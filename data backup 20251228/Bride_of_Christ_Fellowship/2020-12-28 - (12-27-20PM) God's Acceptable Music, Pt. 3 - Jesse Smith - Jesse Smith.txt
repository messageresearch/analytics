us now in jesus christ's name amen praise god let's take our bibles tonight i'd like to look at music again tonight by god's grace i think this is part three and now let's go to ephesians 5 10. we'll start there that's kind of in the scripture i've used i preached on wednesday night i don't know if everybody got to listen to it or not but i'm gonna kind of review a little bit on that and then yesterday i found this little quote book from brother matt lightner i don't remember he made this years ago so i was reading through there this morning and highlighting some good quotes and you know writing some questions i have about you know some quotes and i need to read that so i'll be preaching more out of here lord willing but i forgot all about that and i just found uh yesterday so i thank the lord for that that was a real blessing here so let's go to ephesians 5 10. ephesians 5 10. this is a rather large subject uh this week i've listened to uh when ben narad preached it in the other sanctuary in 2016 i listened to that sermon i think about one and a half times as i was traveling and you know driving and things like that great message but it's such a huge tremendous subject so i'll just i'll go a little bit at a time and i'll be honest like i don't i don't naturally gravitate to this subject it's not like a i wouldn't say it's a easy subject for me to study because i just don't feel i'm very musically inclined uh never really have played any instruments or anything like that so just bear with me i'm trying my best to kind of learn slowly and uh and preach you know what the what i can clearly see i've always preached on the effects of music you know by the holy ghost you know i've always preached on that and how there's liberty in the holy spirit and uh things like that but trying to understand and and teach exactly what we can do you know to guard against rock and roll coming in and things like that that's all new to me so uh as far as you know trying to learn the language of music so uh just have patience with me it's it's more of a new subject it's a it's just a different kind of subject for me so ephesians 5 10. let's read that together just a short scripture let's read that on three one two three proving what is acceptable unto the lord and then remember go down to verse 18 and the bible said be filled with the spirit verse 19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks we looked at that this morning right giving thanks always for all things amen unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ may god add his blessings the ring of his word you may be seated i'm gonna do the very best i can as i said uh by god's grace you know let's do a little practice here let's do try the hdmi on this one because remember we had trouble last week when brother cam was here brother bank said he checked the cords and he said they were working so let's give that a shot and see if that'll work it'll be a hdmi cord i forgot to do it between services so just bear with me here let's try those uh so okay great all right well that hdmi is working so i don't know why we're having trouble with uh last week but anyways let's get started here now i want to give a few quick updates did you see uh there was two big announcements this week from the vatican never anybody see that i was thankful for joseph branham because he actually posted them on his email i saw him and i forgot about him and then i always get the voice of god emails right so i got joseph's email and uh he had he had him in there and i was like oh thank the lord i forgot all about it so i appreciate our brother you know we just we have differences but that was really helpful so let's read let's read that so they have two they put out two declarations this week just really really something oh is that is that okay is that mine okay so the first declaration which this one was extremely sad they said it's okay to get the vaccine uh even though it has i don't know how to say it here vaccines have uh i'm not sure how to say it with the children there but anyways there's a lot of things in vaccines we we don't want in our bodies that come from the abortion industry i guess that's maybe the best way i can say it and who is aware of that because she worked in the medical field and would saw the ingredients in vaccines and it's really sad it come a lot of their ingredients come from the abortion industry so a lot of catholics were up in arms about the covid vaccine right well the vatican put out a declaration this week saying they are allowed to have it because there's no other options now i think that is just downright sad and hypocritical but uh let me see if i can pull up the just the the beginning of the the article real quick so that everybody can see that here's the one we'll get to i like to keep uh yeah i don't know if i'm going to read that but the vatican says use a covered vaccines made from abortion industry is ethical and that's sad church and that's so sad they're so against those things supposedly against those things but then they'll let those things come into their bodies so just something to watch i mean look at i mean every now and then like we right we see their true colors right we see their true signs we saw it earlier this year remember oh we saw a few months ago when the pope come out and said homosexuality's okay he said they're all part of god's family they're all part of our family so see every now and then you know behind this pompous religious thing every now and then we see their true colors and this is one more example of that where they would compromise on such a clear black and white thing this is totally wrong right but they say there's no other options so it's okay it's not okay so i just thought i'd share that with you just to kind of keep you posted on that one and here's the other one this one was more in the economic realm um so here's the article from brother joseph uh but then here's the article big business gets its wings as leaders from major u.s companies partner with pope francis i'm not going to read the whole article but many uh big business companies met with the pope this week i think it was this week no i'm sorry it was a couple weeks ago december 8th i'm sorry it was december 8th so it was more than a couple weeks ago and he met with them just trying to encourage them uh you know to help i just helped the economy let's just i'll read that first part the pope means business uh capitalism met with catholicism on tuesday as some of the world's biggest business leaders announced a new partnership with pope francis the alliance known as the council for inclusive capitalism with the vatican aims create a more inclusive fair and sustainable economic landscape by taking pledges toward sustainable development goals focused on areas such as climate action peace and justice quality education and gender equality so you see they're partners partnering with companies and remember the bible said the antichrist is going to bring prosperity he said daniel said he's going to increase the the crafts and make crafts to prosper and remember he's going to have this message brother brown called him the superman right he got that from clarence larkin satan's superman he's going to promise peace and safety and prosperity so it's just interesting that he's meeting with these uh these companies i think their value is over 10 trillion so the value of these companies was 10 trillion dollars um so just it's a sign right that we can see how the pope is going to be involved in world finances right and that's what we're told in the book of daniel by god's grace so i just thought i'd share those with you there um kind of give you an update i i like to do that so everybody can kind of uh stay up to date on what's going on uh you know you hear many times but church we're living in the days of the bible times praise god bible prophecies being fulfilled before our eyes both out in the world as the tares are maturing but as the bride is maturing as well amen i'm glad to be a a wheat seed maturing praise god hallelujah and i want to lay before the presence of the son and i'm going to bring forth uh the right fruit i want to i want to i want to manifest a true wheat nature by god's grace amen now as we look at this music here again these are the same four references i read on wednesday i'm going to look at this one towards the end of the message here because i'm going to play some examples of brother rams music here or just some songs on the tapes but this is a tremendous message i text brother brother ben on christmas on my brother this was an absolute masterpiece of the holy ghost i'm still it's four years later i'm still i'm still feasting on that message it was such a great message um and then the seven part series this is uh this is more like a biblical approach to music and then this one this one really shows it actually gives a lot of samples of worldly music so i said on wednesday i said if you struggle with worldly music i wouldn't recommend listening to all that one because he does play like longer samples just to show the difference between worldly music and godly music right but there's a lot of great information on that one too and then sister rebecca wrote an article in 1992 i've read through a lot of it not all of it but i've read through i think eight chapters i think it's nine or ten chapters so i'm almost done reading through that one so by god's grace those are the references i'm going to use and i always want to give references because i know people criticize you if you don't and i i don't want to take any credit for anything because i'm just i'm just getting it from other places you know so let me just review real quick here uh we looked at our first two parts god created music the book of zephaniah said god sings over his people so god sings angels sing right job tells us that and then jesus said jesus quoted the psalms and then jesus sang hymns right after the lord's supper uh the passover meal right before the night of his crew or arrest now lucifer was created with a music ministry the bible said he had pipes which are tambourines in the translation so he'll always make worship music that's a little worldly right it's so close to the real to try to deceive the very elect right but the elect cannot be deceived we know there's nothing wrong with a tambourine right i really appreciate a good tambourine player so lydia acacia some of you can yeah sister who somebody some of you that can keep a beat i admire that because i cannot i tried it for a number of years in the church i just couldn't get it i don't i guess i probably should have practiced more but uh you know so so satan is very aware of the right pleasing kind of music to god uh and of course he'll always have his like death metal bands right he always have his rap music out there but he's always also going to be trying to do inside the christian realm to try to get something so close but then to inject something into it a little sensual and so that's what you know we'll be looking at hopefully the next few services uh is that sensual aspect and you'll hear it many times you'll hear it uh musicians they'll make their voice sensual right uh you can tell they're not really singing to jesus they're singing more to be popular but there's so many areas music has so many different elements that satan's only got to change one of them just one of them if he can just make one of them like the rhythm if he just overpowers on the rhythm or if he just overpowers with too much noise right or if he just overpowers on the percussion or if he just overpowers on uh the sensual voice and so we always need god's help uh to give us a good balance and i think we got it by god's grace i love brother amen and i really appreciate your ministry better it's a tremendous blessing uh and so um this is where satan is gonna try to do with with us now with the world he's always gonna have his worldly music right but he's going to try to get us to do a little bit of worldliness we got to be careful now the the thing of it the the danger i see around the message is so many people just do slow slow music there's no joy in it after a while right that's what i see i don't know i don't know if our saints and friends have seen that or not but when i sometimes visit churches they're just there's no every song is so slow that people are sleeping during the song service or there's no joy but on wednesday night i read through all the scriptures where it says sing a new song and they all say sing with joy so where's the joy you know so what i think is satan's trying to keep with many message churches he's trying to keep him so far away from maybe any upbeat or any uplifting type of music that he gets them so dead that there's no joy in it anymore now don't get me wrong there's also a very quiet worship song that it can just bring just as much joy right just as much thankfulness but the thing is uh we got to be careful with that we don't want to get too close we don't want to get close at all to rock and roll but we don't want to go so far away from from any joy in the song or any upbeat part of it where uh there's no joy there's no rejoicing right because the bible plainly says rejoice with your songs so we went over that on wednesdays they went through like probably 11 verses just about new songs and having joy and praising god with loud voices and praising god with uplifted voices amen and loud the bible said loudly on the symbols loudly with the stringed instruments the bible tells us to sing joyfully praise god and so that's where we got it we gotta have and i believe we're in the middle of the road um and if i thought different we'd straighten it out you know brother eamon and i would sit down and he'd teach me some things about music because i don't know much about music but but the point i'm trying to make is that we we have to be careful now remember this too by god's grace brother braham saw the preview of the bride remember the the church that got off was dancing to rock and roll right and so we know that's that's what satan's going to use against the church in the u.s but it's probably worldwide by now right you know what i mean like all the churches are trying to impersonate uh the american church that's in the rock and roll so we know specifically we've got to be very cautious against rock and roll right and we'll get to that a little bit how there's certain instruments rock and rollers use and there's certain rhythms and certain beats they use and we just gotta avoid that and if we if we avoid that and we sing godly songs with the right lyrics and joy in our hearts and uh and uplifting songs that have godly lyrics that we know it's the freedom of a christian to enjoy those songs praise god amen so we got to be very careful because satan's he's a master at deception right he's a master at it and we've got to be very careful so that's what the holy spirit gives us discernment to know praise god now we looked at also that choosing to sing god's music music helps us walk in the spear that was what we just looked at earlier right by our text so we've got to choose to sing god's music and i like this from our hearts i believe the bible said make a melody in your heart to the lord and so like a lot of like the famous uh christian singers you can tell some of them are always singing for the lord like you can kind of hear their voices where they're singing just to be heard they're not really singing as a worship and that's why i love coming to church because i know i'm going to hear a song that worships god from the heart to god praise god but we've all seen you know famous musicians or we've all heard them when you can tell they're not really singing to god they're singing to make themselves famous and it's not truly worship and a lot of times i can a lot of times i can tell after the song is done like if they'll just smile and accept everybody's clapping you know what i mean like if you're singing for jesus you should be praising you know you should be praising jesus or humble right but some of these people sit there and clap and say oh thank you i mean come on that's the that's not singing in your heart to the lord that's singing to impress the people especially you see that on the live recordings when they sing live and everybody just clap and thank you yes thank you and throw the roses at me thank you and to me that's not to me that's not singing to christ because remember like brother i said with the preacher you want to come up humbly so you can leave happy right but he said many people come up uh proudly and then they leave sad right so we want to come up humbly and i'll say like this we want to go down humbly too okay so there's uh that scripture about singing your heart to the lord and now the bible says we need to identify the sounds and make ours easy to be understood praise god and so that's that's our desire too is our songs should always be easily understood to be christian songs praise god hallelujah now next um now we saw this on wednesday new songs can be loud or they can be quiet uh they can be songs of repentance right like dave that great example of creating me a clean heart oh god you know renew a steadfast spirit within me all right there's songs that are god i'm sorry forgive me jesus but then there's songs that you your sins washed away and you're happy now you're you're you're full of joy i'm forgiven i'm under the blood of the lamb of god amen so see there's there's there's times and seasons for all the all the kind different different songs right but the bible did say the new songs should be sung worldwide the bible said let all the world sing new songs unto the lord and i ended with this i ended part two on wednesday with this singing is contacting your heavenly home because brother graham said your body contacts your earthly home but then he said faith contacts god so when we start singing uh we're actually trying to contact our heavenly home right we're reaching out to god uh and so that that's important to remember a song is a trying to contact heaven lord i need your power lord i want to worship you and because remember he inhabits the praises so we don't always feel it maybe when we start but the goal is to contact him so that he's we feel his presence in our worship praise god because he inhabits the praises of his people amen hallelujah so that's the goal singing is to contact the spiritual world which in our case is the holy spirit now the world uses to contact the demonic spirit world right but we're using our spirits and songs to contact heaven amen so see worship is an invitation so i'm just trying to find in my mind like what is singing it's an invitation for god's anointing or the world they do satan's anointing because the bible tells us neither give place to the devil in ephesians uh 4 27. all right so now i narrowed this down i don't know if you saw or i mentioned it wednesday but i just narrowed this down we have three important duties and there could be more uh but i'm just trying to teach this or like i said this is a subject that's more challenging for me i don't easily grasp music concepts but we have the duties to introduce new songs and we have the duty to create the right atmosphere when we sing right we got to sing from our heart it's got to be worship it's got to be about lifting up jesus praise god and we and brother braham says you and i are supposed to create that atmosphere praise god right just like we saw with prayer you've got we not we have to create the atmosphere of thanksgiving praise god amen we have to create the atmosphere of peace in our own lives right that's what keeps our hearts and minds is the peace of god that we create through prayer the same thing's true with music we have to create an atmosphere here praise god amen hallelujah it is through singing the right way right it's singing with joy it's singing with worship it's singing with praise to god it's our duty brother brother man says don't sit there like a wall flower on the wall he says when you come to church he said become a part of it he said get right into it amen he said become a part of the service amen have you take your part take your position amen amen so we've got to do that we've got to create the right atmosphere and for me that means to me that means clapping singing smiling and standing up praising the lord shouting you know what i got to feel it and so i got to enter in and i gotta get my mind on the things of god i gotta feel it praise god and then thirdly uh this is this is what's gonna take the the longest for me to study out so just be patient with me i have to prove what's acceptable to god with rhythms this is totally new to me lyrics that to me that's easy that's the easy part right we can all look at lyrics and say okay that's scriptural that's not scriptural volume and that's a little bit uh i mean there's there's room there to take it loud too because i've been in some real loud services that have been real people got healed and you know saved and all kinds of great things and then instruments that's another one too where some you just got to use wisdom uh and you you prove it's acceptable in all these areas by identifying the meanings of the sounds so that's what the bible says remember every sound has a meaning okay and so let me just share of just a few things just from my heart here okay rhythm we're going to we're going to show you some um let you listen to that one song i was there when the spirit came we'll listen to that a little bit that one has a more fast beat rhythm and brother graham calls it a spiritual lift okay now there's some things with rhythm i'm not sure about like uh like clapping off beat okay uh but we've been to services where they've clapped off beat and i kind of like it you know i i think that's that's kind of that feels makes me happy makes me want to worship but rock and roll is known for playing like guitar beats and drum beats off-beat and there's some connection to that with voodoo so from what i understand now there's some offbeats that are okay and there's some offbeats that are not okay that's what i understand right now so i'm i'm not ready to preach all that and give you examples right now but that's where i want to go i want to go to that so you can actually hear some off beats that are right that are okay and then some beats that are not okay all right now the same thing is true with lyrics now some people say oh the lyrics if they don't mention the name of jesus or or god or lord then you can't sing them well that might be but there's also a song like you ever heard that song you raised me up by sayla you raised me up so i can stand on my i mean i've heard that's we sang that in in lima when i was going to live when brother brooks is my pastor and the song never says god one time in it so see some people make these strict rigid rules right like oh don't say the name of god so you can't sing it well i i think if our hearts are pure and we know who wrote it and if we can we can find some uh some connection to scripture in the lyrics that's okay now for me if i don't hear the name of jesus i like to insert the name of jesus like that king of my heart song he's saying did you notice how i'm inserting the name i just like to hear the name of jesus praise god i think it's a fine song it's very scriptural uh you can find all those scriptures about christ we run to christ he's our high tower you know we sh we hide under the shadow of his wings like that's that's plain scripture but to me i like to hear the name of jesus uh so many times i'll add the name of jesus i'll just insert it in there if i don't hear it enough so just so you know and that's that's my preference right but i believe you can sing that song and you without adding that and you can still worship the lord with that song i believe that but for me i like to if i can i like to add the name of jesus in there now volume like i said there's times for quiet songs and people are like brother i remember when you do prayer lines he'd say just play something soft right but because the people are repenting right they're trying to ask the holy spirit help me to remember if i've sinned against you and right but then there's times i'll listen tonight brother brown he would clap along and he would sing and meeting in the air and all these fast songs he'd like there's a time to clap he brother man tells them to stomp their feet there's a time to stop there there's a time for slow and there's a time for fast songs okay so it's all about really finding the leadership of the holy spirit for that particular time praise god but like i said i've been in services where it's been like at brother cams that's that's what i'm really talking about where we'll they would have loud music and we would just be you know we're everybody worshiping and yet people are getting healed and saved you know so those are good examples sometimes it's quiet sometimes it's loud but the thing with the world is as you know i at rock concerts now i don't think i've ever really been to one i've only been to christian rock concerts and that's before i was in the message but yes they did crank up the volume too high and there's one thing about when it gets too loud then you lose your thinking and you just your bot your your sensual uh your sensual is your body's just taken over by the music and you you lose your train of thought like when we were there we were like head banging anyone ever heard a third day they're like a a christian rock group okay so before i came in the message i went to a third day concert and we just had bang the whole two hours forgive me you know uh i'm not proud of that but i'm just saying that's all i knew at least i was in a bar right there was only one time i was in a line you know even even as a sinner i was in a line one time to go into a bar and i got halfway up the line and i had to leave and i never he went into a bar that's how much god was like i believe he was watching over my life and all my friends are like in college all my friends are like where'd you go jesse what are you i'm like i just couldn't go into the bar that was even before i was a christian so i thank the lord for protecting me that far but uh so if it's too loud you can lose control but also i've been in loud services where people have danced in the spirit and that's good that's great that could be a good thing uh so again it's it's it's about finding uh what god is doing and then instruments now we'll get to this one i have an article at the end uh rock and roll's main instruments are electric guitar bass guitar and drums those are the three main instruments but yeah i know churches you know that use some of those and they can be used okay as long as they're used in the right way right um and there's a lot of clear examples you know uh when you listen to music so again it takes a lot of wisdom right it takes a lot of uh discernment by the holy spirit right to identify the different meanings of sounds okay so let's go through this a little bit here i want to read just a couple more so you can see how music helped out brother branham and uh and then i want to play that song so you can hear it so singing this contacting god and receiving his strength uh the and this is like the power of music is this one of my favorite quotes of all time with brother branham sometimes i get kind of feeling tired and wore out and nerves on the edge we talked about anxious right don't be anxious i'll just jump in my car take out hold to the steering wheel can you see brother i'm doing this going down the road singing i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them or something just gripping the wheel and singing and stomping my foot and shouting i'm one of them i'm one of them he says well after a while i get tired and i return back home and start something else he said but when we get worshipping god in that new kingdom there will never be a tired moment so he so he felt like he was in a rut right he's tired he's worn out he's anxious so he'd get in the car and start singing god singing to god and loudly getting his foot going and he said oh i can go home and start something new so see sometimes he hadn't even had to leave the home to get refreshed you know i imagine because all the people sitting outside wanting to be prayed for probably you know just you know people would sleep on his porch people would sleep in the yard and uh but i just want you to see this like see and it was okay it's okay church to get our bodies involved in the worship praise god like he realized that music when you play it it does something to your body and you want to join in you know now the evil of it is when satan uses certain kind of a notes with electric guitar and bass guitar right who use certain kind of notes to take that go too far right and they actually have proof brother ben brought out some quotes i don't know if you listened that lately but brother brother brandon brought out some quotes from the scientific world where they can prove it certain types of music on electric guitar get your hormones flowing for like uh immorality the same uh the same type of hormones for immorality i guess i just say like that sexual morality let me just say like that okay so there are certain notes they can play with the electric guitar and bass guitar that release those hormones right they they can prove that and that's like that voodoo that's the same type of voodoo beats and rhythms right uh but there must be a way to do it where brotherhood says you can stomp your feet and clap and and shout and praise the lord where it's okay and it doesn't activate those hormones but it makes your body want to move and join in with the worship praise god so that's one of my favorites there i like that when you get tired so see sometimes when you're tired your mind is tired and this is what brother ben brought out too he said your brain has two parts one the thinking part and then uh the other part uh just like the praise the relaxing part he said that when you when you sing it your body is your mind is supposed to stop thinking and calculating and just to relax and that's what he was i don't know if you remember that but he was saying that's why god gave us music so we'd stop uh try for a little bit trying to figure things out and worry and and get outside of that part of our brain and get into the happy side amen and so part of that is getting your body into it right letting the the music you know just uh take care take control your body and worshiping and praising god uh stomping your feet clapping and shouting and praising the lord and rejoicing in god's spirit amen so he says of course he said uh he said we are so happy so he's basically talking about the millennium there the new kingdom there'll never be a tired moment uh he says we are so happy praise god so i hope that's a help to you here's and this is what it reminded me of uh we you know we're familiar with this how the bible says when the evil spirit was upon saul david took a harp play with his hands so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed him okay so see how brother brown is discouraged he's tired he's anxious but once he gets his body and his mind into it and he shout once he gets his voice into it he breaks out of it so you see that's why we entering into worship is so important right entering into god's spirit see we're reaching out to god god i need you god change my thinking help me not to be so discouraged let me take take all my stress god bring your peace and god brings his peace here's another good one you'll like uh and look at this one today's been a terrible day for me anybody said that this week oh it's been a terrible day man brother man's at the pulpit church and he said today's been terrible and so many calls and so forth and the phones are ringing everywhere and as i walked in here brother mercer said i can tell you're nervous and i said who wouldn't it be you see our moms and dads if they're getting pulled on all day see how you can be a little nervous but now i'm quiet just the singing and relaxing i just love that i feel if we could just say amen and go home it would pay every one of us to have been here in this wonderful atmosphere so constant ringing right like with our phones constant buzzing and notifications it can be it can feel like a terrible day but just get in the right atmosphere of worship and your day can change because it's the atmosphere if we're nervous if we're stressed out the atmosphere can help us relax and forget about our terrible day see how this is just like the bible right it's just like david playing for saul terrible oh it's awful day oh but now i feel much better because i'm in the atmosphere of the holy spirit praise god well i'll tell you you're certainly blessed with some real singing he said i like good singing i just love real good singing i've always said when i get to heaven i want to get where they're singing and listen i can never get my fill of singing i love that one you know singing gives courage so see that's why it's reaching out for spiritual power singing is reach is invitation i need spiritual power you know that don't you soldiers you're going to battle you know what they do they they play the music and sing and things to give them courage and when you're going on to battle we sing and it gives us courage to go on hallelujah anybody uh ever been encouraged by a song maybe it came at a certain time when you needed a song about that i told the testimony on wednesday i don't know if you heard someone tell tonight i was at the woman's uh i was at the sisters meeting up in new york and they were doing song specials and a sister came up and she started playing some sweet notes before she sang and she said i wrote this song when i was going through the trial of my life um and in the situation this sister was being abused by her husband now she was since divorced um she was being abused by her husband and uh and everybody she started playing singing it was one of the most beautiful songs you'd want to hear and every eye i was crying everybody was crying in the whole in the whole service um but it was such a it was such an example of it was such a song of hope like it was just so showing how god never left her and she was never alone and god was able to bring her out and give her hope and protect her and save her basically and uh it just gave her a lot of courage and she said she got this song going through that storm right and so many times church will get a song uh in the midst of a storm praise god and god will send a right song at the right time when you need it praise god amen so see singing will give you courage then you look at the person well my if that if that person could get victory uh i can get victory too that gives me courage to keep going on because a song that god placed in their hearts amen he said jim i want to be sure get that for me so he's requesting a tape of the song put it on that for me special so my children want to hear that when i kind of get down a little low i hear that it makes me feel good to hear good singing and billy i go to the office down there and he has constantly got them tapes of singing going on all the time and i think it kind of helps him too praise god how many know singing helps you praise god no doubt it helped billy praise god he said now you know he said there's something about a song that's got power in it we all know that we're aware of that that looks at the army when they sing the songs and play the music do you know the approach to war and the army of god is first by music the singers went before the ark rejoicing and singing then come the ark and then the battle that's right so that's the right approach he said that we come at service at night what do we do we sing the hymns of the lord then the ark the word read the word and then the battle now here's the battle church we're trying to save souls we're trying to heal the sick right we're trying to get the we to be encouraged praise god that's the battle right so we do the singing then the word and then at the end trying to get victory see victory in people's lives amen he said so the great banners are flying tonight the name of jesus christ the lord god may be exalted the enemy be put to flight praise god and god he said god win the victory tonight save souls heal the sick and afflicted cause those that are weary and stooped low to raise their heads and rejoice get glory unto thyself for we ask this in the name of the lord jesus amen oh wouldn't that be such a victory tonight if someone that's so discouraged instead of being discouraged they could they might have walked in here with the head hung low but they'll walk out with their head up look into heaven with affection set on things above that'd be a great victory church praise god that's the battle that's the battle to uh raise up their heads to get them to rejoice to get them to see how close god is to them to know that they're not alone that god is with them hallelujah amen thank the lord hallelujah now let's play this here says uh this is probably uh this is probably the fastest song i've ever heard on brother branham's tapes so let me play this uh i was there when the spirit came how many ever heard that before anyone ever heard that it's a beautiful song it's from 1962 the end sign now i want you to notice though there's a man on here he kind of loses control and i want you to listen as brother brown comes up afterwards brother branham says what a spiritual lift but then he starts getting really serious because it's a healing service okay so i just want you to see brother brother brown makes a transition it's a rejoicing song the guy's he's literally screaming so some of you might be shocked to hear this if you've never heard it before this guy is ah and brother brahm comes up and says what a spiritual lift but then he goes right to prayer because he's going right to the battle because the battle is they're sick in the building and they need to be healed praise god screaming brother man says screaming shouting that's good that's victory but he has to transition from a victory song he said that's victory for that brother right that's victory for him but now there's many sick and afflicted here and we've got to win the battle for them praise god so it's just interesting it's interesting brother brahm doesn't enter in into the rejoicing he he realizes i've got to get the word for a healing service all right so listen to this here i think it'll be a help to you by god's grace all right so here let me uh do the history search real quick thank you for your patience here okay here it is let's see if this is the beginning of it there's two songs this and this is in uh arizona i believe so the first song i'm gonna skip this oh you might as well listen a little bit they have some beautiful singing here [Music] i know jesus will see me through all right [Music] now they have they have parts they have male parts and female parts here's the one now get ready for this guy to scream a little bit here okay i was there when the spirit came [Music] as loud as i can go [Music] you hear that you hear the stomping hear that you [Music] stomping glory [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] can you look up these lyrics real quick and put them up here i was there when the spirit came i know we got the song [Music] is [Music] once again [Music] all right here's brother [Music] praise the lord for that how thankful we are for a nice spiritual lift like that but there when the spirit came now we are grateful for these services again i say and we're praying now that god will heal the sick heal all right thank you everybody like that one by god's grace that's always been uh a great song i enjoy hearing it instantly makes me happy instantly makes me joyful to hear somebody sing like that because you don't hear that very often especially around the message ranks right so you can switch back over here let me put up the exact quote but abraham says praise the lord for thank the lord for that he says we're thankful for a nice spiritual lift like that so anyone that would say oh it's you know we shouldn't shout or we shouldn't clap or shouldn't stomp well brother bram never reboot we rebuke this guy right and he even called it we're thankful for a nice spiritual lift like that but as i said he had to make the transition now he's going from songs at the beginning now he's got to bring the word right and then now then he has a battle at the end to do discernments and get people to accept their healing so brother man doesn't really join in we'd say with uh that but i want to notice the scripture too this brother must have been really on fire and the bible says is any merry let him sing songs this all this guy is doing is obeying the word praise god the word says if you're happy sing a song praise god and surely this guy was he was mary the bible said let him sing psalms praise god so i don't know if i've ever played that before but amen have you ever heard that here okay so that was uh from ensign phoenix arizona 1962. so whenever people uh whenever people try to limit what god can do in songs i always bring out this it's loud it's got shouting stomping clapping it's got piano where they're what is it called improvisation improvisation now like i say you can hear like they add little extra beats and brother bam calls it a spiritual lift so i always use this this is kind of like my judgment here for this isn't rock and roll according to brother branham it's upbeat it's loud it's clapping so in my mind without without knowing much about music this has been my example of this is real freedom right here this is loud and it's joyful it's not rock and roll right uh but it's a joyful song unto the lord so i guess as i learn more about it then i'll be able to kind of understand what was in this song that was good yet it's not rock and roll all right so that's just me growing as an individual to try to understand it now i want to play another one too this is uh this is from thirst 1965 a beautiful message here and let me read this first i think i read this when i preached part one but we didn't listen to it so i would like to listen to it just to hear how brother adam says it they're singing a song i don't remember which song it is but we'll listen to in a moment he said do you love that no wonder he said now i wonder if you've got your feet converted you don't dance anymore out there for the world see let's pat our feet to the lord so he says well you don't dance anymore but can you still pat your feet to god right he said let's pat our feet is your hands converted you don't steal anymore is your lips converted you don't lie anymore just don't get religion in your head get it all over you so brother is encouraging worship god with your whole being right with your feet your hands your ten-stringed instruments right your voice worship god with everything you got praise god he said that's right now let's pat our feet okay so again i gotta go off here sorry let me pull that up here and we can listen to it might be onward christian soldiers i can't remember here do you love that oh it's when the saints go marching in okay yeah okay here we go it's a little bit faster right [Music] is [Music] here's the quote that's right [Laughter] i have all right i'll stop right there praise god all right can you switch back over here i want to put the rest of them almost done here by god's grace i hope that's a help to your church to see how some songs are fast you know uh and some are slower oh yeah and right after this he goes into we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light so he goes from a fast one down to a slow one and that's what we'll do that too right all churches will do that sometimes they'll go well not all churches but many churches will do that they go from a fast down to a slow and maybe then pick it back up again uh just as you let the lord but i love that how brother brown says let's pat our feet let's clap let's sing let's do a fast song right get your body moving get your whole body into the worship praise god all right now so uh let's take a few minutes on this i'm not going to be much longer just got a couple more slides here i want to show because i got more i got to do a lot more studying on this here to kind of define some of these things uh so let's look here um so in other words acceptable worship it can be loud or soft um and that could even be loud with stomping right it can stomp loud clapping repentant or joyful fast or slow and it can even have if expressed correctly it can have drums electric and bass guitars but they got to have control praise god they got to have control and not be used in a way that makes it too sensual right and so i'll try to get some examples of that in the future lord willing where you can tell where it becomes a rock and roll drum beat right or becomes a rock and roll electric guitar that's pretty easy to spot or rock and roll bass guitar i don't know about that myself i'm not really familiar with bass guitars but uh with some of these we can clearly be able to discern if it's the right beat or not okay now here i want to just close i think i'll just close with this this thought from rebecca branham so this here's a few lessons now from her chapter seven she identifies rock and roll's four attributes so these are the four i kind of mentioned earlier but i'll just read a little bit about what she was writing so she says here's the four attributes of rock and roll rhythm so that has a certain ungodly rhythm it has a lot of repetition uh the volume and then variety so i'm just taking this straight from her book or her article so she says uh rhythm rock and roll is usually four four time but not always okay so some there are some people that say you can't do a 4-4 song and there's that's that group that came down from canada and came to our church and other churches and they were saying you can't do 4-4 time because of this article but we looked it up we did that at home we looked up some of the songs and a lot of hymns are four four time like one of them is onward christian soldiers onward christian soldiers marching as two i might be going a little faster now anyways it's four times at least what we saw on the internet or we saw it in the book yeah we saw it in the hymnal book so see people will take this article from sister rebecca and uh and she didn't say uh it has to be a 4-4 but she said many times they use a 4-4 rock and roll were used for for and these people just misunderstood even her article um but she says you always got to watch out for the sensual back beats which is also called syncopate syncopation and then the certain articles that will produce sensuality we talked i just mentioned that earlier okay now here's a little evernote article i found about electric guitar i was with my children at the library um it was four years ago and we were just looking at books you know and the holy spirit brought this back to my memory just this morning i i say this article four years ago i totally forgot about it and the holy spirit brought it back to my remembrance this morning so it's just interesting um and jesus promised his spirit would bring all things to our remembrance so let me go forward a little bit here so here's what the article says about electric guitar now it's really hard to read so i don't expect you to read that but i'll read it the electric guitar revolutionized 20th century popular music like its acoustic cousin it has six strings which run down a long neck over metal strips called frets but rather than having a hollow body to make the sound louder most electric guitars are solid electromagnets change the strings vibrations into electrical currents which are then amplified made louder electronically rickenbacker electro instruments produced the first electric guitars in 1931 but electric guitar playing really caught on in 1949 with the simple rich sounding fender telecaster musicians started using this to play a new type of music called rock and roll okay now i didn't have this but uh oh yeah over there in the corner it says this it says uh the tone knob changes the strength of the overtones sounds that are higher than the main note so let your guitar is able to go to other notes right which and stronger so that means that a stronger effect on the human body and mind right uh and then they use these stronger notes and the stronger volumes in rock and roll right they didn't they weren't used right away but it was i guess a creation or a perversion perversion of the devil right and that's how they would use electric guitars the wrong way and this was from the book ideas that changed the world so i just found that at the library a few years ago okay so i don't understand it all yet but i'm just saying electric guitar has electric means to impact the body and the mind in ways it shouldn't be affected okay so we got to be very careful with electric guitar now i just brought this quote out so you can see how brother ram didn't uh he wasn't against drums right he was just against rock and roll drumming okay because he's talking about he's talking about elisha when elisha said bring me a menstrual remember second kings chapter three i read it on wednesday night jehoshaphat said can you prophesy should we go up and he said i'll do it for your sake jehoshaphat he said bring me a minstrel bring me this how brother says it he said they got to play in the music now listen you can't be the prophet you can be one of the instruments you know that plays the music to bring the spirit down on the prophet praise god you know what i mean they begin to play they beat the drums play the instruments oh they begin to beat and play there will be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by and by so my brand said they got to sing a song that will bring the spirit down praise god and drums and beats and singing all involved the prophet began to get in the spirit he says and the first thing you know when he got in the spirit things began to happen that's what the matter we can't get anywhere today we don't get in the spirit of it that's right yes you got to get in the spirit of it they begin to go to clap in their hands and really having a good time and the spirit of god begins to fall in the prophet his spirit got on the prophet then they begin to see things you'll go to seeing things when you get in the sphere praise god hallelujah praise god amen so see uh we can't say all drums are bad we can't say uh can't say all loud songs are bad can't say uh all guitars are bad remember satan's gonna make it so close so close right but then he'll try to pervert one thing it'll pervert the vocals or the rhythm or one of those elements that uh we we read earlier okay so i think this one might be my last slide actually yeah this one's my last slime and so here's her uh last thoughts on on this okay so there's four rhythm now with repetition now here's one idea about repetition if you listen to the end of perfect faith um brother branham i'm not gonna play it tonight but brother graham uh is doing a prayer line and they're just doing a prayer line and just letting people pass through he's not even praying he just said receive your healing receive your healing and it goes on for 15 20 maybe 30 minutes and they just sing the great physician the whole time well if if you say it's wrong to repeat songs well then he was wrong just singing the great physician the whole 20 or minute long prayer line right so we got to be careful uh you know with some of these attributes of rock and roll right that people that people say they're they're attributes of rock and roll but yet sometimes we're led of god just to sing the same song again right just keep singing that song and so sometimes we'll see repetition in songs that's not always bad right it's not always bad so that that that's a real that's a kind of a question mark area for me i don't understand like what do you mean rock and roll repetition so i'm just saying i maybe don't understand that but i know it's not always bad to do repetition because of that prayer line in perfect faith 1963. now the volume i mentioned this earlier extreme loud music void your thinking and it's and it easily it helps you easily lose control you see that at rock concerts of course and that kind of those type of atmospheres now here's this is really interesting and this is what she ends this section with how to identify rock and roll she said rock and roll is constantly changing like recently you've seen rock and roll and rap mix right uh well like on that video series they used eminem who's a rapper uh he started getting popular right when i was leaving the world and becoming a christian right around 1999. so i listened to a few of his songs at the beginning before they were really really awful i mean they were awful then but they're really really awful now anyways they started doing crossovers between rock and rap and then rap and hip hop or whatever or country and rap and rock so they start doing crossovers and so that's the point she's making rock and roll is constantly changing to attract more people so it's so it always won't have the same rhythms it always won't have the same volume or it'll always be changing uh to keep it fresh for them for the devil worshipers right fresh for them but also attracting a larger audience so she makes the point it won't always be 4-4 time right it will always be electric guitar it won't always be the base like this so we can't we can't just pinpoint it and say it's always going to be this because satan's smarter than that right he's going to try to uh adjust things all right so she says it's always constantly changing mixing evolving to seduce more souls okay we can't say it's always one thing all right so uh in closing here i hope you saw that uh that uh brother branham got spiritual lifts uh from upbeat songs praise god hope you can see that and singing will of course as we know it helps us contact god and it'll drive away like we said anxiety stress right in saul's case a murdering spirit church a murdering spirit music will drive away and cast out a murdering spirit praise god for music amen and we've got to use uh wisdom uh to make sure we're balancing it the right way which i believe we've always done a good job of that and i believe it's only getting better as witnessed by the saints from last weekend so let's stand to our feet by god's grace if you guys can play that song here i am to worship can we play that song here i am to bow down lie to the world yeah did we see that this morning yep oh we didn't see that this morning okay that's fine we could see it again i forgot about that hope that's a good start church you know this is and i gotta tell you i'm just being honest this is not an easy subject for me to study and preach on and it's just hard for me to understand for some reason like there's really there's some subjects i just well i grab ahold of that i think i can it just seems to come to me really easily like with the fivefold ministry and you know the godhead and some of these other doctors i just i eat them all up and it seems like it's easy to study but this one has just been a hard one so i appreciate you bearing with me uh did anybody learn anything tonight or was anything helpful tonight by god's grace okay good good good praise god that makes me happy let's just remember that we always need to have a spirit of rejoicing right if our music gets so cold and stale like brother ben said he said if it gets so cold and still you he he said you'll probably think you walked into a funeral rather than a worship service and then he said you'd be walking around looking for the dead body right we're looking for the that's what he was saying over there that's true you know like in some churches you do that you walk in you think why is everybody so sad the music is there we start with the music right to drive away all that so we can rejoice and receive god's word amen hallelujah and really be thankful for what god has done for us amen remember the bible says we are complete in christ already we already have redemption now praise god he's given unto us every good and spiritual gift you believe that let's say praise the lord ready praise the lord hallelujah let's buy our heads for word of prayer amen [Music] father in heaven we thank you lord god for this time together lord [Music] thank you for your help lord i just want to thank you lord i have i'm not saying i appreciate
