========================================

Grace good to see brother mercy and Claude and Patrick God bless you Brothers good to see you tonight boy you're going to really spoil me coming on Wednesday night brother so thank you for coming it's such a joy to have you Brothers God bless you Hallelujah God is so good I just want to read here uh 1 Corinthians 1 and 1 through three I'm going to try to get through chapter 2 tonight we'll kind of see how the Lord leads by the grace of God first Cor Ians 1 veres 1 through3 yeah I've just been you know as I've looked as we started the series I've just been astounded to see the actual state that the Corinthian Church was in and then to see uh what God did in them and God how God corrected them and then how Paul tried to solidify them or give them a foundation in Christ despite the sin in the church it's amazing grace hallelujah amen and so and then as I said uh uh you know if we look at our church and we don't have those issues then that means we're a pretty clean church by God's grace right a pretty mature Church by the grace of God right nobody's getting drunk at the Lord's table we had communion a few weeks ago nobody got drunk right nobody suing each other right hallelujah we're we're doing good with that Hallelujah no sexual sin nobody's sleeping around everybody's faithful to their vows and faithful if they're single and everything like that by the grace of God that's a pretty much mature church and we're thankful for that that's the mercy of God on our lives hallelujah we're thankful for God's mercy so we're very thankful and good to look at this of course this was a book of Acts church we saw it in Acts chapter 18 how Paul didn't want to stay there but uh Jesus said fear not I've got many people in this city and no man will hurt you what a blessing to know that Christ is with us hallelujah we have nothing to fear because Christ is with us amen so verse one I'll read one uh I'll read one and then we can all read two and three Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and S sanes our brother 1 two three unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctify in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place called upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated you can switch over H I have a few uh slides to show here by God's grace you have to bear with me I got a cold after church on Sunday night I went home I started coughing and sneezing so if you have to forgive me a little uh got a little runny nose and so forth like that but other than that doing good by God's grace hope everybody else is doing everybody else doing good today Hallelujah I guess if you're at church you're doing good Hallelujah so I want to just uh briefly before we get started here look at again CI Scofield's outline of this letter this is of course the first letter and uh tonight we'll just be looking at at the second section the first section is the Believers standing in Grace we're going to start there and then uh we're going into the carnal state of the Corinthians now chapter 2 doesn't really deal with a lot of carnality as you'll see but then in chapter three so chap at the end of chapter one and chapter three and then especially five he deals with a lot of the carnality of course with sexual Morality In chapter 5 and so forth um but good good lessons for us how many you been enjoying the Corinthian Series so far Amen brother William said this to me now I can say it because he's not here he said brother Jesse I've been in the message 40 years he said and the word of God keeps getting deeper all the time I said praise God that's the kind of testimony I want to have that's why I told him I said the word of God is getting deeper all the time more rich and that's what we're going to see the word of God is here to enrich your life Hallelujah and if it's not enriching your life then it's time to have faith in it because the Bible said you got to mix Faith with the word of God hallelujah have faith in God's word how many want Faith tonight in God's word that would be the greatest blessing of your life that you could be enriched by the word of God that you hear tonight and strengthen you for your battles that lay ahead Hallelujah now I want to follow up on the scoffers I don't know uh if you remember I was preaching a little bit on scoffers on Sunday that's because brother brandham preached on scoffers at the beginning of the Rapture sermon 1965 from y Yuma Arizona and uh you know these are just my notes I didn't really have time to kind of like you know look make them look nice I just kind of put them in here but uh the the second example I gave you the first example was one of the Supreme Court Justices who said what is a woman I don't know what a woman is that's complete Insanity to not know what a woman is uh as we saw and then they want the first woman president how can they get a woman president if they don't know what a woman is that doesn't make any sense um but you know here I'm following up you know I I never finished this thought on the astrophysicist who uh of course is an atheist and tries to turn people away uh from from Christianity or any kind of Faith uh and I said you know he was so close on his uh his uh origins of the universe but so far away remember his Origins his Origins uh was that you know they had all these molecules that weren't very weighty light light molecules and then uh it Formed into these stars then when the stars exploded over billions of years all that all that was left over from the explosions cessed or came together and eventually made living organisms that's the biggest bunch of nonsense that's ever been spoken Hallelujah it reminds me of Charles Darwin who said the smaller the organism gets uh the less complex it is and we find out it's EX exactly the opposite the smaller you look I'm sorry the the the deeper you look into the Small Things the more complex they get yeah You' been uh nature been learning about cells yet cells and nucleuses okay you're going to get there huh how many know what do they compare one cell to one cell in your body what do they compare it to a massive City a cell just one cell and the nucleus then is like having its own uh major city like think of all the roads in a city right all the the connections that's what one cell is how many know how many uh cells in your body right now trillions and how many does your body make how many new cells does your body make every day Millions your body's a cell making machine Hallelujah and they just constantly and and then this this smart guy says well somehow all these molecules all came together uh and and then eventually we have living organisms that's a bunch of Tommy rot so he was so far away because he's basically saying stars have the power to write DNA after cesing for billions of years I put LOL on that one that makes me laugh out loud any person that knows I'm going to show you a picture in just a moment I'll just show it to you now this is one cell out of the trillions that are in your body this is one cell inside a cell is a nucleus right inside of the nucleus is chromosomes and if you start unwrapping a chromosome you'll eventually get to the DNA structure and it goes all the way down to a the a single Neo Neo uh Neo I can never say n nucleotide I cannot say it so forgive me I don't teach this this actually isn't my teaching uh subject matter right here this is far far above my pay grade but you break it down to the very building blocks of life right now DNA in other words has this these are all instructions this is you know Caris is going to be so tall Haven's going to have this color hair Victoria's going to have uh this size hands this is all the information this is instructions and it's in every cell but then the proteins and these other molecules come and they read this and then they go build the bones they build the muscles and all these things so God put a book of instructions in every single cell now I heard a good preacher say this uh he said he took a book to these atheists and he said uh what if I could give you any proof about God would you believe it and she'd say yes but it have to be substantial you know how how smart those people are have to be such substantial proof that then I could believe in God and he said okay what are the chances I told you that all these words in here all these letters in here were at one time all this ink was up in the sky somewhere and they randomly fell down and landed in exactly the right location to make this book what are the chances of that and she said oh there's no chance of that and he said what if I told you there's this much information and millions times more in every single cell in your body he said would that be enough proof and they said well no not really but they know it's right think about that in every cell I I've heard this Saints if you could unroll every chromosome if you could unroll it it would go all the way up to the Moon in back so many times there's so much information in just one of these uh cells here and these are chromosomes right and you've got trillions of so cells in your body see so the more com the more deeper you get the smaller you get the more complex it is that's how great our God is amen he hides these things from the wise and prudent and reveals it unto babe such as we learn hallelujah oh my so he's so far away how could Stars uh make DNA and write how could Stars put all that code in there and tell uh this chicken to be this size or or that that elephant to be that size how could Stars put that together randomly it'd be as impossible as this happening randomly there's nothing random to Creation it's all by God's design Hallelujah CU church let me tell you especially you young girls you're fearfully and wonderfully made amen that's what the Bible says and the Bible says my soul knows it right well my soul knows this was designed by a designer Hallelujah this was created by a Creator this wasn't random chance you're not random chance that you're here tonight Hallelujah you came here to hear about Jesus Christ and him crucified Hallelujah and the power of the Cross will change your life if your life hasn't been change it's because you're not drawing on the benefits of the cross of Jesus Christ hallelujah how many know that tonight amen so he's so far away because he's saying stars have power to write DNA but he's so close because we all came from the explosion of let there be light right so he's thinking oh there was an explosion and then all this came together well that's partially right right whatever God spoke on each of the seven or six days that's what happened he spoke it and it's like the word of God exploded and it created God's word is a creative act it's creative power and we all come from the explosion of God's word out of his mouth Hallelujah and then we all and then he also said see we came from Heaven well or the cosmos but we know we came from further than that we came from the mind of God the creator of the cosmos and he said we he said and he said we're literally Stardust well friends we didn't come from the stars but the Bible said will shine like the stars Hallelujah the Bible says anyone who tries to get people to live righteous will shine like the stars in eternity see that's why our young men our young teenagers try to encourage your friends to live a Godly life God will honor you if you honor God hallelujah I'm glad I gave my life to Jesus at 19 I had a lot of scars before that but I'm glad I repented and I'm glad I started preaching at 21 years old amen I would not change a thing hallelujah it's a joy to preach for Jesus Christ it's a joy to serve Jesus Christ to see God come and use you or speak through you or help somebody or answer one of your prayers there could be no greater privilege in life than to have Christ use you for His Glory Hallelujah amen glory to God and then the remember God told Abraham he said your seed will be like the stars of heaven so I do have a connection to the Stars Hallelujah but I did not come from the stars I came from the maker of the Stars Hallelujah so again church God is so great fearfully and wonderfully made hallelujah it's all by Design and that and now just so you know on those videos this had DNA has been enough to convince atheists that they is a God because there's so much order there's there's such a plan here uh there's so it's like code on a computer who's done code on a computer anybody done code on okay Nature has I'll add you a little bit right you write code what does the code do it makes the program do what makes the program yeah you can read it better and it makes the program run right Elijah do you you ever make an app or anything like that okay just did some code I did some code back in high school school too I just typed in a few things and then you click play or whatever and then the like you know the little thing the little computer guys would March and go this way and go that way when you set the code you set directions for what's going to happen and that's what God did God set directions inside of your body so you can be happy with how tall you are now I wish I was a little taller like Elijah M okay but I'm not going to be jealous or you might wish you had that this many this this type of smile or that type of smile or or this type of hair that type of hair but you got to know God had it all pre-planned out hallelujah hallelujah I'll say like this for some of us we just got to do the best we can with what we've been given Hallelujah right one thing for know one thing we know for sure when we get to heaven we'll have a glorified body likened unto his glorious body Hallelujah and then we'll shine with the same light that Christ has Hallelujah in other words we'll have the glory the light of the Holy Spirit now I want to look a little more I was reading this morning as I Was preparing my sermon I was reading through chapter one again just to kind of refresh myself in Chapter 2 and I want to look at verse two unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours now I like this Paul connects the Corinthian Church to every other church so Church even though sometimes we feel all alone we're not all alone we're connected to Elijah's Church in Michigan right we're connected to brother Brooks's church out there brother Jim shakes out there we're connected by the Holy Spirit I mean how many times says uh Brian Hawkins come or Jim Jim shate come last time Jim shate came remember in November he preached on Dancing that's exactly what I was preaching the last time in other words God has given the Bride of Jesus Christ the same thoughts as we're going to see the bride of Christ has the mind of Christ Hallelujah so we're receiving the Same Spirit the same word and it it's something that unites us praise God doesn't divide us it's Satan that wants to divide us it's Jesus trying to unite us hallelujah amen now we of course we have to rebuke sin and everything like that H but but ultimately uh if people are saved we're United by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now uh I highlighted to them because scoffield if you got a scoffield Bible you'll see there's a footnote by them and remember this is the same group that has all the sin problems we noted previously so here's a quick reminder these are all the problems in the church first of all they are divided well uh I'm of Apollos I'm of Peter well I'm better than all of you I'm of Jesus I don't follow any preachers I follow Jesus well Jesus ordained preachers so you can't get away from preachers right right so they're all divided who's the greatest preacher and who baptized me how did I become a Christian which preacher brought brought me into the messeng OR which preacher brought me in into Christianity they're all divided about we're better than that preacher this preacher is better than that preacher that was the first problem then there was sexual immorality right a man sleeping with his stepmom and then there was there was legal issues Saints suing each other and then there was drunkenness at the Lord's table and then uh when they would get drunk they wouldn't let the poor church members eat their food that they would eat outside the church and then they were uh they needed order with spiritual gifts they would just do so many tongues so many interpretations and Paul says two or three at the most Hallelujah that's right let there be an interpreter Let There Be judges to the interpretations and then he said they lack generosity so think about that they had all these gifts but they weren't very giving people my goodness and then also later I read this later I added this uh last week they also allowed false preachers to come in that actually these preachers pitted the church against St Paul who started the church and so that's remember Paul has to go through all of his resume you know here's all the things I've suffered what have they suffered right and of course they had suffered anything because they're false teachers but true men of God go through suffering Hallelujah they get criticized they get uh belittled Now in America there hasn't been much physical uh persecution yet and thank God for that but we don't know when it's going to happen but yeah for sure it's coming Hallelujah but they allowed false preachers to come in and now the false preachers were probably allowing a lot of this stuff right the false preachers probably wanted to be the most popular preacher in the church Hallelujah right they probably allowed sexual morality but now remember recall all the grace Paul extended to this leaven church this was a leaven Church everybody say leav ready this was a leav church this was a church uh that had the sourdough and it was it was uh rising and it should not should not been puffed up but uh sin was taking an impact on the church it wasn't in the right condition it should have been in but look at all the grace Paul gives them you know why because he's going to come bring them a sword not not not soon after this he starts with all this grace and then he's going to bring correction Hallelujah so what does he first call him he said you're Sanctified that means set apart in Christ Jesus you're called to be Saints and then he says Grace and peace unto you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now Paul says I thank God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Christ Jesus now were they a perfect Church no but Paul said thank God you're not out in the world anymore Hallelujah he was still able to thank God even though they got sin problems even though they got anger and pride and sexual immorality uh and they got they got uh discrimination you know the rich against the poor even though they've got got all this going on Paul's starting off with I'm thankful that God has started something in your life church let's be thankful if God has started something in your life praise God Let's do let's do something to try to draw closer to God tonight Hallelujah verse five that in everything you're enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge church if you're paying attention tonight if you're pulling on the word of God you should be enriched spiritually when you walk out of this place Hallelujah just one word of somebody says well I want to hear from God well I just read you what God Said So that you just heard from God that should help you out Hallelujah that should help you out it's thus sayith the word of God hallelujah it has to help you if you have a Hungry Heart to know God hallelujah even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so Paul says you've got Grace I'm thankful for you you're enriched by everything and God has confirmed a testimony in your life life you have some type of testimony now did they have a little church did they have a few blemishes on their testimony lately yes but did Paul did Paul just dechristianize them no Paul was gracious to them so see church this is kind of what we looked at last Wednesday night with brother random he was very gracious with the Pentecostals remember uh with his Full Gospel businessmen he called them fine Brethren remember that and he just slowly he just kind of on the side tried to introduce the message to them and talked about Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4:5 and6 and uh Luke 17:30 all these verses God had brother random fulfill he just tried to put it out there he knew if the people really wanted truth they get it Hallelujah church we know we know all God's elect will come to God hallelujah all that the father has given me will come to me Hallelujah that's right church now and look in all this he says you come behind and no gift they didn't lack any gifts sometimes we look around here and maybe other churches and we we feel like well we don't have many gifts but remember when people say that they're mostly talking about tongues right that's what most people want just tongues all the time because that's what Pentecost has that's what brother Ram had to come out of right but these Corinthians had uh no lack of gifts but they had all this sin in there and so remember brother R told us he said if you gave me the choice of the nine gifts with sin but the choice of having another choice of just love without the nine gifts he said I take the love of God every time because if you have the love of God it will produce those gifts in your life hallelujah amen verse eight who shall also confirm you unto the end I like that God's going to confirm you God's going to keep you all the way to the end none of us know when our end is but God promised us he'll be with me all the way to the end amen Hallelujah I'm hoping I got at least 50 50 more years brother Rod hopefully 43 hopefully I got 50 more years maybe 60 I'm trying to be uh positive Hallelujah but I I got to believe if Jesus has watched over me for these 403 I trust to watch for over me till the end Hallelujah now look he says confirm you that you might be what blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ how is it possible that Christians like us can go to heaven and be blameless there's only one way that we could be blameless as if someone took all of our guilt someone took all of our shame that man's name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's who I praise right AA that's who I praise amen that's right she sang that on Sunday that was a very good song all children all the children did a good job all the children don't I don't want to just say casa all the children did a great job Malachi did a great job playing think about that and now think about who he's talking about is Paul saying the Corinthian Church could be blameless what do you think Church yes they can be blameless how are they going to be blameless by confessing their sins and trusting in the righteousness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the imputed righteousness you confess your sins right you lose your sins and you gain Christ's righteousness oh thank God for the blood applied amen oh my who is Fai faithful in this life we try to be faithful but are we really faithful no only God is faithful oh I was I thought i' get a little more amens tonight but that's okay you're all tired maybe the Holy Spirit Will stir you up here by the end church God is faithful amen hallelujah he cares he'll confirm you he'll be with you to the end Hallelujah by whom you were called unto the fellowship you were called by Christ to fellowship with Jesus Christ Our Lord that's what you were called to you were called to have fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ now again how do you get blameless who remembers this verse you were sometimes aliens and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death so God has reconciled you God has brought you back into Fellowship through the death of Christ to present you holy and blame unblamable and unreprovable in his sight that's that's a wonderful scripture Church God makes you unblameable unreprovable because of the death of his son Jesus Christ amen so if you've been battling this week not feeling like you're good enough I got an answer for you Jesus is good enough or if you feel like you're a no good Christian I gotta I got to answer for you Jesus forgives you of all that am I say this you are no good amen I'm no good none of us are any good Hallelujah we need need Christ to forgive our sins and then we need to let Christ flow through our mortal bodies Hallelujah flow through our spirits to think like Christ to talk like Christ to act like Christ Hallelujah there's none good no not one the Bible said in Romans 3:23 Hallelujah now look God's going to present you holy present you holy he's going to present Malachi here's Malachi Smith he's holy he's he's he's in heaven he's saved by Jesus Christ right Hallelujah he's going to present Jesse Smith he's holy he's unblameable unreprovable now here's what M here's what we got to remember we got to remember God's looking at it through his eyes we got to stop looking at ourselves through our eyes we got to look at ourselves Through The Eyes of Christ that's that's the difference right there amen everybody say can you say his sight ready his sight see you're only going to be unblamable and unreprovable in his sight not your own right how many here are your own worst critic or Your Own Worst Enemy we should have all the hands up Hallelujah right so we can't look at it our sight we got to look at it through the sight of Christ Hallelujah because his body his death paid the price for the punishment of our sins that we deserved hallelujah hallelujah he became a curse that we might receive his righteousness Hallelujah he took the curse on him that we might get the blessing on us hallelujah amen glory now here's the big if now this is where uh free agency comes in if you continue just got to keep coming to church just got to keep reading your Bible just got to keep repenting just got to keep serving God you'll have some mountains you'll have some valleys but the best part is you'll have god with you Hallelujah the faithful God with you Hallelujah see you just got to continue and don't be moved away don't let anybody talk you out of leaving Christianity come talk to me if somebody's going to try to talk you out of I'll come stand with you let's get out some Bible verses let's get out some some of that those scientific facts there i' hardly had any on there but we can go get some scientific facts there is a God Amen his son is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he's coming back again hallelujah amen glory to God Amen which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where I of Paul and made a minister glory to God so we got to look at we got to look at God's sight what does God see when he looks at me now this was so good to me this morning I can tell I'm not going to get very far on my sermon tonight now this is what stuck out to me now I'm going to zoom in here so this is Scofield's notes I'm G to zoom in a little bit let's read that so to them that are called right there's the footnote there one there verses 2 to9 in contrast with verses 10 through1 13 now remember in verses 1013 Paul's rebuking them for their divisions but before that he's complimenting them saying you're in Christ God is faithful uh God's going to be with you to the end you have Grace and peace Hallelujah some that might confuse some people but it doesn't confuse the Christian Hallelujah because we know this God sees us in heaven God sees you Patrick God sees you in heaven as a finished work like like all the sins already taken out God sees you in heaven as a perfect man CL that's how God sees you no matter what trials you go through in high school no matter what Temptations you suffer no doubt there's lots of them right especially in high school these days high school was bad in my day and John's day but man this really bad now right didn't it somebody said they had uh the ambulance come 10 times this year already to what the the school right the middle school that the Middle School Mercy 10 times right but remember God he sees us as perfect in heaven because of the blood but on Earth he treats us like children that need correction and church you've all seen it if you don't correct children they become spoiled brats God does not want us to be spoiled brats so God gives us a lot of rebukes on Earth Hallelujah now how many know he gives blessings to he gave you all the oxygen you got tonight right he protected you gave you all the food shelter your job your money right Elijah is making good money now he's working full-time now he knows what it's like to be a grown man you know starting to feel that right you make got your own money pay your own bills you paying rent yet buddy okay well then once you start paying rent there you be a real man then I'm just joking but yeah rent is huge uh but see you know in in in heaven God sees us as perfect but on Earth God sees us as children that we got to overcome all of our uh all of our sinful desires right we're still in the flesh we're still battling sin all the time so Paul shows a contrast between God's love for them in verses 2-9 but then the correction starts coming down in 10 through1 13 so he says there's a difference between the believer's position in Christ in the family of God and his walk and his actual State everybody say position ready position position is what God sees you as in heaven but your walk is on Earth everybody say walk ready walk your walk is down here so it's it's different right God sees you in different states that's hard for us to understand but if we can catch it it'll really help us out in our Christian Journey Hallelujah brother R you got a scope for your Bible brother oh you do have you read it a little bit okay so are you familiar with this okay Glory good man man there oh man you're so blessed brother I started in 2009 that's when I first got my scopio B bless your heart Hallelujah don't wonder you're so blessed so there's a difference between your your position and your walk Christian position is in Grace is the result of the work of Christ and is fully entered at the moment Christ is received by faith and he lists all those verses the weakest most ignorant and fallow believer has precisely the same relationship and Grace as the most illustrious Saint right you have position in in heaven right didn't didn't the Bible say you're all Kings and Priests unto God brother Mercy didn't it say just the preachers are Kings and Priests under God is that what the Bible said no or oh just the brothers right not the sisters no we see uh we we see uh women as uh uh prophesying using the gift of proph Prophecy in the New Testament praise God Philip had four virgin daughters that prophesied Hallelujah and of course we know God used Deborah in a great way in the Old Testament as a judge she wasn't a preacher she wasn't a priestess she was just a judge like in a courtroom so see they have the same uh the same relationship as a child of God that's why I like that song I'm a Child of God yes I am there's a in heaven there's a place for me Church CH there's a place for you in heaven Hallelujah think of that think about that brother Claude you got a place that's got got your name right on that's Brother claude's house right there in heaven right you got a place Jesus said I go to prepare you a place did he not am I adding to the word does anyone think I'm adding to the word of God tonight I'm telling the truth because you in relationship we're the same in relationship hallelujah we're saved by Grace We're the called We're the Sanctified we're the Saints hallelujah amen we're God's people but our walk is where it all starts to change Hallelujah after all the work of God in his behalf the application of the word to walk and conscience okay so your conscience right how many battle your conscience this week am I am I doing enough this week am I does God love me this week has God heard my prayers this week week should I do this should I do that your conscience the Divine chastening anybody got a chastening recently where God rebuked you right that's what the Bible says the Bible says he chastens all his sons all his children the ministry the difficulties and trials of Life anybody have any trials or difficult life Parts lately he says of the path and the final transformation at the appearing of Christ have for their object to make the believer's character conform to the exalted position in Christ I like this he grows in Grace in other words church I'm already in Grace you're already in Grace Hallelujah you grow in the grace you're not growing into Grace I'm already in Grace Hallelujah I already am Hallelujah not one day Caris not one day Caris I'll be in Grace no I'm already standing in God's Grace amen like that song look where I'm standing now look look Church look where you're standing now not physically look spiritually how many believe you're standing in an unblamable condition right now in heaven yes I'll say Amen to that on Earth no you could probably blame me for some mistakes I made and that you I'd say Amen you're right I made mistakes but in heaven I don't have any praise God Amen you don't have any you're unreprovable unblamable in heaven because the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away all your sins they're thrown in the sea of forgetfulness and that's good enough for you and I oh my glory to God what a comment I tell you Mali found another good comment from scoffield scoffield had a lot of Revelation that guy my remember this church God's attitude about job in heaven he told the Devil he's perfect and upright but when God came down he said who is this guy same man not a different man same man so in one way uh we would be God's child God's child in heaven but when God's spirit comes down here to deal with our mistakes he rebukes us I'll say like this church he lets us suffer is that right didn't you let job suffer to Humble him right so God's still got to let us suffer many times church we won't obey unless God makes us suffer right Hallelujah that's right we have to be mindful of these things that we're learning we're going through a process of continual sanctification in heaven we're already called uh we're already uh in exalted position the Bible says he's already made us accepted in the Beloved hallelujah oh my I'm already accepted in heaven Saints you're you already are accepted by Heaven Hallelujah but it's this walk where our consciences get confused and we go through trials and temptations we don't feel like we're saved brother Braham said many times I don't even feel saved remember that beautiful quote he said but I don't base my walk upon feelings I base my walk upon the word of God hallelujah you don't have to raise your hands but how many would agree with brother brandom many times I don't even feel like I'm saved don't have to raise your hand that's what brother Bram said as a man of God right because he still had that human uh sin nature right he had to remember church we got desires of the Soul we got desires of the spirit and we got desires of the Flesh and every day we got to crucify the desires of the mind and the the Flesh and give the soul the word of God hallelujah now let me read this quote here I got a few quotes I think you'll like them brother bam said he's healing every person in here is healed right now now Church let's keep that in mind remember Jesus in in many sermons Jesus would heal the entire multitude how many remember that Paul had that happen too in his ministry now did that happen at every one of Jesus's Services no remember he went to some cities and the Bible said he could not do many mighty works because of what their unbelief so braham's in a spot he's led by the spirit in Indiana not too far from here he said every everybody's healed right now the Bible says you are every sinner inside the door and every sinner in this world is already saved and been saved since jesus' death at Calvary you say brother bam I was saved 10 years ago no you accepted it 10 years ago he took away the sin of the world 1900 years ago but it's your personal faith in a finished work that brings the results if you never accept it you'll die and without Mercy because you judge the Son of God thus us or thus rather if you're sick tonight he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes you were healed it's the past tense it isn't that I lay hands on you or any other minister lays hands on you it's your personal faith in a finished work that Christ did certainly how many agree with that amen now this is the one I sent you this morning what a beautiful quote this was how many enjoyed that this morning I was like so happy I'm like M it feels like i' I probably heard this before but I couldn't remember it when that blood said was broke for sin on Calvary every man coming to Christ purged by that blood has no more conscience of sin and is perfectly Anchored In Christ until the day of your Redemption now I'm a witness of that uh John Graham would know when I was a sinner and John and I talked about this many times when I was a sinner I did a lot of awful things I mean a lot of awful things I mean all day awful things right all week for 19 years all all awful all the time the worst music the worst things uh magazines and movies the worst things but church since I've been serving Jesus I don't even think about it I have no more conscience of sin because now my mind's on Jesus all the time I tell my wife all the time it's like I live I'm I'm I'm two different per people I can't even remember the life that I used to live unless somebody shows me a picture or a video or something like man I did that I went there I I don't even feel like that anymore either the Bible's true or not either the blood makes your mind pure or the blood doesn't how many know the blood makes your conscience clean Hallelujah glory to God yeah now the devil will bring back those memories but when you're walking the word loving Jesus you don't think of those things you're just full of the love of God hallelujah amen that is so true church I you know sometimes I hear like I hear a song at the restaurant like that's right yeah I used to listen to that when I was a sinner but I never ever think of it because I have a I have a clean conscience praise God because I spend and like we do we spend our time in the word of God hallelujah if you want to forget about the old things get your get your uh get your nose in the word of God hallelujah hallelujah now I love this Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption amen oh that makes the devil go anybody feel like the devil's been on your shoulder lately I got a scripture to make him go come on somebody Hallelujah brother Raam said this will make him go Satan says oh you're not going to last very long you're not going to make it through your 20s you're not going to serve God when you get older or you'll never be a good Christian I got a Bible verse to make him go the Bible says I'm sealed unto the day of my Redemption oh you're not going to make it to Heaven God's going to reject you sorry devil the Bible said I'm sealed I'm marked I'm God's Property until the day of my Redemption Hallelujah until I get a new body Hallelujah I am sealed that will make the devil flee Hallelujah so nobody should leave her with the devil on your shoulder you should quote that word you should quote the promise of God say I'm God's until the day of my Redemption amen that'll make the devil go Hallelujah when you realize what you are oh there's no good to me brother brandham brother BR says that's right I never was any good and neither was you I'm no good brother Jesse you're right neither was I but Jesus sealed me Hallelujah that will make the devil leave you if you quote the promise of God and believe leave his promise that you're sealed to the day of your Redemption now don't raise your hand but how many did that today how many quoted a word of God and you keep quoting throughout the day to keep the devil off you if you haven't Now's the Time amen hallelujah I never was any good neither was you there's nothing we could do about it that's the good part but when you can just realize that that you're no good then you'll not trust in your own goodness right your own goodness will never measure up you'll never feel good enough right so you can't trust in your goodness you have to trust in the goodness of Christ amen you'll never measure up to the standards like like I said you'll never measure up to reading your Bible enough or praying enough or going to church enough you'll never measure up to that now should you press toward the mark of the High Calling of God yes but but you don't put confidence in your ability you put your confidence in what Christ has done for you Hallelujah and that's how you make the devil go you say devil I'm sealed he called me he chose me he saved me his blood forgave all my sins he sealed me until the day I get a new body Hallelujah and he's not going to forsake me he's going to be faithful to me he's going to confirm me all the way to the end Hallelujah Patrick are you 16 Patrick 16 Hallelujah I started serving God at 19 so from 19 to 43 I've seen God he's confirming me all the way to the end he keeps holding me in my trials he keeps giving me more grace as I go through tests Hallelujah he's confirmed me he strengthened me he's been the faithful one not me Christ has been faithful that's what we're going to see here brother B says if there's one thing you do you could do to Merit it you'd have something to brag about brother I'm not going to ask brother brother Rod but there's been people we've known maybe Rod hasn't but I've known people they almost brag about well I've sought I prayed this much I fasted this much I've sought God all the time I see God all the time but you can't say that to him nobody's gonna say well Jesus I deserve to go to heaven because I fasted and I I sought I sought you day and night Lord no you didn't some of you had you know you have to say Amen but some of us had some selfish days and some selfish nights where we didn't seek God like we ought to we did what we wanted to do rather than what God wanted us to do Hallelujah you can't say that you can't say I sought God all the time no man can come to me except my father draws him it's God seeking man not man seeking God oh glory amen that's right so you don't have one thing to say but God it was your grace that did it how did I get how did I get where I'm standing now God's grace did it for me God gave me unmar Grace tonight Hallelujah remember Church we're thinking in the context of a Corinthian Church that was filled with leaven everywhere you look there's sin there there's sin there there there's sin there for sure at the Lord's table there's sin there in the back and there sin right there in the front there there's there sins amongst the preachers talking bad against the prophet of God St Paul there's sin all over the place and Paul's trying to tell them God is faithful he'll confirm you to the end if you'll believe that's right as long as you as long as you're accepted in the Beloved how can God bring you into judgment when he's already judged Christ in your stead how could you have to suffer for your sins when Christ is already done it God would be a two-timer and an awful person when it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ and you'd accept it right God's not a two-timer God's not going to change his mind about you like uh some of you high school people see it right the dating they do two timers right you know two timer is one boy likes this girl he says you're the only one for me but then the behind her back he's he's like you're the only one for me that's a two-timer God's not going to do that to you God's not goingon to say I love you and I don't love you God loves you hallelujah amen God's a one-timer hallah God's a one-time he saved you in his mind before the foundational World God's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he died for you he loves you Hallelujah now a lot of those men you young sisters listen a lot of those boys out there are two timers even the message now the message people can probably say Amen to that a lot of those boys are liers they are two timers that's because they got a lustful demon Spirit on them that's right so you girls be careful as you get older now I'm shocking you now while you're young so so you're ready when the boys start coming and I'll be right there to back you up so will your dad Hallelujah glory and when did God accept you no look uh he says when it was he God's not a two-timer when it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ you accepted it and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ that's awesome church was he accepted or not did God accept him that means you're accepted because all those who have faith in Jesus Christ are the Bible said they're the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah they're God's children as long as God accepted your his sacrifice the sacrifice of Jesus then God has to accept you and I CU we're trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that's the kind of God I'm going to serve right there when did he do it before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians 1: 14 and5 and when he spoke it into existence he spoke you redeemed with him see job was already redeemed in God's sight how could job say or how could God say job's a perfect man there's nobody like him in the whole earth it was because God had already forgiven him God had already accepted him in the Beloved and we have that same promise he's already accepted Us in the Beloved let's read that scripture I don't I don't I don't think I have it on this slide let me look it up get you got your Bible let's read it it'll do you good you can quote it while you're going in bed tonight you can say devil I'm accepting the Beloved then you then you'll stop thinking about the devil then you start praising God as you go to bed yep Ephesians thank you sir been it's been a minute since I preached on that there yeah Ephesians 1:6 thank you sir oh yeah it's right after the foundation of the world verse four is foundation of the world verse 6 Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved and church you didn't do it yourself God made you accepted in heaven Jesus God allowed Jesus to die and if you have faith in Jesus God makes you accepted because you trust in his sacrifice you trust in his son now I don't know what you're praying tonight but you can have this confidence whatever you're praying for God hears you because you're accepted in the Beloved you just have to have faith either wait or know it's not God's will or you can have it right now right like remember Lena gave her testimony remember we prayed for her uh her family member who was lost remember that sister n me that was a quite a powerful prayer with brother Austin we were crying and weeping right here we knew God heard our prayer that night and God answered the next day right so God wasn't saying wait God saying I'm going to do it now but because why because we're accepting the Beloved that's why God heard our prayer he's already M we're already accepted we're not trying to be well someday I hope someday I hope I'll be good enough where God will accept me in the Beloved he's already done it I hope I hope someday God will will will will think I'm special and save me he's already saved me Hallelujah I'm already saved I'm already accepted the Beloved not by my works but by the works of Christ I just put my faith in him that makes me happy that's why I laugh it Mak I'm so happy this quote made me so happy today you can ask CAA I was probably I was probably too loose with some of my jokes this morning but I was I was so happy I read this I'm like I feel light as a feather I I feel great today Hallelujah your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world and then you're scared W now look at that he's kind of rebuking everybody who's scar why why would we be scared our name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world scared of what oh if I could just keep holding on to the message brother Ram said I quit that thinking a long time ago I never did even try in the first place I just turned loose and let him do the holding something keeps holding me Church how many know that song is a reality I I hope if you don't have a revelation of that song I hope you get it tonight that God's the one holding you tonight that's right Hallelujah you're not holding yourself I'm not holding you your dad's not holding you your mom's not holding you Christ is holding you Hallelujah I hope this encourages somebody here tonight by God's grace Hallelujah he said I I quit that a long time ago oh if I can just hold on if I can just be a good enough message believer if I can just be good enough if I can just not fall away God's holding me God go God's G to keep me from falling away Hallelujah someone said when I was sick that time I got over it said brother Ram did you keep your religion during that six spell I said no sir it kept me that's the difference and that's what happened something keeps holding me I'm just at about time to quit let me see how much I got here how enjoying the word of God tonight glory to God yeah I think uh yeah I'll close with this here okay let's go to chapter two I'll just read a few verses here we'll just read verses one two and three and then we'll stop I've been trying to go to bed earlier too and not not go so late like the biggest trial of my life verse one and I Brethren when I came to you came not with exen of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God now that's currently what was happening in the church they had the most excellent speakers they never stuttered and spit like I do they never forgot things like I do they never had to ask the congregation for a help with a a scripture the Corinthians had the most eloquent teachers the most eloquent I'm sorry eloquent I can't even say it eloquent it just shows how little I'm nothing the most eloquent preachers Paul didn't come like that church you got to watch when a preacher comes so polished you got to watch that preacher because sometimes he's more focused on his on his presentation than on preaching the word of God the real question is is he getting sin out of your life and making the holy ghost or allowing the Holy Ghost to move through your life more amen that's the real difference amen I've seen since I've been the message of brother Mercy uh since Naomi's raised in the message since I've in the message I see many preachers that could preach the house down every Service never stud they could remember every verse and I've seen them walk away with either sexual sin or Pride or money or something and I was like I thought this guy was an angel I thought this guy was untouchable but Church God's going to allow all of us to go through the fires of tests all gold must go through the fire how many know that the Bible said every man's work think of that sisters your works are going to go through the fire brother Rod your works are going to go through the fire and the Bible said whatever works come out and make it through the fire that's the reward you'll get my Works what I did in my life is going to be tested by fire just Smith's attitude what he did with his finances uh what he preached it's going to go through the fires of God's testing and if anything comes out I get rewarded now the Bible said there's going to be some people he says it in chapter three all their Works going to be burned up yet they're still saved think of that living your whole life as a Believer going to church but it you got no reward out of it right that's like lot lot is the best example because look all of his possessions got burned in the fire in Sodom right but he himself was saved think about that they spent he spent decades in Sodom making money he was a judge in the in the gates he was a judge he was an elder respected he had family and and son-in-laws and daughters uh daughters and some of them died in the fire his wife turned into a pillar of of salt so that means his Works were not really sincere but yet he was saved so church this is the question who are you living for what works are you trying to do that's the question lot's works really weren't about God they were just about his Natural Life why are you working so hard for what right why was Lot working so hard it was just for himself it wasn't for other people does ever understand that so all his think of all think of his 40 hour weeks think of his 40 all of his 40 hour weeks got no reward in heaven because it wasn't for other people it was only for himself that's why it's important that we give to others hallelujah amen that's why it's important that we separate from the things of the world because he never separated from Sodom fully does every understand what I'm saying Glory when my life goes to the fire I want I want there to be lots of things that come out by the gra God's grace that pass the the the fiery test of God that I lived a clean Life I Lived the right kind of life my motive was to glorify Christ and not to glorify myself glory to God so Paul wasn't coming to impress them with their his speeches Hallelujah for I determined not to know anything among you say Jesus Christ and him Cru why did he have to do that because they were they had all the Revelations they had all the gifts Church they had all the tongues all the prophets they had all these spiritual things I dreamed that I saw that I spoke that all these spiritual things so Paul said I'm just knowing Christ and him crucified because they had all these gifts but had all this sin in the church as well so Paul purposely had to be plain and simple because they were so caught up and Revelations they could receive but then also sin on the side and not kick the sin out of the church thank God When sin gets dealt with thank God for sending uh the preachers here that preach against sin amen hallelujah am remember it don't profit you nothing unless you got the love of God and what do God what does the love of God do it hates iniquity it loves the truth right so Paul said man with all these gifts with all this big church and and and all the tongues and all the interpretation all the prophecy all the Revelation he said I only want to know Christ Christ and him crucified and he said when I was among you I was among you in weakness and in the fear of the Lord right AA fear of the Lord not a partial this is the true fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord is to what hate evil and depart from Evil right don't go there on your phone anymore and the church said or get rid of your phone whatever you have to do to avoid evil depart from evil amen hallelujah have fear of the Lord and in much trembling so he was constantly trembling about God's presence and and the word of God and living a holy life because these people had gifts they had they had experiences but they allowed sin to grow up in the church okay everybody understand I'm trying to close here I didn't I didn't know how long I'd get like I told you so in an immature church with so many gifts operating a miss all this leaven Paul had to Humble himself in order to stand out to the elect so Paul didn't come into the church like everybody else oh thus say the Lord this and remember he said he's spoken tongues more than everybody but when he came to church the Chan church he didn't speak in tongues so much because that's everybody was doing that he wanted to correct them so they live the right kind of Life hallelujah how many want to live the right kind of life oh God help us amen God help help us especially while you're young right that's what David said how does a young man keep his way pure by taking heed according to Thy word or young women or young teenagers how does a young lady keep her way pure by taking heed obeying the word of God honoring and fearing God hallelujah I'm trying to close I only got a couple more quotes I got two more slides here oh you think I know a whole lot yeah you get your brain all worked up and it can't even work itself anybody ever feel that way sometimes you get your brain so worked up you can't even it it doesn't help you out you know all the books all the answers all the Greek all the Hebrew till it ain't got no place for the dove to roost now he's talking about a humble Christian Life in this quote just being a humble Christian he's going to say it later not being arguing with people not having a temper not gossiping all he's going to say it in a little bit here in other words watch ing the words that come out of our mouths oh but you know it all he says then the dove can't lead because you know too much think about that church God can't lead us if we know everything we have to say God I don't know everything lead me the lamb don't claim to know nothing did you have Lambs Elijah do you guys have sheep or just goats goats I remember I remember out there you had goats there but he don't claim to know anything it's got to have somebody else to lead it Glory that's it don't know nothing amen the only thing I know is Jesus Christ died to save me this is what brother R says this is after this is 1956 after the pillar of fire picture 1950 right he's already gone to Bombay India uh and seen uh 500,000 in in a a series of meetings there he's uh he's seen the the blind eyes open and he said I don't know anything except Christ died to save me that's a real humble prophet of God right there he says come back to being a lamb come back to be gentle come back to know nothing come back to just submit yourself to Christ remember the Corinthian Church they were they were so angry they were going to sue each other oh brother Mercy I'm taking you to court tomorrow they were so angry oh I'm better than you because my preacher is this guy I'm more spiritual because I this person baptized me Paul said I'm glad I baptized nobody but christas and gas worried about who you're baptized by you got to you got to remember who died for you so you could be baptized Hallelujah remember Christ Hallelujah he says come back just submit yourself to Christ don't try don't try to know nothing just walk meekly quietly humbly gently and the dove will lead you oh I want to be led by the dove but what where whenever you go listening to that gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up whenever you go to thinking you got a right to do this or that the dove just takes her flight and goes away she flies away then you don't have that now it's the anointing on the mind now not the soul you can't lose the anointing on the soul brother's talking about the mind if we argue fuss temper gossip the anointing leaves us and we won't think about God God now she's not very far from you this morning or this evening church she's setting right out there on a limb of Peace waiting for your nature to be changed amen let's stand to our feet Mali can come up here hallelujah praise God church we have One Life to Live we have one chance by God's grace to get this right tonight let's examine ourselves is the dove leading us tonight everything we say the dove approves of how we're treating especially if we're married how we're treating our husband or our wife is the dove there and is the dove leading us to treat our husband and wife the right way how about your children how about our brothers and sisters for our our our young ones are we treating our brothers and our sisters with love is the dove active in our lives that's that's the whole point of Christianity is the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us into all truth how many want the dove to lead them tonight let's pray father God we thank you for tonight Lord God in this humble place I appreciate your people being attentive Lord God I trust something was said that was a help to your people tonight Lord God this meeting is not in vain Lord God I preach many a Wednesday night Lord I've seen you do great things Lord I've seen you bless the hungry Souls Lord of Believers yes Lord I pray tonight if anyone has the devil on their shoulder I pray they'll

the people are battling tonight Lord so I pray Lord you deliver that if anyone's battling from discouragement Lord or depression Lord God or or uncertainty or fear or unbelief or loneliness I pray you deliver them in Jesus Christ's name Hallelujah let them find that scripture that will make the enemy leave for the glory of God yes Lord you know how these quotes bless me this morning Lord God I'm not the one holding myself Jesus you're holding me Lord God Lord You've held me you've held this church Lord for all these years Lord God [Music] father we want to recognize that tonight and we want to thank you for holding on to us Lord but if any of us feel uncertain I pray they'll make it right here tonight if anyone feels like they're drifting from God may they set down an anchor in [Music] Christ may they quote the word of God and choose to have faith in the word of God rather than unbelief May the dove come back as brother ra said the Dove's not far from each one of us the Bible says that God is not far from each one of [Music] us but the Bible said that God wants us to reach out and feel after him that we might fellowship with him acts 17 we are God's Offspring Hallelujah Lord so father we thank you for the word of God tonight Lord again thank you Lord that our church has lived above a lot of these problems Lord the Corinthians had I thank you Lord I give you glory for that

you've overcome the wicked one Lord God May the Saints overcome tonight by the blood of Jesus Christ by the word of their testimony may they have a testimony of the word of God spoken I pray bless your people in Jesus Christ's name
