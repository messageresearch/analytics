take a rabbit out of the hamper you know or something you thought he might be in otherwise he regarded as like a magician we've heard that you can do pranks let me see you do your prank now yeah I say this is Reverend but how many times have so-called ministers of this day yeah is it if there be a Holy Ghost if you believe that the Holy Ghost is just like it was in the beginning let me see you take old so-and-so over here this all this manner where this one will get audible get him let me see you perform do they realize that that's the same spirit no they don't that's them - Jesus if that'll be the Son of God make these stones bread if thou be the Son of God tell us you hit you on the head if you're a prophet tell us who hit you with a rag around his face hit him on the head in his pants to stick wonder there said tell us if you're a prophet tell us you hit you will bleed you then tell us uh if you're the Son of God we're honest to our heart if you're the Son of God come down off the

sensation plain idolatry then you're you know Jesus said in one case he asked a question I like to ask the church tonight this Jesus said Wow Wow why do you call me your Lord and do not the things that I command you to do why could you call me Lord and keep up my word why can't you call me Lord and deny the things that I've commanded you to preach and teach what is it what does it it's the cow there's some denominational traditions stands between that and the world and anything it stands between you and God is an idol it takes the place of God Lord means ownership Lord owns the property and

that last weekend and he was saying what a privilege it will be to meet her meet that lady that so encouraged each and every one of us to just reach out in faith and maybe we can't grab ahold of him and hug him but maybe we could just touch the hem of his garment as he's passing my and maybe you don't necessarily have the strength to get through the rest of the crown but maybe maybe Jesus has passed in front of the pew in front of you just reach out and touch him he'll solve all your problems he's that kind of a God that loves and he wants to take care of his children it's so wonderful to be here this morning I woke up this morning with my with my mindset on Jesus but I woke up this morning with this song with my heart our God is tremendous and the Yaak choir the young adult choir has sang out with us and I just must stand before we go to the word this this morning and let's sing that song our God is tremendous I think the brothers and the sisters have the words for us so y'all

for battle service he will stand [Music] [Music] all right [Applause] [Music] and all what a victory it is a man god bless you this morning good to see you a man we love you with all of our hearts and and thank you for your prayers and continued prayers and and we just love you I'm just so honored to stand here with you and to feel just just honored to be among you and miss those that can't be with us but but we're glad that you could be here and thank you for the all the inconveniences you're having to go through to to be here but we're thinking you for your your strengthen your your tolerance with things and and we appreciate we appreciate everything we love you this bug has just did a whole number on a lot of things and so I even going to McDonald's as a difficult thing and so I'm just I'd like to just be done with it but looks like there's a there's a wave of it that's coming back through and it's very very dangerous wave so don't relax too much there's a lot of sickness that is still among us and so a couple things that just like to pass to you that I think that that it's already been told to you in one respect that we have we just canceled our Labor Day services this year and really hate to do that but it'd be real difficult to have 500 people on this hill under these conditions and then try to orchestrate the hotels and make sure they're clean and the restaurants and have them open and all of that so appreciate that brother Joe green this is the first year that I know of that our Labor Day convention has been canceled brother Joe greens meeting the mission meeting it has been cancelled as well and so just to make you aware of those things if you have got a motel room I'd go ahead and get that cancelled in and even picnics that's what's really aggravating to me when we had it sister Brenda when we have to start canceling picnics a it's a sad it's a sad day amen amen we love you with all of our hearts I'd like for you to pray for dear friend of mine sister Karen Brooke and she's she's had a real difficult time struggling with a she had two previous brain brain bleeds that they were able to catch and do medicine with but this was massive to which that they had to go in and do some work - and so she the the doctor was able to to get it stopped for just for bit and and looks like they've got these places taken care of but she hasn't spoken as of yet so we need a we need a miracle and not only do we need a miracle we understand that that kind of condition is you live with a sword over your head the rest of your life because it's just not in one place it's all over and so we believe that God can heal her and so a man I understand some of that you know you you know when you get that conversation to where the doctor says we've we've we've got to stop for right now but it could happen in another second and we don't give you the promise of tomorrow and so when brother Tim got that speech he told me yesterday said you know when we were just having the conversation you could hear it different in his voice he said she lives with a sword over her head I said brother Tim you know now you've got sister Karen with that and you have me with that and so we really need you now a man so we we certainly appreciate brother Tim Pruett and his wife and family and church and what they mean to us here just want to read you a report or just give you a report Wednesday we went to the doctor and and and we had had two previous MRIs and an MRI on the liver and they they did they told us that I have no cancer in my liver or my pancreas that's very [Applause] [Music] [Applause] some thankful for that and so we if we can get it out of that brain but at least in all of this brother Nathaniel there's a couple of things that has been proved I have a heart and I have some brains and so you know so we've got some good things that I mean just cause it's got plants are close to it it proves that I do have it so simple things we love you we thank you where the doctor told me this week we are fighting cancer amen I just want to leave the best till the last here and of course the fight is on and I'll take chemo for for however long it takes and that's eight pills a day and that's a struggle and it's a that's what we continue to struggle with and where we got a real fight on our hands so don't quit praying so and every day is different you take your medicine one day and it reacts one way you take your medicine the next day and it reacts another way and so amen and so yeah and and here's the deal here's the greatest part of the but all when you feel a nap coming on you've got to take it because it's the healing process so should I get about 15 minutes in this morning and you feel the NAP coming through me and you feel like going to sleep you understand it's the healing process [Applause] a man so at home with a home with the family there when all the sudden the the shade starts coming down Paul Paul just goes to sleep everybody understands Amen I'll try to understand if you go to sleep today and so a man we love you with all of our hearts he's good to a Sydney I just about missed a mark the doctor was talking to me about the liver lines and they said it said that there's a line that's in the liver that they watch and it's the the cells that are leaving the body dead cells and they said that's really interesting in cancer patients that we really watch for that to take place since one of the things that we wants to happen in in the liver that happens in and said yeah this might be some good news for you said you have an inordinate abnormal amount of dead cells leaving your body [Applause] that's good maybe same that's good that's good news oh yeah amen amen amen god bless you I probably get more concerned about you know I told sister Connie I said probably my complex is as I've got this chipmunk look and she said it'll be okay you know so sister Mamie would like these cheeks to grab ahold of because when we first got married brother Terry remember those days she'd grab her cheeks is that not bad enough amen man god bless you thank you for allowing me the opening comments this morning and I'll do my best not to be long but if you turned with me this morning I have a few things I just want to share on my heart I thought last night and if you haven't got to hear it but I thought last night was one of the most tremendous sermons I've ever heard on the heart Andrew that was so awesome Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 and like first all to put herself in this these places today I want to speak from my heart again I've kind of changed the way I look at speaking so I want to speak from the heart today I want to speak to you on the man in the arena and I know that I will not get done but but I would like to give you about 30 35 40 minutes of that if that would be suitable it said okay brother brother ray says the we're mind can only take them in what the sea can bear so I think that's good I think that's good admonition Philippians 3 verse 13 this is Paul brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus first John chapter 4 in verse 4 and and we can probably repeat it without it by mine thought says year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world Amen let's pray Almighty God we love you with all of our hearts today and Lord we ask you now that you would come and anoint your servant of the Lord that you would help me to just kind of get myself out of the way for a few moments lord give me wisdom to know how to handle the strength that you would give me just now thank you for what you delivered to us last night we asked your father that you'd speak to us bless this audience in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen amen brother Andrew and brother Matthew give me some water you can be seated we were sitting at the table last night and one of my nephew's was there and he looked over at me and he said brother he said Ron has anybody ever told you you look like Teddy Roosevelt I said well you know this morning I have an interesting thing that you would say that too but uh but I'm going to read an excerpt from a speech this morning it was one of his greatest speeches that he would ever ever speak and and he became famous for the saying he said it is not the critic who counts thank God for that not the man who points out how strong how the strong man stumbles or when the doer of Deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena it's not the one that's up there that's everybody's wanting to give their point of view because there's a lot of people come to the arena there's a lot of people walk in and take their seats and they're on one side of the other in life there's a lot of monday-morning quarterbacks we live in an age that everybody's got an opinion in an age that everybody's got a thought on the process so I want to just as I set that format just for a moment it's not the critic that counts not the man who points out the strong man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds could have done it better the credit belongs to the man that is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who thrives strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error I like that statement there's no effort without error listen let me just say the only man that's never made a mistake with Jesus and everybody else that says they haven't made a mistake hasn't done anything who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in worthy cause Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so his place shall never be with those cold timid souls who knew who never know victory or defeat this sermons been coming for a couple of months so I just wanted to share some thoughts that I have on my heart statements that we have made from this pulpit that now is is is very pertinent to the hour that we live in because we are in a time of the world is changing not just America but the world is changing we are headed toward the Tribulation Period or the rapture there's a resurrection that is laying right in front of us the message has been preached the message has been delivered that message has went around the world and we've had phenomenal men carry the message translate the message the message the bright people have been gathered and will continue to be gathered the work is not done but let me just say there's change on the horizon [Applause] we are enjoying our last services and things are different let me just say to be shut in and closed in in to our homes let me just say for us it has not been prison as the Bride of Christ it's not prison I don't mind not having to be able to go to McDonald's in the morning to get my coffee I don't mind being shut in my house a little bit I married my best friend a man I'm glad your amens were good amen I married my best friend I have a family that don't fast don't fight try wood they don't gossip they don't do all of those things I like quiet peaceable life amen but we've made statements from the pulpit here refuse to retreat refuse to retreat there is no give up inside of us I'm saying that from a level of fighting cancer I refuse to quit [Applause] last week we sister Colleen or a couple maybe this week during the night this week by Sunday night last Sunday night after preaching and was preaching there's a lot of emotions to you and sister Connie we went to bed and and just shortly thereafter I I went to bed early and would sleep and and when she got into bed she said it looked like I was totally awake and she said that I spoke to her and said I'm stopping my treatments I'm not taking any more treatments and it just tore her up because that's something that we've said we're gonna finish this and and I understand why people quit I understand I understand why people quit I don't have any I don't want to throw a rock but I understand why people say I can't take this anymore this therapy is just too difficult I understand brother Andy you can attach to that some of you here that can attach to that it's it's a difficult chemo is a difficult process and so I told her that an hour later and I told her that an hour later three different times during the night I said I'm quitting and I'm quitting so I got up and she just walked the house with the floors all night because she couldn't tell if I was asleep or I was awake and she just didn't want to be confrontational during the night with me and so we were sitting at the table the next morning and she says was he serious about what you said last night I said what did I say last night I probably need to know but I what I said last night and so as if I confessed any major sins era and I said what did I say she said you said you were quitting the therapy and I said absolutely not she said you said it three times about three about an hour apart and said it just tore me up all the during the night that's it I had to be the devil even in my sleep he wanted to attach in a fight but I refused to give up but I now I wanted to speak of not timo therapy but I refused to quit on serving God when you think about it in life as Christians we're were called to battles Psalms like onward Christian soldiers are written because we are people that war and we will be faced many battles in her life but we thank God that God has counted us worthy to stand the test and when the scripture says he are of God God allows himself to be put on trial it's not your flesh that he's got confidence in it's the god part of you that he's got confidence in that he'll see you through now we realize as Paul would say we're we are not sufficient of ourselves to think of ourselves of anything but it's a sufficiency of God for he he'd asked God that God would deliver him of the trial thrice but the scripture says that God's words back to him was my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities but that the power of Christ might rest upon me in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 the scripture says he gives power to the faint and to the them that have no might he increaseth their strength even to the use shall faint and weary and young men shall utterly fall but notice these next words but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength this is not your battle this is God's battle our problems is is when we take a hold of the reins and fight for our self then but God reminds us over and over again this is not your battle so we must stand off and applaud God at fightin the battle through our flesh some one another there was a choice that was made a choice that God chose that we're going to have a battle Satan we're going to have a battle your flesh might have been placed as the man in the arena today the scripture that we all love here no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall arise against thee and the judgment that will shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord I want to thank God that just like the man in the arena we're all familiar with a sports world to where that different teams are there and people go and you it's always good to see your children hit a home run ER get to play or whatever they do we must encourage them and strengthen them and stand there with them and many times we with them many times in the Christian world we watch our brothers and sis go through some incredible trials and you think well why did they have to go through that why did they go through such deep dark trials in their life why it seems like that some people skate through and never have a trial never have a test never have a situation in their life many times it's hey I got a text yesterday morning and it was a text aware that if you could clean the sin out of your life you'll be healed I thought that was an interesting take on things but I thought that was nice that they would send it to me and and make it so personal if you could get the sin out of your life let me just be don't go on record I prayed over and over and over about that and as I look back in life I am I've came through a lot of turmoil I they're not either doughnut if they're right if we're traveling and I dare not either doing that I'll get a call from sister Connie what you do it so I had brother Homer sister Connie and God that has watched over me but many times the comforters are like jobs comforters who sand or what have you done many people set up in the balcony and they're willing to shuffle you a million scriptures or maybe give you all kind of organic things that'll fix you right up and make your head spin or maybe kind of give you some guidance about how to talk and how to be more positive and and maybe how to think you see most of the people sitting in the stands that are watching their favorite athletes do no push-ups run no laps they don't do any exercise I'm gonna preach to you for just a little bit I'm over exterior but just in life they're willing to give all kinds of advice to others but I've always watched in life and this is where this come to it makes such a difference when you're the one in the arena it makes such a difference when you leave the stands and it's you Paul would say it like this no you're not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things and they do it to get a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible Paul now is addressing himself as the man in the arena out there for so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway merely sunday made a statement that was astounding to me that i i I thought it was something that I always wanted to hold in the back of my mind Billy Sunday was a an incredible baseball player then became an incredible preacher brother random talks about Billy Sunday but when it came to the end of his journey he said I've led thousands of souls to Christ and my family went to hell I think we need to be very responsible to our family in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne overcome is to prevail in the war that you have been given all of us are not given the same war brother Brennan would state use a statement he took him up on the mountain and set him down and he rebuked him again with the word Jesus defeated Satan with the Word of God showing that the witnessed of Christian can defeat Satan with thus saith the Lord so regardless of your battle regardless of your battle and I would say every one of us in here have a battle every one of us have a battle I can't overcome your battle for you I just can't I'd like to overcome your battle for you I can't overcome sister Connie's battle every one of you have a battle and God gave you the best weapon he could give you when he gave you the Word of God God does not have to reinvent the word to see if it will work for your situation or does it change from century to century or decade to decade or from year to year it does not have an expiration date to it [Applause] Jesus defeated Satan with thus sayeth the Lord showing that the weakest of Christian how many gets reminded by the devil that you are the weakest of Christian in that church down there well I want to tell you some really good news this morning he's alive he's never told the truth sometimes you look at your children and you go over my job my job my job the worst child in this building I don't know who it would be but the worst child in this building it's ten thousand times better off now I'm getting ready to preach and without and if you just give me a little leeway were here had a sister send me a letter for a weeks ago you know I don't know but I keep every letter every card I keep I keep everything I'm a hoarder of those things but there's a sister that has been she's about she's in her I don't know how her AIDS I don't want to get in danger she may hear this sermon I'm sure she will but she still works she's I would say she's older than me let me say that let me just go that by quite a bit she's lost her entire family so I think let me just advance I think she's I think she's advanced into her 70s and she still works two jobs because she can't make it she works at a department store selling clothes and then she works at another job lost her husband her son and her family members so she's the only one left she goes to to a church there in Lima Ohio and she writes me a letter and she's done this consistently for years and she writes me a handwritten letter and and generally it runs between twenty and thirty pages and I get one every two weeks and always has a card in it it says I'm thinking of you praying for you she's done this for years literally for years and sister Connie can tell you that I sat down and read every word that she says because she sent some very nice things and very encouraging things four weeks ago she wrote me something that stirred my heart and she knows that were the season that were in she understands the things that are going on and she wrote me this she says brother run I met you preaching in 2003 on God's champions that were the final voice to the final age and we must overcome and were champions of this day and she says no brother Ron she says I heard that in 2003 and she said you've been in this battle with cancer for months now she said it's time to be the champion it was in a season God sends you words in a season to where that your your your your you're coming to a spot to where that you're struggling your humanity and it was one of those Sikkim French moments and I was sitting at my desk and I I read that brother on it's time for you to be a champion here's a woman probably weighs 110 pounds soaking wet working two jobs to be able to make it yet she can write me 40 pages a month to tell me she loves me and she's she says I'm your biggest fan maybe she is I don't know for sure but when that little lady screamed out to me it's time for you to be a champion something on the inside of me triggered are you with me and the next quote that I read reading the property says if if we had to stand alone standing for it's God's word every man that ever has got anywhere had to stand alone on the convictions alone only that's not a that's not in a partnership there's only one who will walk with you that that that's him who made the statement the Lord Jesus he's the one that will draw the valley with you he will go with you through every briar patch and climb every mountain by your side yoked yourself up with him for my yoke is light my burdens are easy don't be yoked with the things of the world don't be yoked up with different societies and organizations or yoke yourselves singly with the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah didn't it got to us can you understand me okay I'm struggling with the condition we're very tongues so I'm having quite difficulty with that forgiving me you mind if I just give you some personal notes now and then I'll be done my boys say that something happens to me they're gonna put me on a horse for a statue they're gonna have a statue may be put down here in the yard some of you thought some of you thought that we were cleaning the UH the barns up in the pine trees up and we were getting ready to what we're really looking for is a statue and the good news is is they they just tore Teddy Roosevelt down this week and that'll work that'll work real good we can just find the people that sell in that statute we we've got a place for it here we build statues to men and women and even little girls little boys and we put statues up because they have accomplished something you don't put a statue up because they didn't accomplish something in their life I don't care if this is going on social media or not it's just I'm gonna preach for three minutes the reason that statutes are put up is because men in their life did something that was worthy to look back and recognize that their life was worthy of remembrance they did it at phenomenal cost they did it at phenomenal risk whether it's George Washington Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King Nelson Mandela Neil Armstrong whoever it would be they did it at incredible cost I'm not willing to go the moon thank God somebody decided that you needed to go Thomas Jefferson if we could mail some statutes tonight we could build some de Peter James and John and seven messengers that stood out on the ages and preachers under them that step to the challenge of the hour and at great personal cost and phenomenal risk they preach the gospel of Jesus Christ men who died to give their life for the cause of Jesus Christ to preach the Word of God let me just say this to you many times people want to come along and wrap those statues they want to tear those statutes down they'd like to tag the cross down if they could then it would never be remembered of ever again but let me just say even in hell today that crosses a Raimondo that crosses our Amanda this is the spot that we was defeated and we lost the keys [Applause] and I want to remind mankind and all the demons in hell there's not a rope and there's not a chain big enough to tear down to call the cross of Jesus Christ there's a spirit on the earth to destroy headship others feared on the earth to destroy anything that had any resemblance of truth and to tear it down and and try to destroy it where is that spirit come from hell don't get yourself all caught up in that kind of a nonsense I'm gonna say a couple of things I wrote them down but I want to say it with and what I want it to land it is people that tear down those stains they're stupid people [Applause] they're void of brings your amen in me they have no appreciation for who or what we are I have said it before I say it now if you don't like America leave brother branham stood with america and he said i'm identified with her in her shame and in her glory i am not right and running for political office my office is much higher than politics I turned down politics many years ago to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ but I too AM identified with America and America has shamed but she has glory but I am a citizen of another country I am a citizen of another country identify with Abraham I identify with David identify with these other great men and I am a citizen under the citizenship of Jesus Christ you see my king is not by the Brenham it's not the men of all the ages although this message has produced some of the greatest preachers that has ever been on the face of the earth and if my voice be silenced tonight men like Andrew here don't a Reagan tim-tim Pruitt all across the land I'm not going to take the time to call all my favorite preachers these men's mouths as much as Satan would love to hush their mouths in this discredit them you can't stop the Word of God from going and when you see a man that's preaching the gospel in full force you don't realize all the things that he's had to go through in his life to be who he is you see there's a lot of people want to be that kind of a man but they're not willing to go through what that man had to go through to be that kind of a man the world is full of counts potatoes second guessers talking heads bloggers behind the computer the world is full of political agendas I got a note here while back that could that actually actually talked asked me what side of parties was on but because of what colored tide that I was wearing well let me just say that on my color of time for the suit is my chance if sister Carney says it's okay it's good the world is full of Monday morning quarterbacks who for the most part can't keep their facts straight now you thought I was talking about seeing in Fox ABC NBC well somewhat but let me expand all of this to weak pulpits that's why America's where she's at today who decades ago sold out to the will of man schools of their own think and now I'm getting ready to fight the lines in the arena you see if you show up in the arena you got to fight the lines you're not just down in the dust to get your picture taken so let me just fight for just a few seconds here because we are where we are we are reaping the benefits of wheat pulpits Deacon boards and schools of thinking who have tore the Word of God to shreds control by their own boards businessmen who want to promote a social fit gospel who is after sports education after things they want a preacher that will preach 20 minutes tell a joke have a scripture talk talk about the political events that's going on for the week and and get them out in time that their roasts will not burn they have built a modern church where you can sit in church and live with your sin on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and show up on Sunday morning and look a different part yes forward this to your friends to say this to you we have many that set behind our internet and listen to us preacher in our local area many of our own families are watching and watch every service I got an incredible letter from from Charles's mother and father this week and because of their age they can't come but there they're wonderful they're wonderful supporters of of encouragement to honor this church sister Mary and in Charles and sent me a wonderful letter even yesterday and they're at a point that they can't come or others that can't come and I'm glad the internet is available but just to put it on because of it it's good entertainment that's not enough that's not enough it's easy to watch from that arena get in your car get in your car and come here on Levin o'clock sat Sunday morning seven o'clock Saturday night let it be you a man's in your changing of your heart brother run but I'm afraid it'll change my wardrobe it will I'm afraid it'll change my music it will I'm afraid it'll change my friends it will bet it will put you in rapture ready condition friends Jesus is coming Jesus is coming the message has been delivered he is coming and in his own his way it is not a time to be couch potatoes second-guesses many churches sit with Ichabod on the door and the Spirit of God is never going to go back to they talk about a God that was 30 40 50 years ago or 200 years ago Ichabod has been written over the door because they turned the word down they turned it down they turned the Prophet down they turned the message down they actually turned the Bible down and rewrote it but thank God for people that will stand for truth in this day that will stand uncompromising that will preach it with passion men stood and told that the message was of the devil they will pay a cost for that they said don't go don't go to those brand new meetings don't go to the Homer Fraser's meetings don't go down those meetings down there they worship a man well pray tell me who you worship I'll tell you who he worship we worship Jesus Christ let's just get this real straight here tonight we worship the Lord Jesus Christ and [Applause] social distances is not a new term then weak pulpits have been preaching it for years Jesus asked for our life and he asked us to take work of our cross and follow him that's what he asked for I'm afraid my friends to leave me any friend that will lead you toward hell is not a friend any friend that I put beer to your mouth is not a friend then I put a drug in your hand is not a friend and if you're trying to impress that kind of brand of friend you're on the wrong road gonna say some just couple personal things now the devil comes to kill to steal and to destroy but Jesus came that he might give you lights at the end of the road I may not preach another sermon do you ever I don't know but at the end of the road when you come to that in spite what will you be remembered for really what will you be remembered for we talked about the man in the arena but what will you be remembered for they'll put me at statue brother Mike sits right here he writes me every week and tells me how much he loves me he's been my buddy all of these years calls me brother Ron I love you he sits in a man's place that sit there and danced and we enjoyed him and we enjoy being together but this is not the end this is not the end so as they come to the end of this first part I want you to think about something we watch all of them tearing all of those statutes down and sometimes brother Joe it grieves our hearts and we get on our soapboxes but at the end of the day what will I be remembered for it's quite a thought what have I done what did I accomplish what would I do what did I do was I constantly somebody else's gossip ear was I constantly putting somebody else down was I encouraged her was I strength giver you know brother run I don't I don't seem to do a whole lot in the kingdom of God my name never gets called I would dare say that the little lady that writes the twenty page letter every two weeks has ever had her name called anywhere in the world I would dare say that her pastor don't know I get the letters that I get but sister carpenter I want to thank you I want to thank you for sending me a letter and I've got a file that's I've got I've got files of her letters but in one of her letters she wrote me a letter and she put in there some inspired words she says twenty years ago I heard you preach a sermon on you're a champion now brother Ron it's time to be a champion well I didn't get a quarter way through would you let me preach again next Sunday okay I'll do it it's good to have a smile back at net I love you I love you I love you with all my heart he's good to us a man it seems like every service I preach I get a little bit more energy so I'm sorry I run out hey man I love you with all my heart I know you're not shaking hands and hugging each other but will you do me a great big favor tell your neighbor but they're on love shoes I can't hug you for now or social distance or all I'm breaking every rule in the world marry you we have a secrecy policy going on here and we have a big job secrecy policy going
