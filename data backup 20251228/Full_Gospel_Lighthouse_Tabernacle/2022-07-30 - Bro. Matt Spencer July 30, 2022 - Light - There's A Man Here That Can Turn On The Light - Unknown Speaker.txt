i'd be here this weekend but not to speak so amen so you just have to bear with us this evening you know i told them i'm an annual speaker here and uh so if with that being said i'm not sure what i'm going to speak on new year's eve you know so burning it all up here help us lord amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord this evening isn't it amen amen thank you musicians this evening i would like to speak on light and there's a man that can turn on the light brother branham speaks to the sermon says there's a man that can turn on the light and we believe that don't we and we're glad to have him in our midst this evening amen maybe we'll just turn in our scriptures to matthew 4 and verse 12 this evening matthew 4 and verse 12. amen now when jesus heard that john was cast into the prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the seacoast in the borders of zebelum and nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by elias the prophet saying the land of zebulum in the land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them that set in the region of the shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen let's just bow our heads this evening dear heavenly father lord we thank you for letting us be able to gather here once again lord and we feel your nearness now and and god we ask you that you'll just lift the words off the pages and just put them up on our hearts this evening lord we thank you for what you're doing for us and our pastor no no god i should be even him there in canada this evening i ask you to just strengthen him lord lord just move upon the hearts of the people at this time in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen you can be seated this evening as i said i'd like to speak this evening on light there's a man here that can turn on the light amen i believe we're a church that is sitting here and has recognized that man that has turned on the light for us a bride around the world has recognized that man that has turned on the light for us and so did the people there that saw the great light they saw that light that had come for they was in a shadow of death and that light sprung up amongst them and i believe that same light that has sprung amongst them has sprung up amongst us amen in genesis 1 and verse 1 and 2 and it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was out form or void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light and it was good and god divided the light from the darkness now here we see that god in his creating powers as he rolled planets off of his fingertips as he rolled stars and suns and he just held them in place and each one in their perfection but also he seen that the earth was without form of void and there was darkness but when he come there was a reflection of him upon there and he said let there be light for he was light amen he was that light in that darkness and he said let there be light that spoken word at that instant let there be light and he divided the light and the darkness the light he called day in the darkness he called night and we believe that we're in that light we're of that light and we're part of that light amen amen now all light destroys any darkness within it now we're sitting here in this building this evening and we thank the lord for electricity the other evening there was a power surge that went through my area and my power went off but see i have a generator underneath the porch now i had to go underneath there i had to plug up everything but there was a spark laying down on the inside of that generator but see i had the power to be able to turn on that light and jesus had that power to be able to speak that light that light into existence and there was light and he separated it so if you take a bright light in the darkness there is no darkness inside of that ring of light none whatsoever there is no darkness inside of there and that's what god will do as he said here in verse 4 says and brother brenham says it like this and he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day in the darkness he called night god's word always separates light from darkness see it's the word that does the separating the light from the darkness god ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything like that he got to use that old star or whatever this this world he had to separate the light from the darkness now i like this what he says here he says and when he gets ready to leave to use this group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he has to separate the light from the darkness amen aren't you glad that that light is laying up on the inside of you and he separated that darkness out of you one day see there was a little bit of darkness there but he separated that and say i have to use this individual and he knew the time and the place that he would be using you and that light had sprung up inside of you amen says in first john 1 and 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same as in the beginning with god all things were made by him amen when he spoke that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made and in him was life and the light and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen he was that word in the beginning as that song says jesus what a beautiful name it is that word at the very beginning amen and he separated it and separated that darkness out of us we went to a junkyard here several years ago and i might have told this story before but there was an individual there working at the junkyard on the excavator and he was he was explaining to us that he used to be a coal miner and as a coal miner they would have to drill way down into these mountains to dig out this coal well of course if you're down in those mountains the deepest dark holes there in those mountains drilling out cold it's dark and he said that there was times that you could put your hand in front of your face without no lights there and you couldn't even see your hand in front of your face because of where he was at in that darkness there was no light none whatsoever but see when you turn on a light in that type of darkness it pushes back all of that darkness and within that light he brings life within that light there is no shadow there was no darkness whatsoever in that light amen god shines his light up upon us all he says and heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away aren't you glad that that word will never pass away he is not a liar god cannot lie never lies he says my word shall never pass away so if his word will never pass away you're with him because you was with him from the foundation of the world he seen you he knew that your seed was laying here and he knew that that light was going to shine upon you and one day that life was going to come forth out of that light amen we're living in a dark time a layout of seeing age an age when darkness is all around there was a shotgun that i used to look at and want to buy from my house and and it was one of those tactical type shotguns but they had a slogan with their shotgun and it says makes things that go thump in the dark run and that's what the word does things that go thump in the dark run amen aren't you glad that you have that word that life that light that when there's darkness all around just wreck that shotgun it'll make those things that go thump in the dark things that scare you that's fear upon you make them run well how is that it's that word it's that light amen i'm glad i'm living in a day where i have that word that word that makes things go thump in the dark run aren't you yeah amen we're in a dark age lay out a seeing age the church age where there's darkness all around us every year we well maybe it'll get better next year maybe in the next four years we'll vote for another president maybe it'll get better then i don't care if you're democrat republican whatever there is it's continuing to get dark and the darker it's getting so no matter what they do it's going to continue to get darker amen george washington abraham lincoln they all could come back all could stand here this evening all could go to the richmond halls but each year it will get darker amen why is that it's because they threw christ out of the churches amen it's because they threw christ out of their homes amen it's because they threw christ out of the courthouses it's because they threw christ out of the schools amen they didn't want no light whatsoever all they want is darkness and you look at a cricket a cricket all they want is dark dad has a saying you look at night times in the cities the cricket comes out at night he loves darkness he loves mischievousness that's those crickets and that's the same thing with this world they don't want no light they just want an idea of a light and as the saying goes you can't get worn by a painted fire amen they don't want no light they just want an idea of a light amen but this age is continuing to get it darker and darker and this layout of seeing age in mark 8 and 22 and it reads and it says and he came from bethesda and they bringing a blind man unto him and he besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and he let him out of the town and when he had spit in his eyes he put his hands upon him and asked if he see ought and he said and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking and that he put his hands again on the man's eyes and made him look up and he restored and saw every man clearly amen so we see here he was in bethesda the blind man was in bethesda but i want you to recognize over in matthew 11 there was judgment that was set up on bethesda there was a destruction that has was set up on bethesda so there was nothing good in bethesda so jesus took the blind man out of there and so that's what he's doing in this age as well there's been judgments that's been cast upon this age but he is bringing a people out of that darkness out of that judgment you see there he has mercy upon every individual the same mercy he showed up on the blind man he said you cannot see and you will not see in this judgment town but you come with me walk with me out of the city and what did he tell him to do after he healed the blind man he don't go back in there do not go back in there those people will not believe what you believe there is judgment there so don't go back in if you go back in i'm sure blindness will be set up on him don't go back in where there's been judgment that's been cast but that's what the lord will do for you he will have mercy upon an individual that's been in the deepest darkest pits and he will say come out of there come out of that pit there's too much judgment that's going on there come out of there too much darkness there your blindness you're miserable blind and naked that's what they are in revelations 3 it tells what they were and it says in the laodiceans right said these things the amen and the faithful true and witness beginning of creation of god i know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot i would rather them be cold nor hot because if thou were lukewarm i would neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of the mouth because thou sayest that's what they're saying i am rich and increased with goods and i have need of nothing this old world that's what they're saying nowadays nobody wants to work everybody's getting paid to stay at home i have need of nothing rich and increased with goods everyone has something everyone has goods all around amen that's what this world is saying today i have no need of you amen he said i would have you rather be cold or hot not lukewarm cold nor hot because thou sayest time any christmas increased rich with goods have no need of nothing because and knowest not that they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked they can't even see their nakedness their blindness no more but god would have you to come out to be able to heal you of your blindness but he says here says i counsel thee to buy of me come unto me and by of me gold tried in the fire in that fire where there's pureness in that fire where all things are cast out pureness of gold amen come to me and buy of me gold trout and a fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment though thou mayest be clothed and that the shame and thy nakedness do not appear anoint those eyes with isaf see that same thing that he had cleared out that blinds man eyes he said wiped them once and he said i see men there's trees still see there was a blurriness there was not a clear vision there but he wiped them again said i see men clearly i see it clearly i see you clearly lord could you imagine the first face you see is jesus after being blind all that time after being blind and walking in this darkness all that time you might not see anybody else around you any of these christians whatsoever but one of these days you found a way someone came to you and said come with me and they wiped your eyes and the first face you see is him you see no no other darkness no blurriness how good is our god to us so good to us this evening isn't it that thou mayest see amen aren't you glad that he's put the ice half upon you this evening that you maybe will be able to see he said behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice i will and open the door i will come into him and sup with him and he with me as that our pastor brother ron was speaking there on that door the door latches on the inside opening it up to jesus that wants to come in and sup with you amen because it says in romans this is the way they are because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were they thankful but they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish hearts was darkened professing them to be wise they became fools amen just as i was saying earlier there they they don't want church in the schools they don't want god in the schools they don't want any of that but they're too smart for that they got too much wisdom for anything to have anything with jesus in it they cast him down and say we can do better than what he's even done it amen i like that story granddaddy used to tell two scientists saying we can create a body just like you did lord they said we're going to take dirt and create a body he said get your own dirt amen every science wants to take and do and build off of what god has created but they they are not the creator amen it's just like the devil he's a counterfeit if there's a true there's a false amen so if there's a true light there's a false light a lot of people are walking in a false light amen but god does the separating and he'll he will knock that old self that old miserable self out of you amen that would used to hold you back and say you don't want no new birth but god will give you that new birth god will shine that light upon you amen see in first john 1 5 he says and then the message which we have heard of him declared unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness i'm glad there's no darkness in him because i am in him amen so there if there's no darkness in him there's no darkness that can be set in me amen no darkness in him at all and see if we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not tell the truth amen but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we fellowship one another and the blood of jesus christ son cleanses us from all of our sins aren't you glad of that that he will cleanse you from all of your sins amen and if you're walking in that light and having fellowship with him how great that is to have fellowship with our lord in that light that life amen he says in first in john 1 and 4 says in him was life and the light was light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen excuse me for reading so many scriptures and we could go on and on about light there's so many scriptures in the bible about the light and you know i just i'm trying to narrow it down this evening and thank the lord for for giving us a revelation of light amen in john 8 and 12 it says and then speak jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in in darkness but he shall walk in light in john wesley's notes he would say it like this he said and he that followeth me in no wise walk in darkness he won't walk in ignorance he won't walk in wickedness he won't walk in misery but shall have light of life he that closely humbly steadily follows me shall have the divine light continually shining upon him diffusing over his soul knowledge holiness joy so he is guided by it to at life everlasting amen so many times people want to shine other people's light amen people want to shine other people's light let me let let me give you a little bit of an example by when people go with certain people to a doctor so you have somebody that will go with you to a doctor and they will sit there the doctor walks in and the doctor says okay what is your condition well the person that's don't have the illness speaks up and says well this is what's wrong with them and they and the doc okay that's that's great and but now he's done this too and and you need to know this and the doctor looks at the patient and they and they go on a little further but now we have read online that if you do this it can be cured by this i would love for one of these times the doctor would walk in tell that patient's i don't know what you would call that individual but you know their orator or whatever it would be and say all right here's the shot turn around not one time has any of those individuals ever taken a shot for the patient amen and so many times we have people that want to try to shine other people's light but they can't shine their own light amen in matthew 7 it talks about the man that wants to try to pull the beam and the mote out of the other person's eye and the beam is still in thine own eye and so many times they want to say hey this is a light shine it walk in here so if you're walking down through the woods and and you have a light and you're shining it all around and the person behind you says hey i can't see behind me let me have your light well then you're not going to be able to see you have a light you let your light shine don't hide it let your light shine amen but see what it is is you've also got to be plugged into the word for you to be able to shine your light you have to be unplugged into the word amen it's just like benjamin franklin brother brandon would say it like this said when benjamin franklin when he caught that electricity and he began to scream i've got it i got it i've got it but just to say you've had it because you felt it he had it but he never did no good until it was put to work amen you can scream i've got it i've got it i've got it but until it's put to work what do you have you don't know what you have as brother brandon would say there's a lot of people going around that says i feel it i feel it i feel it i feel it i believe i feel it well that that's just a feeling but what he wants jesus said do you believe it that's when it's put to work that's when it was put into a circuit amen when you were plugged into that current as thomas edison would plug it into that current to make a light bulb benjamin franklin had it but he didn't know what he had until thomas edison plugged it into that light bulb and he had current and i believe it amen that's what i want to be plugged into is his word his current that says i believe it not just i got it amen see because ye are the light of the world a city set up on a hill and that cannot be hid amen aren't you glad that you're a light of this world and neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel or on a candlestick but it giveth light unto all that are in the house you want to shine your light into all your family but like i said they're going to have to catch that light also they're going to have to tune into that electric circuit that word that power and they're going to have to walk in their light and we don't know times when when certain family members will catch it amen but god knows amen from the foundation of the world god knew what seed would be laying here all seeds everything that would come up was laying there from the foundation of the world and god said at the certain time it would come up and that light would bring it forth just as much as the s-o-n the s-u-n would bring forth plants trees and grass amen it's just like that seed that's buried underneath a concrete before long that sun is going to shine down and that warmth that's laying laying upon that concrete is going to warm up that dirt it's going to warm up that seed and before long that seed is going to break forth out of that shock and before long it's going to make his way and work its way around and it'll work its way up right around the edge of that concrete because even concrete laying down laying up on you it won't stop that seed for coming forth no matter where you are in your life when that light shines upon you it won't stop it from coming forth there's no darkness heavy enough that can stop that seed from coming forth when that warmth that holy ghost can move upon you and brood upon that life and that life starts to quicken and something inside of it it says i haven't felt this before but there's something that's laying on the inside of me right now i can't stop it from coming forth and when you get that life on the inside of you you can't stop it you can try to hide it you can try to say well i'm like i used to be but you know on the inside of you there's something that's laying there and you can't stop shining that light amen when you try to just stand there and you and you're just like no i don't want it but all of a sudden there's something moves over top of you and that light comes forth and before long you start rejoicing you say well i never did this before i never acted like this before well there's something on the inside that's been moving there's something that's been growing there's something that's brooding over that life and it's saying come forth and i'm quickening you and you begin to grow and all of a sudden people around you they're going you're not the same person that you used to be and well i don't know what happened but we know what happened we know you and there's no turning back once that sun hits there's no going back down into that shock there's no going back underneath that concrete that darkness there's no going back because that light has brewed on the inside of you is pushing you forward and it's pulling you up a little higher oh i love that life that life that's been laid on the inside of each and every one of us that says drawn out of her drawed out of that darkness in this dark age amen when there's darkness all around darkness through every age come forth but you are living in laodicea the darkest age that there was when they would say that there's just just shining just a little bit of light there's just a little bit of light there and you're that light in this darkness you're that light shining when people come up to you and you might be in the store or the gas station or whatever it may be and said there's a light that's over top of you now you you can't make that happen you can't oh there's a light in me let me shine it we don't have that cartoon character thing where you can click a button all of a sudden a light bulb there's a light i want to shine it i want to shine it you can't shine it like that what's the best way to shine your light you eat this word you you when you eat this word and you let that word take over your life that word will then shine forth and and things that you cared about before they don't make a hill of beans and you go well i don't know why i don't do that no more but i really don't care to do that amen as brother joe green would say i drink as much as i want to i smoke as much as i want to because god took that want to out of me amen and why because that word that word that's been quickened on the inside of you amen see we are a representation of god of christ and that life that light and that life is laying and lives there and we are the light of this world amen if we're then with him in him being and god knew us from the foundation of the world i was glad when i was there with him when he said let there be light i was glad that i was there at that moment you say well you wasn't there at that i was in his mind i was in him at that very moment when he said let there be light and he said there is a son that's laying there matthew david spencer and he seen me at that moment he said at this certain time at this certain place it's going to come forth and each and every one of us sitting here this evening we was laying there from the foundation of the world in his image in his mind that light you didn't even know how you got here brother shannon you didn't know i mean a phone call one day and all of a sudden the light it's like it quickens you and there was no turning back it was it's gone it's over many of us are sitting here and say i don't even know how i got in the building i don't know how i got to the brick building down there but one night i found my way to an altar amen but it happened that light see and he knew where he was at that time he knew you'd live in this age i'm glad to be able to live in this age i'm glad to be able to say when i get there i come through laodicea i come through the darkest of the darks amen but why why are we able to come through this dark it's because we've been given a light it's because we've been given in revelations as it would say the stars amen we've been given that star that star has light amen excuse me i lost my place here each and every age in revelations 1 to 20 and 12 it says and i turned and i seen a voice and spake with me and being turned i saw seven gold seven golden candle sticks and midst of the candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot in the girdle the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs was white as wool as white as the snow his eyes were a flame of fire and his feet like into the fine brass and as they burned in the furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-widget sword two-widget sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell on my feet as dead and laid at his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys to hell and death write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou saust in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars the seven stars are the angels to the seven churches the seven golden candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches i'm glad that we have a revelation of those stars i'm glad that he showed us each and every one of those stars and those stars shining light in each to every dark age there is paul that was a star in his age a shining light arrhenius with a star in his age martin colombo of ireland martin luther each one was a star in their age john wesley and it comes all the way down to william marion branham each one was a star in each and every one of their age and they had to shine their light for what they had been given to shine in this dark age i want to tell a little bit of a testimony here back several years ago when people were making fun of brother branham and saying that he's not a vindicated prophet i'm sitting in my i'm standing in my kitchen of my garage and me and cassie's just talking and i look at cassie and i say william branham is a vindicated prophet if william branham wasn't a vindicated prophet neither was paul irenaeus martin columbo martin luther john wesley if he wasn't the vindicated prophet for this age they weren't the vindicated prophet for each and every one of those ages and we have missed it all and about the time i said that there was a light that come through my garage [Music] i said cassie did you see that i didn't see it but i feel that see he vindicated his word through that prophet he vindicated his word through each and every prophet each and every one that come down through each and every age and said this is my prophet this is the one that's shining light in this dark age amen i don't think i put it in my notes but just bear with me for a minute amen trying to remember the full story here when brother branham was on the ohio river and he was baptizing all those people and a voice come out of there and said so so was john the baptist forerunned my first coming so shall you forerun my second coming and there was a fire that come down through there and there was a lady that brother branham had had asked said please cover up please go and move on away from here and as that pillow of fire came down and as that voice spoke out of there said vindicating this prophet that lady pitched forward in the boat and from that point on was an insane asylum you don't make fun of this word you don't make fun of the prophets you say well i i don't believe so much in that that testimony i don't believe so much in that story see we all were in darkness we all all were sinners oh all needed that light to be quickened inside of us see in first john 1 and 8 it says if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of all of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen see he we need forgiveness of our sins and the blood of christ is the divine provision for each and every one of our sins see and in first john 2 and 1 it says my children these things i write unto you that if you that sin not and if any man sin you have an advocate with the father jesus christ his righteousness and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world i'm glad i have an advocate with the father i'm glad that he was with me even when i i didn't think i was lost i was lost but when i come to i said lord i need a savior i need i need an advocate and you might be sitting there and you might be critical of those testimonies and say i don't but you are without sin no we all have sinned and come short of the grace of god amen and to walk in light is to live in fellowship with jesus christ see sin interrupts that fellowship and cannot change the relationship confession restores a full fellowship with jesus christ and an immediate confession will keep you with that fellowship and that will be unbroken so let your light shine amen see in genesis 15 the lord spoke to abram and said i am thy shield and thy exceedingly great reward and a little bit further down he says and he brought forth him abroad and said look now towards the heavens and tell the stars if thou art able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be each and every one of you laying here that you didn't know you'd be here so shall you'd come forth god knows where you're at in each and every time each and every place knows your condition knows what you're going through dad tells this testimony about how that he was when he was preaching in alaska and they had those bull horns on the church and it was just blowing forth and down through those valleys and he said and you might be a wall from the army running but god knows where you're at and there was a boy that was sitting in a truck down the road about ready to commit suicide he said that's me i i was lost and just in that moment that light god knew where he was god knew i have a son in alaska that's running that needs life and that light shined upon him there see for we were sometimes in darkness we can't say that we've always been light there's a whole lot of us here that are sitting here that says we were in darkness and we knew we were in darkness but i'm glad we're in that light now i'm glad that we can walk with him in that light in that life you know you might be in in a spot in your life and you're in a pit pit of darkness put a despair and you've fallen and you say i i just can't get out but you can take that sword that remembrance and you can call upon that name of jesus and you might be able to take that sword and there ain't no devils down there at that moment but you hit a rock and it'll throw a spark there's a little bit of light there and you say oh i can see the next step and you throw that sword again and you hit a little bit more light and you start climbing your way out of that pit many times you feel like i'm in the deepest darkest place in that pit and have fallen so far see adam and eve had fallen into that deepest darkest pit but god said i'm going to make a way for you i'm going to make a way for you out of there you can come out of there you can come out of that pit you can come out of that despair that you're in climb your way out of there you can keep coming forth but now it's not over once you get out of that pit there's a whole lot of devils that you're going to have to keep fighting amen you're going to have to keep carrying that sword that word of the lord and starts flinging that thing and shining that light amen just as i said earlier you can't just stand there and shout say i want to shine a light you have to do something you have to connect you have to get a hold of that light amen amen maybe as the musicians are coming this evening in revelations 22 and 5 it says and there shall be no night there i plan on going to that city where there is no night no need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light he is our light i plan on going to that city where there's no darkness no torments where god is the light and we'll live forevermore once my soul was straight from [Music] has confirmed [Music] gave me peace [Applause] [Music] see he knew where he was at he reached out for you oh when he reached [Music] [Applause] [Music] for me oh i was lost and under o without god oh [Music] rejoice oh how my heart is since i may give my choice o from the tip piece [Music] now i flee [Music] [Music] i'm secured from my [Music] yes [Music] for me [Music] way down [Music] [Applause] i was lost and undone without god [Music] here i am [Music] my eyes [Music] here i am to worship [Music] and here i am to say that you're my god [Music] [Music] you're all together wonder [Music] for two [Music] king of all days and king of all days oh so highly exhausted glorious [Music] um [Music] love's sake became poor and here i am to worship and here i am to bow [Music] oh you're my god you're all together

[Music] [Music] myself i give myself to you [Music] i give myself away oh i give myself away so you can use how many would say lord i give myself to you so that you can use me oh yes i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me or take my heart will [Music] is take all my dreams just take on all of my plans when lord i place i place them in your hands i give myself away oh god i keep myself away so you can use me i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me how many would say that is their desire this evening is to completely give yourself over to him that he could shine his word through you and it would be a light into a dying generation i just love it when the word of the lord begins to work through our lives that's what the word does it shines a light it makes us correct all the wrong errors in our life it makes us recognize our wrongdoings and it makes us recognize that he is the author and the finisher of our faith i'm so thankful for this word that has shined a light in this generation upon us and i'd say we've been truly blessed by the message of the hour i tell you what i don't know where we'd be without this message but i i'm certainly thankful that god released a star in this generation not a basketball star not a wandering star but a but a seventh messenger that would come by our way and shine the light on our hearts aren't you thankful for that star that that brought us a message to draw us out of those things that maybe were we wouldn't even think we'd have been involved in but if it wasn't for a message you'd have been there but this message this message changed your course and i'm so thankful i'm so thankful for the message of the hour amen why don't you give the lord a handclap of praise this evening amen amen amen we just love the lord with all of our hearts and that's what we've come tonight to do is to let his light shine on our life and if light wasn't so powerful then why would satan transform himself to be you know to be one that would transform himself in light he recognizes the power of it so he wants to he wants to transition himself there but i'm so thankful to know that i've got my eyes on the author of life amen amen as you're dismissed this evening as we sing this song go in the name of the lord and we'll see you in the morning amen just be praying for tomorrow morning service amen you're dismissed in the name of the lord i give myself away so you can't use me oh my life is not my own to you i belong i give myself i give myself to you lord
