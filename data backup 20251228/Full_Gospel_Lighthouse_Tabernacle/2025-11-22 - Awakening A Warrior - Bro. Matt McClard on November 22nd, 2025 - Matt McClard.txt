Nobody else can take your place. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you're like, "Hey, if they just go ahead and do it, then I don't have to." Listen, they can't do what you've got to do. &gt;&gt; You've got to do what you've got to do. Gideon Judges chapter 6 start reading actually at verse one says and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them in the hand of many seven years and the hand of Minion prevailed against Israel and because the Minionites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds. And so it was when Israel had sw sown that the Minionites came up and Amalachitis and the children of east even they come up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth to all come unto God and left no substance for the Israel neither sheep nor ox nor rats. For they came up with their cattle on their tents and they came as grasshoppers for a multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it. And Israel, Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midionites. And children of Israel cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midionites. The Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus sayeth the Lord God, I brought you up out of Egypt, brought you forth out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and dread them out from before you, and gave you their land. I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods of Amorites, in the whose land ye dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice. And there came an angel in the Lord, and sat under an oak, which was in Ofra, and pertain unto Joash, that Ebzite, and his son Gideon, thresh wheat by the ry press to hide from the Midians. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. And Gideon said unto him,"Oh Lord," said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, and why this, and all this befallen us, and where all the miracles which our father told us, saying, Do not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord have forsaken us and deliver us in the hand of the Minionites?" And the Lord looked upon him, and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of Minions Minionites, have not I sent thee." And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherefore wither shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasses. I'm the least in my father's house. Think about it now. And he said unto him, if thou have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me, and he part not hence, and I pray thee until I come unto thee, and bring forth and present it before thee. And I will tarry until thou come again. I want to take a thought if I might of awakening a warrior. Awakening a warrior. You know, as we begin to look at the scriptures here, and I read this at the very beginning, let me read you a couple quotes here. I just I'm trying to lay a foundation, believe it or not. Amen. It says, "The time had come." Brother Brandon will say this, "When playing church had come to a halt with God, there was no more playing church. We must get down to business." Let me say that again. We must get down to business. And let me tell you, it's the same as same as Jesus. It was THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. HE'S GOT THE SAME BUSINESS going on. And he's got children that are yielded to the spirit of God. AND THEY'RE ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST SAYS, "WHAT?" THEY SAY, "AMEN, LORD. WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, LORD, LET ME BE ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS." He says, ' AND I TRUST THE SAME GOD WILL PLACE THIS UPON THE heart of the people tonight that it's time for the halt of playing church, playing religious, playing righteous. Now is the time for action. How many believe he's with me? Now is the time for action, saints of God. You say, "What are we waiting on, brother Matt?" There's nothing WE'RE WAITING ON. GOD'S GIVEN US THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S GIVEN US THE MYSTERIES. HE'S GIVEN US THE FULLNESS OF THE WORLD. IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND GO INTO ACTION. AMEN. SO MANY TIMES WE THINK, LORD, I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. LISTEN, THE DISCIPLES DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS THING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD THEM? GO. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I'M [groaning and screaming] GOING TO FOLLOW THE SAME VOICE THAT CALLED ME OUT OF DARKNESS. HE'S THE SAME VOICE THAT'S SPEAKING TO ME TONIGHT. AND HE'S TOLD US IT'S TIME FOR ACTION. LITTLE BRIDE. THERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO. TAKE THIS WORD OF GOD. TAKE THIS MESSAGE. PUT IT UPON YOUR LIPS AND GO FIGHT EVERY DEMON THAT'S TRYING TO HOLD YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; Brother say this. He says when the word has been spoken for a certain generation, there's going to be somebody rise on the scene and fulfill that word. Am I talking to somebody tonight that says, Lord, be it unto me according to that word. LORD, NOT THAT I'LL JUST UNDERSTAND IT. NOT THAT I'LL JUST KNOW THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET, BUT I'LL TAKE THE VERY MESSAGE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME. COME ON, WARRIORS. I'M SPEAKING TO WARRIORS TONIGHT. YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE YOU'RE A WARRIOR, BUT YOU'RE A [screaming] WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; Listen now. Now. Now means present. Well, glory. Now I'm going to knock that over. Hold on. I got to fix it. We got to hear Jeff. NOW IS YOUR TIME. YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR ANOTHER MESSENGER. NOW IS YOUR TIME, LITTLE BRIDE. NOW IS YOUR TIME. WHAT DOES NOW MEAN? PRESENT TENSE. I DON'T know about you, I need a present tense God. LISTEN. AND WE'VE GOT A PRESENT TENSE GOD. AND THE PRESENT TENSE GOD IS WAITING FOR YOU TO SAY, "LORD, I BELIEVE YOUR WORD, AND I'M GOING TO PUT ACTION BEHIND YOUR WORD." YOU START PUTTING ACTION, WHICH IS YOUR FAITH BEING EXPRESSED THROUGH YOUR WORKS, AND GOD WILL MEET YOU TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. START PUTTING IT INTO ACTION. START THINKING. QUIT THINKING THIS IS WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING AND GET TO DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. DON'T MAKE ANY PROVISIONS FOR YOUR FLESH. SOMETIME WELL, I'M GOING TO PREACH. SOMETIMES YOUR FLESH IS YOUR IDOL. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY. [screaming] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, BROTHER M? YOU'LL DO WHAT YOUR FLESH WANTS TO DO WHEN THE WORD SAYS DON'T DO IT. &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, [screaming] YOU'RE PILING TO YOUR OWN IDOL, AND IT'S YOU. WELL, GLORY. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT HERE TO PLAY CHURCH ANY LONGER. IT'S TIME WE GOT TO GO. AND I NEED EVERY ONE OF YOU. LET'S GO. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALL [screaming] WARRIORS. YOU MAY NOT THINK YOU ARE, BUT YOU'RE A MIGHTY, MIGHTY WARRIOR. Awakening a warrior. [sighs] Now is the time. The Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday. Come on, finish it for me. Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; Well, IF HE WAS THE SAME BACK THEN, HE'S THE SAME GOD. LISTEN, THIS PROPHET CAME TO GIDEON AND SAID, "DID I DELIVER YOU? DID NOT I TAKE CARE OF YOU? DID NOT I DO THIS [screaming] FOR YOU?" &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME GOD, THE SAME MESSAGE, THE SAME WORD. HE JUST NEEDS SOMEBODY TO TAKE IT AND GO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; What does the Bible says, beloved? Now we are the sons of God. Now, oh glory, I know a lot of us are thinking, "But man, I don't really feel like a son." That's all right. You take what the word said about you over your feelings. That's where we stop a lot of times. We got our feelings of how we feel when we come to church. Well, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME. LISTEN, WHAT DID BROTHER? [screaming] HE GAVE I LISTENED SUNDAY. HE GAVE YOU A SHIRT. FEELINGS ARE OVERRATED. IT'S TIME WE START STEPPING OVER OUR FEELINGS AND START SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD. IF GOD SAID I COULD HAVE A BABY, LET ME START SAYING I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY. IF GOD SAID I [screaming] COULD BE HEALED, LET ME START SPEAKING IT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME WE TAKE WHAT GOD GAVE US AND [screaming] GO WITH IT. YOU ARE THE WARRIORS. Brother Matt, Ron's a warrior. Ron is a warrior and he's doing what he's supposed to do. And Andrew is a warrior and he's doing what he's supposed to do. We're preaching the word of God that you MIGHT RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE. Come on, somebody. Brother Matt, I'm of weak faith. Brother said, "Never confess that." So, if you got that thought going through your mind right now, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THAT CLOUD THAT'S HOLDING BACK THE SUPERNATURAL AND LET THE WIND OF THE HOLY GHOST, WHY DON'T YOU BLOW IT OUT OF YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, the sun stands all the time. Am I right? I'm from Indiana. There's a period from about November to about February, you don't see the sun very much. In fact, you get I think it's there's a condition they get. I don't even know what it is. It's But I tell you what, I loved coming south to preach in the winter. I literally pull my face over to the side and be like, "That is just shun." I was like a plant growing. I was happy to see it. I'm not kid. I came down to brother Lloyd and the sun down 64 was just just I had my I was all over the side. 22 degrees outside, but man, the sun was shining. Listen, this world might be as cold as COLD CAN BE. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE SEN IS SHINING TONIGHT. AND HE'S BRINGING HIS PREDESTINATED SEAT TO A PLACE THEY RECOGNIZE. YOU ARE A MIGHTY ARMY. &gt;&gt; You are. Little Noah. You're a part of this army, buddy. And you're a mighty warrior. Your words speak in heaven. Come on, SOMEBODY. YOUR WORDS MOVE MOUNTAINS. IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, IT DIDN'T PUT AN AGE LIMIT ON THAT. THEN WHY DO you &gt;&gt; Well, preach somebody OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABE. Sometimes maybe we need a babe to tell us, "Hey, you're an idiot." &gt;&gt; Kids, don't you dare do that. But when you speak the word, write to your parents. Come on. Some of you kids know this Bible. Some of you kids know this message. Come on. YOU CAN CHANGE AN ATMOSPHERE, YOUNG PEOPLE, IN YOUR HOMES. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LISTEN, THE DEVIL WILL GET [screaming] ON DADDY. THE DEVIL WILL GET ON MOMMY. BUT WHY DON'T YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS NOT BECOMING OF A CHRISTIAN. MOM AND DAD, [screaming] WHY DON'T WE PRAY?" &gt;&gt; AND WHY DON'T YOU PARENTS HAVE ENOUGH UMP INSIDE OF YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT." &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW where this is from, but all right. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Well, preach, brother Matt. LISTEN. I WANT TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED ME TO BE AND I'M NOT SETTLING BACK FOR ANYTHING ELSE. HE'S CALLED ME TO BE A WARRIOR. HE'S CALLED YOU TO BE A WARRIOR. HE'S CALLED YOU TO [screaming] TAKE GROUND. Let me read you a few quotes here. Jesus Christ in the beginning in the building tonight to perform Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform miracles. How many needs a miracle? Well, you showed up to the right place. Man, let that sink in for just me. If you would just believe that that the God that's made heaven and earth is in the building tonight, then whatever you have need of, let your faith go and say, you know what, it's mine. And right there, there's every thought in hell trying to come against you. Well, why don't you fight every thought in hell and say, you know what, that's the word of God and it's worth fighting for. He says Jesus Christ is the building there tonight to perform Moses. But he does it through his church, his people. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Who's he doing it through? The preachers? No, no, no. He didn't say that. He said the people. So sisters, when your husband's sick, don't you be afraid to lay your hand on him and you begin to pray the prayer of faith and you watch God move in the situation. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; What are you doing, brother Matt? I'm an awakening a warrior. Come on, warriors. Come on. Draw your sword. IT AIN'T TIME FOR JUST BROTHER RON TO FIGHT. BROTHER ANDREW AND BROTHER MATT AND BROTHER MATT AND BROTHER WILLIAM. IT AIN'T JUST TIME FOR HIM TO FIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO WIN. IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO RECOGNIZE WHO YOU [screaming] ARE. YOU ARE A WARRIOR. Says in my name they will cast out devils, evil spirits. Is that right? The commission given to the church. That's what the matter of the church today. It doesn't know its position. If you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble person in the building in the next five minutes. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Why don't you just start believing it? Why don't you quit questioning it? Quit looking for some sensation. Quit looking for some feeling and JUST TAKE GOD AT his word. DON'T MAKE IT HARD. JUST SAY, "LORD, I BELIEVE IT. LORD, I [screaming] RECEIVE IT. LORD, I NEED IT. LORD, IF YOU'RE IN THE BUILDING, pass by my way and nobody else needs it. Father, I need it. I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost. I'VE BEEN FIGHTING MIND BATTLES ALL WEEK. I NEED A REFRESHING IN YOUR PRESENCE. THIS IS MY SERVICE. THIS IS MY TIME. AND I'M HERE TO FIGHT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO FIGHT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M LEAVING VICTORIOUS IN JESUS NAME. AND [screaming] YOU ARE TOO. &gt;&gt; But now you shouldn't SAY THAT. WHY SHOULDN'T I SAY THAT? I'M LETTING HELL KNOW. BACK OFF OF GOD'S PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I'M A SON OF GOD STANDING IN MY POSITION. I WILL NOT BOW TO ANY [screaming] DEVIL. And you should do the same. Let me go to the next one. Ah, let me finish this one. They're good. If you know position who you was, what you were tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble person here in the next five minutes. That's right. The thing of is you're looking That's right. Sorry, Virginia slipped through. He said, 'The thing of it is you're looking off in the momentum for something to happen when it's already here. Now we are the sons of God, not we will be. We are right now. Let me skip down another quote. Brother Ram, why are you hitting on those things at night? is the reason this is you can't get if you can get can ever get the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are and what they positionally healing will be the simplest message you ever had to preach or anything else but you're scared you're afraid you don't realize you're sons and daughters of God and now not we will be We are now. Say now with me. &gt;&gt; Now, then what do you have need of? Come on, somebody. But now I don't have any need. Well, why don't you begin to praise him like a son would praise him? &gt;&gt; Why don't you begin to look at the prodical son and think back where you came from and think, Lord, I didn't deserve it, but God, there was something DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF ME THAT I CAME TO MYSELF. I'M GLAD I CAME TO MYSELF AND I'M COMING TO MYSELF EVEN NOW. YOU ARE A [screaming] MIGHTY WARRIOR. THIS IS WHAT JESUS SAYS TO HIS BRIDE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ANYTHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BACK DOWN FROM ANYTHING. YOU ARE MY [screaming] REDEEMED BRIDE. I PAID THE PRICE FOR YOU. I PAID FOR YOUR HEALING. I PAID FOR YOUR INIQUITIES. I PAID FOR YOUR SINS. THEN WHY DO YOU LIVE BELOW WHERE GOD CALLED YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO. SO WHATEVER DEVIL THAT'S KEPT YOU IN THE TRENCHES AND MADE YOU THINK YOU GOT TO STAY THERE, I SAY [screaming] BOOT DEVIL, GET OFF OF GOD'S PROPERTY. THEY'RE FREE IN JESUS' NAME. AND IF THE SUN SET ME FREE, [screaming] THEN I'M FREE INDEED. The Bible says awake. How many ever heard your mom wake you up for school? My Ella's here. You know what she says? Two more minutes, daddy. I'm glad she doesn't say 12. Two more. That's all she wants. Two more minutes. I remember my mom waking up me. It was more like a glass of water after 25 more minutes. And then I'm like, I pray some of you get I pray some of you get that tonight to recognize you aren't just here for no reason. COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU GOT A POSITION. YOU GOT AN [screaming] AUTHORITY IN HEAVEN. DRAW YOUR SWORD. THAT'S MEANT FOR CUTTING. YES, IT'S MEANT FOR CUTTING. IT'S MEANT FOR CUTTING EVERY PROMISE OF GOD OUT OF IT. GO TO CUTTING ON THE WORD OF GOD. YOU NEED HEALING, GO TO CUTTING ON THE WORD OF GOD. SAY, "LORD, I NEED MY HEALING. Every thought that comes contrary, I am the God that he health thee. By his stripes, I'M HEALED." LISTEN, IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. WALK RIGHT INTO YOUR healing spiritually. I'm speaking to people sometimes the devil has beat you down to think you're cowards, you're nobodies, you're never going to get it. I'm preaching to the right crowd tonight. You know what that is? The devil is so stinking scared that you recognize who you are. So he puts I'm getting ahead of myself. Teaser. You know, my mom would eventually go, "Matt, get up." I don't know about you, she be to shout. Well, I'm here to let you know, there's been a shout go out in this end time. And what has it been to do? It's been to awaken the bride, to make her recognize who she is. You are in a SLEEPING SLUMBER. BUT THUS SAY THE LORD, COME BY YOUR WAY. AND SAID, "THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT VOICE. I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT." LISTEN, I TALKED TO A MAN. LISTEN, BY CHANCE LAST WEEKEND. I'm in Pennsylvania and there's a brother from Brother Danny Stevens in the church. He said, I said, "Man," he just gave me a testimony. He said, "I met a man from Indiana. I knew him. He was right from where I was at." He said, and he told me about a prophet. He said, "A year later, he came back down to Florida." He said, "I met him in the driveway. Tell me more." Listen, you can't stop a predestinated seed when they hear something from God. There's an awakening that HAPPENS ON THE INSIDE OF THEM. THEY CAN'T STOP IT. LISTEN, THE DEVIL WOULD LIKE TO COW YOU DOWN AS, "OH, YOU JUST HAD A BORN AGAIN EXPERIENCE." NO, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE A MIGHTY WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; Some of you going to get it tonight. Some of you going to recognize you can fight your own battles. You don't need me to pray for you. Listen, we will pray for you. We will pray over you. We will pray with you. WE WILL FAST FOR YOU. WE WILL PRAY FOR YOU. WE WILL DO ANYTHING WE CAN FOR YOU. BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE HAS POWER. YOUR VOICE [screaming] CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS. YOUR PRAYER. I think God wants us to get this. Listen, I wrote this down. Brother brother preacher on weapons of our welfare. By the way, that was part two last Sunday. He didn't label it. I called him, said, "Hey, man. You label that." He didn't. He goes, "Oh, man. I didn't do that. It was weapons of our warfare. Brother Andrew would preach a message. United by faith, united by the battle, David's mighty man. Brother Matt would preach a message. Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. YOU THINK GOD'S TRYING TO GET SOME TO THE CHURCH? HE'S TRYING TO AWAKEN YOU. YOU ARE [screaming] A MIGHTY ARMY. YOU ARE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. YOU ARE MY BRIDE. YOU HAVE THE SAYITH THE LORD AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; But I'm afraid I'll make a mistake. You know what? You'll never do anything. &gt;&gt; You remember the man with no eraser? What'd he do? NOTHING. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. BUT I [screaming] SAY TO YOU, DRAW YOUR SWORD AND GET TO FIGHTING. LISTEN, DADDIES, you ain't got to claim anything the devil tries to put on your home. You're the priest of that home. It's about time you take it and put it in order. Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TAKE THE DEVIL COMING IN AND STEALING YOUR STEALING YOUR CHILD'S MIND. LISTEN, DEVIL COMES INTO MY HOUSE AND I RECOGNIZE THAT'S NOTHING BUT A DEVIL. I BEGIN TO PRAY FIRST BEFORE I EVER TALK TO MY CHILD. LISTEN, HE WILL COME ANY WAY HE CAN GET INTO THAT HOUSE. BUT YOU'RE THE HIGH PRIEST OF THAT HOME. YOU STAND AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, SATAN? I'M A CHILD OF GOD. [screaming] I'M A WARRIOR OF THE CROSS. YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT IN MY HOME. SO, LET ME SHOW you the door and you better not come back cuz you'll leave headless. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'm thinking about taking your head off right now. LISTEN, MAS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT. &gt;&gt; Your husband GETS IN A FUNK FOR A COUPLE DAYS. WELL, PREACH, brother Matt. WON'T YOU BEGIN TO PRAY FOR HIM INSTEAD OF complaining about him? &gt;&gt; And I can turn that vice versa right away. We're warriors. That means we keep our house fortified. You keep it fortified in what? Prayer. Go look up the quote. It's there. Fortify your house with prayer. Well, mama will begin to shout if you don't get up. I pray God doesn't have to do so much that way. Well, preacher man, listen. God's calling you tonight and he's letting you know you're a warrior. But that I don't feel like a warrior. It's all right. You don't have to feel like a warrior. You are identified with what he says. &gt;&gt; I'm not identified by my past. I'm not identified as a drunk. I'm not identified as as a pot smoker. I'm not identified as a cigarette drinker. I'm not identified as a cusser. I'm not identified with anything in THE WORLD. I'M IDENTIFIED IN BLOODBOUGHT, BORN AGAIN SON OF GOD. THAT'S HOW HE SEES ME. HE CANNOT SEE ME ANY OTHER WAY. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S LOOKING THROUGH THE BLOOD. WHY [screaming] DON'T YOU LOOK THROUGH THE BLOOD TONIGHT AND SAY, "LORD, I AM WHO YOU CALLED ME TO BE. I AM A WARRIOR. Let me read you this now. There's been a shout this end time. WHAT WAS IT? COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. I'm going read a few quotes here. Just time together. He says, "My shadow will move every time. Everything of the my body moves and the Holy Spirit body of Christ will move just as Christ moves. And if Christ in heaven could ever get his physical body or his spiritual body on the earth moving as he wants it to move, watch for things to happen. Catch this now. It's beginning to come to life. They've paralyzed it long enough. You know who he's talking about? Denominations. And I'm here to say those message denominations within the message have tried to paralyze the move of God way too long. If God wants a prayer line, there'll be a prayer line. and he wants laying on the sick. They'll be laying they'll be laying hands on the sick. LISTEN, I DON'T WANT YOUR IDEA WHAT THE MESSAGE IS. I DON'T WANT YOUR WATERED DOWN GOSPEL. I BELIEVE IN A FULL GOSPEL. I BELIEVE IN A SUPERNATURAL GOD. I BELIEVE GOD WILL DELIVER. [screaming] AND HE IS STILL DELIVERING. You've come into another age. Well, you stay in your age. I'm right here with Jesus. &gt;&gt; He says they paralyzed it long enough, but the Holy Spirit is bringing life into it and beginning to wake it up. beginning to move because it sees its position. This is the third seal that was in 1955. This is brother Ramon says the bride hasn't had a revival yet. Says there's been no revival, no no manifestation of God to serve the bride yet. See, we're looking for it now. It'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again. See? Yeah. He'll send it. He promised it. Catch this. 1964. He says, "How many reads it?" You know, you see it all the time. Fast pray. Fast pray. It's all you hear. Fast pray. We're going to have a great breaking of the day. There's a great thing going to happen. All of you pray, pray, pray. We're not too late. Why do they do that? Why do they do it? They want a great awakening. They're crying, believing there'll be awakening. They're good people. What is it? What have they done? They've not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a Christian. They feel the pull of the hour, but they haven't recognized what's been done. That's what's making them feel that way. They know something's supposed to happen. Aren't you glad you haven't missed it? There's been a seven thunders that has gone out before you. What is that? IT WAS THE SHOUT TO BRING THE BRIDE TO AN AWAKENING OF WHO SHE WAS, WHO SHE'S GOING TO BE. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A BOOK OF REDEMPTION THAT WAS OPEN THAT YOU MIGHT SEE YOUR NAME. HOW DO I SEE MY NAME, BROTHER MATT? WHAT IS THAT PULL ON YOUR LIFE? WHY CAN'T YOU GET AWAY FROM IT? YOU'VE TRIED TO GET AWAY [screaming] FROM IT, BUT GOD, RICH IN MERCY, IS CALLING YOU. YOU [screaming] ARE A GREAT WARRIOR, LITTLE BRIDE. I want to take that over to Ezekiel. Can these dry bones live? Can these dry bones live? What did he tell the son of man? Why don't you start prophesying? Aren't you glad we've had a son of man begin to prophesy to us in the end time? What did he do, brother brother Andrew preacher last week? Uniting. IT'S THE UNITING TIME OF THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. WE'VE GOT ONE MIND. WE'VE GOT ONE THOUGHT. WE'VE GOT ONE GOAL. WE'VE GOT ONE BAPTISM. WE GOT ONE HOLY GHOST. AND WE'RE MOVING TO [screaming] A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; Can these bones live? Catch this now. He asked him. He said, "Can these bones live?" At the very end of it, it said it'd be a great exceeding army. Let me get to Gideon. How many loves the Lord? Let me get to Gideon. We're going to get down home now. We're going to get to where we live. Here's Gideon. Israel had sinned and the many nights has stolen everything they had. You know, that's what the devil likes to do. He likes to steal your healing. He likes to steal your joy. He wants to take every revelation you've ever had. He wants to steal your peace of mind. Come on, somebody. He doesn't want you to have peace of mind. He doesn't want you to think anything of yourself. That you're no down little anything. Listen, we're humble, but we know who we are. We know what he did for us and we know who we are. Come on, somebody. It's time we get on the devil and say, "Listen, devil, I'm tired of you trying to steal MY JOY. I'M TIRED OF YOU TRYING TO STEAL MY SIGNED MIND. I'M TIRED OF YOU TRYING TO TAKE WHAT GOD RIGHTLY GAVE TO ME. IT'S MINE AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DON'T FIGHT FOR IT, HE'S GOING TO STEAL IT FOR YOU. BROTHER MATT, I GOT IT. UH-HUH. Keep it now. &gt;&gt; How do I keep Brother says, "Stay constantly in the state of revival." Come on, somebody. Maybe you've fallen out of the state of revival. Well, you've come to the right place tonight. Why don't you get back into the revival? Get back under the spoken word that God is speaking to you tonight to let you know YOU ARE A MIGHTY WAR. I PRAY SOMEBODY WOULD AWAKE OUT OF THEIR SLUMBER. LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE THINGS OF THE WORLD WILL SWEEP US OFF TO SLEEP. YOU CARE MORE ABOUT FOOTBALL THAN YOU DO THIS. OR YOU CARE MORE ABOUT BASKETBALL [screaming] THAN YOU DO THAT. YOU CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR FINANCES, YOUR RETIREMENT THAN YOU DO GOING IN A RAPTURE. WELL, PREACH, BROTHER MAN. I AM PREACHING. WHY DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE THAT'S A DEVIL TRYING TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP AND RECOGNIZE GOD? LET ME GET BACK TO DOING WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I ain't got a clock now. I got a timer. It's okay. 15 of you just checked out. He likes to steal your joy. You know why? Because he knows what the joy is. It's your strength. Listen, we're mighty warriors and we're not going to battle without joy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to battle knowing I'm going to win. Listen, how many's ever went to a fight you know you're going to win? Well, I'm here to tell you it maybe it's not a maybe you're going to win. YOU'RE GONNA WIN. BUT MAN, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA WIN. CAST [screaming] THAT THOUGHT OUT. YOU'RE GONNA WIN. WHAT YOU SAY THROUGH YOUR LIPS? I'm gonna win. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; One more time. Make it good. &gt;&gt; Well, out of the mouth of two or three witnesses, LET IT BE ESTABLISHED. YOU'RE GOING TO WIN. &gt;&gt; That battle IS FACING YOU RIGHT NOW. WHY DON'T YOU TURN AROUND and say, "You know what? I'm tired of you stealing from me. I'm Listen, you try to steal my joy every Monday. He tries to bring that complex right back on your head. WELL, ONCE YOU'RE DONE, THAT COMPLEX IS NOT MINE. THAT IS STRAIGHT FROM THE PITS OF HELL, AND YOU CAN TAKE IT BACK TO THE PITS OF HELL. I DON'T CLAIM IT. I DON'T WANT IT. IT'S BEAT ME DOWN ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; HOW do you know what you're talking about? I've had them. Listen, I'm walking the dunness of life right now. I don't even really know who I am. What do you mean? I had a complex for so long, I thought that's who I was. But that is not who I am. I am not some back down nobody. I'm a daughter. I'm a son of God walking in the light of this blessed end time. I cannot lose. He called me by grace. He can't LOSE ME. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I'VE GOT A SWORD. I'VE GOT A SHIELD. LISTEN, BROTHER RON SAID LAST NIGHT OR LAST WEEK, THERE AIN'T NOTHING BACK HERE. SO WHY DON'T YOU TURN AND FACE THAT DEVIL? SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DAVID DID. I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; What you're saying doesn't line up. So that means you're a liar. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in for just a minute. That thing that's been beating you down. [sighs] Listen, the devil likes to the Midianites. They want to keep Gideon to the place that he was hiding to get his food. Cow down. Listen, brother said this. It's time you found out who you are. The devil's trying to hide you back and tell you some little cow down something. You're not. You are as sons and daughters of God. The deed is not in heaven. It's in you. Catch this next word. Hallelujah. Why don't you say it with me? Hallelujah. Said, "Brother man, I don't feel like it's in me, but why don't you say hallelujah anyway?" You know why? Cuz the devil doesn't want you to know that you are who you say you are. Listen, I went to a meeting down in North Carolina. I couldn't study. I couldn't pray. Felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. And I said, "Lord, here I am. I'm just COMING WITH YOU." AND I HAD THE MOST POWERFUL MEETINGS SUNDAY MORNING. AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WHY? BECAUSE I WASN'T GOING TO LET MY THOUGHTS AND WHAT MY LISTEN, GOD HELPED ME. NOW LISTEN, GOD HELPED ME TO DO [screaming] IT. BUT I WASN'T GOING TO LET THAT MOVE ME BACK FROM STANDING IN MY PLACE OF DUTY AND SWINGING MY SWORD. AND THE POWER OF GOD DROPPED INTO THE BUILDING. AND WE HAD PRAYER LINE IN THE MORNING. [screaming] WE HAD PRAYER LINE EVENING. NOT FOR MY GLORY, BUT BECAUSE I'M NOT BACKING DOWN. [screaming] GOD CALLED ME TO THIS. WE'RE PREACHING IT. AND LET MY LIFE [screaming] SAY AMEN. I got in the car that night. I told my wife, I'm thankful for a wife that goes with me, listens to me, supposed to tell on her, not myself, listens to me whine every once in a while, and she just prays for me. Send me a word of encouragement. And I got in the car. I said, "Honey, I believe I know what it was." The devil was scared. Let me tell you, he's scared of what you can do. He's scared of what you young people. You said, "But man, I'm just young in this." That's all right. He's still scared of you. He's scared of your testimony. He's scared of your life. He's scared of the Holy Ghost. See, he knows he sees on the inside of you that if you ever begin to feed it the right way. Come on, somebody. You ever begin to get in this message, begin to feed on the right way, he knows you've become an invincible army. Oh, that's my next quote. Leads right into it. Amen. He says, he says, listen now. He says it exposes Satan. He hates Revelations where it's at. This is in the exposition church ages. [sighs] Yeah. Think it's in there. It exposes revealing the works, attempted destruction of God's people, the discrediting of God's word, right down to the time he's cast in a lake of fire. He cannot stand it. He knows that the people get the revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work. She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what invincible means. You want it? I'm just I'm not very smart, so I look it up. Listen, you don't know what a word means? Look it up. Don't sit there. Listen, there's revelation standing behind the word meaning. Devil didn't like that, but that's all right. Gets people to dig a little bit farther. All of a sudden, listen, it ain't all in the root word of it. But I tell you what, when the Holy Spirit quickens, look up what that word means. Go digging. There's more revelation for you right there. Go digging for those golden nuggets, brother Jerry. Go digging for him, man. I love that guy over there. Praying, you get off this Sunday, man. Pray with us. How many loves Brother Jerry being here? I'm pray. I love Brother Jerry. Listen, I love seeing him sit over there. There's some of you are quiet, but you pull like all get out. Preacher loves it. Especially one that preaches by inspiration. That'd be me. Invincible. Incapable of being defeated. Say it with me. Incapable of being defeated. Man, I wish I could see the little boy in the mirror. Incapable. It's you, Brother Chris. Incapable of being defeated. It's you, buddy. Incapable. Quit waiting on a feeling. It's what the word of God called you to. Step into the power of it, bride. He just dropped in the building. He's here to vindicate what I'm telling you. If you just believe it, quit trying to feel it. feelings will be there. I guarantee you. You get down the fire the place you need him. Oh, he coming. You stood for my word. You didn't back down. Nobody else is coming. I'm coming down there with you. In fact, I've been here with you the whole time. AND NOW YOU SEE ME AND YOU SEE THE PURPOSE OF THIS. LISTEN, THOSE CH HEBREW CHILDREN WENT IN THEIR BOUND. BUT WHEN THEY CAME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, THERE WAS NOTHING BINDING THEM. GLORY. Let me read. I got 25 minutes. I'm doing good. Preach fast. Here we go. Gideon here. Think about [clears throat] Gideon. Verse 12. Now Gideon, brother said this. He said, "Now, Gideon was not when he was out there threshing the wheat, no doubt, but the prophet's message was going through his heart." Listen, I read all those scriptures for a purpose. When they cried unto the Lord, God sent him the word. AND THEY RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE PROPHET. IT'D BEEN SEVEN YEARS THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE. COME ON, SOMEBODY. SEVEN YEARS THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE. AND WHAT DID THIS PROPHET [screaming] DO? HE CAME DOWN AND GAVE THEM SEVEN REASONS AND SAID, "LISTEN, HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS. [screaming] HERE IT IS. OBEY THE VOICE. THE PROPHET DELIVERED [screaming] THE MESSAGE. AND A LOT OF GIDEONSS out there still scared to death. Maybe I'll get a little bit. Maybe I'll I'll feed my family. But aren't you thankful that behind the message came the angel of the Lord? The angel of the Lord still here on I believe he's talking about it last was Sunday. Yeah. Angel of Lord still here. John introduced us to Christ. William Brandham introduces to Christ. The angel of the Lord is still in the building tonight. And where the angel of the Lord, there are miracles that happen. Where the angel of the Lord, there's supernatural THAT HAPPEN. WHERE THERE'S ANGEL OF THE LORD, THERE'S AN AWAKENING OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE THIS IS WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; NOW, Gideon was out there threshing his wheat, no doubt, but the prophet's message was going through his heart. What the prophet said, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac. I am the one that brought you out of Egypt. I'm the one to give you what you you've got. Turn to me." And there his father out there threshing wheat. And the angel came to him. Oh, aren't you glad the angel comes to where you're at? Aren't you glad he come right where the widow where where the um oh woman the whale he came right where she was at AND THE CONDITION YOU'RE IN DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOU. OH, let that sink in for JUST A MINUTE. YOU MIGHT BE SCARED IN CHURCH TONIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE WALKED IN HERE WITH ALL KINDS OF FEAR, BUT WHY [screaming] DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THE WORD OF THE LORD TONIGHT? THE WORD OF THE LORD IS SAYING YOU ARE A MIGHTY WARRIOR. BUT BROTHER MAN, I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE. WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO WHAT GOD IN THIS MESSAGE IS CALLING YOU TO? HE'S AWAKENING A BRIDE. HE IS BRINGING. HE IS SAYING, "COME BACK TO ME, MY PEOPLE. YOU ARE [screaming] MY INVINCIBLE ARMY." &gt;&gt; Not you will be. Now listen, we're not waiting on something. The devil will talk you into that. Well, if you just wait. If you just wait. Yeah. Brother man was 12 years old and waited. He said it was cloud cloud hung over to him and he waited to give his heart to the Lord. Wish he'd never done it. Why don't you quit waiting? Young person, why don't you quit waiting? Old person, why don't YOU QUIT WAITING? YOU KNOW, whether you got the baptism of the Holy GHOST OR NOT, QUIT ACTING LIKE IT. LET'S GET IT FOR [screaming] REAL. Come on, somebody. This ain't time to play church. Listen, listen. Have you not heard the message? Come here. Do you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Do you have the seal of God? DO YOU HAVE THE HAVE YOU NOT HEARD IT? LISTEN, LITTLE BRIDE, IT'S [screaming] TIME TO GO. IT'S TIME FOR ACTION. And he spoke to Gideon. And Gideon was a little surprised. He said, "Now, mighty man man of valor, he didn't know who he was." Now, a lot of you identify Gideon right now, don't you? You think, "Brother Matt, but why would I have this? Why would I have this problem? Do you recognize that's nothing but a devil trying to hide you back? Where's the greatest battle ever fought? And it seems so real. You guys have mind bells, right? All right. Devil good at his job. He knows how to paint a picture of you that all you can see is nothing but negative. And you can come up this far, but you can't go all the way. Well, I'm here to cut that devil's head off and say that's not who you are. You are of the ones You are of the caliber that goes all the way. You are of THE CALIBER THAT MARCHES ON. WE'RE CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. YOU ARE THE ONE THAT TOES THE LINE WITH THIS MESSAGE. YOU DON'T TRY TO WATER IT DOWN. YOU DON'T TRY TO SAY, "WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, BUT I'M GOING TO DO THIS." NO, YOU SAY WHAT HE SAID. YOU DID WHAT HE SAID. IT'S THUS, SAYETH THE LORD, SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART, AND YOU [screaming] KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. YOU PUT ACTION BEHIND IT. HE SAID, he said he didn't know who he was. Maybe you don't know who you are. You might be many of those mighty men of value tonight sitting here. You say the little church, small group. Oh my. There's only two of them here. Him and his daddy. There was only two here. You and Christ. And that's all it takes to be a mighty man of our How many thankful you've had your meeting with you in Christ? But let me ask you, you had your meeting, but have you backed off of it? It's easy to get complacent. I felt God move in church. Uhhuh. That's great. I danced. Praise the Lord. But are you taking this sword and taking some devil's heads off? This ain't just for brother Ron to do. I know he'll do it. Amen. I know brother Angel. They ain't afraid of any devil. Listen, you know what that instills in you? The same thing that's in them. It's the same God leading them and it's LETTING YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU AFRAID? WHY ARE YOU BACK DOWN? LISTEN, GIDEON, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BACK DOWN. I GAVE YOU MY WORD. NOW ACT UPON [screaming] MY WORD, 19 minutes. This message came to identify the bride. I know a lot of you even right now there's complexes in the hangover your life and you think man Matt this is so good but could it really really be me? How could I man? That'd be awesome but I'm gonna keep going church and maybe one day this is your day. Quit waiting. Your daddy said it. The last ones will be like the first. Amen. They'll get the same results. You may have come in the last hour, but this is your time to fight. Don't let the de I know there's a fight in you. Turn it back on the devil and let him have it. Come on, SAINTS OF GOD. WHY DON'T YOU GET [screaming] MAD ENOUGH OF THE DEVIL? SAY, "I AM SICK AND TIRED. SICK AND TIRED OF YOU TAKING WHAT GOD GAVE ME ON SUNDAY, WHAT GOD GAVE ME [screaming] ON SATURDAY. I AM A CHILD OF GOD AND I ACT JUST LIKE I DID ON SATURDAY AND JUST LIKE I DID ON SUNDAY, ON MONDAY, ON TUESDAY, ON WEDNESDAY, &gt;&gt; ON THURSDAY, on Friday, and wait until I get back to church again on Saturday. &gt;&gt; Come on, Warriors. So the angel of the Lord comes and says Gideon it's you Gideon in this cowardness scaredness you talking my dad me I don't see no mighty about you. I don't see anything of strength inside of me. Aren't you glad God sees what you truly are? He called him what he was and he's called you what you are. You are his bride. Amen. It's time we start acting like it. Then it's time we let the let the devil know I'm giving you notice. You get off of my property. You get off of MY LAND. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO TAKE BACK WHAT YOU'VE STOLEN FROM ME. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF IT. There's going to be somebody on the face of the earth the devil ain't going to know what to do with. I believe I'm looking at him. He's telling it to you. You are That quote was me, Brother Chris. Me, Brother Doug. The devil's scared to death you'll recognize who you are. He's scared to death that you will turn around and say, "Listen, I'm I'm preaching again. Listen, I'm gonna have we're gonna have all kinds of fights this week, but that's all right. I know my God. He said he'd never leave me nor forsake me. And I'm HERE TO TELL YOU, COME ON, LITTLE BRIDE. IT'S TIME WE BE BECOME A UNITED, INVINCIBLE ARMY. WE'RE NOT FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER. WE'RE GOING FOR ONE CAUSE, FOR ONE PLACE. LISTEN, BROTHER ANDREW PREACHING SO GOOD SATURDAY NIGHT. LET'S [screaming] UNITE TOGETHER. AND YOU WATCH US HAVE CHURCH LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN CHURCH BEFORE. &gt;&gt; I believe we've had some good church services. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, you ain't seen nothing yet. Brother Matt, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT EXPECTATION. COME ON, [screaming] WARRIORS. FIGHT THAT DEVIL BEFORE YOU GET HERE. BEAT HIM AT EVERY TURN. [screaming] WHEN YOU WALK IN THERE, YOUR EXPECTATIONS SO HIGH. And when you sit down at your pew and you recognize that guy three three uh three chairs down hasn't had so good of a week. Won't you bow your head say, "Father, you see what they have need of over there." Come on. God said he raised UP A STANDARD. IT'S RIGHT THROUGH YOUR [screaming] PRAYER. Let me go somewhere. Gideon's like, "All right, Lord. Aren't you thankful? We just don't take everything we feel." Gideon took the angel of the Lord and said, "Now wait a minute. If that be true and you're calling me who you say you are, I don't think so. But can you show me? Show me how many miracles I got in the building tonight. There you go. Devil Brother say this. I'm going to just preach it. I'm gonna go through the quotes. I got them all. You want it? I'll send it all to you. You can have it. But let said this. He says, "You got to become a miracle in order to see a miracle." You know what the greatest miracle there is? A new birth. How many's got a new birth tonight? Well, why don't you stand to your feet? Say, "It's me. I've got a new birth." HE'S IDENTIFIED IN MY LIFE. I AM BORN AGAIN, SAVED, filled with the Holy Ghost. Now, sit down. I'm not DONE YET. S. HE SAID, "I AM BORN AGAIN." [screaming] EXERCISE. You guys need some blood flow change. Some of you about ready to get a blood clot. Oh, praise the Lord. All things happen for a reason. Sounds good. Anyway, if you have a new birth, you're in possession of the greatest miracle. You're in possession of what he came for. You're in possession of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it rings down on the inside of your heart. And the devil is trying to cow you down from it and say, "You can't be that type of warrior. You can't be LIKE DAVID. BUT WHY WOULD GOD PREACH IT FROM THIS PULLPIT? TAKE YOUR WARFARE. TAKE YOUR LIKE DAVID. YOU'RE LIKE GIDEON. YOU ARE. WHAT IS HE TRYING TO IDENTIFY? HE'S AWAKENING [screaming] A WARRIOR. [sighs] I got to read this one. He says, "No, 13 minutes." He says, "Now Gideon, countdown. Now Gideon, those people there before they could see or could ever go see these miracles of God, there was a condition they had to meet. They had to meet to see the power of miracles, they had to believe. They also had to believe and obey the prophet's word to see the miracles of God. Ah, you didn't catch it. You got to believe what this prophet said. Quit watering it down and quit making excuses for yourself. Well, preach, brother man. Come on, SOMEBODY. THE BIBLE SAID, "GIVE NO EXCUSES FOR YOUR FLESH. What idol you got?" Glory. He says, "Before we can see miracles, God, we've got to obey." The prophet said, "The Bible is a prophet to us." That's right. If a man, no matter how much he calls himself God's prophet of the Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, whatever may be, whoever he calls himself, if his word isn't living in him, he isn't a prophet. He might be a prophet, but a false one. True prophets speak this true word and then put God just exactly the same God, the same power, the same word, the same everything, the true word. LET ME ASK YOU, did William, Mary, and Brandham speak the same word? &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY WAKE UP. WAKE UP. I MEAN IT FOR REAL TONIGHT. WAKE UP. [screaming] WHAT ARE YOU FOLLOWING? YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND IT'S IDENTIFYING WHO [screaming] YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; I think brother William read this a while back. He says, "We find out those people who are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is God's heroes. I pray we just tore some devils down right there. I know some of you think, "I'm just the weakest nobody." And the devil plants that seed in your head and you begin to feed that thing because you got every excuse of why you're the weakest somebody and you can't ever do any of this and you're afraid to pray over somebody. QUIT BEING AFRAID. THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE COME FOR. TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, [screaming] TO INTRODUCE YOU TO CHRIST THAT IT WOULD TAKE THE SCARE AWAY. LISTEN, what would catch this? What would Gideon say? And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I'm the least in my father's house." Well, that's me. Well, good. You're identified with Gideon. Why don't you start believing like Gideon did? Gideon was a little bit scared and he had to give a fleece out here and a fleece out here. HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THE WILL OF THE LORD. BUT GIDEON GOT TO THE PLACE WHEN GOD [screaming] SAID IT, HE JUST BELIEVED IT. WHY DON'T WE GET TO THAT PLACE TONIGHT? IF GOD SAID I'M HEALED, I'M HEALED. IF GOD [screaming] SAID I GOT THE HOLY GHOST, I GOT THE HOLY GHOST. IF GOD SAID I WAS DELIVERED, I'M DELIVERED. IF I'M FREE, I'M FREE. [screaming] BELIEVE WHAT THE WORD OF GOD SPOKE OVER YOU. IF YOU'RE A SINLESS, SPOTLESS BRIDE, THEN IDENTIFY AND WALK IN IT. DON'T CONDEMN [screaming] SOMEBODY. JUST BE THE LIGHT. Let me finish. I got nine minutes. Keep me, aren't you? I'm a little timeer right there. Gideon would begin to choose his warriors. And he would follow the war the leadership of God. And he got down to the first place. Listen, God's warriors can't be scared. Let me tell you, perfect love casts out fear. So, if you would recognize how much God actually loves you tonight, every fear would leave you. All right, reach over and grab your wife, husband's hand, child, grab your mom and dad's. How much love is representative right there? All right, you guys can hold hands. You You're brothers in Christ. It'll be all right. Guys look weird. No. set him up, didn't I? How much love is identified right here. Look at this marriage. Been through many ups and downs, many valleys, but I guarantee you right now, they love each other more than they ever loved each other. Sister Whitney, am I right? It gets sweeter as the days go by. I thought when I walked down the aisle, I'd love her more than I ever did. I held her hand the other week in Pennsylvania. I said, "Honey, I love you now more than I ever love you." And let me tell you, this bride of Jesus Christ, God loves you more now than he ever loved you. His love, I believe, is growing for you day by day by day by day. He is God and he changes not. But his love for you, it grows for you. But that maybe I'm mentioning, but I I believe if my love can grow for my wife, and that's a spiritual type. Amen. the natural types of spiritual. I believe God is saying, "All right, come away." I wish brother Donnie here. Come away, my bride. Quit being scared. But brother Matt, I've failed so many times. His grace is sufficient. His mercy endureth forever. Brother Matt, you know how many times I messed up this week? You still here? He said he never leave you nor forsake you. And I have found him to be true and faithful over and over and over again when I would have left myself. Come on, somebody. How many of you has given up on yourself? Said, "God, you should really give up on me. YOU DO. YOU KNOW ME." YES. YOU'RE A mighty warrior. YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR. I DON'T SEE YOU FOR YOUR MISTAKES. I DON'T SEE YOU FOR BEING SCARED. I SEE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE. AND YOU ARE MY PRIDE. [screaming] YOU ARE MY ARMY. AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. God's warriors don't bite idols. I already hit it way ago. If that's your idol tonight, why don't you just repent? If your idol is you, I know sticky, but just be honest with yourself. Say, Lord, I'm sorry. I've bowed to what I wanted. Lord, help me to do better. Father, I hear your voice in this end time. Father, I want to do what you want me to do. And Father, all I can say is here I am. Father, I put my hands in your hands. I put this clay in your life. Mold me and make me. Fashion me into a vessel of honor for you. Musicians come. You love him. Five minutes, honey. Good. I want you to catch this right now. This hit me the other day and I like to have a fit. I be to look at Gideon's army. and get his army ended up being 300 men, which to any rightful person looks crazy. If you took Brother Gabe, Brother Josh, Brother Alen, Brother Adam, and it was me against them, that's four against one. I'll be honest, I don't think I'd last more than three seconds. I'm a big guy, but man, I tell you what, one of them gets their hand on me, it over. You got to say, I'm into that. It's all right. I'm not that guy. But it was 300. What was What were the odds? The odds were 300 men to 135. 450 to one. You might have one word of God and you got 450 thoughts and ideas and feelings coming against it. Listen, we fight not against flesh and blood, but you got every thought coming against that one word of God. Why don't you take that one word of God and draw your sword to say, "The word is right. The word is right. This message is true. I am a warrior. I am who he said I am. I'm called to win. I'M CALLED TO OVERCOME. I'M CALLED TO be what he said I would be." Brought it down to reality. To me, so many times you think of Samson clearing a thousand men. And it's like, if we could ever see that, you see one man and a thousand set up before it. I know sometimes you have 1500 thoughts coming against the fact that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But why don't you sit there and say, "Lord, you called me. You've done this work, Father. You started this work. You'll finish this work, Father. I'm not packing down. I'm not &gt;&gt; cut your way through." How many loves him tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many's ready to fight? I did my job like a pep rally. Come on, baby. Let's go win that fight you've had at home. [music] Why don't you go win it now? Come on. You know it's going to meet you on Tuesday. You be looking for it. Say, "I got you." Say, "But man, I don't have anything to fight with." Begin to listen to these messages. [music] You got plenty to fight with. But man, I never remember it. The Bible says he'll [music] bring all things to your remembrance. Then why are you scared of when you stand against that devil? You got nothing to be scared of. In fact, that devil's already shaking his books in hell because he knows he's assigned to you on Tuesday. And he knows, you know what? if they ever TRULY GET IT. I AM DON'T WANT TO GO. You love him. Let me play. How great is [music] our God? Isn't he great? How great is our God? Oh, sing with me. How great [singing] [music] is our God and all will see how [singing] great how great is our [music] God. Sing it again. You believe it tonight. How great is [music] our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our [music] God and always see how [singing] great, how [music] great is our [singing] God. Name above all names. He's the name above all names.

How [singing] great is our God. And all will [music] see how great how great our [music and singing] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's pray together. Maybe tonight you're you still think, "Well, brother Matt, that's good, but how could it be me?" Say, "Father, won't you pass by my way? Won't you vindicate to me, Father, over and over again, I am who you said I am. Father, Lord, you see the hands that are raised, Father. God, I pray for each one of us now, Father. God, I pray that you'd pass by our way, God. God, that you'd make this so real to us, Father, that we'd identify who we are, Father. God, not we will be, but right now who we are. Father, you've called us to this, Father. We didn't call oursel, Father, but God, you made us, Lord. You've pressurized us, Father, to be able to handle it, Father. So, Father, I pray right now. Touch each one. Let it become real, Lord. I pray let their eyes come open. May they see the workings of the devil, how he works in their life, how he tries to bring them down, Father. And may they not just see that, but God, may they take their sword. May they take this message, Father, and may they begin to cut through, Lord God, into liberty, [music] into freedom, Lord God. May they come into a unity with you, Father. God, that they would be with you alone, Father, ministering to their needs. Lord, we love you tonight. Bless each one. Jesus [music] name. Amen. The earth [music] rejoice. He wraps himself with light and darkness [music] tries to hide. And truth and [music] more truth and how great [music and singing] our God. Oh, sing with me.

And all will see how [singing] great, how [music] great is our God. God is God. Well, he's God in the Father. He's God [music and singing] in the Son. He's God in the Holy Ghost. He's [music] got all three in one. [singing] And I know God is God [music] and he don't ever change. I know God is God [music and singing] and Jesus is his name. He's God in the Father.
