when you come father Lord you begin to take us into our higher realm and lift us into a place father that only your presence can take us father Lord we have stood here before we've been in this place before but God we're not standing in the same position as we were last weekend father we've grown more in you we've we've studied the message we've listened father we' we've tried to hear the very voice of God speaking to us and father we're standing in a higher place as Believers seated here tonight and I pray father that as brother and brother sister to sister all throughout this body Lord I pray the pillar of fire would move through this congregation just now and meet every single one of these needs father Lord some spoken requests some unspoken some natural things some spiritual things but I believe God that you're the god that created the universe father and there's nothing too big for you and there's nothing too small for you and I recognize that you're the god that created everything and it's in your control right now Lord and I pray God that you would begin to minister to us as your children father may you take us down the road of emus tonight walk with us talk with us father but may we not fail to recognize who you are Lord I pray that you would do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and believe these things in your name amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to take a look over in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 and verse three Revelations chap 1 and verse three just one scripture here and then we're going to let you have your seats and have a little bit of a lengthy scripture reading but I don't want to I don't want to keep you standing too long so we'll just we'll just read this one portion of scripture here in Revelations how many loves the word of the Lord amen amen amen the joy of the Lord is our strength and his word is what we feed upon amen Revelations 1 and verse3 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the time is at hand may God richly bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord I would like to take a thought tonight on on something that the Lord's been dealing with me on um ever since last last weekend and so I'd like to take a thought tonight and speak to you on the weight is over the weight is over brother brandham says to us here in the exposition of the seven Church ages he said the time is at hand reading here from Revelations 1 and 3 he said the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of God he he said this Mighty Revelation through though fully known to God could not come forth hitherto thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time we know that that makes very good sense to us is that right we know that we can't preach Noah's message today is that right look at the history of Israel the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of History and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age Le Osan the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today and we begin to think about these things about how that God has been holding all of these Revelations and to think that where we are in the church age of this layout of seean church age that we recognize that God has been waiting on you and I he's been waiting on this time for you and I to get here and recognizing that there is a fullness of this age and it's not going to go out unless there's a people that are going to overcome this lotan age so let us turn to Joshua chapter 3 here this evening very lengthy but we'll just just bear with us this evening don't get lost don't get lost in sight here but the Bible says here that Joshua rose up early in the morning and they removed they removed from sham and came to Jordan and he and all the children of Israel lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after 3 days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest and the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after after it yet there shall be a space between you and 2,000 cubits by measure it's about 3,500 ft if you study it out you'll you'll see that it's almost about 10 football fields long is the distance that was to stay between them and the Ark of the Covenant it says the come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you've not passed by this way hitherto hitherto for and Joshua said un the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders amongst you and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and Passover before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all of Israel they that they might know that to think that God already knew this and Joshua's already had conversations with God about this but God God is getting ready to show to all the children of Israel that that God that the God that was with Moses is the god that was with Joshua and to think that Joshua is Joshua is Moses's predecessor here you got to think about Moses's Ministry of all the great all the great Ministries and all the great Miracles that would happen in Moses's Ministry Moses is nobody that necessarily that that the next guy wants to follow in line because he he's got a great ministry but Joshua is the man that go has chosen unto him you've got to think that J that Moses was a man that was he was doing his greatest miracles in his 80s and you think that maybe when you get over 80 years old you think you're kind of out of the out of out of the system of God but Moses was doing his greatest and most prolific Miracles when he got above 80 years old so you're never too old for the promises of God but here Joshua is is commanded that God is going to be with them and he said from this day I will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they might know that that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and thou Thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when you are come to the brink of the Waters of the Jordan you shall stand still in Jordan and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither hear the words of the Lord your God and and Joshua said hereby you shall know that the Living God is amongst you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites the Hittites the hivites the pites the jurgos sites the amorites the jebusites behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passes over before you in the Jordan now therefore take ye 12 men of the tribes of Israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass that as soon as the souls of the feet of the priesthood that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and it came to pass that when the people removed their tents to pass over Jordan and the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they they that bear the ark were come into Jordan and the feet of the priests that be the ark were dipped into the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all the Brinks all the banks all the time all its banks all the time of harvest so we recognize where they're living at they were in the they were living in the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood up Rose up as a heap very far from the city of a Adam that is beside zaratan and those that came down towards the sea plane even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over over right against Jericho and the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan and all the Israelites passed over onto dry ground until all the people were passed over clean over Jordan to think that there we we're watching that that children that the children of Israel were in a time of transition that they were getting ready to leave the old lands of Egypt completely behind them that they were in a spot of translation that God was literally carrying them over by a miracle he was carrying them over into the promises of God and to think about that the whole Plan of Redemption to think about it and place it into view just for a moment it's a very powerful and it's a very beautiful thing when you begin to put the whole Plan of Redemption as we see here you begin to reflect upon this and you think about that this has been waited for for so long that this this promise that was given unto Abraham was promised unto him when he was in a Strange Land he he was he was coming out he was coming out from things that he that he grew up knowing but to think that this promise had been waiting until the children of Israel had got to their full position in their inheritance you think about the things that happened ever since the time that God made that promise unto Abraham that from that time Abraham had met MDC from that time Abraham actually lied to a king and you watch as Isaac actually falls into the same cycle because he didn't break it he fell into the same cycle and did the same exact thing with his wife from that time that God made a promise unto Abraham there you find that Jacob he lied he was a he was a robber he was a cheater he was a Shyer but yet you find that in those same times that in all of those times that it was a time that Jacob actually be to wrestle with the angel of the Lord and to think from that time until Jacob is wrestling with the angel of the Lord It's been 220 years since the promise has been made from that time that Abraham has given that promise Joseph that is known as a man that is a prophet as a Seer he has he has dreams he has visions and he's and he's raised up and he sees a vision of of him raised up before his brothers then notice that Joseph goes from the pit to the very vice president of Egypt to think that God has all of this in the part of his mind that God is going to bring about something that is going to do a part in his Redemptive plants to think that that Joseph was a man was a man that was exactly almost exactly like Christ but he he moved and saved an entire nation by the leadership of the Lord during that time all throughout that time Moses Moses is raised right there in Pharaoh's house he goes outside of Pharaoh's house goes on the backside of a desert meets a pillar of fire and be became the deliverer that is going to lead the children of Israel right out so from the time that Abraham has given this promise until this day that they're getting ready to walk into walk into their promise it's been over 600 years it's been over 600 years from the time that it was spoken to the time that it was getting ready to be fulfilled I don't know that sometimes that we miss what is really happening or what is going on but I would say that that reality was setting in to them as soon as they stepped into the waters that day that the things that that that had laid out there in front of them in the promised land that I'd have to say that they would have to recognize when they were watching this miracle they would have to say we're in a moment we're in a moment we've never seen anything like this before we've never noticed anything like this before because you've got to think about this aspect of it all the old Fighters have done gone all the old gener generation has done gone away and they ain't never seen anything quite like this but they were in a moment because we don't completely do away with our Traditions is that right we don't completely do away with our Traditions there was stories about God doing those things there was stories about God parting the Red Sea but they were getting ready to witness the god that made the promise to Abraham you ever been in one of those spots where it's it's you know that God is said something to you and you know that God has promised you something and all of a sudden you're right in the middle of it and you're right in the middle of the vision you're right and all of a sudden reality starts setting in brother bam said that when God when God speaks anything he forces it to its place he literally forces it to its place you think that when Daniel was raised up in the time of Babylon to think that he was only there with only three other believers but God had raised Daniel up into such a spot that he was going to raise him up to be a witness to be a witness and God literally forced Daniel to the spot that I'm not going to allow some man to make some image of you and make some man-made worship but God literally pushed Daniel to a spot he was waiting at that spot to see what Daniel was going to do about it because everybody was asking for man worship but Daniel Daniel refused man worship and he literally got into such a time he was waiting God was waiting on Daniel to get to a spot and Daniel recognized he was in a moment he recognized he was in a moment and he literally throw up the windows like he' done every single day before Daniel was in that moment but God protected his Prophet all throughout those years of Babylon he was God to him before and he was going to be God to him after so Daniel was able to worship when men did not want him worshiping because God was his protector but God literally forced Daniel into this position now we know that throughout the Bible that God has always had Junctions that there's always Junctions in time that literally what it is it's a crossover that's what a junction is it's a change over in the road it's a it's a blending of rows that come together that they had been waiting since the time of Abraham but now the vision is literally being crossed over that they're in a blending of of Dimensions or a blending of Junctions that they were coming to a spot and I want to I just want to make this precedent here tonight don't fail to recognize where we are as the Church of the Living God don't fail to recognize who you are as a church or as a as a son and daughter of God don't fail to recognize what God has deposited what God has given what God has allowed you to see because you see they had been waiting on it for so long and when they were in the moment when they were in the moment that's where unbelievers Miss what's happening but real Believers recognize when they're in that moment you've waited for so long you've asked for it for so long they waited for the Messiah but the Bible said in John 1:45 that when Phillip found the anel said we have found him the ones the prophets had talked about the ones that everybody Moses talked about we found him we found him and he turns around he turns around and looks onto him and said before Phillip called you I saw you sitting underneath your fig tree I saw you sitting there it's amazing thing to know to recognize that you can find yourself at the same time that God finds you I'm going to shout by myself and preach by myself tonight but it's an amazing thing to know that you can find yourself and find the Messiah at the very same time I was one way I was on a road I was sitting underneath a tree and I thought that God had left me and I thought that God had failed me but he found me he found me where I was he ain't leaving you where you're sitting at he ain't leaving you in your failures he ain't leaving you sitting out there depending on a drug by a needle he's not leaving you out there depending upon yourself he's not leaving you out there wondering if you're going to make it or not come on somebody if they had only found the Messiah and the Messiah left them the way they were he was not worth following but they found something they found something that prophecy had locked itself into this little woman by the name of Mary and It produced Jesus and they found something in Jesus that they'd been looking for let me tell you something there was something locked up on the inside of the body of Jesus Christ this bride that she'd been looking for and she found him she found him just like it says in this day in Luke 17 and3 that in the days that in the last days of the son of man it shall be thus as it is in the days of the revealing of the son of man we know where we are we know where we're standing at let me tell you something let me tell you Wesley could have never fulfilled that because it wasn't his portion Luther could have never fulfilled that because it wasn't his portion because they were not at that spot of their Journey they were not there but they were waiting for it they were waiting for it they were waiting for somebody to release the seals let me say that when Paul was standing there and he was preaching to the First Corinthians church and speaking to the Thessalonian church he literally locked up the prophecies for this hour so God has spoke in Amos chapter 3 that surely Our God will do nothing unless he reveals it to the prophets so Paul literally locked up or he held those cab he held those truth there so we know that it's got to take a profit to go in there and unlock those things those Hidden Truths it would take a [Music] prophet Luther was looking for it but he died out and they they denominational lied his church Wesley looked for it but he died and they reformed his church Pentecost looked for it and they denominated and they built a box around it but God found a lady God found found a lady and I want to announce to you as Heaven has announced it the wait is over the message is here the seals have been released thus shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of [Applause] man it was news it was news in the 60s 65 70 early ' 80s that God sent a prophet there're still some that don't recognize that God has sent a prophet but if they're predestinated to it they'll come to it but I don't have to stand here and preach to you that God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet the message has produced more than God sent a prophet the message has produced that you are an offspring of almighty God we know where we are we know exactly where we're standing at we're in a time of transition let me tell you this whole world is not my home I'm not happy here I enjoy the presence of the Lord I enjoy worshiping him I enjoy feeling his presence but I get so sick and tired of leaving it I get so sick and tired of coming back down to myself and the anointing rolling off we're just humans we can't handle it no more but one of these mornings between the hours of 6 and N God is going to say the wait is over let me say that all the six ages had looked for it they' look for it but they died they looked for it but they died but the seventh one which is Enoch that one was translated he was caught up let me tell you Enoch means dedicated and Enoch was dedicated to his walk he walked whether people criticized him or not but he had found such a spot where he was walking with King theoy that he would walk with him he would talk with him and God found so much favor in Enoch that he could not leave him there I'll say that God has found such favor in the Church of the Living God that he's going to translate you just like he translated Enoch but it won't be just one man it won't be just William brandom it won't just be Tim puit it won't just be Ron Spencer it'll be a universal body and when we get there brother Chris when we get in that moment that we've longed for that we beli for when we look over there and we see our loved ones the wait is over the weit is over Hallelujah the Bible said in Revelations 10: 6 and I and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things therein and the earth and the things therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so what is God saying unto us that the days of holding back of all the Mysteries are over we waited for this it's not that time shall be no more there's coming an end of time but but this is the hour of the mighty Angel Christ standing up there has been been many descendingsort days of holding back are over the days of a body without Authority are over the days of Miracles are not over but the days of saying that Miracles are over that day is over I could give testimony after testimony to anybody that wants to say the days of Miracles are passed and those days are over just let me take you back one weekend and I can show you Miracle after miracle Miracle but I want to say and announce to you that God ain't done [Applause] yet what is it it's exactly in line with Ezekiel is exactly in line with Ezekiel chapter 3 when God speaks to the prophet and tells him go out there and eat the scroll eat the scroll and go out there and prophesy to the house of Israel what was it that the prophet and the scroll had became one let me say this to you that Christ and God were one but God now has a body God now has a body that he can lay his head down on it not he's now got a body that he can fully trust and now she has ate this word she's fed on this word it ain't just books and tapes to her it ain't just pictures to her she's ate this word she's became this word she's ate it what is it we are living right here in the hour of the third pole Ministry that when he shall begin to sound forth his ministry or the mystery that the days of God shall be finished we are living right here in the hour of the third pool there was a lot of people that connected themselves to Jesus his first Ministry of Healing The Sick they were happy to stand there when he was standing there and he would raise he would raise the dead but when Jesus would stand there and said I am my father are one that's something different they didn't want no part with that they crucified him over it that's why that this generation is crucifying Christ again is because God has now found a body that God is saying the weight is over I have found her she is a virtuous wife she is a clean woman she is pure she is spotless it was not at the beginning of Ministry of the first and second pole but it was at the third pole that when Jesus begin to say those things that there begin to be a separation that's what Jesus was living for to whom will we go Lord there going to be people that walk away from you there's going to be people that walk away from maybe this ministry but they're not walking away from me and they're not walking away from you they're walking away from King Jesus God's got a body he's happy with her he loves her he can commune with her he's speaking to her she recognizes who she is in him you see it's like Ezekiel Dry Bones over there in Ezekiel 27:37 I believe you'll find that Ezekiel was standing right there and God begins to speak to him said Can these live again and Ezekiel starts talking back to him said thou knowest Lord he said then prophesy to it prophesy to it and there he begin to prophesy over those dry bones and skin and senu and flesh begin to come upon them but there's still nothing there you see that's why William Brandon would say in the church age book that a Beed corpse is nothing but a corpse you can dress it up you can dll it up you can paint PT it up but it's still a corpse that's why you can paint all these churches around here forgive me Lord Jesus forgive me little people down here but you can D all these denominations up but without Christ in them they're nothing but a [Music] corpse it can look the part it can have the body features of the part what you're looking at is mechanics without Dynamics but there came a prophecy prophesy to the wind son of man what happened and he breathed the very Breath of Life what is it William Brandon would say it in this day he said that it'll be that Pentecostal fire that'll Rapture her up I know there's a lot of people that's ashamed of Pentecostal fire but I'm not ashamed of it because a prophet said that it would be Pentecostal fire that would Rapture her up what was it it was in its position it was standing it had all the muscles it looked the part but it didn't have no life let me tell you young people if you've not been born again you're the same way that ezekiel's dry bones were without breath but let the wind of the Holy Ghost come breathe over your life wash away your sin Purge your life be born a new who can tell where the wind comes from and where the winds goes it's like the spirit of almighty God he might deal with you in this service but he might deal with you in your car I'm not putting God in a box I'm not saying that God's got to do it this way but I will say that where the spirit is there will the Eagles be gathered hallelujah hallelujah notice a during this is powerful that during the 40 Years of wandering in the desert they're entering into to the promised land with a deep yearning within their souls this new generation that God's raising up and day after day they've dreamed about this they've dreamed about New Life in the promised land they've dreamed about it thought about it what's it going to be like how's it going to how's the how's the grapes going to taste over there if we've tasted it on this side what's it going to be like over there they dreamed about it they thought about it they they prayed about it they've asked they've waited now they're coming into it all them days and years of wandering watching the old Fighters die off it begin to be begin more of a reality the push to get in was real they weren't playing Church no more they weren't standing back and wondering am I it or not let me say this to you when Paul would say that we are now seated in Heavenly places that's a believer's position in Christ Jesus your days of wanding are over of sitting there and saying am I a Son of God or am I a daughter of God do I have the Holy Ghost is healing for me is Deliverance for me let me say when you are seated in this position that only an overcomer can set in that days of wondering are over come on somebody you know you know you've been born again somebody tell my mom somebody tell my mama she didn't have me somebody tell me I'm not alive somebody tell me I don't have skin on my flesh somebody tell me somebody tell me that I'm dead how can you tell me I'm dead how can you tell me that the message is wrong how can you tell me that the Holy Ghost is not working anymore how can it do it I might be a crazy man but I believe this message try to tell me that God that was with William brandom can't do the same thing when I watch him in my life you can't tell me I've ain't been born you can't tell me that God don't heal cancer Hallelujah you can't tell me why brother Andrew the days of waiting are over we waited for this moment but we're stepping into it they say oh I I can't live that message brother Andrew I can't live that message brother Andrew if I live that message I I'll miss out on a good time I miss out on parties I miss out on my friends let me tell you what this message will do for you you'll miss out on on the tribulation this message will make you miss out the tribulation it'll make you miss out on heartaches it'll make you miss out on headaches it'll make you Hallelujah let me tell you something everything you have need of is Jesus let me miss out on the parties let me miss out on the things of the world but don't let me Miss King Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] him days are over him Days Are Over the days of wondering if he's the same yesterday today and forever it's over that's why Georgie Carter had been sitting there for nine years in this condition but when she heard about a man named William brand and she read a book that God was doing the same thing that he did back there in the days of the Bible she said my days are waiting over it's over come on Georgie it's time you get up out of your bed rise up out of your bed start leaping for Joy start bringing back a worship Hallelujah what it Israelites were getting ready to move into their full benefits because they got a land out there that has to be inherited they had to dispossess to inherit let me bring you into this picture just for a minute they've been camping and them for three days they're right there on the banks of the Jordan they're having a camping party and they're watching one of the greatest floods that the Jordan Valley has ever seen that's a paradox to me how them two spies got over there one chapter before as a paradox that's left up to God but you think about this they've been camping down there by this Jordan and we know that Jordan it means death is that right Jordan is a sign of death but this is this this place of Jordan it's it's a very prominent location in the Scriptures it was here that non dipped in the water and he was healed of leprosy it was here that Elijah was standing out there and he began to make made an axe Head Start begin floating out there in that water it was here at the Jordan rivers that Elijah and Elisha walked over on dry ground because they smoked the waters and they walked over the Jordan River going and coming so he's a god that can come through and he's a God that can get you through but it was at this spot that John the Baptist buils his builds his ministry right here on the banks of the Jordan River John the Baptist cave is just right Beyond this this Bank of Jordan it was at this spot that John is standing there and he says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world it was at this spot this position this place this heavenly spot that Jesus starts his ministry it's at this spot notice that that's where he started at but notice when Christ came he was the Seed of Abraham but he wasn't no not necessarily that in his body but he was that of faith of Abraham he wasn't that of he wasn't that of Abraham's body but he was that of Abraham's faith that he that he believed the word of God no matter what I think amaz amazing tonight that that Paul would say unto us that you are the children of Abraham by faith that no matter how ridiculous it may seem you still believe it doesn't matter how how how how big the obstacles are you still believe no matter how ridiculous it makes you look to the outside world of waiting on a baby but when they met MDC what was the story the waiting is over but here he wasn't just Isaac but this was the royal Seed of Abraham right here in a very Junction of time we know that William Brandon would tell us he would tell us in a junction of time he said to every Junction Angels appear prophets arise Miracles are done right there right there at the junction because we Rec recognize that Miracles are happening because there is a prophetic moment that we're standing in you see brother random would also tell us that two omnipotence when they meet the miraculous has got to take place what is it it's an omnipotence of God and your faith your omnipotent Faith what is it how are you Abraham seed not by body but by faith you see faith comes by hearing of the word of God faith is never built upon sympathy faith never comes through discussing with people their pains or their aches or their weaknesses or their sicknesses but faith is born when we hear the very word of God and Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and he is the truth is that right so it's our time as Sons and Daughters of God to stand right here and to declare war on every form of sickness every demon every High thing and take authority over it every form of demon power not through our bodies but through faith in the Son of God you've been camping around this and you've been looking at that trouble but I want to announce to you you've got faith to conquer the flood you've got faith to conquer the flood the old generation has done watch some miracle like this happened before but Joshua and Caleb's only one has watched it but here's a new generation a new generation that's raising up the old generation watched God part the Red Sea and walk over on dry ground but God was raising up a new generation and he was saying unto them that I'm the same yesterday today and forever that the God that was with Moses is the god that is with Joshua it's one thing it's one thing to get a couple soldiers across here go spy out the land but it's another thing to stand out there and watch a million people crossing with belongings with their Ox with their livestock and all those things they're right there in the time of harvest they're right there in that moment maybe you show those pictures for us is as you as you see here this is what you're looking at is what you're looking from above of what what Israel was getting ready to cross this is what it typically looks like it's it's Jordan Jordan what we see it we would call it a creek is what we would typically call that here but you've got to think about thousands of years ago and as man progressed they begin to learn about how they could wash the sand and get rid of the sea get rid of the salt in it so they would take Waters from it so it condensed down the size of the Jordan River and men would begin to progress it so the Jordan River What would we see now was much bigger back in the days of Joshua but when Joshua is standing there they're camping on the side of sidom and there you watch that the baptismal it's highly thought that the baptismal sight of Jesus and the crossing sight of Israel is at the same location there you can see it just right outside of gilgal there's Jericho just right past it but to think that they were in this spot in a time of harvest that when God comes down to prove himself that he's God he he not just going to stand there and just let you walk over a creek to prove that he's God but God allows major circumstances to come so that he can prove that he's God next picture if you don't mind as you see as you see here I you forgive me I ain't too much of a slideshow kind of dude but just felt this is probably the best way to show it to you so here they are they're camping up here and them and they're standing there and they're camping here for three days and they're looking there and when Joshua begins to speak to them and tells him said now look we're going to send the Ark of the Covenant out in front of you by 3,500 ft the iffel tower is only about a th000 ft so that the Ark of the Covenant is going about three times past what the Eiffel Tower looks at because God wanted to make sure that they didn't lose sight of the word how bad things were down there in Lea so we put it so far out there in front of them so that they could see it so they're back there camping at sh them but the Ark of the Covenant is moving on and when the priest step into the waters the waters begin to part the waters too the Dead Sea are now cut off but everything all the way up to the city of Adam begins to be put on hold and God begins to build it up he begins to build it up and it is said by the banks that the water actually crested or showed that it was 100 to 120 ft standing in the air as soon as they step into it as soon as they step into it let me say this to you Church you don't have to worry when the word of God steps into your situation he will make the enemy stop where he's at all now you can imagine everybody up there zaran in the city of Adam saying what is going on down there close to gilgal and the people down at the Dead Sea said man we was having a good time fishing down here but all of a sudden the waters dried up but God literally stopped the waters made the men of God stand right there where the water was where the truck trouble was where the fear was and he made them to cross over it it's two miles two miles of water that they're walking past when you when you're in this position when you and you're in this position and you look over and there's a 100 to 120 ft of water looking at you don't tell me that he can't do it when I look over there and I see cancer bound don't tell me he can't do it when I look over there and I see tuberculosis bound don't tell me he can't do it when I look over there and I see Congressman Upshaw don't tell me he can't do it I look over there and two miles two miles of this you got two miles of testimonies you got two miles of this you don't have to worry about if God's a bridge builder or not he's still Jehovah Gyra he's the god that can provide away so if he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa if he is Jehovah Rafa he's Jehovah madash that is my righteousness if he's Jehovah madash he's Jehovah tiu he's Jehovah ni hallelujah what are we looking at extreme events call for extreme beliefs but Extreme beliefs causes extreme miracles Jordan you're nothing to almighty God the Bible said in Isaiah 52 and12 that for you shall not go out with haste nor go nor go by flight for the Lord will go before you and the god of Israel will be your reward so he's before you and he's behind you brother man said that when them two spies came back when when them two spies came back and they got to testifying of what Jericho thought about them what Jericho thought about how that they went down there won the battle they' heard about it and Rahab had brought up this brought up this report brother Baron said that Joshua was standing there as he's hearing these reports he's standing there and he's whirling his swirled his sword around he's standing there whirling his sword around said glory to God he's before us glory to God he's before us us so Joshua knew that the report of the Lord had already got to the enemy you might believe the report but God makes sure that your enemy is going to believe the report let me tell you there's an announcement in hell I'm losing this one I'm losing that one the wait is over Hallelujah [Applause] he thought he had you sister Melissa but God rich in Mercy he lost that one let me tell you something right now Satan is losing our prodical right now the waiting is over we prayed for it we have not because we ask not but we've asked we believed glory to God if he can part the Jordan Waters surely he can make a way for you in the middle of a desert if an 80-year old man could walk through a desert and produce Miracles how about some young people that's filled by the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost I just preached a message brother Andrew that's what I'm preaching it's time to cross cross over it's time to pass on past your beliefs P what you think God is able to do cross over that cross over that the word Hebrew means to cross over cross over Abraham had to cross over he come out of Babylon he had to cross over from the multiplicity of Gods to the one true God he had to Passover of leaving his family he had to cross over that the children of Israel had to cross over Red Sea they had to cross over it the children of Israel had to cross over the Jordan Rivers they had to cross over it it's time that you cross over from sickness to health it's time that you cross over from ashes to Beauty it's time that you cross over from bitterness to forgiveness it's time that you pass over from mourning to laughter it's time that you cross over from Fear to Faith I don't know if it's time yet let me tell you it's time because the time is at hand and it's time that you cross over from jealousy to love the time is here right now the baptism of the Holy Ghost moves through the city again it's time for Sinners to repent it's time for backsliders to get right with God it's time for a cleaning up in the church it's a time for signs that God showed everybody waited on their sign the signs of Mark 16 is being fulfilled David waited for a sign he heard he waited he waited to start then all at once he heard the mberry bushes are rattling he know that God was going before him brother the time is come when the Pentecostal mberry bushes is being shook again Hallelujah by the outpouring of the Holy Ghost like it fell on the days of Pentecost that rushan Mighty Wind that came down from heaven the time is [Applause] come Hallelujah if there's ever a time it's time if there ever a time to clean up it's time I'm afraid to cross over when you cross over it's a sign you're in Victory don't tell me you're not able to do it cuz I'll put you on a wagon and I'll take you across this don't tell me he ain't God cuz I'll put you I'll put you right in here in the midst of The Oxen I'll put you right in the midst of the children that do believe in this new generation that do believe that God still gives the holy ghost that still believes it's the best time in the world it's the best time in the world to be living there ain't no other time like his time sister Gabrielle because a prophet said if I could have chose any time to be living I'd have chose this time well let me tell you it's a time of our [Applause] life hallelujah hallelujah brother brandom said I he said we sent some brothers over to Israel he said I got the film back from it he said they went down there to the banks of the Jordan River he said they got down there he said they got down there seen where Jesus was baptized he said they got the shouting and got the screaming and running down he said they like to tore up all the bushes down there in the banks of the Jordan just beginning to recognize that's where Jesus was baptized and he said all of them got re-baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ because they saw where Jesus was baptized at now if it'll make men do that what about when you see your name in the Lamb's Book of Life old buddy Robinson was going old buddy Robinson was going around he was going through the through the through the Israel there and taking down the journey he was going down the journey down through air and he was riding in the old model te forward and going down through and they were showing them where the children of Israel had left Egypt how that they went over this way and went over that way how that they SM how Moses smok The Rock and the water came forth and old buddy Robinson said let me out the car I done had enough he said he went around that car around and around and around it reminds me about a prophet that was standing up there on a mountain walking around a tree praising God I hav seen enough of this Holy Ghost to still believe that God can do it for anybody let me out if you don't want me in the car but I done seen too much to not believe it let me out let me out Hallelujah hallelu every devil in hell has lost its power it's over it's over don't tell me I didn't seen him heal cancer of the eye don't tell me he can't do it throughout the whole body I didn't seen him raise up Enoch I didn't seen him raise up Elijah Don't tell me he can't take you up Hallelujah it's time it's time it's time you're in it you ain't got to wait on somebody else put you in the water you're in it you're in this thing stop

tonight whether you want to get in it or not there's somebody that's willing to put you in it I tell you what we need we need some old Herald chiplets back in the house of God when people were scared to go swimming Harold would pick them up and throw them right there in the water TJ learned how to swim that way I say what we need is some spiritual baptizer again where people that are scared to get so drunk on the holy ghost that somebody Picks Them Up by prayer and throws them right over there in the land of the Holy Ghost well that's way out there oh no it ain't I had a mom and I had a daddy and I had a church that still believed when I didn't believe and they asked when I wasn't asking I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way where you going I'm going to prodical land and I'm bringing back all of them come on David come on David you done heard the sound of the Mulberry Tree you done heard the Holy Ghost why don't you go ahead and destroy the [Applause] Philistine crossover where we at where we at as a body of Jesus Christ BL barus waited for this moment but he was in Translation time brother I found this today brother BR said said that barname was sitting there he said my mama told me about the God that did those things how that just about 500 ft down there that's where Joshua was standing and he saw the angel of the Lord with the sword in his hand he said if I could have lived in that day I could have met him remember said that blind b m was sitting there on a rock said sitting there on a rock and he said you know what he said I'm sitting on this rock he said that a couple hundred years ago was sitting on the top of that wall up there in Jericho he said if he could do it then surely he can come by then all of a sudden he heard a word said Jesus of Nazareth is passing by this way and his days of blindness was over you walked in darkness for so long but now you are enlightened to the truth we're in a time of translation church that the only translation that can be done from Earth to glory is through Jesus Christ he's the only translation only way to be translated he said you can't buy it you can't work for it you got to receive it it's a gift of God God's translation is to take you now notice what the Bible said here in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them shall not hinder them is what brother br said the message Rapture he said will not hinder them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now the word rapture is not even in the Bible in the English language it's not even in there but the English Language by English language we put that word rapture right there and we shall remain shall be caught up that word caught up it means to seize it means to catch away it means to pluck it means to pull or to take up by force but the word rapture is a Latin word which comes from the word Raptor which is like an eagle or an opre that begins to swoop down and begins to snatch up it begins to snatch up so notice that that this is the rapture that this catching away it's like a thief coming in the middle of the night he's not going to let anybody else know what he's doing he's not going to announce it to the neighborhood I'm coming to rob you but such as a thief in the night the Lord shall come and literally snatch like a eagle anointing come in and snatch you up let me say it to you this eag anointing has found its position in the body of Jesus Christ and it's this Vindicated message that has literally snatched you away from the devil he snatched you away spiritually from the devil when the devil tried to rob you and steal your identity he snatched you away from the devil but one of these mornings he's going to snatch you away physically Satan wants you to miss this Rapture he wants you to miss this Rapture because even while William brandham is preaching a Rapture in 1965 you hear him on tape he said there's a lady back here trying to get me to stop she's back there waving her hand what was it Satan was trying to stop a Rapture message what was it it's a woman a woman literally kicked William brandham out what is it this church this church world this Catholicism is kicking this Bri out we're not welcome here no more but so riddens goodbye this message has been Vindicated this message called my name I know there's a lot of people that say that it called him a buzzard but he called me an eagle this message is Thoroughly Vindicated and William Bram is a Vindicated Prophet but Sam you're Vindicated you're Vindicated that the god of William brandom is your god Samuel what is it it's the lord it's Christ that has descended notice brother Brandon when he comes and I I'm trying to bring us down I'm sorry if I've went too far for you my brother random said that when he descends he does all three one time Trump the shout and it becomes and he begins to come down and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump and all of it it all happens at once now notice what you see in Revelation aans chapter 10 that's not Jesus that's Christ up there that's Christ up there what is it it is his descending what is it the shout is a message the voice is the wakening up of the sleeping bride but the trumpet is the Gathering the trumpet is the rapture what is it it's the shout it's the shout that wakes up the sleeping body what is it he's descended many of times but this time he's coming and he's bringing the people with him and when he see when you go it's a signal to Israel that she's receiving her two prophets that the same Angel anointing will be on those prophets what is it it's the shout it's a shout that is a third pole the shout is the third pole it's the Vindication of the message what is it first pole didn't get you the second pole didn't get you but this third pole this vindicat ation he said we become a part of all of this before that time of rapture comes he said before the catching up of that Rapture he said we became a part of it before that time now notice brother random says some very powerful things here and how can I overcome he said now at the coming of Christ of the Lord Jesus Christ he said those who are really loving his coming that's living for it when he appears in the sky the church that's dead in Christ shall rise and those those will be changed in a moment he said the rest of them won't know nothing about it he said remember he appeared to those in the city see he said the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other and we'll see them and the rest of the world W see them it'll be cut away as a secret going he said a waiting for that time but when when God gives us when God sets us in order when God gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost when God give us the best that he got he gave us an atomic weapon that brother brandom said that it is that Atomic weapon that will sweep us all the way from Eden right into the Rapture of the Lord that it's this message that Satan does not know what to do with that literally will sweep us will literally sweep us right into the Rapture now when William brand was up there he's up there and up he's up there in Sportsman Hollow and you can hear Brother B talk about this in my new ministry and he starts talking about there there I was he said I was up there and he said and he said I was I was up there and I was thinking on those things Mark 1122 23 have faith in God for whatsoever things you ask believe that you shall receive them he said I was up there he said and all of a sudden he said a super anointing come whirling down through them trees I said what do you have need of ask and it shall be given he said it was a super anointing that comes sweeping through there he comes sweeping down through there he said there I am and I'm back there I'm back there sitting with had rod and he said I'm simply telling these things or testifying of what God did and he said all of a sudden when had he said that's nothing but the truth he said that super anointing comes sweeping through there and said the angel of the Lord said tell her that she's found favor with God Almighty said give her whatever she asked for he said it comes sweeping he said it comes sweeping through the room what was it the third pole was sweeping over the human body for the very first time he said it come sweeping down through and brother bam brother bam said that when somebody asked him on on the Rapture said now is the bride all going to have to be in one spot are they all going to have to be in one spot for the Rapture to go and said absolutely not he said absolutely not he said you don't have to be buried down

come yet musicians but he's walking down there brother brandom said that Elijah knew that the day was his last day brother Bram said this he said Elijah knew that them horses was down there waiting on him said he knew that there was down there waiting on him said when he smoked the waters he knew they was down there waiting on him and when he got there on the other side he said my ministry here is over and he said he literally took up one of them horses and flew off on a chariot of fire brother Baron said he said I he said I seen him not too long ago he said he said when my old horse my old horse Prince he said come over and put his head on my shoulder and he started nickering he said I saw him on that side he said I saw him on that side he said one of these days he said when my Ministry is over he said one of these days he said Prince will be down there waiting at the river he said he'll be down there waiting at the river and he said when it's over he said I'll step in on Prince on my Chariot and I'll ride away to Glory when it's all over I'll say this that he knows what are you going to do Rebecca when the sound of freedom when he looks over when you look over there and Freedom's leading you right there in the Chariot of fire what's he going to do for you it's too carnal for me brother angrew let me tell you it's a prophet's word I can take a prophet's word a't never left me wrong never left me wrong Elisha knew that it was coming to the en closing of his ministry let me tell you I know that we're coming to the close of this because we see the handwriting on the wall the light is changing us the light is physically moving over our bodies don't you be afraid of it don't you be afraid of it just step into it one time just step right into it I know it's dark I know it's dark but there's a man that can turn the light on I know you got a lot to fear and I know there's a lot of things that could cause you to worry about things but don't fear there's a man here that can turn on the light you don't know how to do it there's a man here can do it you don't know how to make him believe but God can make him believe if he can take sh adch mesach and abedo and put them down there in a fiery furnace and sweep a little air into that room surely he can come sweep over your body and he can change circumstances where you don't deal with complexes where you don't deal with fear where you don't deal with stigmas where you don't deal with jealousy where you don't deal with these things little by little little by little but there's going to be a rushian Mighty Wind just like it did on the day of Pentecost that come rushing in there and it rushed all the anxiety and it rushed all the thoughts of humanity out of them and it proved that there was plenty of room for the fourth man in this Fire come on come on Ruth come on Ruth you're predestined for this moment it's time you enter into your Bethlehem and meet your Bo ass you waited for this long enough the lord of the Harvest is standing here and I know you got a lot of things that you could look back at your past to being a moabit but just take a look back just take a look back at what he did for Moses take a look back what he did for David take a look back take a look back take a look back we don't do away with our traditions Hallelujah I want to do away from things people used to say that I don't know why I'm here let me let me close we done had too much of a good time to get myself in trouble the waiting is over the days of wandering are over the days of asking are over I say it's time for you to just enter in it's time to enter in when you I'm going to I'm closing musicians come on come on come on so I quit but when they get done God is going to have the ark standing right there in the middle of the river standing right there in the middle to the river and he's going to have 12 men big men men like Randall men that really believe real Believers real Believers men like Denny men like Thomas men like Steve Thomas men like Samuel men like Tom Hill men like Jonathan Damron real Believers walk out there in the Jordan of river and grab some rock of testimony said that these are for those that we refuse to believe that God does these things and we're going to set them up as a memorial that we literally got them out of our troubles and we're going to stack them up over here on the side of gilar so that everybody will see them I tell you what such a testimony it is that when everybody wanted to say that John the Baptist was nothing but a bunch of Holy Rollers he was standing there and he put his hand on them Stones said you bunch of Generation of Vipers you refuse to believe that God's going to do a new thing he said but God is literally able to rise up children of Israel right out of these Stones I'll say this that if the rest of the world don't want to believe it God will raise up some rocks of testimony that'll believe that God is a God that can cross a red sea he's a God that can cross a Jordan River he's the god that walks in fire he's the god that kills goliaths when they want to say it's over there's a people that say the days of waiting are over and I ain't going to let no Rock testify in my place I got 12 Stones right here don't tell me don't make me make them start singing cuz they can sing sing don't make me start beating on them so that they can sing because they will testify they will testify that God still God if we could get a hold of that rock that killed Goliath that rock could testify to us couldn't he that this rock of testimony is good enough to kill a giant don't make me get them rocks out don't make me get them rocks out that them Pharisees dropped out dropped out there when they said he when Jesus said ye with without sin cast the first stone don't make me pick these rocks up don't make me pick these rocks up don't make me pick that rock up that Moses smoked and there was enough water for two million people don't make me do it but I'm afraid that too many times that people are afraid to miss a moment they're afraid to recognize where they're at and they're afraid to sing out and they're afraid to testify and they're afraid to witness that he's a God that does these things right there's literally there's literally a rock quarry in Pennsylvania that you can go up there and you can take your hammer and you can start tapping on it that's all fresh man I ain't looked at them things for years but you can take your hammer and you can tap on it and it'll start ringing out and they said that in certain Seasons that it's the most beautiful music that is played right out of them Stones right up there in that rock Corry it's a sign to us that there's an old generation that refuses to sing out the Praises of God but I ain't going to let some rock quy in Pennsylvania outdo me I'm in the season of the coming of the Lord and it's time to sing It's Time To Praise It's Time To Worship well that's going to be for when
