your Bibles today we'd like to look over in second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 and verse 2 and also down to uh Mark 11 and 22 ain't it good to be a Christian that's my song Hallelujah I'm glad he made me a new man in Christ Jesus amen second Peter chapter 1 and verse two amen the Bible says here that Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain un life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust also Mark 11: 22 this morning very very familiar scripture to us as message Believers and studiers of the word we realize that this is the scripture that the Brandon was sitting there and he was studying that day when he was sitting there in Sportsman Hollow he sitting there studying the studying over that and trying to find it in the scriptures and how it placed itself in the atonement brother Brandon found out that it was a Eternal atonement that this was was before Calvary these scriptures here were before Calvary but brother brandham had always pondered that how how it fit in the economy of God or the pro in the promises of God but you remember you know exactly what happened that morning while brother bram's sitting there and he's thinking about these things he's thinking about this scripture right here and the Bible said in Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God ain't that beautiful maybe we say it like this have the faith of God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say under this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith let's say that together whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you that what thing soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen may God bless his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord I'd like to take a thought this morning on the Paradox the Paradox of his promise the Paradox of his promise and the Bible says here in Isaiah 40 and verse 28 and I know this is many of our favorite scriptures he said hast thou not known and hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Feth not neither is we there is no searching of his understanding so not only does he not faint not but notice the next scripture but he giveth power to the faint ain't it a powerful Paradox laying right there in the scripture that that our God don't faint but he gives power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases he increaseth strength so they that have no might in themselves you find out that he gives them strength and which they can't find in their own in their own might In Their Own Strength but he is their strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but here is the Paradox of it but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle and they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint brother Bron we we realize that brother Brandon would take a thought on Paradox several times and he would always he would always go back and find where the what what Webster said about that word paradox he said I want to take a subject on one word paradox he said and first I'd like to explain maybe what a paradox is in Webster's Dictionary he says it says that a paradox means something that's incredible but true that is a paradox something that is almost completely out of reason and couldn't be so but yet it is that's a paradox and we realize that all the promises of God that are laying here are a complete Paradox to those that are of a carnal mind and it's a carnal it's to a carnal mind you can never comprehend what the promises of God but if you do not have the the spirit of the world but you have the spirit of the one that wrote the word that is the author of the word it is not a paradox to you because you recognize that God is the author of it because you see if you begin to look at what Jesus said in Matthew 1039 that he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it and it's a complete Paradox right there how that you could lose your life but yet you could find it in him but to those that are true believers you recognize when you lost your life you found his life it's a complete Paradox to the rest of the world how how we were speaking about Samson last night how that he wasn't a great big giant of a man but yet he was a little shrimp he was a little bitty man but yet God would come and anoint him and ordain him for the for the destruction of the Philistines but yet God could so move on him because he had a promise that was over top of her life and we know we know that a lot of people those Philistines could look out there and see the natural elements that were working on on Samson's life that's why there was great fear amongst the Philistines because they had seen Giants they had they had seen they had they had Giants in their own ranks but here was a little bitty old guy that that had the power of 10 men that is upon him it was it was a paradox to them they'd never seen anything like that and I I'll say this that by the Bible that there is there is a people in the land today that are under the same power today that the world cannot understand and they can't comprehend how that you do what you do but this we know that by the scripture reading this morning that whereby are given unto us great and exceeding precious promise so we consider these promises it's not just it's not just a man that is speaking these things but we consider the author of the one that is speaking these promises we understand that that he is that he that he is a God and his promises are absolute they're free they're unconditional they're irresistible and they're irreversible and they're unchangeable and if we look at it in that aspect that God was under no obligation to give us as his as people of the world or people of the land to think that he was under no obligation to make any promises to us but yet he did because he's God and to think that God would he would create a generation and then there would be a generation under Noah's generation that would turn their back on God and and God actually repented of making man but there was something on the inside of God that God longed for the fellowship that he had had once back there in the Garden of Eden and he found a man by the name of Noah that that man was a righteous man he was a holy man he kept the standards of God and God had found a man that he could put his promises in and that man could go out there and build things that were a complete Paradox and it wasn't man constructed but it was God constructed and Noah completely relied upon the promises of God it didn't make no sense to him why he would go out there and choose a a a wood that would be the porest of wood it would be a goph for wood but God had an example laying there in those words that he was given to him he said because you're going to pitch it with tar it's going to show that there's going to be a people that are going to need need to be sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's a lot of things about the scriptures that maybe a lot of people don't understand but God's got a purpose behind every single one of his elements and his characters that are laid there in the Bible and Noah couldn't explain to them how that rain was going to come out of the sky but yet he believed that God was going to do something Supernatural because Noah was a man that believed you see Noah was a man that believed and this we know that the Bible said here Peter tells us that by the these promises that we become or or that we might be partakers of the divine nature you see it's by these promises we become by his we become partakers of the divine nature and that's exactly in line with 1 John 3 and2 that now are we the sons of God but it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall be like him when we see him so it shows to us that by the promises of God we are sons of God but if there was not that promise laying there how would it be when Satan would come against you and try to tell you that you're not a son of God it's all for days gone by but Peter or John wrote it in this way he said but right now you are the sons of God and Noah didn't have to worry about when it came when he was a Son of God because he knew that by the promises of God that he was perfectly in line with what the scripture was saying at that time Noah didn't have a bible to read at that time but he was looking at the skies and he was hearing a voice that God had wrote the first Bible up there in the skies and he looked up there and he seen a god up there and he he handled God he talked to God and he recognized that he was now a Son of God he didn't have to wait till the rain to come before he was a Son of God and you you don't have to wait till you feel the emotions of the spirit of God to find out whether you're a God whether you're a Son of God or not you can recognize right now by by one little simple thing of applying the hiss up taking that hiss up and putting it over your heart's door and recognize that you're a Son of God by the promises of God not because of emotions and not because of feelings but because the word said so that's why Satan wants to give you well he puts it in your mind well you don't have the same feeling as this feeling or or that brother or that sister because he can whip you around on those feelings but if he can put something if he can if he if God can ever implant something on the inside of your heart that it's the word of God that matters most Satan can never whip you around upon the promises of God that's why he's trying to tear down with everything that is within him the power of the promises of God but he's been doing it for all all these years and the gates of hell didn't Prevail against it so he does everything do to you to make you feel like you're not a Christian to make you think that you're not a Christian but if you can ever tie your soul to an absolute that is the word of God you'll find that Satan can whip you around all he wants to he can try to push you around the stump but you know that you've got an absolute solute in the promises of God but we know this that we cannot read the Bible like a newspaper because you see you've got to read the Bible as it is it's a love letter to God's children you see brother Bram would tell us he said you can't have the faith that you have in the Bible that you have in the newspaper he said you can't tie those two things together he said if you do he said it will callous your faith it'll callous your faith but you see this is that when we see something that is laying here in the promises of God that maybe seem like they're a little bit far off or maybe superstitious or a little bit Mystic brother Brandon would tell us he said all you've got to do is give God just a little bit of time and he said his Co his cogs or his prophetic wheels will roll right on time they'll roll right on time and he said it'll develop the picture that God had in his mind if you can just give God a little bit of time this morning maybe you don't see the healing working in your body maybe you don't see the promise of your children coming back yet but if you can give God God just a little bit of time he'll make good on every one of his promises and that's the thing about God God does not promise US easy things but neither does he fail to fulfill all of his promises either if God said it God is the one that is obligated to back it up I'm simply here as an instrument to preach the word of God and God will back up the word that I speak if it be true here today if I preach to you that Isaiah 53 is still in effect and your faith aligns with that promise then you can watch healing come to your body but if your faith is in a God that died 2,000 years ago and that's as far as it is it'll never come to fruition in your life but if you can believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever if you can believe that he doesn't do things things that are necessarily easy but he does things with purpose you see God does not promise us a flower bed of Eden and brother Brandon would say he said we don't want to falsify the message by telling people that everything's going to be all right he said we don't want to go around and falsify Christianity and tell them that just because you're a Christian that you're never going to have problems and you're never going to have trials because God never promised us those kind of things you see he does not promise us prosperity he doesn't promise US he doesn't promise us a ease of life but what he does promise US is that he's given us Grace to endure the trials that we're going to go through and it might be a paradox to you why God does things the way that he does but I want you to know this it's incredible but it's true when you go to studying out all the characters of the Bible you begin to look at all those characters you find that God chooses some of the most paradoxical people that are in the Bible and it's amazing you begin to study out just one person's life if you go to studying out Jonah's life Jonah was a complete Paradox the whole book of Jonah was a complete Paradox he's a Jew but yet he's sent down there to a bunch of ninevites a heathen City now that's a complete Paradox right there they didn't mingle together and you can look at every prophet in the Bible and you can see in there that there were prophecies that was pertaining unto Israel but you can read the Book of Jonah and there's not one prophecy that is laying there that is pertaining unto Israel but it's all pertaining to a heathen City now don't tell me God ain't a God of a paradox but it shows to us that God had a people down there that was ready and willing to repent at the first preaching of a prophet a stranger that would come walking out on the tongue of a whale talk about a paradox because God does things so perfectly and you may not understand this you may not understand the way God does things but when Jonah come walking out of that whale's mouth what was it they were fish worshippers and they recognized that that was a God that they were serving down there and when they seen Jonah come walking out of that whale it was a sign to them that God was looking on them I tell you the entire story of Jonah is a complete Paradox because when you see God begin to deal with a gentile Nation it is a sign of his in anticipar or his anticipation streak of light that God was going to light the light to the Gentiles and then you were seeing that right there in the Book of Jonah a prophet of God but yet a run away from God a preacher of repentance but he didn't want to repent I'd say it's a paradox save from the jaws of death but in the I always get this confused I always say it wrong but in that whale's belly he finds himself [Music] repenting but you find him on the other side of going down there and preaching to Nineveh and you find Jonah in the very last chapter of Jonah and he's moping because God turns his face towards a heathen City and he's over there moping because his little tree has withered away and there sets ninfa over there prospering in the mercies of God but here is a man that has preached in Repentance it's a complete Paradox you don't have to try to figure it all out but God is a god of his word now notice brother man he said now God he said Needs Nobody to interpret his word he does it his own interpretation by bringing it to pass the things that he said that he would do he said when God said let there be light he said there was light he said that needs no interpretation he said when God said a virgin shall conceive she did that doesn't need any interpretation when Jesus said the son of man goes up to Jerusalem before and be given into the hands of sinful men he said they'll crucify him and on the third day he'll raise again he said that needs no interpretation why because he brought it to pass that's his interpretation he also said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and to the consummation he said he is here he doesn't need any interpretation of it it's his promise you remember when brother random would sit there and he said now he said now he said I he said I got an old bar little knife that's sitting back there on my dresser he said I got it sitting back there on my dresser he said but if I can accumulate the right kind of Faith he said God can put it in my pocket in a matter of moments what was it it's a Paradox to try to figure out how that a man could speak to a mountain and the mountain be removed from hence To Yonder it's a paradox it's a paradox when that little girl that was saying laying there in that bed and and brother Brandon begins to speak to her and tells her said if you can accumulate the faith he said if you can accumulate the faith he said God can heal your body and there they were they were a different style of Christians and there they were they were raised up under under under a certain thought and brother brandom said he said he said but if I could get you to believe ain't it amazing that the angel would get this he would say this if you can get the people to believe you if you can get the people to believe you you see it's the same way with me this morning I can't do anything for you unless you believe me and brother brandham starts talking to this girl she's laying there in that bed and brother brandham said do you believe that I can take my faith and I can roll that little cord that's up there that's hanging over top of your bed do you believe that I could do that and brother bandam said brother bandam said I started to do it and she said well that's witchcraft he said oh no he said that's my faith doing that you see it's a complete Paradox to somebody that's never seen it before you see it's a complete Paradox when you see people that starts walking over on dry ground and the rest of the world gets swallowed up by that same wat it's a complete Paradox you can't explain it but it's true now you may not believe or may not have the same faith that I got but I believe belie that every one of you sitting here can go in Rapture you may not have the kind of faith that I got but I got the kind of faith that God is the kind of God that I know that he can take a people that feel unworthy and show them that they're worthy he can take the kind of people that look like they're out of the picture of God and put them right in the picture of God hallelujah hallelujah let's have church today his promises might be carnal it might be hard for the carnal mind to comprehend but the TRU God never abandons his promises you might disbel him but God never abandons his promises because the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 2 and 1 or two verse chapter 1 and 20 that all the promises of God are in him are yay and in him amen all the promises of God are in him and are yay and a amen and now notice what what the message to this leot and age is that these things saith the amen so Jesus is the Amen brother mam said in the layot ofy in church age he said he never changes what he does he never changes it he says it and it stands fast he does it and it is done forever none can take from them what he says or what he or none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be amen so let it be aren't you glad that you serve that kind of a God you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time he is the amen and God won't change these things sayith the amen he said I like that he said it means that whatever he said it's final it means that whatever he said to the first age and the second and all the ages about his own true church and about the false Vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to for he is the amen so let it be it might be hard to explain but yet it's true it might be hard for you to comprehend but he true and When God says you're healed it's final When God says you're filled it's final When God says you're going to make it it's final who who can turn back the hand of of almighty God if God's got a purpose in extending his hand of Mercy to you who in the right mind and who all the powers of hell can turn back the very power of the hand of the almighty God Satan can send all of his powers from Hell against one child and they can never turn back the hand of almighty God let me let me continue to lay these things here brother bandam said in the message paradox he said we know his word is a paradox he said when it promises something that is so unreal to the world something that they cannot prescribe to it's something beyond their knowledge it's something that's beyond their understanding he said but when a simple heart will take that word and sink it into the depths of its being then that word produces the live facts of that promise what happened when Gideon started taking God at his word and believe that he was a mighty man of Valor he went down there with 300 men and whipped 122,000 midianites why because he took the very word of God and when you as a simple heart begin to take the promises of God and let it sink in there you become the live facts of the promise when God promised Zacharias he's sitting there and he and he's worshiping God in his Temple he's worshiping in the office of a priest he's there and he's offering unto God and God begins to speak to him by the angel Gabriel and he tells him said now look you and Elizabeth y'all been without child for a long time but things are about to change now brother bam said he said it would have been easy he said it was e should have been easy for Zacharias and Elizabeth to believe that he said because he said because it had happened in the scripture before he said but when the angel goes over there and starts talking to Mary she had nobody in the Bible that she could point back to and look back there and say that this is the way it was back then so I know that it'll be this way for me she had nobody to look to John John his parents had the ability to look back there to Abraham and Sarah and say yeah it's incredible but it's true and they doubt it they doubt it and zachariah's mouth was shut until John was born come on now but when Mary first heard the salutation of the Angel she said be it unto me according to Thy word she couldn't explain it a 16year old girl couldn't explain how that happened but yet it was true he' let her all her life so why I doubt him now you know if you got a voice that'll tell you the truth you ought to follow it you know when when Hatty R's sitting there and she's hearing about Mark 11 and she's hearing about Jehovah Gyra that he was a s Jehovah Gyra that was back there with Abraham that he was that s Jehovah Gyra up there in Sportsman holla brother bam said all I can say to y'all is that he's still the same yesterday today and forever and brother ROM said that when Haddie said that he said she said the right thing and he said when she did he said he called when she said that it called to the heart of Jehovah by her saying the right thing and when brother Bram said it called it called the heart of Jehovah he said the Lord said give her whatever she asked for don't you recognize you're sitting here today you're not in need of squirrels but some of you are sitting here in need of your prodical some of you are sitting here and you're in need of healing some of you are in here and you're in need of answers but oh if you could just say the right thing and call to the heart of Jehovah what would it do in a service like this God would say give them whatever they want what was it she said the right thing and when she said the right thing what did he do she didn't ask for money she asked for the most righteous thing something eternal what are you going to do with a paradox sitting in front of you hadie are you going to believe him that he could still produce squirrels are you still going to believe him that he's got a sacrifice for you howy are you still going to believe him when things are worse and it doesn't look like your sons are coming Haddie are you still going to believe him yeah i' say it's a paradox but it's a promise hallelujah it's a promise this morning he's the kind of God that never backs off of his promises he's the kind of God that doesn't give up on his promises he's the kind of God that knows where they are and he's that kind of a God that he thought of them before the foundation of the world I walked out there outside the house the other morning about 3:00 in the morning just walking around and I started looking up there at them stars and admiring the stars and I thought God before them Stars was ever into existence they was in your mind and I started just worshiping the Lord right there nobody in the neighborhood knew what was going on but I was out there praising God that God had those things all of those Stars up there that are more than the Sands that are upon the seashores of the Earth but God had them in his mind but before there was ever spoken to existence there was a thought but I looked at them stars and I said before you was created I was in his mind before you ever heard the hanging there throughout the galaxies I was in his mind hallelujah hallelujah you see it's value had he valued the one that was speaking to her because she'd always trusted she'd always trusted his word she'd always seen everything that he had said that had come to pass and why I doubt him now let me ask Abraham he has been talking to you all the way from Genesis 12 all the way through surely you can trust him up there in Genesis 22 surely you can trust him when he ask you to give your only begotten son surely you can trust him let me just drop this real quick you know I never had the opportunity of meeting my grand Pat M Aly and by the sound of it he's quite the guy but you know I never I never had the opportunity to meet him but I'd always been told about when he'd go over there and fish Silver Lake there was a certain spot that Miley would go over there and he fish at you know I never I never did meet him or anything but I'd always been told that Miley go over there and he' get back in the back side of that corner and he' fish out of there and he said that was the best spot now you know I I'd never met him you know whether I thought about it or not subconsciously I'd always found myself always back there in that same hole that they said Miley was fishing at I go back there and sometimes it didn't work out for me but one day it did one day it did it caught one of the best fish I ever ever did catch because you see I was relying I'd never fish that pond before but they told me they told me that's where Miley fished at so I went back there according to what I had heard and I went back there and I had myself a jubilee back there and you know good and well that there is value in the voice i' never met Miley but i' heard about it you know I'd never I maybe never met the god that Ryan Spencer or Homer Fraser knew until a certain time but I'd heard about him and I trusted the voice so the same voice that I trusted to go back there to that fishing hole was the same voice that had told me Hallelujah he's said God that cares for you now if God could deposit something like that on the inside of a human being that they would subconsciously go back to a fishing hole go back there to a fishing hole where their granddaddy had fish that many many years before you know they probably been a many of people fish back there and never thought one thing about Miley Fraser fishing back there but it was in my mind that my granddaddy fish back here it was in my mind that my granddaddy caught some big trout back here it was in my mind that my granddaddy had caught some good fish back there and I went back there with that in my mind that if my granddaddy could have done it then I can do it too that's the same way with the promises of God that I can look in there and I I can see Homer fras praying for somebody in a hospital room and I can see him walking out of the pro out of that hospital room completely made well and I can say like job said in job 42 and5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now I see I have the same ability that Homer Fraser had I have the same ability that Peter had I have the same ability that William brandham had this ain't some fishing hole it's the message of the hour and I got the same ability to lay hands on the sick and they shall it might be a paradox to you how that a hillbilly a country boy out of the Pilot Mountain would come and lay his hands upon you and all of a sudden the rush of Heaven would roll over top of you it ain't me it's the one you heard about this is more than a fishing story God's getting a rainbow trap kind of people a coveted people Hallelujah brother said now I might break my promise cuz I'm a man and your friend might break his promise or her promise God will not break his promise he can't because he's God could you imagine how pure and unadulterated his promises are how infinite he said why if I'd go to a spring that my grandfather drank out of one time or spring that it was it was clear and tested the water he said it was 100% pure my father drank out of it he said it was 100% pure and all down through my life I I drank out of it and 100% pure why I'd have enough Faith to go back there and believe if I take a drink of that water it'd be all right for me now if we can do that by what somebody else has said surely we can take God at his word that David would say in Psalms 13 oh bless the Lord oh my soul oh oh bless the Lord oh my soul and blessed be His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits he forgiveth all of thine iniquities who Health all of thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who cth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles Hallelujah does he still got benefits for his children now some of you don't understand this but we've been standing here and we've been preaching and we are watching the very manifestation of the promises come to pass you know when you wait on something for so long A lot of times you don't recognize it until it's already passed but God does some things right in front of you so that you can't miss them is that right you can pray about it and all of a sudden it comes into fruition just look at Gabriel we prayed for him all them years but now he's here look at brother Jason back there we prayed for him all those years those years of prayer and fasting was not in vain because they're here and it's like praying for brother Ron it was like it's like praying for brother on it's not in vain this morning your faith is not in vain this morning all of your faith is being accumulated to one spot and when God takes your faith and puts it all together what's God going to do I I was simply I'll be honest about got more than I could handle last night when I heard the culmination of all those voices last night screaming out all all one thing all they was all screaming out and I know we we had more people screaming out don't do it than actually was there when Jesus was there 2,000 years ago but it gave us a good illustration of all the voices that was coming together and they were they were screaming and hollering I I be honest it it was overwhelming just to think about think about being in that part of the story and I never want to find myself in the seat of s sitting there and crucifying the Flesh of the word of God right here right now today but you could you imagine when when I was sitting there I begin to think about this all in that moment I begin to think now what if we could all turn our voice loose to the promises of God and saying yes to them that we could say that he is the Lord who forgiveth me of all of my iniquities and heals all of my diseases and we could come together with one great big shout of yes what would it would be tonight if we if we would sit here in one mind in one Accord if we could sit here not no isms not no skepticism not one big one and not one little one but as a body word begin to accumulate all of these promises together and put them all together and all of you say well I don't know exactly how it's going to be but yes to it that he is still Isaiah 53 he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his tribes I am healed I know it's a paradox that you is a high priest of your profession but I believe that if you can hold fast your profession in faith today brother Brit said something very powerful at sister Erica's at sister Erica's uh funeral the other day he said our faith he said we didn't he said we didn't have weak Faith he said it wasn't that he said we have very strong faith he had he said we had very strong faith and I know that sometimes when you you get to a certain spot and you're praying for a certain thing that a lot of times you may feel like you're disappointed you might feel like it you didn't get the answer that maybe you were wanting but I found this in life that God's nose are also as good as his Essence and I know this that that your faith was not in vain when you were praying for sister Erica and just like it's not in vain right now when you're praying for brother Donnie and sister Carol your faith is not in vain that God is a God of all comfort so if we've got that kind of a faith that God would care so much that he would release her from the grips of cancer how much more is he able to say yes that I can heal this one or I can heal that one you say well I prayed all those times and it don't look like it availed to anything oh yes it did Satan lost I know we've been we've been talking about Zoe here and that I I'll be honest it's pretty overwhelming if you just set back as a family we set back in the last month you begin to y'all heard us talking about how how that God's going to God's going to bless her she's going to start talking but if you'd hear that little baby talk you'd say it's the Wonder workking power of almighty God it's already working now what happened it was somebody that believed what doctors had said would never be that she wouldn't talk till she was 20 years old and maybe never talk that way but somebody took a hold of the promise and that little baby back there is talking like never before she may not be as advanced as maybe this one or that one but because somebody grabbed a hold of the promise and said yes to it what would happen in here today if you would say God I see you talking about a people that's going in a Rapture yes I see you talking about a people that believe that all things are possible yes I see you talking about God being able to create a ram and create squirrels then God you can produce the powerful right now if God's that kind of a God that he can create squirrels surely surely he can do the impossible in every one of our Lives it's a paradox but it's [Applause] true imagine homop frasia running with everything that's within him you think about it think about him sister Francis you saw him in his youth you saw him brother Vernon youve seen him preached with the same passion that he would preach with all the way up until his death but could you imagine where this bride is at today and brother hom said I was a part of that I was a part of that they might be on beyond the curtain of time but they are still a part of the promise right now hallelujah hallelujah can't you see it right here right now that there's a host of angels that are gather around this building there's a people that's G going on and they're saying it's a paradox but it's a real land it's a real home it's a real heaven it's worth fighting for come on little bride it's everything you dreamed of he ain't going to let you [Applause] down I'm begin to think back here I begin to think about about this the salt sometimes you just the thought begins to get a little bit bigger than than you and you recognize that you're just in the the mind of the Lord I begin to think about brother Joe shifflet begin to think about how that how that brother Homer had witnessed to them to him all those times brother Joe was hidden that hdden that way to the church there believe it was Summit Avenue if I if I got that right maybe maybe was on one of the others places there but I believe it was Summit but anyways it doesn't matter he is at one of churches but either way brother brother Homer had was been back there and he was he was preparing but the Lord spoke to him said now go out there and wait on the porch because Joe's not going to come in Joe's not going to come in until unless you're setting up there he's done set it in his heart he's not going to come into there unless brother Homer sitting on the porch and when brother Joe rode up there there was brother Homer sitting on the porch I want you to hear me soldier boy I want you to hear me there's a daddy that's sitting on the porch for you and say I'm waiting for you to come on in come on in here come on soldja boy you're not going to commit suicide come on in soldier boy there's a daddy that's waiting for you it's more than your fleshly daddy that's waiting for you the papa God is waiting for you and his promises are yes and amen hallelujah time and science might be against God's promises but God is the god of his word there's a daddy that's sitting on the porch said come on home children come on home children I'd say mamas and daddies you've been looking for them you've been asking for them but I'd say It's Time to Kill the fatty calf stop looking for him and start rejoicing over [Applause] it imagine Abraham your faith is not in vain you waited 25 years for this but it's not in vain but brother BR I I found this brother said that God had been testing the patriarch because he had give him a promise and when God makes a promise he said he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said that he would promise what he had promised him you imagine 25 years that's a short time compared to 120 years of saying it's going to rain but for 25 years Abraham been preaching I'm going to have a son and his name's going to be called Isaac you imagine you imagine as Abraham is he's got everything in order all all his faith is in order his his promises are lining up everything his faith he's got his he's got his he's got his home under the message he's got it under the token and everything and then MDC shows up at his house brother Chris and he recognizes that this is the acceptable time of the Lord and he begins to move into the promise now you you imagine how Abraham felt when mzc comes to his tent door and sits there and he starts Discerning the very thoughts of his wife's heart that's sitting behind the tent and Abraham would say that's the same voice I've listened to that's the one that led me that's the one that letting me out of my daddy's home that's the same one that spoke to me to go down there and get lot that's the same one that told me down there and I I paid ties to them it's the same one imagine that's the same sign in this generation and now I I'll turn my back to you and I can't see you but I see that there's a woman sitting back there in a red dress and she's got a dark shadow that keeps following her and and it's following her but thus saith the Lord It's Over what is it it was the same it was the same Messiah sign that was being expressed in Abraham's life that there all of a sudden that all of his faith had been to a spot it all came together and all of a sudden things begin to change in his life he starts stepping into the vision of the message and he starts walking into and he he's perfectly in line with all of those things that that what he's seeing is a complete invisible Union that has taken place by the grace of God and he he he's watching it and all of his faith has come together he didn't believe and he didn't believe he didn't believe that God was going to fail him but the Bible said that he staggered not at the promises of God but there all of this is coming together and everything's coming into fruition all of a sudden can you imagine how he felt when he sees Isaac face to face and they call me crazy call me crazy but I I just happen to believe that Abraham and Sarah had thems a good little dancing party right there they Sarah may have been the very first one to ever shout at a woman that just gave birth to a baby and Shout outside the hospital room but I happen to believe that there that little woman had so much so much Zeal and passion on the inside of her that I have not believed in vain that everything that I hope for and it might be a paradox that God would take a 100y old man and a 90y old woman and turn them back new again but I believed it I believed it and you can look in the Old Testament and you can see where Sarah doubted but you can look in the New Testament and it's not even found in the picture what is it it's a sign that the blood was good enough to curse your past and bless your future the promises of God can't be held back remember the prophet God dropped in his heart you're going to have a Joseph you're going to have a Joseph here he's got Billy Here Comes Rebecca and here comes Sarah and all them people started mocking him but God had already dropped it into his heart that you're going to have a Joseph and the doctor done told him said now look your wife can no longer she cannot handle having any more children brother Bron told that doctor said now look I've been promised that I'm going to have a son and he's going to come forth can you imagine you can imagine about all them mockers and brother Bram said that them people were sitting around there when there came out Sarah and Rebecca and they said maybe you meant Josephine he said but when Joseph showed up he said there I was he said I was there he said Joseph it sure took you a long time to get here but thank God that you're here you can sit there and all the Skeptics are sitting there but because God dropped the message in your heart you have not believed in vain 400 years the children of Israel had believed had believed that God was going to take them out of the land of Egypt and time was increasing the pressure of it time increased the pressure of it but God was as good as his word that he told Abraham that they would sojourn in a Strange Land but I'm going to give them this land time was increasing against him the pressures of life but don't you see what pressure produces it produces gold they waited for it look at them look at them there brother M said that faith is designed to see what God wants he said how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise he said there this is a full revelation of Jesus Christ he said and when that Faith that's in you focus you to the word you're focused away from all the denominations agrees and everything you're focused right straight on the word and you're zeroed in on it it only it only needs a little touch off amen he said the prayer flies straight into the presence of God because there's nothing to stop it he said that's what does it when you're zeroed in with God and focused in by then you're looking at the Target he said you're not looking at what somebody else says this can't happen and that can't happen he said but you're looking to what you know did happen you look on to your target you see what they hit if they hit it in that day and he's the same yesterday today and forever he said Focus out all the Creeds and things you got mixed up and go right back to the word then confess your unbelief and let God take his Holy Spirit and direct your right your sights right straight onto Jesus Christ we're looking to him then not what somebody else says I know it's incredible but if you can align your faith with the word of God I know it's incredible that you that there is in this generation of people that believe a people that can take Deuteronomy 22 and5 and make it live a people a lady a sister of the grace can take a 1 Corinthians 11 and make him live it's incredible but it's true and God is not backing off of his promises God does not forget his promises you imagine when God is speaking to Elijah and Elisha asked a hard thing of Elijah said I want a double portion I want a double portion and he asked him he asked a hard thing of him but God granted him he said when you see if you see me when I go did not he say the same thing to you yet a little while and the world can't see me but you'll see me and God had granted him a double portion and you imagine all the markers sitting around he was one short of his promises Elijah had eight Miracles and Elisha had should have had 16 but he only got 15 but God is the god of paradox and when they took that Soldier and they threw him in there on a Dead Man's Bones God was a god of paradox and showed that he had the power that the quickening power of almighty God was still he upon Elijah's bones and It produced The Miraculous what is it is when God begins to take the burden of the word that God releases his burden by bringing his promises to pass you know when you know when brother brandham is is preaching he's telling he's working his way through he that is in you and a lot of people listen to that sermon and they think one Bar's just telling stories he's more than telling stories he's telling you about a god that is in you that is greater than than he that is in the world you remember brother brandham is there he's there on Colorado mountain and he starts speaking to the storm and and you remember the whole entire story and I don't want to go through the whole thing but you know the story and there brother brandham he said he starts he starts walking down through there and those deer had come up to him but but you remember you remember that brother brandham said I I had carried this burden for four to five years i' carried this burden 4 to 5 years and he said I I he said I did everything that I could to get rid of that to get rid of that burden he said I prayed he said I asked God to take it away from me and he said I I kept praying and I kept asking and it just seemed like it wasn't it would never leave he said he said but what it was he said he said I I had told all those men that I would go out there and kill wild game for him he said they would ask for an elk and I'd go out there and he said he said he said I'd go out there and kill something for him he said i' go out there and he said he said but God be to condemn my heart and he said that wasn't right and he said I was doing those things because those men he said but he said there I was and he said i' done told the Lord now Lord I'm not going to kill anymore for anybody else I'm just going to take what's for me now brother Brandon is up there after he speaks to that storm and those deer come up close and I believe that they seen something on the inside of William brandham that they saw back there in the Garden of Eden they seen somebody speaking to the natural elements he was speaking to the mountain and he speaks of that and those deer come up there and you remember that brother bham said I just said now you're in my life I could take your life right now they said but I just shoed them off said go on go on go on I'm not going to do it and he said when I did that the spirit of the Lord began to speak to me and said you remembered your promise and he said and I'll remember mine that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you he said right then right then the burden left me right there it's a sign to you that when you keep your promise the the burden will leave you don't you see that that's how the burden leaves almighty God is when he brings his promises to pass you might think it's a little bit strange you might think it's a little bit far reaching but do you recognize that if you're believing for a certain need or a certain situation that the only way that God can relieve the burden off of you is to bring his promise to pass so God said I'll send them the best thing that I can I'll send them my word you don't have to do it by your own might he showed you that you don't have to do it by your own might because he was standing there on the mountain and he didn't use any power and he didn't use any he didn't use any great strength he simply took it is written and he overcome the enemy right there what is it God is the god of the Paradox right here let us stand this morning amen he's that kind of a God that he can release his burden over you you might be carrying the burden and you might be carrying you might be weary you might be a weary traveler but the greatest way to let go of your burden is to find yourself in the promises of God say Lord I I need I need a touch from you today I need just more of you in my life as we go forward into the promises of God lord would would you help me Lord would you anoint My Faith Lord bless us as we go forward let's just bow our hearts today Heavenly Father we approach you father by the preaching of the word we recognize that we are here gathered here Lord these things have been heavy on my heart Lord today thinking over these things and we recognize that you're going to release your burden father you see people that are praying for certain needs and you see why you maybe why you keep them up or maybe why they're burden so much over this certain one it's because you have been dealing with us to pray for that certain need father now God we commit our faith unto you and ask that your blessings would be released in this place now God we take you at your word so let it be in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brother Shannon the trials of this world was getting [Music] closer and the pool I felt was more than I could bear and I was on the verge of giving [Music] over the strength I needed within me just wasn't [Applause] there but something keeps holding [Music] me every day I see he's
