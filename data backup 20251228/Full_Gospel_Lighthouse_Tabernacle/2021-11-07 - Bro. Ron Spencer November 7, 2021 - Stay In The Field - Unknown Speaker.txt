every day a couple of times and life has just changed for him and it looked like we were going to have to put him in a home to be very honest with your rehab to try to get him stronger when i went in to get him this morning he was a brand new man and so we're just really thankful for that many of you saw him fall last night and that's why we we went away pretty early but i'd like for you to pray with us this morning for dad and ask god to just touch him in a special way amen heavenly father my jesus now you showed me monday that i would be praying for him and now here we stand yes we've watched a little boy walk across this stage and it builds our faith zach and mary getting married lord we know your word doesn't fail you're a healer now we're not expecting you to turn us young again

you're the great heart surgeon lord in just now i thank you first of all that there's great doctors great nurses great staff lord you heal many different ways miracles all different kinds of things but father sometimes you go through medicine dr luna and his team are great people and lord i just ask you that you would anoint them to take care of harold lord i i find it a miracle that they will are even willing to work we ask you that you will touch brother harold for let them do their work and then you will heal his body for any great doctor will will tell us that that god is the great

today lord as we lay our hands on brother danny we do this by a proxy for brother harold in the name of jesus christ send your word the many other needs that are even in this building today father we ask you to send forth your hand and touch them dear god today in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen god bless you brother denny i love you thank you for that amen amen said oh yeah okay amen any good to us amen we love him don't we amen we had a very difficult week this week and when i call it difficult it was very difficult this week and the same team that's taking care of brother harold their office called me four days in a row and wanted me to come to the emergency room and and i did go to the emergency room because my doctor asked me to go dr gohan called me she didn't simply said we came too far to quit now and so she said i want you to go so i went and i sat there for six hours and uh they did a couple tests on me and had an iv in me and told me my tests were good but it may be ten more hours before i'd see the doctor well i was sitting there with people coughing and all other kind of things happened and i said connie i'm going home and so i consulted with my other doctor over here he told me it was a good idea i didn't tell them your name and he was wanting me to stay so but we came home and i felt safer in my own bed than over there and so and every day since they have been asking me to go back and yesterday seemed to be a very difficult day and and just to be honest with you the the deal that we're looking at is we have a clot that's about three quarters an inch and it's it's it's in my lung and it's right on the aorta uh there with the heart and uh three different doctors told me this week that i'm playing russian roulette and so i woke up this morning i didn't have any pain in my chest hallelujah amen brother tim wrote me something this morning and so i i asked him if i could share it and this was for me and so maybe it's for you as well cancer will end like this only belief all things are possible today is the day of the lord on a day like this joseph woke up a prisoner ready to execute his daily routine but by evening he became the prime minister on a day like this naaman woke up usually with leprosy but before the day closed he was healed and transformed on a day like this david was innocently in a field tending his father's sheep before he was sent for and was anointed to be the king on a day like this mordecai slept at a palace gate as usual as a gateman but before the day closed he brought inside was brought inside the palace and was honored on a day like this bartimaeus woke up as usual a blind man but before the day closed he was able to regain his sight [Applause] on a day like this daniel slept in a lion's den but by the time it was morning he was brought out and promoted to the pros uh prime minister a day like this a woman from shem woke up and overwhelmed by debts and threats by the close of the day she had them all paid and she became rich on a day like this lazarus slept overnight in the grave but by evening he was arisen and came back to life on a day like this the woman with a issue of blood woke up and with her illness but at the close of the day she was totally healed of it on a day like this jabez cried unto the lord and his coast was enlarged on a day like this elisha prophesied that by this time tomorrow famine will be over and there will be plenty of food and it came to pass as he had said so we believe that today is our day hallelujah for pleasant surprises and outstanding testimonies because god is greater than cancer hallelujah [Applause] your day my day [Applause] any good to us is any good let's have church look at your neighbor and say let's have church ruth chapter 1 and verse 14 if you will turn there with me i'd like to maybe just rehearse for a few moments of where we was last week and then we will go forward this morning i'd like to speak to you on stay in the field i think god is so amazing in all of his great arrangements of things a wedding yesterday of epic proportion and in in all of that we're speaking stay in the field hallelujah amen ruth chapter 1 and verse 14 let's just pray lord jesus we come now to the most sacred thing that we do is to take your word and read it great men of god were led to write these things down unction by the holy spirit now we pray that that same heavenly unction will sweep across this audience just now and may we realize we are she the bride of the last day standing in our place rising up in this hour father we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our mistakes and failures in our humanity help us to grow in grace and the knowledge of jesus christ may the anointing of god fall on this preacher today fall on this audience and people wherever they will hear these words we pray that you would minister to us now speak to our hearts we committed and give it to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen ruth chapter 1 and verse 14 and they lifted up their voice and and wept again and orpha kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave to her and he said and she said behold thy sister is gone back unto her people and under her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and whether thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there and there i will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if i ought but death part thee and me and she was that she was steadfastly minded to go with her when she left speaking unto her powerful scriptures ruth 2 and verse 5 then said boaz under the servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this and the servant set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitess damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheeps so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house and then boaz said unto ruth here's thou not my daughter go not gleaned to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field and they that do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art to thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn god bless you enjoy this have you come to have church these words kept coming to me about three weeks ago stay in the field stay in the field stay in the field they mean incredible amount to the bride of jesus christ there's a lot of characters that are in the field that are working that no doubt went to a lot of fields it was the plan of the day it was the way that they made their their living that's the way that they actually survived its people would go behind the reapers and and get the remnants that were not picked up but this girl was ordained by god now she might not understand the borders or even the boundaries of the field she might not understand even the traditions or the way that god had planned no way could she understand redemption but she was actually playing our part this girl had had had met the family of her husband she had married into them realizing they were not from moab but they were from another land and they had went they had came there because there was a famine brother branham said that's where we get in trouble is when we move out where god's blessed us but god override all of their all of their mistakes and sometimes he uses our mistakes he uses our failures to prove the very plan of god that he's got in his mind now remember god hasn't changed from the eternities as he watches time unfold many characters will come throughout the scriptures and step to their role and they're very unwittingly don't know of what they're playing joseph would be in a dungeon for years not understanding that he was playing the perfect type of jesus christ jonah would step off of a ship thinking his wife his life was not worthy of anything and it better that he die than live without god but god had prepared a great fish are you with me it's not for me to understand how that he the how he breathed under those conditions but god prepares a great fish and listen if god prepares a great fish you may have a lot of questions in there but god knows how to prepare a fish better than boeing aircraft knows how to prepare an airplane hallelujah it will get where it's going and jonah had time in that fish to pray and kept turning his way until he got himself turned a certain direction to where he knew god could hear from him this woman could not understand that where she's going back to is a land of promise it's the land of abraham's land abraham look for a city whose builder and maker is god and let me just say he entertained a lot of kings the scripture bears out in genesis 14 that he entertained kings but there was one king that came to his house and this king was not from a country that would be on the seven continents of the united of the world but it would be from heaven without father without mother and god would step like he stepped with the three hebrew children would step into a body and go be in a furnace but god stepped in at the athany party and came and ate ate lamb and drank milk and while he was there he told him of the promise that they had been talking about now for years if you remember god asked abraham to sojourn come out and he didn't know where he was going but he was being led by shall we say a deep calling to a deep and something was leading him and he couldn't explain where he was going but one day god came to his tent let me just say if you are on a journey and you don't know where you're going the greatest visitor you can ever have is for god himself to come to your place maybe before abraham couldn't couldn't describe what his life was all about having all these visitors couldn't understand he had became rich he had 318 male servants so he was doing pretty good that's quite us quite an incredible company to be quite honest with you we read about lot walking away we read about how that things happen and hurt takes place but when lot walks away melchizedek comes i'd say that's an incredible trade so when friends walk away don't worry there's more of jesus for you i think i said this last week but god ask isaac thy only son take him up and offer him as a sacrifice god settles the argument abraham had another son but it was by hagar god never recognized that blessed him but never recognized him as being abraham's seed but i want you to understand the world is in chaos in the middle east because there's still a disturbance over which one is truly abraham's seed that the fight that goes all the way back i'm not going to get into it but the fight that goes always goes all the way back was settled by god take thy son thine only son but due to jealousy and humanity the other son always thought he was apart are you with me now sometimes we ask why did god touch me and didn't touch this one or didn't touch that one remember before esau and jacob was ever born god spoke to the mother and told him that jacob i love and esau are you with me tonight listen it's all into the hands of god the predestinated hands of god and if god has ever spoke to you to draw on you don't you neglect that thirst don't you take it for granted when he brings isaac down off of the mountain of life and they have an incredible testimony we don't know the exact days or the the time but sarah would pass away now i'd like to just just drive this down one more time i don't know if i did a good enough job last week but god wanted an abstract title deed to that property so that those israelites could sit over there at their great halls of government and said god gave it to us he gave it to us and it didn't come cheap and i want to just remind you your salvation did not come cheap it didn't come through a school it didn't come through some theology it came by the blood of god himself he left the ivory palaces of heaven and took on humanity to be spit on to be mocked to be cursed and the final betrayal that his own people would choose barabbas over top of him and the government would beat him like no other man would ever be beat so that we could be healed so that we could tell cancer and look at it right in the eye and tell him you're not just defeated today you were defeated 2 000 years ago by the blood of jesus christ i wasn't just saved a few years ago i was saved when the blood was dripping from his immortal veins dripping down on the ground and purchasing this land purchasing my redemption like adam eve was pulled out of adam like the bride of jesus christ we were pulled out of the blood the rib of jesus christ himself give the lord a great big hand right there [Applause] sarah chose sarah past and abraham chose to bury her in a particular piece of property not going to go long into it but it is even recognized today as the highest piece of property that's ever been sold between two people abraham was a great man in the land and he was looking for a city who's building maker's god god had told him wherever you look look north look south east look west it's yours but he didn't own it he had a faith but he didn't own it you understand what i'm saying i like to go to biltmore but i don't own it but actually biltmore wouldn't make my dog a good house in heaven he was choosing to bury his wife in a particular land and he went to the elders and asked them i'd like to bury my wife and i'd like to buy it those elders told him bury your wife we don't want to we don't want to sell it to you bury your wife you're welcome to bury your wife there at the property but i want to own it but i want to own it and they pleaded with him bury your wife it'd be amazing that satan wants to give you religion and make you phenomenal offers but god wanted it purchased [Applause] and in the purchasing of it satan asked for a phenomenal cost he asked for a phenomenal cost in this cost it would be the highest piece of property ever transacted but abraham had a deed when netanyahu sat the other day here some months ago and said the argument is over the land he raised his bible and said this is the deed and it took them all the way back to the property that sarah was buried in are you with me this has significance i got to lay it here listen when joseph and them went into a strange land he said don't you bury me down here don't you bury me in this denomination are you with me when you go home carry my bones [Applause] you take my bones over there because there's a resurrection that's coming we got a king that's coming and he'll conquer death hell in the grave don't you bury my bones anywhere you take me back to where our homeland is this is where god told abraham i'll be your shield in your buckler he told him who he was he confirmed himself and not just confirmed himself he turned him back young again i want to just ask you right now i have spoke with many a theologian and asked him what was the great miracle that took place with melchizedek and them going to grill repeatedly through the years i've had them tell me that uh that a king that is a young king would lust after an old woman because the land was not given to them the book wasn't open to them and if the book is not open you can't see the mystery of it and let me just say even to 62 brother branham explains to us i've been probing at it i'll take his good probing over top of a lot of denominal ideas but after 63 when the seals are revealed there's no longer probing at it the book the title deed became open and the kinsmen redeemer the redemption plan was open now there's a lot of people that work in this field there's a lot of people that work in the field but they work in a lot of other fields as well but the land this is the promised land it ought to be a hundred percent here satan you back off i woke up feeling good now i need him to back off can i just maybe i just until this settles down maybe i just talked to you for a minute that be okay sometimes we have some pretty good talks here don't you think about it the bible is two books it's old and it's new and here's a woman that has a past but she don't know she's a part of the plan okay oh let's go get good help me lord help me lord so here she is she's been married she's a widower her womb has been used she has no children she's not a virgin she's been married before so basically according to law her life is over cannot preach to you but actually it hadn't started her life seemed over but it hadn't started maybe she couldn't explain when orpha kisses her mother-in-law and says goodbye and goes back to her gods why she didn't go back but she responds your people be my people your god my god where you die i'm gonna die where you live i'm going to live and it was just it was such a response until it actually took naomi's breath and said well come go with me now remember this isn't her country that she's walking to she don't know where she's going she don't know the traditions she don't have no friends there she is of a little bit of a different color she has a past but she don't know it she's got a future they go back to the house where they came from they go back to the well they go back to all of these things and and they've they've got to live and naomi knows that we have kinsmen and she can see the two trees which one she would send her to and so she sends her to the kinsmen that owns the field go there and work now listen she's an alien humanity is humanity and everybody becomes judgmental everybody wants to throw a stone she's a cursed woman she has a moabitess working in our field but she was more predestinated to be in that field than all of them so when they make fun of you just give yourself a little dance this field is about me [Applause] historians bear out how beautiful she was so there was a lot of young men looking you know what i'm saying look new girl looking somehow they forget the curse when they're looking boaz is going to be a type of christ now let me just show you how neat god does business now think about it this is the promised land that the children of abraham and jacob's boys they're going to go back joseph has preserved them now god sends him a prophet of moses and moses stands there with thus saith the lord and it turns off egypt and turns on israel their eyes are quickened they're ready to go they begin to move out into a land now let me just say there's enemy in that land first major city that they're going to come to to have to fight is the best wall city in the whole land they ran chariot races across it god is not going to preserve the king he is not going to presume the council or the generals there is a harlot that has received a lot of different kind of seeds but she in his plan realizes that that's the real god that is with the children of israel he's a real god and there's something of the deep that is responding on the inside of her that's the real god two spies come and everybody else is hey i'm preaching again talking to you a little bit here so so so what happens is what happens is i'll tell dr ghana whispered so what happens is is of all of those people that wouldn't receive those spies she did and these guys come in and they begin to talk about the message and the supernatural message and they begin to tell her that this is the first city that we're actually going to destroy and it's going to come down the walls are going to come down well how can i i'm protecting you how can you protect me i believe you're god and she begins to testify to them i believe your god and they tell her to take a red scarlet thread a rope maybe to run down over the wall of her city out of her window it's a token sign god's gonna make a covenant with this harlot because god don't see her as a harlot god's not looking at her as a harlot he's looking at the end product of what i'm going to do for you god don't see your failures he don't see your mistakes he don't see your quirky little ways he sees the end product [Applause] strange thing happens that wall was incredibly ins constructed races could be run on it wars could be fought cannons could be shot fires could come and all of those walls were getting ready to come down but her peace as a matter of fact god would so curse he would so curse this city till he would curse anybody from ever building there again but when those walls fell rahab who everybody would recognize as a harlot with her family and everybody that would stay in the field or stay in the house are you getting a picture here now you see when the flood came it was only in the ark are you getting it now it's only in christ it's where you're truly safe you can build bomb shelters that won't preserve you you can turn all your money into gold that won't keep you but if you get into christ get into this word get into this message there's resurrection in it there's body changing in it i find this interesting and maybe you've never made this link but i found this interesting that when rahab becomes a a citizen identified with those israelites that god knows how to draw people together you step out of eternity into time and you're drawn together and she's drawn to the head man the captain the general salmon and she marries someone so her past is over with and she has a future when the walls didn't fall for her she had a future life wasn't over but she would be a heart at no more she could take the shingle down off of the door i'm not in business no more your god's going to be my god your people's going to be my people and she just started walking now she couldn't choose the general she couldn't choose the mighty captain she couldn't choose the mighty leader he chose her you didn't choose god god chose you [Applause] now god's got a purpose in it he's got a purpose he don't just bring you to church set you in the pew say well i'm done with him no he's got plans maybe he tells you if you trust me i'll use you like never before so that tells me i got a future i'm not looking for a hole in the ground i'm looking for a hole in the sky [Applause] so they establish a place called bethlehem it's a piece of land it's a tidal deed and they start raising barney because this is going to be the city it's got the best water and it raises the breasts wheat and barley and this is going to be the bread basket of the promised land i dare tell you now nobody called her a harlot after she became queen sure your human memory will remember the things that you used to do but don't dare nobody call you your past cause you know who you are once you're the queen of heaven and it ain't no going back no going back now sure you have an accuser should you have an accuser that point shouldn't i mean he's got a memory here everybody don't have on amnesia you've got memory you remember it's getting time for dinner there's some people probably in the building here don't remember what they had for breakfast yesterday but they can remember when they were a child they could quote those things all day long but they don't know your name they don't know your neighbor they don't know what's going on it's cause they just got old but satan will take you and take your memory and flash things before your eyes are what you used to be but you're not that guy no more looks like the same house but the guy that used to live here he died and jesus moved in and he changed our nature he didn't rehab us he created a new man on the inside all things are passed away and because all things have become new [Applause] hallelujah now i don't i don't know if you know how this works and maybe you went to school and you learned mathematics but one plus one sometimes equals three it's probably what's going to happen for the couple that stood under a tree so god ordains seed because they're part of the predestinated plan of god so out of this strange set couple that has to know what grace is about i want you to understand sometime for us to preach about prodigals you've got to have the spirit of the father to say welcome home welcome home you've got to have the spirit of forgiveness to forget hog bends and riot is living you got to be able to look at them and say welcome home you're welcome at my table you don't have to sit in the service cord you are my son welcome home so god has to when he's molding like a like a bell he puts certain chemicals in it to where that it will sound a certain way oh come on now so he has to put certain people together so that he can show his grace so he puts some on and and rehab together so they can produce a bow ass hallelujah hallelujah of all the women of israel i hope i'm okay to put it that way of all the women of israel they never attract these eye but here comes a girl with a past a history and he can't put it together he can't put it together who is this damsel she's a moabitess she's from naomi's family her being a widow didn't scare him off her being a moabitus didn't scare him off and he knew her field could preserve her she came to the right field now she don't understand redemption no way to put it all together but this was the most important man she'd ever met in her life and he goes to her not she comes to him he goes to her and he begins to talk to her let me just say this to you i can adventure by authority he never told nobody else these words stay in the field stay in the field because immediately he had plans a lot of people working but he came to you and let me just say this him coming to you is different than anybody else every one of you have a different experience with god and you can explain it and you get feelings and the other person goes that's really nice but they can't feel it but when they tell their experience tears are running down out of their eyes let me just say when you meet jesus [Music] there's just nobody like him [Applause] and he gives her instructions by the scriptures first conversation i've instructed all the young men stay away from don't you touch her you know they knew he had plans and he's the boss throw down handfuls on purpose for her because she needs it i've given her instructions you stay right here don't you go to another field let me just say this to you a lot of times in our human nature we get so ants in our pants and we want to move here move our move our we're just not satisfied come on i know i'm preaching to human beings here for a little while we get discontent with life and we're constantly looking ahead missing what's going on now sometimes people get like brother homer did at the grand canyon grand canyon remember that thomas we had traveled the best i tried to remember this morning we had traveled about six hours to get to the edge of the grand canyon we walked up we looked down we walked around a little bit brother homer said y'all ready to go seen everything you want to see what were we going to do we was looking at one of the seventh wonders of the entire world this is the place when god was making this earth he allowed the water to run through and show every element of the earth there's not two walls on the canyon a lock and he'd seen it all in five minutes remember that you remember thomas hadn't talk to us there's nobody like can talk to a daddy like a son and thomas had to have a conference with brother homer he said we came a long way daddy people come with their entire vacation just to be here we've came a long way we need to stay here for a little while we need to look around it's about the way some people do in church hallelujah i've got you in the most beautiful land we're with ruth and boaz and you looking at your watch where you going burger king ain't got nothing like this longhorn ain't got nothing like this they got some statues like i got at my house but hey they ain't got nothing like this your plans this coming week ain't this good but the devil will tell you to get in a hurry he'll tell you i'm with you now i wasn't off board he'll get you discontent it's too hot here it's too cold i didn't get to sing you know they knew that i'm a good singer i didn't get to sing i thought they'd have maybe somebody special speaking today since they had a wedding yesterday i thought they'd have somebody else brother ron again stay in the field we heard that last week i'm talking to you now and she was working in the field she kept going back to every day to the same field she didn't understand that god hid and rescind in simplicity was being handed back to her but she did it the mighty god unveiled and she did it the comforter and she'd get it and she kept coming in with great big baskets while the other ladies were you know they had to know something going on here there's something going on here you know people's got to look around and go how can people live like that how can they dress like that how can they have that kind of character where do you get kids i've had way too many principles where do you get kids what do you do to get kids like that best kids we've ever seen best young people we've ever seen i have employers call me with references have you got some more of your people that would be interested to come here but all of y'all can't be cops i need some of you to be doctors i need some of you to be lawyers i need some of you to be janitors i need some of you to be mamas shaking babies shaking oh yeah have a good time i'm going to be done here in just a second what you don't realize is going on if you can just be content just a little bit because there's something goes with this if you can be just content just a little bit you'll own the field if you make content just a little while you just hey enjoy enjoy picking up the the fragments enjoy it but in a few days you're on the field i'm waiting on you to get it i know you're working hard and you're going through and you're picking up the fragments and you're getting a bigger basket and everybody else is good i know there's times there's lean i know there's times of difficulty i know there's times of discouragement just keep working just keep working don't go to another field no matter how entertaining it looks like why brother ron they can't redeem you they're not willing to redeem you they're not willing to do the work for you but boaz because he's born of rahab he's been built to be your redeemer i'm going to finish with this and then i'll pick this up next week is that all right is that all right everybody enjoying this okay when jesus left the portals of glory to become a kinsmen redeemer he didn't come as a king he didn't come as a governor he didn't come as the owner of it all he was born to a teenage girl that everybody would be made fun of because she was now with child and rumors would go on that it was by a roman soldier and an old man who she's espoused to will become her protector so jesus would be born with a horrible name on him because illegitimate in that in that day was looked at of all the 400 years of not being able to enter the temple so he was born under a bad name because he had to get you he could not be born under a pristine reputation because he had to get you because here's where i'm going i know why boaz chose her because his mama was a harlot are you getting it now hallelujah but they don't realize she's representing the queen of heaven god became so low and then god could raise him so high and there's been days to where you felt so low ain't that right brother donny there's been days you felt so low because we had a history we had a history but when you walked into this place to work in this field god had plans i want to finish with it this morning god still got plans you may have history in your past but god's got plans for you let's stand to our feet this morning [Applause]
