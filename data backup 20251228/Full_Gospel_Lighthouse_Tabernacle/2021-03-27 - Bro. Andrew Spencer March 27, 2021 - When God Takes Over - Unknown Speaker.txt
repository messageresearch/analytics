long to worship you to stand in this presence lord stand here in the presence of the shekinah glory where the high priest was only allowed to go in once a year but to know that we can enter into your presence every single day because you rent the veil and you made a way for us we that were looked upon as aliens are now made righteous are now made redeemed are now called the chosen god we so love you with all of our hearts lord all day long lord i have been quieting myself just trying to get into your mindset oh god to find the channel father that you want to be in lord lord i know that there are things that are already happening here lord that you had already predestined lord i pray lord that we as your people would be able to tap into that channel just for a moment more lord what will happen here in the next few moments we will treasure for eternity god we encounter the privilege one more time just to stand here to deliver this word that will never fail oh god we love you i pray that you be mindful of your children tonight i pray that you'd speak lip to ear to them but they might know that it's more than andrew spencer they would know that there is an angel of the covenant that's with this message that same one that came down on ohio river that same one that came down on melsania that same one that come down on the mount of transfiguration the same one that came down on mount sunset made that same glory come and your people begin to bless your children tonight we praise your holy name take the service just now in jesus name oh do you love the lord church have your bibles this evening would like to look over in the book of first john chapter 5. john chapter 5 and verse 1. john chapter 5 and then also down to romans chapter 6. have it this evening say amen whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god what a powerful powerful scripture whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ the messiah the anointed one is born of god do you believe that he is jesus the christ that ought to identify yourself right there in that scripture and everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god romans chapter 6 and verse 16. know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey as servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin he became the servants of righteousness may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord this evening amen being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness to be standing here in this hour knowing that exactly where you're standing at is a very a very important and pertinent thing in life to know exactly where you're standing at when so many people are so so tossed about on who they are and and their identities and things but to know that god be thanked because at one point in your life that it looked like you were going one way but because you obeyed because you obeyed from your heart the doctrine that was not not of man but the doctrine of the gospel of jesus christ that has made you because you obeyed from your heart it has made you it has made you servants of righteousness and and tonight i'd like to speak to you on a thought on when god when god takes over then you can all point at your life and look at your life and see that when you were growing when you were running things in the business of your life but then you can point at a spot in your life that when god took over the business and started running things and it seemed like things when jesus started taking over for you in your life things started running a whole lot smoother when you became captivated by somebody greater than yourself but you became so possessed with a power and empowered with his spirit and taken over with more than a form of religion or more than a form of mental conception but you became taken over with the power of the anointing of our lord jesus christ and and just to be standing in that spot if you can identify that you've been taken over and that christ has come and taken over the business of your life what a blessed people that we are this evening to stand here and identify ourselves as christians in this hour when it seems like nobody wants to be identified as a christian when nobody wants to stand as a christian and when nobody wants to stand for christ there's a lot of people that want to be identified with religion and want to get by with things and get by with their sin and everybody wants to heaven everybody wants to get to heaven but nobody wants to live right to get there but you see there's something on the inside of humanity no matter what state of life that person may be in there is something on the inside of humanity that will make them that that makes that person that something on the inside of them that moves them past themselves and and moves them past their fears and every person sitting here there every person sitting here has a different fear about themselves maybe some be scared of the dark or maybe scared to go out in public or maybe scared but to eat without washing their hands or something of that nature but you see there's something on the inside of that person that that even though there's a certain element of fear or there's a certain element of of awkwardness that they push themselves past for certain things is that right you know what i'm speaking of as a parent there's certain things that you would never do but because your child gets into a spot you make yourself it's something laying there that makes you push yourself past your own fears to step out and to save your child you remember when brother branham would tell that story about the lady that was that was coming home on that train that got embarrassed because of that lady that was scarred and her friends began to mock that lady and she began to mock her because of the scars on her face and she began to act like she didn't know her you see the reason why that you know the story but you know the reason why that she stepped out that mother did that was because of the love of that child that was inside of that burning house it made her step past her comfort zone and step into a spot of fear and make her push herself past that spot are you with me this evening there's something in humanity that makes you drive there's something laying there that makes you push past yourself it'll make you actually get beyond your own thinking when you go to breaking into that channel now that's just in humanity there's a lot of great business gurus and there's a lot of great athletes that realize that if they can break past that point that they realize or past their fears or or past that comfort zone that they can go into a realm that nobody is acquainted with that's what determines and makes the difference in greatness is when somebody can step out of their comfort zone now if you watch that in humanity how much greater will it be in a spiritual world when somebody breaks past their comfort zone we've been speaking on the last couple weekends and breaking past in worship and letting go in worship but i'm not just speaking about somebody singing loud i'm not just singing i'm not talking about somebody clapping their hands loud or somebody getting emotional you can sing until you get blue in the face you can scream to your red till your face hurts you can pray to a spot that you actually get a headache you can fast to a spot that almost that your belly button almost falls off but that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about when you break past that element of humanity and break into the element of divinity now this is probably it's one of my favorite quotes by brother william branham and and and i was and i thought i would share it with you in this sermon and then brother branham he says some very pertinent things in this in this quote and i'll quote it to you you can go and look it up and save it for yourself and put it on your put it on your refrigerator if you choose to do so he said in perfect strength by perfect weakness he said the important thing one of the important things that we must master remember this and especially you young preachers and lay mental god's desire in our life that is we have to we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can use us that's right and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability are you with me tonight you see i would never get behind this pulpit counting on my own human abilities i would never get up here be all based upon my own feelings i am only standing here because of the anointing of the lord we've got to make a complete surrender and come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and in me we must master the thought of human ability you see humanity learns how to channel themselves in business humanity learns how to channel themselves in sports humanity learns their limits that they can go to but i want to say to the church of the living god there is no limit in faith in an omnipotent god when you go to channeling yourself it will determine how far you will go in god if you're only willing to go so far and receive salvation that's as far that you'll ever go but i want to tell you there's more than salvation in jesus there's deliverance in jesus there's power in jesus there's wonder working power in the blood of jesus hallelujah you see if a son of god can ever channel themselves to break into that channel and then untap resources and start pulling out those things that are pertaining to them you'll watch miracles start taking place are you with me you see there are things that you're aware of that are happening and passing through this building just now and that's why the prophet would stand there and he would tell you that he was standing in two worlds and he was watching and he was watching people and he would tell people just to to hold himself still because he was watching every one of us have a spirit and he was watching and when they would get to moving that human spirit would get to moving and demon spirits would get to moving as well and brother branham could look into that realm and pull those things out and it's amazing to me is that we can't see those things on tape but yet you know that no human ability could reach into that realm and say those things but it had to be a prophet with a prophet ministry to reach into that realm and pull those things down so that the person could have faith in it brother branham would type it and he would tell us about television that there's channels that there's things that are flying through this atmosphere just now and you know that there's things that are flying through this airwaves that you can't see you could pull up on your phone and maybe pull up youtube and you'll see where did that come from it came from a channel and what did it do it took a unit or an instrument to break into that atmosphere and to show you the vision of what was already there and it took a profit to be able to look on a people and look at a vision and tell you what was already in your past but also be able to tell you what was also in your future hallelujah hallelujah it's amazing when god begins to take over that satan knows that there's an element of faith that's being released that he cannot he cannot break past that element of faith you know that when you go to believing for healing no matter how sick you are it's amazing that satan cannot break that barrier of faith when you go to believing for a baptism of the holy ghost and seeking a real true pentecostal experience and you're believing on the son of god that he is the christ there is a barrier of faith that satan himself cannot break and when you start believing in the god of this bible and when you start believing in the god that william branham preached and when you start believing in the god that paul preached there will be nothing that will scare you off of those promises because faith is not scared of reason faith is not scared of what is seen faith is not scared of what is felt you remember when brother branham he would he was planting he had a little garden there and that groundhog kept getting into his garden and he made that ugly looking picture and put up a little tin pan and put some beans behind it that when the wind would blow that it would tap that little pan and they were doing that to scare that groundhog off from eden in his garden he said but he watched one day and got back and he got to watching that groundhog and he said at first when he ran up to that ugly looking thing he ran back off but then he got to watching it again and he started running up a little bit closer to it and he started realizing that that ain't nothing but a little scarecrow that's standing there before long he was tapping that tin pan and he was realizing that everything that he wanted was on the other side of that scarecrow that all he had to do was get past it satan has set up all kinds of scarecrows in your life but all you gotta do is run past those things if you will realize tonight not just gaze past it but break past it don't look at it don't let you be scared of it there is nothing to be scared of as a son and daughter of god you can't be scared off of god's promises you're not a little groundhog that's looking at a tin pan you are a child of god that's looking at a defeated devil that's trying to keep you off of god's promises there is a place that only god can take you and satan is trying to keep you from it you're not a groundhog and you're not a crow you're an eagle hallelujah it's like the little child that's always trying he's always trying to put his hand put his hand through that sleeve he can never if he sucks there and tries to do it all by himself a little baby can never do it by himself but it takes the power of the father to put that hand directly through there you see as long as you're sitting there and trying to do it by your own human ability you'll never walk into those promises as long as you're trying to do it by your own mind do it by do it by your own thinking you'll never get there but as soon as you can start yielding your hand to the father you start yielding your spirit to the father that's real overcoming that's a victory when you start overcoming and you start yielding yourself to him that's the idea when you start yielding to him brother davey was in the in the hospital there they were giving him some therapy on his shoulder and they were trying to teach us so that we could help him when he got home with his therapy on doing certain things and so the the therapist was trying to teach us how we could be therapists basically on pine creek lane and she said i want you to yield your shoulder to me so that you know that when davey yields his shoulder to you and so i let her take a hold of my arm and she began to she began to tell me now andrew you've not yielded yourself completely over to me you see i was still holding on but finally when i begin to release every muscle on the inside of me i yielded myself to her and she began to take my arm and move it into positions so that she could teach me how to work for brother david's arm you see it taught me a real lesson on yielding you see when you begin to put your faith or you begin to put your muscles of your intellects into it you'll never allow god to go there but when god begins to take over and you start yielding yourself to him you will see the power of the yielding when jesus was walking to the way of the garden of gethsemane we are shown the real power of yielding when he takes his closest friends with him and they walk with him into a garden and he tells him to stay here and he only goes he only goes the cast of a stone away from them and he begins to break into an atmosphere of prayer and he started praying father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me and he went back to his friends and his friends then fell asleep on him you can read the different accounts of matthew mark luke and john of how they capture this he goes at one point in one of the in one of the gospel he goes back three times to them and they say and he speaks to them he said your spirit is willing but your flesh is weak what is it showing you it is showing you that you're going to have to go to a spot that your friends are not willing able to go to young people let me speak to you right there if you want this baptism of the holy ghost if you want to make the rapture if you want to make heaven your home you got to go to a spot that your friends can't even go to you with are you with me you've got to break past your comfort zone oh hallelujah and jesus gets into a spot of prayer and the sincerity of prayer and jesus begins to break in and he comes to a spot of yielding he said father if it be your will let this cup pass from me and he spoke these powerful words nevertheless nevertheless i wonder i wonder what would be past your nevertheless i wonder what would be on the other side of your nevertheless what's really laying past your nevertheless father i i want this in my own human spirit i want to be able to walk this way i want to live with my friends i want to do i want to be with them i'm i'm so eternal that i can live forever jesus didn't have to die but on the other side of his nevertheless i wonder if yours if you're on the other side of nevertheless would be the same as jesus is nevertheless what's your other side of nevertheless be not my will but thy will be taught not my own human spirit oh hallelujah nevertheless lord not my will oh hallelujah not my will not my will but thy will be done what's on the other side of your nevertheless something's laying on the inside of you that they can only come forth in your nevertheless that lily right there to me is one of the most beautiful flowers but it's laying it's it's being produced to you in its glory and its power because of a nevertheless are you with me there's a lot of people you enjoy it right here you enjoy its beauty you enjoy it splendor it testifies to you of the resurrection power of our lord jesus christ that he is the author of all things he is the author of life but there was a spot in this lily's life that you never appreciated it you never appreciated that lily when he was underneath the ground but do you realize that on the other side of this was a nevertheless and it had to break itself it had to break itself underneath the soil you couldn't see it you couldn't appreciate it but when it began to break when you couldn't see it hallelujah when somebody gets past their own emotions past their own feelings past who sees them past who don't see something they'll become a breaking forth oh hallelujah that little lily stands there in its glory because of what took place under the soil i'm looking at a bunch of people that are standing here because i nevertheless i'm willing to break past in my dirt you may be so infiltrated with sin in your life so caught up in drugs so caught up in your past but when god takes over [Applause] when god says your mind when god says i'm big enough to cover all your sins when i'm big enough to take care of you you didn't understand my beauty when i was underneath all of that sin but when i come up out of that ground it begin to testify to you that he's the same yesterday today and forever if he can do it for gabriel if he can do it for malachi he can do it for you hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah jesus so emphatically knew who he was that he was willing to break past his nevertheless he knew what the scripture said pertaining him he knew who he was can i say that jesus was comfortable in his own skin when he stood there and he didn't answer them a word when they hit him in the mouth when they hit him upside the head he was comfortable in his own skin because he knew what isaiah had said about the lamb are you with me he was comfortable when he started walking and they put him upon the fold of an ass and they started screaming hosanna hosanna blessed be the lord he was comfortable where he was at he was comfortable where he was at and when he oh church i could see him now when he's breaking past his own nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he was comfortable in his skin knowing that i'm going to pay the price for justin klein that i'm going to pay the price for joe and kelly he was comfortable because he knew what the scriptures were pertaining him if you can ever get comfortable with jesus in your flesh you'll set worlds on top of worlds you'll turn them upside down hell don't know what to do with somebody that's comfortable with jesus on the inside of them you can walk around knowing what the scripture said about you sure sure you got chains sure you got stigmas sure you got complexes but if you can ever break past that i don't know what he's doing but he's doing it i don't know why he's got me preaching to you on the power to yield but he's got me preaching on it i don't know why he's got me preaching to you about a seed breaking forth past all them sins but he's got me preaching on it i don't know why he's telling me to tell you for you to get comfortable with jesus living on the inside of you but he's telling me to tell you to get comfortable with jesus living on the inside of you now you can't be comfortable with jesus living in you when you got the devil living in you [Music] but if you ever want to get comfortable with jesus you got to get rid of the old things let the old things be passed away and all things be made new in christ jesus hallelujah if you can get yourself good and comfortable with jesus you'll let jesus talk every once in a while if you'll get good and comfortable you'll stand up and you'll start speaking in tongues like jesus did if you ever get so yielded to the holy ghost and get comfortable in your skin with jesus watch out fig trees are getting ready to be cursed mountains are getting ready to be moved strongholds are getting ready to be cast down when you get comfortable with jesus speaking through you and jesus living through you hallelujah if you get comfortable with jesus jesus will walk into your house and kick out your dirty music [Applause] if you get comfortable with jesus he'll walk into your house and kick them skeletons out the closet there ain't enough room for jesus and a bunch of dead skeletons living in the same household but when god starts taking over when it starts taking over you begin to see that power the same power that raised jesus from the dead the same power that same one you realize that jesus was a man like you jesus had 16 elements and built out of the same materials like you and i he may have had a dark complexion like brother william barlavon he may have stood about six foot tall anymore he may have walked a certain way and carried it but jesus was made out of the same materials that you were made out of but jesus realized the power of who he was so much that when he realized that he was more than a man he said i come not to do my own will but i came to do the will of the father and when jesus let god begin to take over in his life he said i can't speak these things unless the father first showed me but he realized when god started taking over he was a man he was a man when he was crying at lazarus tomb but he was more than a man when he said lazarus come forth he was a man when he was weeping he was a man when he was tired in a boat but he was more than a man when he stood up out of that boat and he said peace be still i want to say to you church of the living god that same jesus is comfortable in his body tonight the hands move just like jesus said the feet move just like jesus said the god of peace will bruise satan under your feet hallelujah when you begin to get comfortable that means getting comfortable you begin to let your faith loose on what he has said about you there's not gonna be a mountain standing away of jesus and there won't be a mountain standing your way and when rahab let her faith loose in what the spies had said to her when they told her if you put down this token right here the destroying angel can't even get close to your household when she got good and comfortable with letting the spies go out and hide them and keep them and take on what they had said when she got comfortable with getting everybody on the inside of her house that destroying angel could tear down every brick around her house but it couldn't touch hers because there was a promise there was a covenant and she was comfortable with what the spies had said there is a people on earth today that is comfortable with a prophet's message they're comfortable with calling william branham a prophet calling him malachi 4 calling him revelations 10 7. but it don't stop there they're comfortable in saying i am revelations 10 8. i am he that was spoke of that no weapon that's formed against me shall prosper that when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise up the standard there's a body on earth rahab already had everything that she had to lay that token out there on that window she already had it in her house all that had to be done was applied hey somebody in the house tonight that all you got to do he's already here the blood's already here the atonement's already been made all you got to do is apply it you got everything you have need of if you got the baptism of the holy ghost every redemptive blessing that jesus christ paid for at calvary has already been placed in your hands all you've got to do is obtain it and say god i apply that to my household now jesus said verily i say unto you in 11 mark 11 24 he said if you say to this mountain be moved and no doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said he said that puts him right back supreme again it puts him right back in the condition he said now now we're made up of light meters inside of us is cosmic light now that cosmic light is a light that can take an x-ray with an x-ray their x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray light it comes from your own light and then if that cosmic light say could be pushed to a place to where not cosmic light but eternal light could dwell supremely to do our thinking to do our walking to do our talking then it's no longer the man it's the god in the man if he will yield to the spirit the more he becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes more godlike the more you yield yourself to the holy spirit the more unmanned you become i want you to ponder that just for a moment this humanity will fail you i'm only 33 years old and humanity the flesh is already failing me gray hair is popping up in places that my children said daddy you can't be getting that old yet what is it humanity is failing me you watch as you get older you begin to watch humanity fail you your hair will fall out your teeth will fall out your eyes that have been perfect all their life now you need these things called readers because humanity is constantly failing but the more you yield yourself to the holy spirit the more unmanned you become man i hope you catch this the more you yield yourself the more unmanned you become now you can sit there and wallow in your own self-pity because humanity is failing you or you can yield to the holy spirit that will take you to a new body well you don't have to worry about the manhood no more you don't have to worry about womanhood no more you don't have to worry about sinner like no more but when you get that new body you ain't thinking about humanity failing you you ain't worried about your wings failing you you're only worried about one thing that's worship in him all the days of your life hallelujah he said now we he said if we could just completely yield to the holy ghost and give us super strength to rise in the name of jesus christ because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the strength in god that's in you is greater than any affliction that can come upon you there is nothing that can overtake you that can supersede you because you're full of superpower and that superpower is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you're a christian oh hallelujah how many is a christian in the night there's nothing that can supersede you there's nothing that can overtake you there's no sickness that can harm you there's no disease that can hurt you oh hallelujah hallelujah when you go to reading over in second kings chapter four and he started reading about a little woman that she recognized that there was a prophet in the land and she wanted to prepare a place that when the prophet was coming by that he could stop by her house though he may have been out on a revival he could stop by her house he could lay down on that little chamber in that bed that she had prepared for him because she had prepared a place for god's servant to lay down and he began to talk to his servant to hazel and said what could we give her what could god give her and dehazer started speaking she don't have a son she don't have a son why don't you give her a son why don't you give her son and the prophet began to speak to her and tell her that she was going to bring forth a son you she said she said don't deceive me don't you deceive me like this here i am i'm childless don't deceive me like this but when the appointed time came the child came forth because she had prepared a place for the prophet to stay in was because she brought forth life oh hallelujah i just spoke volumes to a people that's prepared a place for a prophet hallelujah but there come a time in life when that young man had died died out working had a heat stroke went up in his bed and died there and this little woman was so full of faith in that chamber that she had built for the prophet that she took that dead son and laid him up there on that chamber and when no life had come she said make ready make ready my tray my traveling party i'm going to mount carmel to see elijah if you could get your traveling party you'll start seeing dead sons come back to life are you with me i don't care how you got to go if you got to get on a mule if you got to get on a horse if you got to get on an airplane if you can just start going to a place where you know there's resurrection power if the same god that can give you a son he can surely bring him back to life again oh have you prepared a place for him to come she made her way up there and they started looking on this woman of need so that's a shooter my woman what's she doing what is she doing coming all the way up here let me ask you what are you doing driving an hour all the way up here what are you doing spending all your energies coming all the way up here what are you doing spending all your energy seeking the baptism of the holy ghost what are you doing and gahesha goes down to meet her but you kept on walking when the person comes walking to you and they ain't the one you just keep on walking are you with me are you with me just keep on walking till you get to a spot that you know you're gonna get hurt [Applause] you might walk to a spot you may have prayed in your bedroom and it seemed like you never got nowhere but all of a sudden you got in your car got yourself quiet got yourself shut alone and you got somewhere with god what was taking place what was taking place it's god taking over he's saying more this is more than a story this is more than just a woman praying and asking about her son this is god that's a type church and you are the antitype it's time for you start calling for dead peoples to start coming back to life again it's time that the prodigals that we've prayed for to start walking back into this church [Applause] hallelujah if you let god start taking over in your life you'll walk if you let god start taking over in your life you'll pray like you never pray if you'll let god start taking over in your life you'll worship like and never worship in your life if you'll let god take over what can hold you back when god starts taking over my situation's too big my circumstance too big what is it when god starts taking over she made her way all the way up there to elijah the hazel wasn't good enough for it are you with me sometimes sometimes you need more than andrew spencer come knocking on your door you need jesus i'll be with you i'll fight with you but you need somebody bigger than me to come the trouble waters of your soul i can tell you how to get to him i can tell you where he lives at he's the same yesterday today and forever if you'll start digging back in this word you'll find where you can get that resurrection power at notice her faith is all well can you answer that question on the other side of your nevertheless is all well with you brother ray it's oh well are there circumstances in your life is it all well or maybe some uncertain things that are there some things that you don't understand it's all well her faith says all is well what part of that woman was speaking that she was on the other side of her nevertheless and god honored her faith he says hazel you take my you take my rod and you go lay it on that son she said did you deceive me i didn't ask you for this i didn't ask you for this son you asked me you asked me you gave me this did not i asked you don't mock me don't mock me my childlessness don't move did you deceive me hazel take my staff she said as my soul liveth i'm not gonna leave you she was on his hands and elijah said i'm not gonna stay here with you on my hands i'm going to your knee oh hallelujah maybe you've been knocking on heaven's door and you're laying there you just keep knocking for him that knocketh it shall be opened to him and he that seeketh you shall find and the prophet goes to a spot that he's been comfortable before i've laid here before i've been here before i wonder if that same jesus said you've been crying out for all your needs you've been calling out for him because you've been sick now there's a lot of people that call on him when they get sick but after they get well they just run off and leave him but i wonder if there's a spot prepared for jesus that he's already comfortable in laying down in is there a spot already comfortable for jesus to lay in and he starts laying down i've been there before i've worshiped there before i've seen the anointing there before i've seen my own self lay down in that body before i'm comfortable in that woman i'm comfortable in that man i've been there before i know that if i meet their need they won't leave me high and dry they'll walk with me they'll talk with me [Applause] oh oh hallelujah oh hallelujah is jesus comfortable in your own skin that he could come to your situation that he could come to your need and he can lay himself down i'm the son of man that spoke that life and those 16 elements came and that woman that had so long for a child that fleshly lifeless what was that laying on the inside of that prophet that was speaking those things that was the son of man the word that spoke that life and when that same life that had spoke that son into existence began to lay itself down upon itself he laid there he lay there on this dead corpse and nothing was moving he laid there he laid there he laid that way he'd been comfortable before he laid there and he'd been he'd been friends with this boy before but now there's no life and all of a sudden something come up all the way from his feet and elijah sneezed seven times a life came back into a dead corpse elijah was not deceived by the son of man that was in him that spoke that life there when he started seeing that life come and raise up again he realized i wasn't the one that spoke that and when a preacher gets to a spot that he realizes i'm not the one that spoke that they were in that human ability they were warn that human mind but when they get to that spot i'm ah i didn't speak that i didn't say that but jesus says i'm comfortable i'm the one that said that i'm the one that spoke that i will back it up and vindicate what i spoke [Applause] jesus is comfortable in the body of jesus christ i'm the one that said that she'll be blameless she'll be spotless she'll be holy i'm comfortable in living there because i predetermined that house or was it what was it but was it on the inside of elijah god had taken over they were not the messiah they were little messiahs they were my science they had the same anointing they had the same anointing the same power the same life but in a form that it would come and anoint them and god so took over elijah and he could speak those words to him you'll never sneeze the same you'll never handle yourself the same when you get comfortable with jesus living there life shook you up a little bit life gives you some some rough roads life seemed to be more than you could handle but i want you to know you may live on a dirt road and it may look like jesus won't walk your way but i want you to know that jesus will walk in the most unpredictable places he will walk in the most unpredictable places he'll make a highway out of nothing are you with me when peter looked out there and he seen he seen what he said i thought lord is that you it is i be not afraid what did he do he made a highway for peter to walk on you may look like you're in some unpredictable spots in life but jesus knows how to make a highway out of nothing your life may be a wreck your life may be in shambles your humanity may be tore up and scarred up but there's a god oh hallelujah there's a god that's wanting to walk on your waters don't you criticize me don't you criticize me for falling when i got my eyes on the circumstances of life i walked on water once you can call me simon peter all you want to you can make fun of me and criticize me all you want to but i walked on water once i know what it's like to hold his head i know what it's like to walk to him i realize that if i can walk on him once he's the god of second chances he'll let me walk on it twice and just when i felt like there was no way for me to get back up i saw a hand because god took over i'm going to say something mark spencer god's making a highway ray lambert god's making a highway katie spencer god's making a highway ron spencer god's making a highway are you comfortable enough with the man that's standing outside your boat to step out are you comfortable enough to know that he's a master of the wind are you comfortable enough to know that he is the author of your life surely he'll be the finisher of it are you comfortable to know that he is the one that was dead but is now alive again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah wonder who would be that one that would say overtake me overtake me overtake me lord overtake me lord oh take me lord overtake my faith overtake my feelings let my faith rise to a level that i'm comfortable with you living in my skin over overtake my faith overtake my females overtake my symptoms overtake my problems overtake my ideas overtake me

spot in your life and say this is so much bigger than me [Music] i think you watched a minister tonight come to a spot to where he realized this service is way bigger than i am that's the reason we can never have man worship we must keep our focus on god because he wants to be the center focus of our lives and when we realize we can't do nothing without him [Music] even jesus would say i cannot do anything except my father shows me first what is god preparing us for he's going to take your flesh and transform it not just heal your cold [Music] not just try to get into your emotions a bit but he's got to take that body from this dimension mortal to immortality and it's got to be to the point to where that your gravity will turn loose [Applause] [Music] you turn hallelujah enough to let him take you home [Music] hallelujah your eyes will not be on the world but it'll be so on him you'll start walking like enoch walked [Music] and you'll step from one dimension to another dimension or
