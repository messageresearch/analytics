just Bauer heads Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we can just come and be in your presence tonight Lord we know the burdens that that we have all faced we know the trials and temptations that we're all faced throughout the week whether it was sicknesses or mind battles that Satan came to us but Lord Jesus you are worthy and you are worthy to come and you came and you were born in a from a womb that was created created by God and Lord Jesus you came down at this time and and you came to save us from from our sins that we could not save ourselves the Lord Jesus says As we walk our walk we we may stumble we may we may miss that but you were always there to pick us up and Lord Jesus we just we just ask that you'll just come down and be with us tonight as each and every one of the prayer requests were were brought across the pulpit this afternoon I just ask that you will go and be there with each and every one of them we just I just think of these patients that that they're battling cancer and they go to their doctor's appointments and they follow the checkups and they follow the procedures and they're following each and every step that that man has been able to do and we're so thankful for those steps but Lord Jesus we are speaking to the the great High physician that can come down and wipe every cancerous cell out of their body Lord and Lord Jesus we are just so thankful for everything you have done for us you we don't have one day that one day that is guaranteed for us we could be in full health and not be here tomorrow Lord and we can we can be facing death's door and and you give us another 10 15 years or he was completely and allow us to walk right into the rapture or Jesus and we don't know our steps but Lord Jesus I just ask that you will just come down and speak to the minister tonight speak through him that if anyone that would be here would would be bound by chains Bound by chains that may not may not even know what's going on during the ball and chain where they can walk so far and then Satan pulls them right back into the Trap that he has set for them I just ask that you would just lose those chains Lord Jesus I think about that the testimony that our pastor has said when he was up in Alaska and the his his preaching would go across the bullhorn and there would be a man that was AWOL from the AWOL from the Army up there but Lord Jesus you knew exactly where he was at and you brought him right back to you because Lord Jesus there is when you are a seed it doesn't matter where you are you may be walking the streets of streets of New York doing the things that that you may be doing and thinking that you've got your own path but Lord Jesus you know exactly where the seed and the time when that seed is supposed to sprout forth and Lord Jesus we just ask that you will just come forward and water each seed break the chains tonight Lord Jesus Break the chains of sickness of sin and allow us to walk in full health as we leave this building tonight in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] amen at this time we're going to receive this evening's offering you give us God's blessed you ask brother Stephen short if he'd come

through your children right now that you are worthy to be praised and father how we love you Lord with with an undying love father we love you so much father that the words Escape us father inabilities would would cease father our ability cease father inabilities to bring forth words Lord that would be adequate to your stature of how great that you truly are to think that you would have went for just one you went for the cross you would have went just for one but you went for all of us tonight and we return and give you thanks father we praise you father for you are wonderful we praise you father for all your Mighty acts we praise you to know that you're not dead and you're not hidden in the grave you're not hidden behind a tomb you're not living in a womb of Flesh necessarily in Mary but you're living in a bride's body again and father we recognize Lord Jesus that the son of man is revealed in the bride's body father we're asking Lord that you would come and Lord I pray that you'd see fit father Lord Jesus to come and rest upon every one of us here tonight Lord many of us have had maybe difficult times or upsetting things happen this week father Lord busyness of life sometimes begins to flog and fog our mind up and begin to fog our mind and make us think things or make us bombarded in a way that we can't just really break through or enter into the service but father I pray father that you would Break Forth Lord in this congregation just now I pray you break forth with demonstration and power father and I pray there will be such a love in this room that every person would forgive all of their enemies father they'd forgive all of their debts Lord that maybe this one or that one father Lord I pray that such an atmosphere of creation would would come in this building father that they would begin to begin to create we create life Lord with their words Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would just be high and lifted up Lord there's many needs amongst us and I know that you're in the room father heal and to meet every single need father Lord I ask God that you would just take I pray you take the hero tonight I pray you hear through them I pray that you take the speaker father and you'd speak to him I pray that you'd silence my lips father but I pray that you'd open them Father to where you see the fit to open father Lord let it not be me Lord but let it be Christ identifying himself in this generation once again we thank you Lord for the opportunity to praise you and to bring forth this word in this hour we ask God if you would just have your will in your way in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it man we trust you all had a wonderful week and I trust you had a wonderful week amen I certainly enjoy this this season of life that we're in and I believe it's a time for us to rejoice in the Lord and and I certainly appreciate Christmas season and and all that it means to us and it's not the business of life that makes Christmas it's him and uh and I would like to I'd like to speak to you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to just let you be turned in there while we make these comments John chapter 15 verse 5 and then to Isaiah chapter 28. and I'd like to I'd like to uh speak to you again one more time in the same vein of thought that we've been in for the past couple weekends and Lord willing will bring our Christmas message to you next weekend and and uh I'd like to I'd like to speak to you tonight on on resting in the most high resting in the most time as I said I'd like to stay in that same vein or that same channel of thought so that you can just prepare your mind to get there and I titled it just a little bit different because sometimes if you don't just don't change the title sometimes people think you're preaching the same old thing again so I change the title for you that might get a little bored of my title so but I'd like to speak to you tonight on resting resting in the most high and I appreciate that song Sister Sister Julia you just tapped right into the into the channel there and and so we just want to look at the look at the word here and look into the Lord I'd like to read first here from John chapter 15 and verse 5. Jesus said I am the Vine and ye are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing I say that together for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10. that word that word abide there in the Book of John chapter 15 it means to stay it means to rest and Jesus said if you abide in me if you stay in me if you rest in me and my words rest in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you it's easy it's easy to get flustered it's easy to get worried but it's a wonderful thing to rest Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10. for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line and hear a little and they're a little for with stammering lips and an unknown and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may be may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you this evening just for a moment in time on on resting resting in the most high God in Isaiah 28 and 12 it says that this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear we we just look into we look into the Ephesian Church age just for a moment to to gather some things but we recognize that when that when God is speaking to the the church at Ephesus that there John is writing and having these Visions on the Isle of Patmos that there John begins to be caught up into the spirit and be caught up into the Lord's day we recognize that John was able to reach all the way over all the way over into the Ephesian Church age all the way over into the laodicean church age was Able by the way of a vision was able to see the things that we are going through but recognize what the Bible says here in Revelations 2 and 1 that these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks brother Brandon said now where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst and not only in their midst as an as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church Hallelujah he said who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club or a meaningless Gathering of people as a corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes for the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all and all so we recognize that all the way that God is God no matter where he's at that God was showing himself in the midst of the Ephesian Church age that he was Hebrews 13 and 8 and he comes all the way down into the laodicean church age the last Church age where God would show himself and he shows himself as faithful and he shows himself as the amen that God has the finality to be able to say what he wants to and say what he will when he wants to and how he wants to and all the way from the Ephesian Church age all the way to the laodicean church age he is proving that he is the same yesterday today and forever and you see he is the church's life he is the bride's life he is her achievements he is her motivation and we recognize that this body this broad body that that God has presented in this last day to stand up and to be a token to the entire world that this bride's body is not a Bejeweled corpse that's just set up in a corner you know it's a hard thing to carry around a dead body sometimes and it's got no life in it if you ever tried to carry somebody that's passed out or tried to get them tried to get them back up there's no life in them they've completely went out and can you imagine carrying around a dead man and packing him around could you imagine God packing around a dead wife everywhere he went and said this is the wife that I've chosen to live out and finally live out the finality of the message of this hour but this broad body is not that of a Bejeweled corpse that has to be propped up that has to be set over in the corner and says she's still got life in her she doesn't have to be propped up by works she don't have to be profitable by intellect she don't have to be propped up by by formalities but the body that the body that is living in this hour has the same life has the same token has the same manifestation has the same works that her Lord Jesus Christ had and you notice that there is a Harmony that is in between her and the bridegroom it is him that is in the midst of her that is doing the works it's not the body it's not it's not necessarily the woman but it's the life that is living being pushed out of her that is making her expression of what Christ was then two thousand years ago if you wanna if you want to say well I would love to sing Jesus 2000 years ago walk on the shores of Galilee I would have loved to seen him walking walk over and heal the Widow of Maine's son I would have loved to been there when he healed the leper I'll say if you wanted to see it then you can see it right now because if he's still the same in his body he's got to do the same actions got to have the same power half because I got to have the same life and if you want to see Jesus today we ain't going to look for him in a book somewhere we're not going to look for him in some picture but we're going to look for him in the bride's body and I brother Brandon said I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in the bride's body again now notice it notice to think that right here in the worst of all the ages that the most high is operating at full capacity to think that there is nothing that is holding him back in operating in his body to think that that he's got a wife that is fully submitted unto him that is willing to willing to let loose of everything that she that she knows and everything that she's built up or maybe maybe she's gathered knowledge of of religion throughout the years but because of a new birth she was willing to let go of all of the formalities of all the ideas of what she thought about who the Christ was but when she came and was birthed under this anointing she come and gave up everything that she was and to think that right here in the worst of all the ages when it's so dark out there that it that it looks like hell's getting hotter than it ever has but right now God is operating in the body of Jesus Christ at full capacity she's not holding him back but I'll say this that God has got full Liberty in the bride's body tonight I'll say that God ain't scared to work through his body God ain't scared what she'll do God each teared how you act because he knows that you're fully submitted unto him and to think that right now that you're resting you're not resting in a man's word I'll say this even go a little bit further you're not resting in William branham's own marriage you're not resting in his in his own abilities but you're resting in the power of the Holy Ghost if it was just a man that brought this powerful message I say my goodness he could have died on the cross for us if it was just a man but it's not a man's doing it's the anointing of the Holy Ghost that is operating in a message Church foreign think that right now you can live you can live in perfect peace and rest rest in him completely rested it's an amazing thing when you can drift off and I'm not talking about drifting off right now I got something to say to you but when you can really rest at it when you you can really rest you ever got one of them crack job plumbers come in your house and said they could really do something and that you got more leaks after they come in I've not had any plumbers come in my house lately so I'm just I'm just telling you I'm just speaking to you on this but have you ever had somebody come in say they could really do the job and then after they come in and do the job you got more problems you got more problems than that than you had in the first place but you know it's amazing thing that when you can fully rely on a contractor to be able to come in and do the job that he said that he's able to do and sit back you can you can go eat your meatloaf and you can go have your mashed potatoes while he's over there fixing your problems and you're not worried about what the situation is going to be because you're fully resting that he's able to fulfill his job and I'll say this that God is fully able to put this body in the Rapture I think it's an amazing thing that we can sit here tonight and have complete rest tonight knowing that he's in control I don't have to make up how they're going to get in there I don't have to make up or get unsettled about what the what this one's doing or that one's doing I rest in the promises that he is faithful it's easy to get flustered it's easy to get frustrated especially at this old flesh to think that that the older that we get the more this flesh it flustrates us we get all hot and bothered because we we get our hot flashes and hot and bothered by by all the things that my wish I wish I could do that like I used to be able to do it you know you know I'd say everybody that's 80 years old here tonight wishes that they had the body of a 30 or a 40 year old person again so that they could get out there and do the work that they want to do even though their mind might be able to operate at a level where they can think that they can still do it you better not because you're going to end up getting hurt even myself I recognize that this fast this flesh is failing me that the owner that I get the more I wake up stiff the more I wake up and think my where did that backache come from it didn't hurt there yesterday but it just moved up a little bit higher but you see we become into a spot where we recognize that we've got to have a way out of here we've got a way we've got to get out of this old pest house that that keeps aching our body where we have sciatica pain where we have high blood pressure where we have all of these anxieties of life that are built up against us and it seems like you can't have peace no more it's an amazing thing to actually say that you have peace in your home in this Century that you're living in they actually have a life that that doesn't come that doesn't just dump all of our problems on you but have a wife that actually loves you and can create an atmosphere of peace is an amazing thing but to recognize that to live in a world of perfect peace is only for us to let people but do you realize that that brother Bynum would tell us that brother Burnham tell us he had said he said you're all the time unsettled he said you can't find peace or unsettled peace he said you don't have no peace he said it wasn't meant for you to have peace here he said if you did you'd get cut you'd get accustomed to the world he said but God don't want you getting customized to this world he wants you to rest in him come to him then you have peace I don't care what takes place he said if you said the Russians is fixing to pull the trigger at this minute they're sending an atomic bomb a real born-again Christian has Eternal peace in his heart nothing there's nothing that can harm him he said let the bullet fire he said why the smoke won't be scattered out across the street here until we'll be gone in the glory with Jesus standing there Immortal in his likeness never to be sick never to have a heartache never to have disappointment you see God doesn't want you getting into a spot where you get accustomed to this world he wants you to rest in him he don't want you resting in your ability Abraham never had the ability when he was 100 years old in his own flesh to be able to produce an Isaac but when he met Melchizedek then for 25 years it's been promised to him but when Melchizedek comes he's in complete rest how am I going to make for Rapture how am I going to get through the bride's in complete rest now notice the Bible tells us in Hebrews 2 and 8 that thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all uh put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor but he my that he by the grace of God should taste death for every one and we see the world geographically he said we see signs we see earthquakes in diverse places nations against Nations he said we see all the things that's predicted we see fearful sights he said we see the skies man's Hearts feelings were fear flying saucers and so forth they that they can't explain it investigating judgments that's come upon the Earth he said we see the atomic bombs hanging Yonder everywhere in the great missiles can can carry total Destruction in an hour we see the gases hanging over above us there he said we that would rain fires down out of the heavens and destroy the Earth we see all that he said but we see Jesus who made the promise to see you've got to have you've got to have him on your mind it's easy to get flustered it's easy to get worried it's easy to get anxiety in the world that we're living here but we are not looking where the rest of the world is looking at we see Jesus but I'll tell you the problem with so many with so many people around me around tertanity and I won't just say the message but around churchanity as a whole that that there is a people that care more about their image than they care about the image of Christ there are preachers that care more about their their image as a preacher that they can't go here or they can't go there or they can't preach that truth or they'll lose their meal ticket they're more scared of losing their image instead of being an image of Christ you see there's a lot of people that care more about their image because they they don't they they're never going to let loose to worship Him in spirit and in truth because they think more about their image if I let myself loose really to how I really feel like I'm going to let myself loose Then I then I'll make to fool of myself that's exactly what God is wanting you to do he can't use any of you he's wanting he's wanting you to be an image of him let me say this if I was worried about my image there's no way I'd get up here I'd scream and I'd holler and I'd slobber all over this Pulpit if I was worried about my image but baby I didn't come too far down the road I could care about a hill of beans as much about your opinion on what you think about how I should and how I ain't acting I don't care what it comes it's the burden of the word that is bringing forth a manifestation if it destroys my image but it produces the image of Christ I don't care let it produce it [Applause] we got too many people that even sit around the ranks of the message and say well I don't want no part of that Holy Roller business I ain't I've been in this message the whole entire my whole entire life and I ain't seen a Holy Roller yet I've been in this message a long time and I've never seen the Holy Ghost act up one time yet but a lot of times people are afraid to lose their image as a message believer and think we're just back in the days of traditions no more let me say this if you're afraid to shout if you're afraid to dance if you're afraid to amen if you're afraid to pray you are too afraid [Applause] I I hear a prophet saying I don't care if I got to speak in tongues I don't care about it I got crow in tones whatever I gotta do let me do according to the word of the Lord then you've got people that that actually let themselves loose to the liberty of the Holy Ghost and they're worried about what other people said and because they're afraid well you know maybe this ain't the right time to shout let me tell you right now is the perfect time anytime's a perfect time [Applause] and you they're because there's certain fears I don't know why I'm here but let me say this if you are fully adopted as a son and daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost have the mind of almighty God you can never act out of the spirit [Applause] you will always be in the spirit if the spirit of the most high is dwelling in the Church of the Living God tour of me to Psalms 91 that was completely free for you back to the message notice notice what's Psalms 91 we're very familiar with it but notice notice that the targum Intimates that that this dialogue that is set forth here in Psalms 91 that it is a dialogue between David and Solomon and David and Jehovah and so we we see here that that that that David he is reporting to Solomon in Psalms 91 that he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and Solomon says back to David that I will save the Lord that he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust and David goes and goes on and says from all the way from verse 3 to down to verse 13 surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the error that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted that Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thou right hand but it shall not come nothing notice this is David talking to talking to Solomon he's telling him all of these things none of this is going to come nothing only with on Ice shall they behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall be there shall no evil befall thee Solomon neither so any plague come thigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone thou shall tread upon the lion and the adder the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou trample under his feet this has been a conversation between David and his son Solomon but now Jehovah begins to talk what is Jehovah about to do he is confirming everything that David has said to his son he said because this is Jehovah's words because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he has known my name Hallelujah he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation Jehovah comes behind David's words and he backs up what he said and he confirms it to him and I am convinced and I am concerned and recognized that Jehovah is here to back up the message and we are like Aaron that walked into the holies of holies you're not going to have to worry you've been dressed right you've been dressed right you've been anointed right your Praise Is Right your Worship Is Right because by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body we didn't get into this bright Body by handshake by some man's idea but what we thought it was or what somebody else thought it was we got in this message because the spirit's all fit for us to get here foreign a covenant with Abraham and you're you you just you just bear with me as I as I as I lay these things just for a moment that God had swore a covenant a covenant with Abraham that thy seed would possess the Gate of its enemies that I'm going to give you a land that that is going to be flowing with milk and honey and you notice that he give him he gave him the promise of the promised lamb and I want you to notice that that when God gave that promise to Abraham in the minds of human fathers and human mothers I'd say Joshua wasn't even in the picture because if you look at the time frame that is laying there between between when God speaks to Abraham until Joshua goes in it's over 660 years before before Joshua Emerson or enter into the promised land there's a whole lot of time that is laying there but God is not bound by time because God sees what your future is and I'll say it doesn't matter what you're going through God already sees what your future is but I want you to know that every time that God begins to speak to his children that Satan sends his little demons up there to listen in on what God has had because the only way because Satan is not omniscient he's not all knowing so he has to send out his ranks to listen to what God is going to say so that he can form a plan so he hears Abraham and God having a conversation that I'm going to give you this land and I'm going to I will tell you where it's going to be I'll tell you where your land's going to be at Abraham you look North you look South you look West and you look East and I'll tell you that's going to be your land so what did Satan do he sent out his little army everywhere because he knew that he couldn't stop him on his own so he sent out his arm and said well I guess I'll get them from all sides if they come in the East I'll be over there if they go over the West I'll be over there you see Satan has been working against the Church of the Living God for a long time but I want you to know that every time that Satan knows that you're about to possess new land whether it be healing whether it be blessings whether it be Deliverance you can call out what you have need of if you're getting ready to possess new land Satan knows and he will move in and he will occupy your blessings to keep you off of the land you trust me I'm giving you a prophet's quote and paraphrasing it but let me read it to you because some legalistic person on the internet think I'll just make this up he said but God proved his loyalty to his promise by Abraham then he told him his seed that he'd sojourn in a Strange Land and they did but he said he would bring them out and give them that land wherein he dwelt he said notice what brother random said he said now since that time since the time that Abraham made a covenant with him he said since that time the Emirates of Paris Heights the heavy assats the jebusites and all the Gentile Heathen Nations had taken over this beautiful paradise in there and he had occupied in that land yet God had promised it oh you think about this is 660 to 685 years that Satan's been at work going over in that land and tearing about and tearing apart a perfect Paradise he sent out amarites he sent out hivites he sent out dirty websites to go over there and destroy the land before you ever got there I'll say this that Satan has been working on your mind battle that you have this week way before you ever got here Satan has been planning out how to keep you out of the land but the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy 2 and 31 behold I have begun to give you the land you begin to possess the land you see there are going to be obstacles that stand in your way but move towards your promise move in not fear in any opposition I tell you what this was he was an ending of Israel wandering and it was a beginning of them beginning to possess the land they had circled the mountain long enough they'd wondered about mountains long enough but God is saying it's your time to possess it you've wondered about it all your life but now it's time to possess it I'll say this that as soon as a message hit the earth the bride's body begin to not long and no longer Wonder but she began to possess every promise that was laid there for her which since 1963 when the seals was ripped off the book there is a lamb's wife that is standing here that's fully adopted has an open book in her hand she's not wondering if the message is right she knows it's right she's not guessing about it she's not wondering about it she knows that the message will take her into a promised land and change her body all right I'll tell you the trouble of it is Satan knows that you're right it's amazing that Satan knows that you're right and he makes you question whether you're right or not he knows that if you got in this building tonight that you would gain strength for two to three months from now you would gain strength from eternity so he tried everything to keep you from getting into this service tonight but behold I've begun to give you the land begin to possess the land I've already give you the Holy Ghost possess the Holy Ghost I've already given you the healing possess your healing I've already give you a baby talking possession I've already give you a baby I've already give you a miracle possess your Miracle it's a time that we enter in to what God has already built for us I ain't shook up about it I'm resting in it [Applause] let's rest in the theory this rest ain't a Creed this rest ain't an idea but God is our rest just like when he began to speak to speak to Moses over there God knew that he was going to be the deliverer when it didn't look like it but notice what the words of Jehovah was to him in Exodus 23 and 20 that behold I'll send an angel before they to keep thee and bring you into a land that I prepared before you and he was telling Moses I'm going to be with you I'm going to go before you and he had signs pouring for a performed in his message in his ministry and Moses was fully resting in the one that he met up there in the burning bush you see it was a whole lot more than Fred than his mama telling him that the message was right but he had met the personal person of the message up there on that mountain and he knew that God was going to be with him he had troubles with Pharaoh he had trouble with a bunch of legalistic people down there in Egypt he had a bunch of backsliders down there but yet he had a promise over him that he was going to bring them out no matter what the critics say no matter what the skeptic said God said I'm going to be with you he wasn't worried about it he was resting in the promise he was resting in it and he told him I'm going to be with you I'm gonna go with you I'll be there you see and they knew they were on the road to the land of the rest and that God had given him a rest a place where they wouldn't have to be hand under task Masters over them they wouldn't have to be in a land where Past Masters to drive them and to make them do things but they were going to a land to rest it's amazing that God would bring a message to you unrest in the busiest time of the year I got to go here I gotta go there I got to pick this up gotta pick that up cookies change tomorrow yes okay I'll eat them for two more weeks put them in the freezer eat them for two more months not me I gotta go buy this person a person because I know they're gonna buy me a present and you are so worked up how about Christmas was about Christ foreign he said those little kitties are looking for that present he said so you remember them little kitties and all of us still little kitties too ain't we but you see the pillar fire was leading them to the land of the rest and all of Israel no matter if it was Joshua all the way down to the to the Tribe of Benjamin they were all under the anointing of that Angelic Covenant that God had already spoke to them up there on that mountain and they were going to go in it didn't matter what tribe you was in it didn't matter where you came from if God saw you in that land it doesn't matter if you're a Spencer it don't matter if you're afraid sir it don't matter if you're a born of on a Reagan or a Pruitt if God saw you going in there God is going to have a people possess the land I'm sick and tired of the devil whispering in people's ear until I wasn't born in the right family yes you were if you were born again you are born into the family of the most high God you ain't going in because your last name you're going in because of him [Music] and I'm resting on that I'm resting on that I'm not resting in my own marriage I'm not resting in myself I'm resting on him [Applause] What a Sad thing it is they've got to give them this promise and because they begin to murmur and they begin to complain what was it it was their unbelief and the Bible said in the book of Hebrews I believe it's 3 and 17 that the Bible said that their their carcasses was found out there in the wilderness and they couldn't enter into the land of the rest because of their unbelief and to think that there they were all that time they were under the greatest leadership that the world had ever seen until that time and they couldn't completely go in because of their unbelief but God was going to raise up a new generation by the name of Joshua under a Joshua commission that was fully in his commission to walk in there and possess everything that stood in front of him and I'll say Joshua arrested even after Moses died because the angel of the Lord told him said as I was with Moses so I will be with you some people are always worried about well if William Brandon was here that's the same Angel what's with William Branham that same Angel is in this building right now there won't be no habit keep you from it there won't be no problem keep you from it the power of the angel a lot of people you got a lot of people Moses they disbelieving but don't you worry God's going to raise up somebody there's a whole lot of people in the yeah there's a whole lot of people that are refusing to worship God there's a whole lot of people that are refusing to live a message but God is going to raise up a Joshua and he's going to raise up a Caleb God ain't worried about the other 10 spies God's got a Joshua what William Branham tell us that we are under a Joshua commission that Ephesians parallels Joshua and it perfectly parallels that this is your inheritance that's why William Branham come to us and preached us on the Feast of the trumpets he laid out the borders for the bride body he told us this is our inheritance he went down in there and he broke in in 1964 and he broke into the river Euphrates and he's seen all those demons raising up out of there and they were trying to keep the Church of the Living God out of their Liberties he said that whole that's coming to people that are going to accept their Liberty and I'll say that they because of the message and because the borders have been set ain't no Kingdom Builders around here no more we only got one Kingdom to strive for and that's the power of the most high God I'm preaching to you without without saying a whole lot of things and I hope you catching my drift but Joshua wasn't going to let anybody stand in between him and the Promised Land I'll say that there's going to be some young boys and some young girls that rise up and won't let anybody stand between them and the Holy Ghost if God said it's for them they're going to rise up and rest that is for them if there's Mama's if there's somebody that's going to believe and mamas can raise up and say well my my child my child necessarily ain't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but a prophet said to hold our token over her told her and hold hold our token over them and watch them be filled with the Holy Ghost I believe that there's going to be some Mamas and some daddies that held true held fast the profession of their faith and watch a prodigal come in the house of God I know you get a little shook up about me preaching about prodigals because they're going to come in and take your seat let me say if you won't worship God God will bring somebody in off the street gotta bring some prostitute that'll worship Him in spirit and in truth and appreciate the power of salvation come on lock the hinges open it wide make a new entrance because it's coming a church that's Rising above every Doctrine Rising above every Creed Rising above every idea I'll be going to give it to you you begin to possess it and Joshua comes to the thing that stands between him and his promise and it was death was standing between him and Rahab death was standing him between him and going fully in and giving Caleb his Mountain a little Old River it can be beautiful he can be perfect but at the time that God decided to lead his children across Jordan it was the worst time that there was but Joshua one Shook Up he watched the people gather around the message he seen them get under the Angelic Covenant he watched them grab the inspiration and they started to move forward but this is in my way brother Andrew I'm resting that everything's okay been diagnosed been promised certain things and things didn't happen but I'm resting I ain't seen a move in a long time I see my legs move and I ain't see my hands move I seem like I'm a little bit paralyzed but I'm resting in it and here Jericho stand between him and everything that he has need of foreign you realize what it looked to the on onlooker that God has messed up he brought them all the way down here to laodicea and they taped it out it's like it's like God barked the doors on them you see people when God Did It for William Branham but I ain't seen you produce one cancer-ridden patient yet and you get frustrated at it if God did it then God I know you're still God I know you're still able I know I'm like Gideon if God before us then where be all of his miracles and people get frustrated because they haven't seen the thing worked out the way they prayed it to work out don't you know God's got a bigger plan than you just getting rid of your little bitty trial do you trust him because if you trust him he'll use you like never before you're going to have to go through some stuff but are you resting [Applause] let me say this that to to the onlooker it looked it looked like Joshua was the worst leader that there was he looked like the worst General that there ever could be when he was leading them over there at the worst of times to go over that River when it was a time in a season when all of that one of the Bible said it was a worse at times when all that snow was mounting off of that mountain up there and rushing down that River and it was coming down through there but the Bible said that Joshua told them to sanctify themselves go read Joshua 3 don't do her right now but go sanctify yourself because tomorrow the Lord will do wondrous things amongst you do you know where you're living at you're living in the hour well William Branham saw that there would be a manifestation of a body living in complete dynamics of the Holy Ghost today not tomorrow but today prepare yourself for the wondrous acts of almighty God this bride ain't shook up and worried about when it's coming or how it's coming but she's trusting him God Commander Joshua you get the priest and you pack them and you get 12 men and you go out there and you get the priests that are to Bear the Ark of the Covenant the word of the Lord and place it upon their shoulders and you march out into that water and when the priests touched the water that the Lord will stand up the river upon heaps can you imagine looking at Niagara Falls and all of its power turned upside down you see how many gallons of water millions of gallons of water that Niagara Falls is dumping every single second and God Turns Upside down Niagara Falls over there on the Jordan River when priests step into their position and recognize that they are under a Joshua commission to step out into the waters let me read you this scripture Joshua 3 and 13 that it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand up upon a heap when the Lord that is the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters what do you got to fear about death what do you got to fear about Jordan when the Lord of all the Earth is resting upon death don't you realize what Jesus Christ did for you at Calvary if you have been fully born again as a son and daughter of God you don't even know death death can't even touch you death is simply a doorway but do you recognize that when Joshua commanded those priests to step in there that when the word of the Lord rested upon their troubles let the trouble begin to cease 660 years the devil's been trying he's been working and tearing about tearing apart your Paradise but you give Joshua seven days and he's going to get your Rahab out for 660 years Satan's been planning tactics against you but you give us seven years you give us seven days and let us shout on the seventh power you watch Rahab get out you can try to keep her in there you can try to enslave her with prostitution but you watch the Power of Joshua's message foreign I know that it's I know revelation's slipping out of an Unseen World and it's coming to you and you're grabbing hold of it but you've got to walk out rehab binded together all the material that she had in her house and you have the token to get out of Jericho okay you know there there are people that live in abusive situations not everybody's got perfect perfect homes not everybody has has perfect marriages a lot of times a lot of times that there are people that get kidnapped or become captive to an abuser or to an offender that before long if they've been with that abuser for so long that they begin to cope or they begin to cope with the captor and they develop what science says is called the Stockholm syndrome that they begin to cope with the person that has stole them and the person that has abused them all their days and because they maybe give them a little bit of food here or give them a little food there or take care of them they begin to develop the syndrome that they feel affection for the abuser and I'm afraid that too many times people get Stockholm syndrome with the Devil they get to a customer living this way for so long that they are afraid that if they step out of that out of the realm of that abuser that they'll they won't get picked up no more you find Sometimes women get in an abusive situation or an abusive relationship they're afraid that if they let if they let him go they'll never find anybody else and they live in an abusive situation when they don't have to and they live with a syndrome of well it's just got to be this way no it don't have to be that way you don't have to live with a man beating you and you don't have to live with a woman that's constantly trying to take a frying pan to your head but I'll tell you you ain't got to live with the devil telling you you're not good enough you don't have to live with a devil telling you'll never get out of this you'll never overcome but you can break the power of Satan and rest in the promises that the name of Jesus Christ is stronger than every death or it breaks every abusive situation it breaks every stronghold because our weapons are not carnal but they're mighty you're not just under anointing of Acts 2 but you're under the anointing of the mighty Angel and the mighty Angel is here to tell you roll back the tide on the devil each time that you cross over into the promised land and receive it depression this is your last day my Joshua is here anxiety this is your last day my Joshua is here there's gonna be somebody to rise up and say cancer this is your last day her problems this is the last day sugar diabetes this is the last day lay on us here you're about to lose your hold you ain't gonna abuse me no more it's time I just was here [Applause] Christ is identified in the word revealed in this hour you see Christ came and he identified himself with the word by manifesting the word of the hour and the bride is now manifesting the word of her hour and she is identified by his characteristics she does the same Works does the same actions she's got the same life you see when God calls Adam to a dog I deep sleep to fall upon Adam in Genesis chapter 2 that Adam that God brought out of Adam a part of Adam he pulled out of him under his rib he pulled out of it his heart pulled a part of himself out and he produced an eve what was she she was an extension of what Adam was Adam back there was creating life and moving life and sustaining life but when she came out of him she was simply an extension of what Adam was and the Bible said that Adam named her Eve because she came out of man he called her a woman because she come out of man he said she's now bone of my bone she is now Flesh of My Flesh and to think that there is again another people under the land that under their Messenger will become a final voice to the final age she's got the same actions the same power she's life of his life she's born of his bone she's word of his word she's manifestation she's Works she's demonstration he has never put more on you than you can handle he's given you the capacity to be able to walk into the land of the Holy Ghost going through every trouble that you've been through there's a lot of generals sitting all over this building men and women sitting all over this building laughs that had been through hell they lost every dime and that was given to their name but they stood faithful they lost loved ones to cancer they lost daughters they lost Sons still here because they were resting in him the rest is in a day the rest isn't a year the rest stand a Saturday and it ain't a Sunday but the rest is a person the rest ain't a Creed and the rest ain't an idea the rest is a person and the Bible said in Isaiah 28 that with a stammering ellipse and another tongue will I speak to them and this is the Sabbath this is the rest to cause the weary to rest go read in Isaiah 40 31 read what Jesus said unto you come unto me all you that are heavy laden and I will give you rest I will give you eternal life now what was that prophecy that Isaiah was talking about over in Isaiah 28 it was fulfilled 700 years later up there on the day of Pentecost when he was up there when Peter was up there and Mary the Mother of God was a player and they were up there and the power of the Holy Ghost come upon them they knew they knew that something was coming that would bring them rest in their spirit because Joel had prophesied it Isaiah had prophesied it and they accepted the experience of the rest when it came hallelujah hallelujah that's what the rest is now God's shown us three rests throughout throughout the Bible the first rest he gave he gave when God received the first rest he was when he was he rested from his own work the second rest was when Israel received it in the law and the third was when the church received it as a part of God you see the rest is the Holy Ghost foreign and if you're still fighting lust problems if you're still fighting cigarettes if you're still fighting personal things in your own life and you haven't received the Holy Ghost it shows that you can't have rest the rest is the Holy Ghost and to think that if Satan could get you brother Matthew that he'd have the whole world that's a powerful thought if Satan could get these little girls he'd have the whole word on because he tried his best to keep Israel out of her Homeland but he couldn't do it and he's trying his best to keep you from going in to a Rapture but he can't do it you will never stop a predestinated seed from fulfilling everything that the word of the Lord has said that they would be in this hour and we recognize that the predestinated gene seed of God is elected to cast down everything because she has taken the word of the Lord and she is whipping the devil with thus say of the Lord she ain't whipping her she ain't whipping the devil with her flesh she is whipping the devil with things that are to be and this is the reality of it you let me say this this is more than a green checkered shirt this is more than any bisco falling in the water just so he's got to go change his cert sheets sister Ruth biscoll what she she couldn't have thrown that shirt away because it was a part of the prophecy but this is more than a 42-inch caribou this is the reality of Isaiah this is the reality of Joel this is the reality of Acts 2 again in the bride's body wow resting that everything is all right you know Georgie Carter's mom was so upset she was so upset that this man William Branham had come into the country and got his daughter all excited and there she was laying there for nine years got down to 47 pounds and there she'd read a little book about faith and this mama got so upset got so upset because this man William Brenham was stirring up his little daughter when he was the one that was going to come by her way and bring them real rest right you think all those years watching your daughter in torment I would accept anything no matter how it came I would accept it but she was so upset because the way that they've been taught that this was wrong I'd say the miracle that you have need of is in this room and remember you remember what happened when she fell off to sleep sitting there at that table that she had this Vision dream that their Jesus come walking on the sidewalk and come walked up to the door and she was thinking about William Branham and all these things and when she looked it was William Branham coming to her door what was it it was Jesus in William Branham how many has had some real problems this week or throughout your life not every week's a bad week thank God but I'll say this that your Miracle walked in the room when Julia Frazier walked in when Randall Griffith walked in when Whitney Breeden walked in when Jerry Breeden walked in when Vernon Fraser walked in what if the person that's sitting beside you was the person that had the power of prayer to begin to pray over your situation when they walked in it doesn't matter if the preacher did it the Deacon did it or a sister back in the back prayed over me as long as it happens you remember the woman up there in the balcony that that they give up her seat for that little woman and she began to pray for her and she'd come through the prayer line and said you received your healing when that woman prayed over you it doesn't matter where it comes from just rest in his healing power you are as close to God right now as your next prayer well I can't get over the river he'll stand it up I know it's hard waiting but Abraham you're going to need more than you're going to need more than yourself to produce an Isaac but you are resting in the most high God a stand next weekend next Sunday is three years amen I don't know whether it happened or not on next Sunday or if it happened right now but through his completion and I accept healing three years since the angel of the Lord said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before three years you've watched your pastor stand up here preach sick preach afflicted preach having seizures preached unstable preached with sugar that's that's over 600 600 on its scale when it's supposed to be 100 and people get all upset when they're about 120. and he stood here in the face of every demon of hell and preach to you faith and preach to you trust and preach to you that it's going to happen he didn't give you some self-pity parlor where you got a pity him and pity his troubles he showed you what it's like to be a real overcomer trust me and I'll use you like never before if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask he's as close to you right now as your next prayer he's right here oh that I would that my people would call upon the name of the Lord and I'll heal their lands prayer is the most powerful thing it's amazing when you can go to prayer you can go to prayer you ever been in that that special spot of Prayer and you walk in and you're just you're everywhere in your thoughts you've got so much pressure on you it's like I really need to get up and I need to go back to work but I really need this I really need this time and when you really begin to pray not just uttering some words but you begin to break into a realm of praise because prayer is not Lord bless the Joneses bless the Williams's Lord Lord go over here and heal this one God's not an Aaron boy that's just running around on your command prayer starts with praise how did Jesus teach us how to pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name what does it do it starts off with praise oh Father Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth not what I want not what I want thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day Our Daily Bread forgive us our debts as we said well I really really need this to happen have you forgive your debtors so you could be forgiven prayer starts out with praise and all of a sudden you begin to I'm talking I'm talking about rest right here but you are so you got you got business things going on you got family things going on you got church things going on and man it's it's heavy on you this one's sick and that one's sick and you care for everybody and you love them and you want to see them get healed and you've got all of these problems but by the time you get out of prayer your enemy looks good to you have you had that type of prayer lately well you got into a room where it's just you and Jesus and by the time you got out of Prayer you forgot what you went in there was so burdened for be honest real quick when's the last time you prayed a prayer that you forgot about your problems [Music] it's okay I'm not I'm not condemning you Satan has a real way of keeping you from the most powerful thing but when you are breaking into prayer it is the most holy room that you could ever break into brother brother Bishop said that when he took his time to go out and to to take his watch at the campfire he went up there where brother Brandon was sitting at he said when I walked up there where brother random was he said it was like I'd walk into a Lover's chamber but William Branham was talking to the author of life he had tapped into a room I'm talking about prayer I'm talking about resting in prayer I'm talking about when you go into prayer with all of your troubles if God if you don't move upon this situation they're going to go by the way of the grave but by the time you come out of it you've got the faith of Abraham and you've got the strength of Samson and you've got the courage of David and you've got the knowledge of Solomon when you go into prayer you begin to break into rest real worship breaks you into a realm where the burdens leave you why don't you break into prayer break into your car break into your closet breaking the prayer while you're making mashed potatoes while you're making your cookies while you're working on your job why don't you leave such an atmosphere in your bedroom that you'll not walk back in there arguing but you'll walk back in there with a love like it ever before a prayer that it changes your language we no longer say my anxiety we no longer say my heart problems we no longer say my needs we say Satan you got to leave it was never your anxiety to begin with it was Satan's it was never your cancer diagnosis to begin with it was Satan's oh why don't you lift up your hands and why don't you lift up your voice and why don't you call on the god of Heaven Lord I miss you Lord this Christmas season I don't care I don't care what comes in my stock and I don't care what comes wrapped in a gift All I Want Is You The Giver of every good gift and your gift always seems to find Its Right Place Lord you know when I need healing and you know when to give it to me father but Lord as long as you're here I'm going to talk to you as long as you're here I'm going to worship you as long as you're here I'm going to break through as long as you're here father I ask God you not care about I didn't care about myself but I care more about the others around me let them Break Free let them have an experience let them have a breakthrough let them find the anointing let them get healed before me let them Father experience you let them feel the anointing of the Holy Ghost let them Father father if you could just spend a little time with me but only take a second to fix what I got going on Lord I pray that you'd be my sustainer and that you'd be my protector father Satan I rebuke you I rebuke you from touching God's children from touching God's daughters and touching God's Sons you have no legal authority to touch any one of us you have no legal possession you have no documents that say that you're liable that says that you're able to put your hands upon us but we by Isaiah 53 we stand here and say that by Jesus Christ drops we are healed my history Expressions we're made free by his action at the cross we're set free by his love that is shown towards us we no longer live in Wrath but we break into a realm of the Holy Ghost that was meant for us [Music] but we need you that's it let's rest that's him that's the Holy Ghost it ain't that hard it ain't that hard all it takes you taking time to put words on your lips la la [Music] thank you directs the wonderful my children why will you worry and why were you weary why not enter into the rest why not enter into my Holy Spirit and enter into the
