baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as a sign of what the Lord has done on the inside of his life and so he comes this evening and with a heart ready to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're just we're just certainly privileged to have brother Gabriel here sojourning with us and we're just really proud of him and I know you guys are as well it's so good to see you Michael I love that song this evening god bless you hey man if you have her Bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 and verse 8 I definitely want to be remembering sister Karen Pruitt in prayer there in a hospital this evening and they have been lifting our hands up as a church for the last five six months and and just distorting our hearts up and and all of those things that they've sent us every word of encouragement we would turn right around and send them right back to them we don't envy any person for any battle they're going through but we can sure enter in for them and understand the emotions of all the things that they're the families going through and we know that God has got all things in control so we just want to be remembering sister Karen and brother Tim this evening before we read this evening let's speak to the author of the word dear Heavenly Father we come before your holy presence Lord just now knowing and realizing what your word has said that that where two or three are gathered in my name there you will be father and we sense your nearness and the the the mighty angel is here the mighty angel is moving in our midst and we're seeing the the effects of the angel as as he is troubled the waters and we see those that have stepped in and become a part of the the moving of the spirit father I pray tonight that you would just allow that healing angel to go through the land search all this land over father the 16 elements the father that stand before you Lord the 16 elements the Lord Jesus that you created a vessel and brother on Spencer and sister Karen Pruitt and all of your children the needs that have been lifted up to you we realize oh god that you've not changed your ideas you've not changed your thoughts you've not changed your word nor your stance Lord you're not changing your attitude towards us your children tonight and Lord we pray that we would just enter into the mindset of the Lord and that we would find the very channel of the Holy Ghost just now that you might speak to us lip to ear father lord I pray that you would come and calm the troubled waters of your children's lives I pray that you would speak lip to hear to them on in every situation that they're going through we pray that you would be God to them I pray as the word would go forth this evening that you would be magnified and praised and may you receive glory and honor for in all of these things that will be done may they be done in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things amen Romans chapter 10 and verse eight but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in that heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord this this evening we've been speaking to you the last few weeks here on on introducing introducing the God of omnipotence and just to bring it to your memory you remember in the second-handed role he said now if I'm introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the works of God I must be a man of God to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible I have to ask him I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promised it and so do you every person we've been speaking these things and introducing it and bringing before your your eyesight and that that you might see with a clearer vision that the God that we are serving is not a dead God he's not a God that that is just waiting or he's not sitting back he's a God that is ever present and that these things that have been spoken to us are very pertinent for this hour that that but they angel told us to go to take that book and eat the book and become that book and that but the owl must prophesy again and we are to speak what the word says and to fill our mouth with what the Word of God says and wewe said it like Paul said and David said we believe and therefore we speak but as I was preaching last weekend and ages the Spirit of the Lord dropped in my heart you cannot speak what is not in your heart you can have all the words to say you can have everything in line you can know all the scriptures but if it's not in your heart if all it is is a head knowledge and all of it is it's just well I went to church I gathered this information but you see the things that are in your heart are the things that you will speak and the things that you will do so we realize that before we can ever speak these things that there's got to be a change in the heart where the Bible said jesus said in Luke 16 and 44 for every tree is known by his own fruit for off of thorns men do gather figs nor add nor a a bramble bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings it forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh we realized that the heart controls our speech that those things that are down on the inside of your heart are the things that you'll say now anybody can say certain words or just to gather the attention of a preacher or gatherer the attentions of a other Christian or somebody that you're around or can adapt themselves or I will become like a chameleon and just kind of camouflage themselves into certain situations but really it comes down to a heart issue if you have got things right in your heart those things in what you will be is what you will speak so we realize that there's got to be a change a witness of the Holy Ghost on the inside of your life of your heart to to show and to prove what is on the inside of the heart and no man can take these words and produce these words unless deity be in him and Diaz he speaks so we realize that there's got to be something that is that is greater than just a spot of sanctification or there's got to be something greater than just coming to the altar there's got to be a move of God that that transplants our thinking and we begin to take on his thinking that we no longer think our thoughts that we no longer do our deeds that we no longer try to act on our own but he takes over a complete and supreme control and has the preeminence in our life for we know that when the Prophet stood there in the future home that he would draw out on the blackboard that there was a human heart and he said now I'm not much of a heart an artist but he said now here's a human heart and on the inside of that human heart is a snake and he said over here on the other side is a human heart and on the inside of that as a dove he said which represents which represents the Holy Ghost now all of us were born with that snake in our heart and you say well you say well I repented of my sins and I did these deeds you see that snake is still there until you get the root of the thing out of your heart so a man a man can confess his sins and a man can do those things but until he is completely born-again from above all of those things are there now you start in a work of repentance and an start of a work of sanctification and move on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but until you get the root of the thing out are you with me you can spray the weeds but until you get the rude out it can pop right back up so you can see you've got to deal with the thing on the inside of the heart is that Alright anybody can rattle off at the mouth anybody can quote scriptures anybody can quote the message but it's got to go deeper than that it's got to go beyond the surface it's got to go beyond intellectual faith now you with me anybody that's set here for as a child could sit here and tell you these stories and tell you what the prophets had it tell you what the Bible's had but I'm not looking for intellectual faith intellectual faith only will do for you is make you a better citizen but if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a transplant and be completely transformed with the renewing of your mind that you no longer think the thoughts that you think but you start thinking his thoughts it must take a change of the heart if your mind and heart and all doesn't agree with God's Word and believe that he's the same Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead and peace in your heart and yet you belong to church be careful you might have a perverted mind instead of a changed heart hallelu you remember that powerful three-letter scripture that Jesus dropped to us and every child can remember remember Lot's wife all those three little words can tell you a story they can tell you who she was they can tell you they can tell you where she was but it also tells you where she was left standing at you see she set out to go with lot and to follow her husband and her children and their loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world and so it's possible that you can make a start and be in the world and the world be in you you see she never overcame and though she was well on the road and it and it finally over throat her she had to take that one big long last look that's where she got caught don't even look back don't have no desires you keep going and put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ she started out and overcome her but she never did overcome though she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom with lot but she wanted to go back and have her hair cut you know see she had to go back she couldn't stand the test she she had to look back again to see what the rest of them was doing you see she still had something that was hanging on to her who you see where her heart was her heart was not leaving Sodom her heart was back there in Sodom are you with me you can walk out a Laodicea but if Laodicea is still in your heart lay out a seal will produce out of your own life well you know I have some good friends down there after all and after all this might be just a little move I don't know whether it could be right or not I've I've only got this man's word for it though he's my husband yet your pastor is your husband speaking spiritually now whether it could be right or not I don't know maybe his revelation wasn't right then if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the Word of God then you can't go you've got to be really sold out you got to know it you see all all of this all of this that we we've been bringing to you that you have heard throughout the years that if if that all that it is it's just an intellectual conception and if all this message is if this message don't get you to Christ are you ask me if this message don't get you to Christ you have missed it now watch what Jesus said in Matthew 22 and 36 master which is the Great Commandment in the law and Jesus said unto Him thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all that heart and with all thy soul and with all the mind this is the first and Great Commandment you see a man who loves God with all of his heart is willing to give up all he's willing to surrender all and he loves nothing as as comparison with our Lord Jesus Christ a man that loves God is ready to die a man that loves God is ready to give up a man that loves God is willing to do or to suffer anything in order to please and to glorify the God of heaven that's a man that loves him from his heart now notice in March 7 and 20 he said that that which cometh out of the man that defileth a man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts and adulteries fornications and murderers and thefts and covetous and wickedness and deceit lasciviousness an evil na blasphemy and pride and foolishness and all of these evil things come from within and defile the man so it's not what inner in show belly but what comes out of your heart are you with me you see it's the unclean things that are in your heart are the unclean things that come out of your mouth you see if you got an unclean heart you got a filthy spirit and if you got a filthy spirit that filthy spirit will lead you to do dirty things and we'll take you on the dirty websites and we'll take you down roads that you shouldn't be going down if you do not have a change of the heart [Applause] notice in the word became flesh let your thoughts run pure and your expressions for live pure and be pure now out of your heart proceeding evil thinking adultery and all of these different things if that comes out of your heart that's what's in your heart are we on the same page alright but if out of your heart comes righteousness comes peace and love and joy oh my then it's coming from a resource here that's made up out of that see it's made up out of the Spirit of God here and Express through the words what you say then will come to pass you watch a man and a daughter of God when they're full of joy full of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they can only produce what God produces the world does not want this acts 2:38 church but it's the only kind that two-wire can bring forth they don't want a people of change heart they want to change their heart with ideas and theologies but this word will change your thoughts Deuteronomy 6 and 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one and thou shalt love the Lord thy God who with half of our heart and with half of our soul and with half of our might well I must be reading out of the domination of book today and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all that's the way I read it with all that heart and with all the soul and with all the might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart notice the power of these were that if you obey what the word says these words shall be in your heart now it makes complete sense what Jesus said take no thought for tomorrow take no thought for what you say for when the hour comes my father will give it to you so if you have the heart right you have your mouth right you look at Samson you look at men of old and you see them that God always had he had an awful time just to get somebody in his control that he could yield and that he could use you see Samson he was a ladies man Samson could roll up him roll up in sleeves and show off him biceps and he said take a look right there now it wasn't me but Samson could roll up my sleeves and he could show off he could show off those muscles he was a ladies man but that is all that God could use of Samson because that's all that Samson would give to God you see you see God could use his strength to go and take the gates and he can take him out and go so many hundred miles so many miles of that because Sampson gave him his strength you see he could kill a thousand four listings because Samson gave him his strength he could tie up hundreds of foxes and like their tails on fire and run him through their play through the through their crops because he gave God his strength he can do incredible things because he gave God his Swift but when he came to his heart he gave his heart to Delilah you see and what you give him is what he will use you see some people that's always jealous they're always jealous is somebody that's can sing they're always jealous is somebody that can actually clap their hands on time they're actually jealous of somebody they're going so we preach I said actually preach you see what it is those people that are using that talent and using that ability they realize that they didn't have no ability in them at all but what they did is they harness themselves through the Word of God and they say God I don't have no abilities but what I have I give unto you hallelujah if you give God your energies he'll use your energies if you give God your mind he'll use your mind if you give God your soul he'll take some clean control of that soul if you give God your strength who use Australia if you give God if you give God your all he'll use your all where people are so bound up is they love controlling their heart you hear the Prophet he would speak door to the heart and keys through the heart and breeze through the heart and keys to the door you see his he's bringing forth in such a simple way you go back and listen to believe from the heart it's such a powerful message but it's that simple so many times people get themselves worked up and think I've got to do this or I got to do that it's something that just comes out of the heart I was sure glad when I found out then I didn't have to do this work I was sure glad when I found out that I didn't have to go out there and convert my friends but he would be my stay that he would be my strength that he would be my seal that he would be my book hallelujah yes he put a desire in my heart to see a world to see a world realize the power of this message but he's the one that doeth the work you see he could give Delilah his heart they couldn't give that to God and it's the same way today when men do not want to receive the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ it shows that there's a headship issue it shows that there's some major is she's gone on the inside when they do not want to be yes they want to be saved they don't want to go to a devil's hell but they have an headship issue when they will not make Christ the Lord of all you've had people to stand behind this pulpit and get up and pray through pray prayers are 30 to 40 minutes long and you can tell right there if you listen to the message that brother Branham said that anybody gets up there and does that shows that they ain't got a converted heart you had people stand up here and pray prayers but they could not live right yet people stand behind this pulpit and man could they sing the jailhouse nail but they couldn't keep the pants up it showed that there was a problem on the inside of their heart you got preachers that can't preach this message because they have a high problem proverbs 4:23 keep by heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life the heart young girls young boys people of all ages should be carefully guarded because out of your heart comes all the actions of life your heart is a very powerful thing now notice verse Samuel 16 and 7 but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him now remember well the angel said look past what you see for the Lord seeth not as man saith for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart I think there's a key to this Psalms 44 and 21 shall not God search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart now is that not what we have been told that the Word of God is sharp it's a - it's hard it's cutting going and coming and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so we see that this quick and alive word is cutting to the heart of things it knows every little intricate and motive of your heart you see in the heart we find the true man on the outside the outer life is but clothing and maybe a mask of Christianity but from the heart Springs all of the actions of life you see the inward parts every room and every corner of it he knows the secrets of your heart he knows your thoughts he knows her intense he knows her purposes and designs and imaginations all the secret motions of it and he even knows the wickedness of your heart Jeremiah 17 and 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and who can know it take that study that eat them the heart is deceitful above all things where you say no way not my heart are you kidding me watch your heart you watch your heart as a young person and your heart would deceive you and your heart would tell you that you love that man he's so handsome heroes those soldiers back but that man ain't got an ounce of man in him your heart can be deceived your heart can get so entangled up with the things of the world and make you fall in love with the world and it proves to me that you don't have the love of God but notice what verse 10 says that I the LORD search the heart I try the reins even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doing so we watch and we see that verse 10 is the answer to verse 9 it's the answer to it the heart is deceitful but he cannot deceive him are you with me you can deceive yourself you can deceive your momma you can deceive your best friends you can deceive your doctors you can deceive your lawyers you can deceive the banker and tell him you got this much money but he knows but God cannot be deceived you can deceive your girlfriend you can deceive your boyfriend but God cannot be deceived for He is Jehovah and he sees the very secrets of the heart the Apostles would call him and acts 1 and 24 the knower of the heart he sees past you he sees past your camouflage and he breaks down all of the barriers of who you think you are and what you're trying to make yourself up into he sees past that mask hey man you remember what you remember when they had that breakfast you'll hear brother BAM talk about it quite often up rare in Kentucky in there Billy Graham was a speaker of that of that breakfast and he got up layer he got up there and he blamed he said he said it reason why he said I can go into a city and I can have over three months I believe he said I can have 16,000 converts but come back in a year and only have 16 he said the reason of it is is you lazy preachers brother BAM said he said now I understand I'll go with you a little bit on that Billy he said but decisions he said you can make a million decisions you can make all kinds of confessions and that confession is a decision stone you can have all kinds of decision but as long as they're seen out there and malice and they and the glamour of sin out there it will still grab people if they do not have a change in the hundred you can come to this church all your life you can change your clothes you can change your clothes and look right right in front of me or look right in front of Brother on you can change your clothes you can even change your hair you can change your speech you can change the way you talk change the way you walk but if you do not have a change of the heart you'll fall right back in the same things you can fall who you you can change who you sleep with you can change who you fall in love with you can change all types of things change your job you can change how you do business but if you don't have a change of the heart you gonna fall right back in you're gonna be on the treadmill go up and down a roller coaster and you're gonna figure out one day you gonna have your head over top of the side of that thing throwing up because you've been every which way but right because the Bible says that as a man thinketh in his heart and you will allow the enemy to beat you down and rob you and make you think you're not good enough but as you think in your heart so are you the reason why I know I'm a winner because I think I'm a winner the reason I know I'm proud is because I think like Brian you cannot think like a loser and be a winner good job swallow it it'll help you it'll help you when Jesus crossed over the ocean and the enemy tried his best to get G keep Jesus for going all the way over and he clouds storms are raised up but when you find Jesus over in mark chapter 5 and you see him there and he calls this man leech who hid those to him and you know the story but he does not go to him he did not change his dwelling place first he changed his heart he changed his thinking he changed his mind and then he changed his clothes he didn't change all of them before he didn't change where he lived their change how he dressed he changed his heart and when he changed his heart then he was found sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind with his right clothes on that's the reason why people are still sitting out there half-naked it's because they never got to Jesus [Applause] to me this is simple it's real simple if my car is broke down outside and I know that the engine is blown up and every little thing of that engine is completely tore up it's messed up the heads is messed up everything about the engines messed up what good is it going to do me to go out there and change the oil on it it won't do me one liquor good it will prove to you that I'm an idiot if I do that I need to change the engine and when I change the engine then I can get back on the road oh you may have got off the Kings Highway but just change your heart and step right back on in I [Applause] know we come to baptism but let me drop this he said now being baptized in Jesus name or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rather that's that's alright but that's not all of it you could be baptized 50 times like that and don't do a bit of good until the hearts changed we're guilty we're guilty up here we're baptizing drown sinners and they come back up wet sinners but I can't change them what good would it do me if I tried to change them is that right all they are is attaching themselves to me or to what I've said but if they don't have a change in the heart that can baptize them frontwards backwards flip them upside down baptize them every single time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but until they get a change in the heart that water won't do them one bit of good it is a sign of what is taking place you find people they keep falling in the same rut they keep going through the same process of things they keep getting beat down they can't ever find victory or and they keep going back to the same ruts or they or because of tradition they do the same things probably one of the nicest compliments that you people hear the gospel lighthouses as paid to me is I've got a lot of people here that tell me that I that I act like Homer there's a lot of people that tell me that I act like my daddy right now that's a great complement and I received that as a great compliment but let me show you how I receive that I never watch my granddaddy in his heyday so I don't get up here trying to act like Homer Frasier I don't get up here and try to preach like Homer Frasier but because there are certain characteristics that we are identified through certain traits and they're passed down through the genealogies of time I and you see certain things like Homer Fraser now that's a great compliment but understand me right here but I don't want to be Homer Frasier understand me I know that it might hurt some of your feelings but understand what I'm saying I don't want to be Homer Fraser and neither do I want to be Ronald Spencer now I would like to be able to preach like Ronald Spencer and preach like Homer Frasier but I don't want to be them because you see there's so many people now I'm gonna drop a bomb right here there's so many people that attach themselves to brother homers personality but they never got attached to Jesus there's so many people that attacks himself to brother on but they never attach themselves to Jesus but if you can hear what the home brother on preach and you can get a change in your heart you can attach yourself to the Fountain of Life we must attach ourselves to Jesus you see I could get up here now you all love brother Homer who get up here and sing about that old dog he can make that song live but that ain't my song and you all know that that ain't brother Matthew songs so what good now I'm using this as an illustration brother Matthew and I myself can handle that what good is it going to sing a song that does not attach itself I'm using this in a parallel what good is he going to do for me to sing a song that I cannot relate to are you with me what good is he going to do for me to attach myself to a dead call and did God call Muhammed when I can't relate to it but if I can attach myself to King Jesus I can relate to King Jesus we don't wanna become stagnant in our devotion we don't want to become stagnant in our worship we don't want to become stagnant in our praise we don't want to become stagnant in our prayers we don't want to become stagnant in our preach and we must get you to Jesus and if all we preach is a God of yesterday it will not do you one lick of good but if I can lift this God out of history he'll change your heart he'll change your mind he'll change your walks you change your top it's a time that the young people of this message start lifting this God out of history this God is an omnipotent powerful all-knowing God that desires to change your heart if we've grown stagnant would probably drink from a broken sister and it's got full of wiggle tails and everything else and if your experience has got wiggle tails in it if your experience has got old dead cold Cemetery ideas behind it you need to change the water you're drinking that's why I have told these musicians that's why I have told the song leaders that when we get behind here this pulpit we don't ever take one service for granted you break into around you break into the Holies of Holies for one person could come into this place and that song change their heart too many times we got Christians that just walk in and walk out and think well this is the way things are just going to be and they miss search this whole search is here for one purpose and that's for changed lives and when we can't preach say God that saves Souls I can't make nobody death here on this street bride but if I can lead one of them to Jesus Christ it's worth 10 million worlds I'm personal friends with a customer of mine and he's very close friends or very attached to certain message people that are the most legal esteem at in your life and every single time he meets them they condemn him but they have never pointed him to the god of this message if all this is it's just books and tapes we're missing it but he said these words he said the very first time I met you and I met your daddy I said I can serve a god like that that's the kind of people that we ought to be not walking around and condemning people for cutting the hair wearing ear bombs and all types of things let's get them to the God of this message let's get out to new Jesus let's get grottoes to Jesus it's not my duty to put it's not my duty but by the preaching of this word and by the dress wear of this message you'll become dressed but if all I can do sister Sarah if all I can do is get them to a God that heals maybe they can't feed on your level let's get them to a god to a God that saves we understand that there's three kind of believers in every church but let's get all those believers let's get every single one of them stop writing people off and start right people in our Christian experience should be moving higher not to become comfortable and not to become satisfied and I'm afraid too many times that message people get the idea well I'm here because I heard that God sent a prophet where I heard well how about sitting in the ministry of other honor I'm a good enough Christian what is it good enough Christian I figured that doubt and the only thing that I can figure out is when I get there that'll be good enough but a good enough Christian here is not good enough for me it's too long we've been sitting here and be getting satisfied awful all off of our own ideas or we sit here and we just go through the motions it's a time that the fire falls again and say well you ain't got no need a preaching like this really it's wonder that he told me to do it but too many times we're getting like that frog and we get so comfortable and we forget to jump out the water you see if you throw that for you threw that frog and a bowling pot of water he'll jump right out but what the trick is is you put that frog in that water and you slowly turn up the heat that's what sin does it slowly turns up the heat well what's one cigarette what's one time what's one second nobody seen we've become comfortable I find it amazing that when Jesus goes over in John chapter five and he goes by the Pool of Bethesda as a man that's been laying there in that condition for 38 years being laying there and the Prophet would tell us that this man could have lived with that situation for the rest of his life but Jesus had a reason go back there Jesus seen now Jesus had the power to fix every single one of their problems but because Jesus was led of the Lord he went to that one but notice what Jesus says to him will thou be made whole you look at that and you think anybody in a sickness would say you looking for the wrong man would you be hope it's an easy it's an easy answer anybody that sick rap racing in and you can have some class for this day when you're sick do you want to get well one more time when you're sick do you want to get well all right that's pretty pretty clear to me but Jesus goes by his way and he speaks to him and he says will thou be made whole what is he saying to him this man's laid that are in that condition and he's got accustomed to living right there and stand right there and so many times Jesus comes by here and he says will thou be made whole what is he asking him are you willing to be changed are you tired of living in that condition are you tired of saying in that sin I get tired of falling in the same loop are you tired of sickness I get tired of death are you tired of the enemy won't you be changed we could bring a hog right up here prize hog anybody got hogs in here bro Justin got them hogs yeah you could bring on a prize hog up here you can clean that rascal up brother John man you could put some you could put some nice perfume on there what would you call today young people I don't know what that perfume stuff's called nowaday back in my day what do they call that stuff Chanel number five maybe that's still around spray out hog up with that but I'm afraid too many times are we painting the lipstick silver bleep painting the hog with lipstick you put that pink bow on him you bring him in there and you say old porky you're fine ho now I've watched you I put this Chanel number five on you I put the lipstick on you and you are a good porky you're gonna stay right here and when I let you out you go out in the yard and then you come back in as soon as you let that old hog out there he may be smelling fine right now but that hoe go go right back to its wallah and roll back in that mud and become a stinking old hog again why you hurted him up you put lipstick on him you put perfume on him but you didn't change his nature you can look like a message you can even smell like the message but if the message don't get on the inside I don't care what you look like what you talk like if we don't get you to the message you got to change its nature you see if you change that foul sinner into a saint it'll change it'll change the way looks and the sudden people walk up in here still smell like the hall but they still are left what they need to do is really go take a bath they got a nature change but they didn't get a bath so look at your neighbors say it's alright take a bath honey I'm doing a little bit of past work all over this place tonight some of y'all gonna thank me tonight hallelujah who knew brother Jonas be it much fun the word heart can be found in the Bible 765 times so God wants your heart he's not after your wallet and this pre-trained after your wallet he's not after all your rose roses I don't think anybody's got one here but he and after he's not after all your houses and all your monies and all the things you own he's only after your heart and the very first time the word heart is found in the Bible is over in the book of Genesis when it tells us that God repents that he made man that the heart of man was growing and going after after the sons of men and after chasing after the sin of man but there was a man on earth that had found grace in the sight of the Lord Jesus he'd found grace in his sight that man didn't know nothing about building nothing he was a simple farmer but God come to Noah and he asked him to do the impossible when everybody else were around him would criticize him but because that his heart was pliable he could do what the word said and when there was a man on the earth that said I'll do what you said that he goes out there and he starts building an ark in front of all of his family and in front of all of his people and this appears and he goes out and he would grab a hold of a wood brother and brother Terry some of your brothers had no wooden things he would grab a hold of the wood that you would never build an ark out of but God commanded him to take of a gopher wood now that gopher wood is built in such a way it's got holes all in it it's porous it's got holes all in it everywhere nobody in their right mind would chose it but here was God constructed and he what he did he could all of us all those beings down and then he would take back to other trees like pine trees and sapling trees and he would go and beat the rasam out of that old pine tree and he would the Bible said to pitch it with tar what was he doing he was pouring that tar that rosin overtop of all of those porous holes and it was pliable it was light it was easy to work with and when he poured that rosin overtop of that wood it made it hard as steel and it would ride right over the judgment of God you see what men called crazy God called great you see him look crazy to the eyes of the world but Noah just took his hammer and he went out there and he started building what God said Noah didn't know how to make it float but God did David didn't know how to throw that stone but God did hallelujah you see it was that Ark that was pliable that had poured the rosin in I was able to float over the judgments of God you see that word pitch means to atone it means to atone the church there's an atonement that standing between you and the judgments of God there's a blood that's a blood that says hey you're not guilty there's a blood that says that you're justified that's a blood that's has next you're good enough that's a blood that says you're qualified there's a blood that says you're elect there's a blood that says that you are deigned that's a blood that says you're gonna make when hail says that it's going to crush you there's an atonement there that'll Roger and over the judgments of God oh there is a blood so many times I'm closing we choose different things we choose different type of woods but it's got to be a pliable heart it's so many times we get set in our ways that this is a way that I'm going to do it God can't use God can't use something you're not willing to give him what does he want tonight he wants to heart you see once it changes your heart I felt like quite a dummy while I was standing here preaching last weekend why didn't I preach that first God said this is the way I've ordered it this is the way I've ordered it you see you can speak all those things and you could say all the right things but until you get a changed heart some of you I and some of you probably been sitting here some 40 years there's people that have come and gone but the reason you're still here is because the power of a changed heart you see he ordered these things in such a way that you can say from this side of it from this heart of it I believe from my heart mountain be moved from a changed heart you can say what the word says change heart you can speak the impossibilities and watch them become possible the music will change fancy words won't change you and I even dare to say you coming to this altar won't change you I even dare to say getting in that water won't change you but Jesus pointed us to one scripture except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God what is it you must have a heart change we all want to chose he saw but God chose Jacob because of his heart stand with me I read a story sometime ago about men that had seen all of the Mustangs that were running wild out of the National the National lands of the United States and I thought it was such a shame that those horses couldn't be used that they were just dying off but these four men looked at these Mustangs that said they can be used as pack horses everybody doubted them and everybody disbelieved that they could do it but they spent so many hours training and working on those mistakes that they took a trip from Mexico to Canada and they went all the way because they learned how to tame that Mustang I'd say some of you were some real Mustangs in your life and you was sure buck some people off but when God got ahold of you you remember that little story I brother Bisco tell about that but that horse that was wild looked like he was about to kill bud he'd ran her up and he hit bud right in the chest knock him down brother bisque was said brother banner he's a wild one he's going to kill bud and he said all of a sudden he said I watched that horse is it tamed and controlled itself right down and it begins to tremble and shake on over he said I about to turn back to brother Brian him and look and he said brother Brandon was putting his hat back on his head he said even I realized that nature had to recognize the presence of that angel what about it if a dumb horse don't crucify me for saying that but a brute beast if they could have that kind of control under the presence of an angel what about men and women of God how much more should we be under control of the angel of the Lord let's sing a song I'm amazed that you love me as brother oncome system [Music] [Applause] [Music] my life was fine without I was covering up the secrecy then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you show there and purchased my retention when you broke since power instead my speed will I be that you love me [Music] now you can you're precious I felt my gosh [Applause] [Music] [Music] god bless you a man we wouldn't be here without a changed heart would we a man for those of us that has been in that moment to where that we met him it was in that moment it was just over is your Amen still working well that wonderful we're not wonderful you can be seated just a moment I want to just say a couple of things here and I'd like to invite some grandmas and grandad to the balcony of Evan if they could look over just for a moment tonight is a very special night for our family our home there's been quite a few special things that have been happening of late and we're just real thankful for it and we're we're very much pleased this evening to be a part of brother Gabriel's experience with the Lord now brother Gabriel has been raised in an incredible home preacher's home grandson of a minister my nephew and lineages go a long way Gabriel has been a blessed young man he's went away to school he's been a star athlete he's won a lot of accolades in life today he's a state trooper and he actually right there in brother Denny's area felt led of the Lord to move toward our way and and he just wanted to be a part of our congregation here but it lacks something you know you can look the part but you like something for a lot of you in this building you've been around me in a very special moment brother Nathaniel standing under a tree a phone call in that moment you just knew you and God were one-on-one and God was just looking right through you Gabriel came to the hospital the night that I was preparing tomorrow morning to to have brain surgery it was just our family there and it was a it was just a you never know what tomorrow holds with brain surgery they were to remove one of three tumors and that one was bleeding like sister Pruitt's and we're believing for a miracle for her tonight that one was seeping it was about the size of a lemon and it was seeping cancerous fluids out of it into the cavity of my brain and I'd been given some pretty incredible conversations by doctors but to prepare us for it but nothing can prepare you only Jesus can help you and so and so brother Gabriel was there and I could detect that tonight was a special night you know but the room was full you know your family's flowing in and out your room was just completely full and it was before Corbett Kovac it was completely full and so there was no space and I just kept watching and I was watching him and after a bit and I don't know only supernatural brother Bernie the room emptied and he and I was left alone and we would have about 15 minutes alone and God did a work God just did a work and in about 15 minutes brother Joshua God came on the scene and all of the stuff that was fluff in his life meant absolutely zero are you with me you could have the whole world and Miss Jesus Christ the sermon tonight was incredible important they remember just before my mother's death it was a Wednesday night and he was sitting in church and there was a preacher came and that preacher toward that young man apart with legalism and all different kinds of things and medium and medium and beat him and beat him and my mother got so upset all day the next day I talked to my mom trying to settle her down there's something that runs in that Spencer blood it's just you see legalism will not change your life it will beat you into an order of a prison and you'll never live light under legalism it only becomes a prison house among passed away with a broken heart I talked to her my to my mom and just only just hours before her death and I said mom remember there's a lot of people that love to clean fish before they ever catch up they like to clean them before they catch up and they're really good kitchen help but they ain't God called preachers I'm a preach to you for five minutes you're gonna be all right you're gonna live through [Music] they can tell you all about how you are address and how you are act and how you ought to live but they can't bring the presence of God on the scene to change your heart and a lot of people can only flourish under a prison mentality or slave mentality but that ain't here this is not a Reformation Center this ain't a place where you rehab this is a place to where God transforms your life and he lives on the inside of you I remember my mom's promise as a lady in the bed and I begin to deal one-on-one and Jesus came into the room and Gabriel gave his heart to the Lord I invited him to come to live with me now let me just take you something you could have change if you live with me because Jesus lives in that house now I don't want you to come live with me I'm restricted yet the scripture says repent and be baptized every one of you take on his name there's a covenant that comes with this it says for us to be buried with him in baptism this message is more than quotes books tapes all of that has its absolute importance this message is life it's not the life of William Branham it's not the life of Ron Spencer Homer Fraser Andrew Spencer and I just told Andrew I believe it's one of the greatest messages I've ever heard on the heart I'd like to just take a moment if you're sitting here and you're still on the fence and you're still fighting and struggling with you you can get that changed you and Jesus can get that changed you can get that changed tonight Gabriel is to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he wanted me to to do that for him but because of a lack of strength and lack of energy I chose to be this part and I don't think it's none better than to have his daddy many years ago I looked at Gabriel's daddy my brother Marc Marc was a professional bowler with a note over 200 average he'd got to the point till he was about 230 averaging he was getting ready he was going big-time and God dealt with me to talk to him more than just being my brother but of the thousands of people that have believed to the Lord when he walked into my arms at an altar was one of the greatest events forgive me for being emotional but just how it is lately but tonight to watch him baptized Gabriel here I wouldn't have missed this for the world amens I want to pray with brother Gabriel publicly before we go and then brother Matthew for sing some songs while they prepare amen brother cable if you'll come brother Marc you come with me and ruin don't you let me fall off this thing I'm proud of yourself I'm really proud of you but you know being a Spencer don't give you eternal life but that night in the hospital did it work we've been a pair of that work over the last couple of months this is the greater portion even tonight now Gabriel they're going to baptize you with water but he promised I'll give you life up until that point it's just vows but life is the breath of it it's the change of the heart it's where man dies out to himself Almighty God at this altar just now more than wood and pull pets and altar rails but there Anders said it right we baptized a lot of dry sinners and they raised wet will be guilty of that probably tell the rapture but doc tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ feeling your angelic anointing even as I stand here oh god I asked you as I lay my hands on him now I can't in part I can't in part eternal life but I can speak it that it would live in his life oh god right now as as he has repented and is going to be baptized and he feels the Spirit of God he told me the other night he had got out he prayed almost all night with his hands toward heaven and he saw the signs and the sky God this evening I asked you that you would come and feel his life with the Holy Ghost now what was a tabernacle that a lot of sins took place in repentance is as I'm sorry for all of those things I'm ashamed that I brought you much shame father take away these things by the blood of Jesus Christ tonight you paid for it father and that your words I asked you that you administer right here today you're clean his life I can't clean him you claim his life dear Jesus and minister to him by the power of the word of life change him dear God thank you for what we have seen thank you for what we've this young man's become a different man because you came bless his home bless his life he's purchased a house may that house being house of the holy ghost that you're comfortable there more than anything but made this this 200

like I like to say this one of the proudest moments of my life this is the greatest moment because you look at a man would tell people he don't himself he leaned on yourself he's a man but he gave his heart over to God over these last few weeks I wants to change molding and character Jesus Christ God moving that's too kind of God I serve he loved me so much a man he gave him his whole heart didn't leave nothing out him man Jesus could work with that they'd been risen they meant to walk with Jesus how much divine heavenly father Lord if you would stand together right now Lord you've already saved the Lord he took him to give us heart over the universe and not I'm crazy Lord you would take you just moved out of your spirit right now a twenty Lord as he lays down this this is made of the game for all as he is known to this world and rises to walk with you a new line I'm crazy Lord you would take you just moved out of your spirit upon you before these heart drawn and blessing the
