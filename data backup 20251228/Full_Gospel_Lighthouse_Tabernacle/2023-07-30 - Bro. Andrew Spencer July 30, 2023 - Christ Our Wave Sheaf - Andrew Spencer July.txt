Lord and it's amazing you can preach a convention and still feel the way he's feeling so [Music] man if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look in a few portions of scripture this morning I would like to look over in The Book of Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9. then to mark 16. and then to Revelations chapter one but we're first going to turn to a Leviticus chapter 23. and verse 9. hallelujah it's a good day to serve the Lord isn't it man all right Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and saying to them when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf of the firstfruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the moral after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it also Mark chapter 16. and verse 1. and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had brought sweet spices and they that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came under the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun and they said amongst themselves who shall roll away roll us away the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher and when they had looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the Sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were frightened and he said unto them be not a frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen and he is not here behold the place where they laid him also Revelations chapter 1 and verse 17. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death let's pray this morning Heavenly Father we come before you this morning Lord we lay our hands upon Thy word recognizing that we have read of the written word Lord but we recognize that this morning that we're your children that have gathered around the Living Word father and Lord we're asking father for a special time in the Lord today that there would be a great outpouring of your spirit here Lord that you would just do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think father I pray God that you would touch our hearts Lord and as we've come out here and fill this great Bank of Faith Lord that's pulsating in the room Lord we recognize that that is a sign that your children are ready to be fed this morning so father we we thank you for for allowing us to set an atmosphere of this style father where you can come and begin to inhabit the Praises of your people where your blessings can come upon your children and begin to minister to them in a supernatural way father we commit our life into your hands I pray God you help us get out of the way and do a good job for you today in Jesus name amen amen God bless you today you may be seated amen amen this morning we'd like to speak to you just for uh for a few moments on on Christ Christ our our wave Chief Christ Our wave Chief and we've read here in Leviticus chapter 23 as we'll just read this again just to get a context this morning in verse 10 he said when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the firstfruits of your Harvest under the priest and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it excuse me everybody good this morning Hallelujah everybody good ready to have church this morning all right let's have church we recognize as we said we'd like to just speak to you on this thought it's something that's been laboring on our heart for some time and I've had dreams about it I've seen things about this service and it's been on my mind for quite some time but the Lord allowed us a spot to be able to speak it today so we'd like to speak this Christ Our wave Chief and we've seen here by the by the scripture reading that we've taken this morning that we recognized that there is no God like our God and that there is there is something very special that we are a part of in this generation to recognize that we're not just another group or another another selection or another building or another Association or an organization but we are part of something very special that only God himself could ordain and make manifest in the hour that we're living in we recognize that we're not watching a Jesus of 2000 years ago but we're watching Jesus of today live in an act and we recognize that that if God wants to come down and do specific things like he's doing we recognize that God's got intentions he doesn't just move to say that he moves he doesn't he has a purpose behind when he moves he doesn't just create to say that he did it he does it because he's got a purpose behind it and the reason why that we we teach the message here is because it aligns with the Bible and the age that we're living in that's why we preach the message of the hour here because we recognize that God has done something in this generation that he that he hasn't done for over 2 000 years it's God bringing in his elect and he's pulled off all the all the restraints he's pulled off all of the mechanical devices he's pulled off every little ISM and every Schism that has raised itself against the word of God God has done something very special in gathering of people that could come under the unity of the word of God and get under the same inspiration as the one that wrote the war word and we see that it's still Jesus of today as it was two thousand years ago and I I think it's an amazing thing that we can look out and we can see Jesus in our brothers and our sisters I think it's amazing thing because there was never anybody like Jesus David was a great man Moses was a great man Daniel was a great man Abraham was a great man but there was never that anybody that lived the kind of life like our lord Jesus lived like he did two thousand years ago they were they were gallantly and they were great prophets and even Jesus would say that there was no Prophet like John the Baptist he was the greatest of all the prophets but Jesus would say but he is more than a prophet because he was he was anointed to be a prophet of the age but he was a forerunner of the message that was coming and we recognize that Jesus would say but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than John so you recognize that your position is Christ in Christ is a very powerful thing but Jesus wasn't just a prophet Jesus wasn't just a good man that went about Healing The Sick and doing Miracles and Powers but there was something different about this man he he lived up to what he preached he didn't have to worry about falling to sin he didn't have no sin upon his life he didn't have no mistakes upon his life he he come from he come from a family what the natural eye looked at he come from a family that looked like it was an illegitimate child but he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was almighty God you see if he was Jew and or he was Gentile then you and I are in a bad shape this morning but because he was more than a man because he was more than a prophet we recognize that we are serving a God that had the idea to take upon himself to take upon himself to become a part of who we are to understand like us to have Humanity to have flesh to have headaches to be sick to have things up in his body to be tired to be worn out he took upon himself the robe of humanity to understand like humanity and Satan so hates the very word of God that he's tried to destroy the seed word which is Christ he's tried to destroy the very manifestation of the seed word he tried to stop it in David he tried to stop it in Moses but he couldn't stop it because Christ was going to come he come down through a lineage of mistakes of of the five ladies of Grace but Christ was going to get there but Satan knew that there was a seed line that was coming because it was prophesied all the way back in the Book of Genesis that his seed would bruise the head of the serpent so there Satan was looking for that seed line he was watching for it to come and Satan is trying to destroy the very power of the word and the effect of the word because the word is a seed and if he can get to that seed he can destroy it if he can get to it before it gets into the ground he can destroy the purpose but today he cannot destroy he cannot destroy God's word he can maybe missed it or throw it off of timing of things but he cannot stop the very word of God and to recognize today that you have on the inside of you The Germ seed of life he was the seed word but what was deposited in the elect of God is the same life you have the spirit with measure he had the spirit without measure but to recognize that the same chemicals that was in Jesus's body is in your body but we recognize that power how powerful Jesus was that when when Jesus came and he resurrected his friend by the name of Lazarus that would come and allow him to live in his home for a certain time that after he resurrected him that there went out there went out a a council from the Pharisees that they took the council that they were going to try to destroy Jesus and and kill Jesus but you see what they were doing they were lacking the revelation of who Jesus was you see if they'd recognize their day in their message they would have understood who Jesus was but they were living under the light or the glare of the law but they didn't recognize that a new dispensation was at hand but you see the message that they were preaching it had an expiration date on it because the Lamb of God which John saw when he was standing there baptizing on the Jordan Banks he said Behold the Lamb of God has come and what did this this Forerunner do in this age he said Behold the Lamb of God what was it it's it's an hour there the hour that they were living in was in an expiration date and though churches and the World Council of churches has an expiration date but this message does not have an expiration date upon it come on somebody the message that the Pharisees was preaching it was no longer effect when Jesus came and he took upon him the force of the law he was Grace into a generation where they couldn't live the law but he was the law Hallelujah he proved that it could be lived Hallelujah let's Preach Today he proved the message could be left he proved that he was the one that Moses saw at back there in a burning bush he proved what Ezekiel was when he saw him back clearing the wheel in the middle of the wheel he proved what Daniel saw Hallelujah a stone that was cut out of a mountain Hallelujah he proved that he could live the message but they said when they tried to kill Jesus that they prevailed and their effects had no no power to them at all you see the more Jesus preached the more people came the more he preached more faith grew the more he preached more miracles happen the more he preached the more they were afforded Hallelujah you see you try to stop fire with gasoline you're only going to make it burn a little bit hotter and you try to stop this message you try to stop my Jesus what are you doing you're simply waving the fans and we met a went through some tough times we may have been through some trials but it's only made us grow stronger come on somebody they could throw Daniel in a lion's den but it didn't stop it they could throw David in a valley but it Goliath couldn't kill him they could put the three Hebrew children in a fire but it didn't stop them they can put us through all the laodicea every trial that rises up against us we're going to press our way and Crest every wave oh it's Jesus on the inside he's working on the outside he's making a difference in my life come on somebody they couldn't stop the people from Believing on him they tried with all their ideas but they still believed they hung him on a cross they put him in a grave they killed him until all the skies and the Suns and the moons refused to shine they hung him they put him in a grave but they didn't stop the effects of the message they've created websites they've created all kinds of things to stop it but there is a new era at hand the unbelief will not hold us back critics will not hold us back Skeptics will not hold us back depression will not hold us back ah I'm gunning for the devil today telling you there's nothing that is that is formed against you it's going to prosper there's a new era at hand where the Church of the Living God and we won't back up we won't get off of our promises we believe Jesus is Jesus well I don't know if I can believe a god like it let me tell you the god that I'm serving is the only God that there ever will be when all your Gods die Jesus will still be Jesus take your religion take your formalism take your intellect take your ideas but Jesus will still be king [Applause] Hallelujah now the Bible says in Hebrews 7 and 23 that they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he it because he continueth forever hath an unchangeable priesthood you see he was made after the order of Melchizedek which has the power of an endless life those Jewish priests were they were all imperfect they were all sinful men you remember when they would go in and they would offer a sacrifice before the Church of Israel the children of Israel that they first had to make a sacrifice for her themselves before they can offer a sacrifice for anybody else so these men were imperfect they could give no peace this sacrifice that they were offering could give no peace to the man's conscience there was need of something greater and something better and you go to reading the book of Hebrews you'll find that Paul's text and his thoughts that were transpired to us that is bringing to to us that the the law the law was was weak in this that it could not be making you made make you clean and make you manifest but what we needed was something greater and something better that's why Jesus came he didn't come to do away with the law he came to magnify the law you see these men couldn't live the message these men they they were doing their job under the levitically levitical priesthood and Jesus would say to them when he was giving out the levitical law in the book of Elizabeth he says there he says there he said all the Levites are mine they were in the correct order but yet there was no power to make them live what they were preaching but in our Lord Jesus Christ they offered Millions upon millions of lambs but they never had the power to wash away the sins but when my Jesus died one time once and for all I don't have to go up there and beat myself hang Jesus back on the cross one time once and for all [Music] elujah it's the absolute perfection what he did was complete and his office never needs to change notice what it says in verse 25 wherefore he is able also to save to the uttermost that means when you think he's done saving he keeps on saving when you think he's reached his limits he's just getting to where he's starting he's able to save to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such a high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separated from Sinners and made higher than the heavens don't you recognize how how big our God is Hallelujah but we recognize that he was the first one to come to maturity you see what the scriptures have said when you become into the land which I give you it was their possession but God was the one that was giving it unto them what does the land represent it doesn't represent the Millennium but the land Ray it represents our holy ghost that when I bring you to the position that you are destined to be in when I bring you to the place that your mothers when they were when they were in agony and they were in travail when they were birthing you and they claimed your name spoke your name they were setting your destiny for your location where you would live in the promised land and when you come into the place that I've destined you to live in Hallelujah there you shall offer unto me the way sheath oh Lord have mercy now that wave sheath it consisted of an Omer a barley and what it was let me just illustrate this just for you for a moment it was an Omer a barley that was still on the stalk that the that the person that had sown the seed into the ground he sold it out there believing that it would come up again because he knew that there was power in that seat that he was going to deposit so he takes the seed he places it in the ground and when it comes up the first one that came to maturity he took it before the high priest and the high priest would come out upon not just any day but on Sunday he would come up and he would wave it before the Lord so that it would be accepted that this was the first fruits what was it it was a sign unto them that they believed that there was more that was coming so so hear the high priest the man or the worshiper brings his offering to the high priest he brings it to the high priest the high priest takes him before the Lord and he begins to wave the offering before the Lord but so you see an offering is not an offering unless it's accepted by the Lord you see you cannot offer anything unto the Lord you cannot really Worship the Lord unless it's a sacrifice come on somebody you know what it's like to worship when you don't feel like worshiping that's a sacrifice to worship and here this this brother it's the first thing he ain't ate yet but he's coming to a spot where he recognizes that he takes his tithes before the Lord and the high priest begins to wave it before the Lord he waves it before the Lord so what is it it's a sign that there's more coming so you see the first fruit was accepted on Sunday you see it wasn't on Saturday but it was on Sunday that it was way before the Lord the sheath which was first of your seed that you planted when it comes up it ripened you cut it down the sheath and you took it before the priest he said but no he said this ain't Sunday no more he said it's not the Roman word Sunday he said but it's s-o-n-day it's Sunday again the prophet had the authority to say that where you're living in is Sunday it's the son of man living in this hour what did it say in Luke 17 and 30 that at the revealing of the son of man shall these things be when you look out upon the world and you see Sodom and Gomorrah living at its Heights it's a sign that the son of man should be here hallelujah hallelujah you see what it was it was a Sunday he was the first he was the first one that come to maturity and Jesus said except a corn of wheat be planted in the ground or Fallen to the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much more fruit you see this one seed that was planted that was planted in the ground that that worshiper knew what he was doing he was going out there under the inspiration of Moses taking his seat out there and sowing it in the ground what was he operating under he was operating under a prophet's Ministry and he took under his prophet's Ministry and he brought his worship under a prophet's Ministry he was doing everything according to what the scripture said and when the first wave Chief was waived it was a sign that there was more coming do you recognize when Jesus was hung up on a cross he was a sign for us but it was not a sign for our death it was a sign for our life Hallelujah come on somebody let's Preach Today to be waived over the congregation and when he was waived on the day of Pentecost what was he doing he was waving goodbye to the rest of the world and he was ascending upon high in the presence of the people you see what this sign was is that Jacob and Joseph told those Israelites don't you bury my bones down here because they knew that the first fruits was not going to come from Egypt they knew there was no Resurrection there but it was coming to them in Palestine he would tell them don't you leave my bones down here the wave offering isn't going to be offered here the sign isn't here the signs up there in Palestine you see that seed has got to have a certain environment it's got to have a certain environment it's got to have an atmosphere and I recognize that you can't be exact you can't produce your potentials unless you got the right atmosphere come on somebody you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and you take you stick your seed over in some watered-down gospel it'll never produce who you are but you get it in the right atmosphere you get it in the right atmosphere or the right environment that seed will come to life in you what did Jesus say when he was teaching us about the power of the seed in Luke chapter 8 he told us that some of them fell on Stony ground and they sprung up but because when the sun rose it burned them out because they lack moisture and the reason why some people are living where they're living is because they're lacking moisture and William branham's head and wisdom verse his face he said this the atmosphere has got to be right and it can't be intellect it can't be knowledge but it's got to be a spirit word a spirit born Spirit-filled son and daughter of God if you want to produce a bride you got to get an atmosphere of the Bride you can have all the potentials but something's got to draw it out of you if you're going to believe in miracles somebody's got to preach it right if you're going to believe in healing somebody's got to teach it right if you're going to believe for a Rapture somebody's got to teach it right if you believe you can overcome somebody's got to teach you to your right you might have been sitting there in that atmosphere of living where you were living at all the time of your life and never recognize how powerful you were but you were not a chicken to be going do you begin with you were born to fly a little bit higher let me drop this to you you have been released to soar to another level that's why John would say in Revelation chapter 4 come up a little bit higher you've been released you're no longer bound what did William Brandon say when he went a pair to that zoo and he's seen that eagle up there in that cage what did he see he said oh how I would have gave everything that I had just to release it he said but the worst thing about that he said more worse than seeing an eagle that's caged up when it was born to fly he's a son and daughter of God that's born to live as a son and daughter of God but Satan's got them all so ensnared under the power of sin that they don't live to the potential that they're supposed to live in but there is a Christ that is here to set you free that's where you can say oh brother Joel o House of Hell give way Satan you're an offense to me go away in the name of Jesus Christ there's something laying on the inside of you that's got to be released you remember that story about that duck that duck that was up there in that chicken peeing all those years is a his so-called mama told him he was a chicken but something just didn't feel right about it denominations told you that you never live out there this is what you were built to live in but there's something different about you your day was something on the inside of you that it just couldn't satisfy but that duck one day because he was duck he didn't care about the water he didn't care about the rain he was born for the rain the rest of the chickens was in the hand was in the pen but that duck was out there just going around the pen but one day his mama messed up she took him around the side of the house or the side of that little chicken coop and when he got the smell of water she wasn't going to stop him no more and when I got a sight of this message what no devil in hell gonna stop me from getting to where I needed to be I don't smell the waters Brothers I didn't smelt the waters and I didn't see any work on your life so I believe [Music] [Applause] if I can preach this message then you can have it you might be sitting there and you might be ensnared in sin but old duck it's time to head for the waters come on somebody the waters are here the waters are right oh God's gonna give my praise God's gonna give my praise devil get out of my way cause God's gonna get my praise I don't care how long you've been ensnared you might be in heaven have thoughts or you are chicken but you always felt different look different you are an eagle to be going with it's time to fly where you were destined to fly there may be been that tried to keep you in the atmosphere of wisdom but you are born for the Revelation there might be men that try to keep you in intellect but you are born for revelation there might be men to keep you bound down but you are born for the rapture what is it is assigned to us that's who you are when there's something that's drawing you when you begin to watch so drawing power of the Holy Ghost work upon a person's life you're witnessing that Christ is at work you was in some spots and he couldn't get out of them like Ruth was in a spot she was a moabitus was in a was in a nation that was cursed by God but she had a purpose that she was going to fulfill she had a place that God had chosen her fur that there there's a place of God swelling that she was going to be but you remember about Ruth her first husband was dead her first husband was dead and you remember that's the key of invisible Union that your first husband or your first Union has got to be dead you see the only reason why you're in the picture little bride and that you're able to represent Heaven is because you separated from your first Union the only reason that you are part of God's plan is because you disannode your first Union that first husband held you down that first husband makes you sin that first husband made you paint up your face that first husband made you act any way you wanted to act but when you separate it yourself from your first husband now look the first husband's got to be dead I'm preaching you the message your first husband's got to be dead and when he's dead then you can come under the liberty of the marriage of the lamb and when your first Fusion First Union has been broken sin has broke off of your life hail has been broke off of your life anxiety's been broke off of your life so brother Andrew how you preaching like that it's because I understand I know what it's like to be trapped I know what it's like to be ensnared but I know what it's like to be free I'm not like Johnny Crow waiting on somebody to tell me that I'm free I know that I'm free and you might be sitting there in your condition think you're still ensnared by sin but I'm telling you to fly [Music] notice what he says here he said well you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to a new spiritual union of not your natural life for the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you now your own book is gone with your old union now your name now your name and your older in your has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God had put it in the sea of God's forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God God loses none of his and Ruth those who may have been down there may have been worshiping the moabitus gods and worshiping and all kinds of things but when Ruth comes into the picture she comes into the picture into Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley Harvest I think it's powerful where you're living at you're not just entering into the scene at any uncertain time but you're here little bride at Harvest Time your inner here in Bethlehem and Bethlehem is a very powerful place there's all kinds of spots in the scriptures that we could go to it was David's Home Place he was it's Bethlehem it's known as the house of God's breath it is Beth lahim it is the house of God's bread it was this place where Jacob were sitting there and he seen a vision of the latter coming down and Angels ascending and descending upon that ladder and then Jacob returned and they begin to Worship the Lord right there at Bethlehem he built an altar there it was known in the scripture that Bethlehem was the smallest of all the nations of Judah of all the thousands she was the least amongst them but the scriptures had declared that there would be a ruler that would rise out of Bethlehem if you want to be a ruler you've got to go to Bethlehem I'm going to listen a while a little Bethlehem you'll see where William random comes and he preaches to us why it had to be Bethlehem there couldn't have been no other spot that Jesus could be born in because he said I am the bread of life and if you're going to have God's Bread Basket you got to go to Bethlehem if you're going to get filled with the Holy Ghost you got to go to Bethlehem foreign notice when when Ruth comes in to the scene Boaz is in the midst of harvest it's getting ready to be Pentecost and the Chiefs are getting ready to be waived and you notice that salmon is the one that sets up and founds Bethlehem he marries a harlot that's going to produce a Boathouse but you see God's Got A Plan he's got a plan that's bigger than your Humanity he's got a plan that's bigger than your DNA he's got an idea about you that maybe you don't fully understand but because you are in God's mind there is nothing that the devil can do that can stop you or get you out of God's mind you remember Jesus said that no man can pluck them from my hand salmon set this up and here Boaz is coming on the scene Bethlehem is known as the one of the greatest spots even today as the greatest grazing spots for livestock to this day it's known for the greatest spots for watering Watering your camel said it's got the sweetest Waters so you can go and get fed there and you can go and get the sweetest Waters there you remember when David is up there and he's looking out across the hills and he said oh I long for the Waters of Bethlehem so he set out a decree these men took the king's desire what was it the Father the the the Philistines had garest in themselves around Bethlehem they were trying to guard the sweetest Waters what is the devil trying to do today he's trying to guard the sweetest Waters and the greatest Bread Basket that there ever has been what is the devil trying to do he's trying to keep you from Bethlehem what is it what is his League of councils trying to do they're trying to keep you Garrison off from the water that's laying there in Bethlehem but Naomi when she watches Ruth come into her position she comes to the land where she where Naomi it's her home place she's born to be here her she's destined to be in this position and Ruth goes out there her first husband is dead she goes out there in the field what does Boaz tell her you stay right here in this field don't you get off on some idea don't you get off on some other religion you stay right here in this ceiling you stay in this message don't you get off my thoughts don't you get off what I preach don't you get because I got something that's going to take care of you Naomi when she watch row when she watch Ruth come back from the first day and she'd seen what Ruth had got she'd garnered five days worth of barley she said who is the man that took knowledge of you what did Boaz do he told him to drop handfuls on purpose for her what is it the ministry of Boaz today he is telling her drop the message preach the message give her what she needs come on somebody you're not going to be known as Ruth for more about it it's going to time for a change oh hallelujah what was it she recognized and she said blessed is he these men were under direction of Boaz because he recognized that there was some great power that was coming Naomi knew that there was somebody that had been their redeemer somebody was going to step in and take the place there was somebody closer Satan had some rights on you Bobo ass stood up your families your family showed you out to sin but Boaz stood up for you you're failing all kinds of things but Boaz stood up for you Naomi looked up there and recognized that that was her near to Kin her goel had stood up for Ruth said you just wait here you just wait right here let him do the work you can rest about this Ruth you ain't got to get hot and bothered about it boy ass is going to do what he said he's going to do stop trying to work your way into salvation our Boaz has already done the work he kicked his shoe off and threw off the Robes of of his righteousness and proved himself that he was a worthy one I feel Ten Thousand Angels surrounding us this morning there is a God that thought that you was worthy enough that he could come and take upon him the Robes of humanity to be made like you and job looked out there and he seen your Redeemer and he said I know that my redeemer lives what did he do he looked out there and saw the I am the same one the I am that was seen over there in Revelations chapter one that I am he that was dead but I Am Alive forevermore what did he do he conquered the Trinity of Satan he conquered hell he conquered death he conquered the grave when you feel like you ain't a conqueror he's more than a conqueror when you feel like giving up he did not give up what did he do he conquered death and when Annika told you a few weekends ago everything below death once it's conquered everything else below it is powerless you kick death out everything below it's powerless what am I saying to you there was somebody that was waived before you you see that word is the only reality that word will raise a dead body that's what Romans 8 and 11 tells us therefore this quickening power if it being you in a quick in your motor bodies you see what Christ was he was the first fruits of them that slept but what happened there what happened there what he was waived over the people but this was really the first fruits of them that slept everybody that went by the way of the Grave they never seen him no more but when Jesus came he was the first fruits of them that slept he was waived over the promise seed and promised and that they had promised of life upon it you see now when the wave Chief was offered when the wave Chief was offered it was a sign there's more coming don't you see who you are you're a representative of Heaven you can imagine as a farmer is working over his field he sees the anticipation of the first fruits coming to fruition he's looking out there he's waiting for the certain time it's got to be offered on Sunday and he's looking for the right time and he sees it can you imagine the anticipation of the farmer as he's looking out there and he sees his seed the original seed that he planted in the ground as he sees it goes into the ground and it comes and it brings forth can you imagine the anticipation what was that first fruit it was a sign it was a proof that there was more coming and when God raised up on Easter morning it was a sign that there was more coming there was going to be men that would raise and Conquer death there would be men that would raise and Conquer The Devil there would be men that would raise and overcome the powers of Satan there would be men that would raise and overcome the hell that would come against them it was a sign Hallelujah if I Rise they'll rise with it oh lift up your heads oh your Gates and be you lifted up your Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads all your gifts and lift him up Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory Salah what was it it was a sign if I R Us if Jesus rose you can rise goodbye world I stand no longer with you what gives me satisfaction in my soul is knowing that there is no grave that can take me down there is no sin that can take me down because it's a sign when Jesus rose up what did Easter prove that it was both mechanics and Dynamics that's what Easter proved is that you are a son and daughter of almighty God what happened in this generation the son of man was waived over the people again that the word had come into full majority again this was a sign of the full majority of the one that had came to maturity first William Branham was not a wave Chief Christ is our wave seats but William Brandon was the first one to experience the power of our Lord Jesus Christ with all the restraints removed off of him just go ask catty Wright how powerful this wave Chief is come on somebody just go ask those German Witch Doctors when they tried to call up a storm and tried to stop the meetings when William Bynum stood up there and cursed those storms go ask Georgie Carter how powerful our Lord is come on somebody just go ask the blind girl down there in Memphis Tennessee with cataracts around her eyes see what's got a hold of God's representative she wasn't going to let him go and if you can capture what's happening the wave Chief is being waived over the people what happened up there on the day of Pentecost it was alrighty a mighty Russian wave and win that went across the people and 120 busted out shouting speaking in tongues laughs hello you ain't gotta worry about doing anything wrong when the wave sheets been waved over you foreign I'll do something wrong the Holy Ghost shall never make you do anything wrong I'm afraid if I get that kind of religion brother Andrew it'll make me shout the Lord don't make you do anything wrong I'm afraid if I get that kind of religion it'll make me dance it'll make me speak in tongues it'll make me cry boohoo mess up my makeup if that's your case you need to get it washed off anyway this religion won't do your own thank you I know what this circle is and I know what it does what is it it can cast out tumors it can raise little dead fishies it can speak it can speak over opossum foreign what happens when the wave of Faith begins to move in this place all of a sudden your faith begins to recognize that there's somebody bigger than the preacher in her room and you begin to feel the pulsation of the holy ghost moving across the congregation what are you witnessing you're witnessing a bank of Faith being built up you watch like a service like this it begins to it begins to transpire and it begins to move into an elevation and it starts out right here and then all of a sudden the Holy Ghost gets into it and takes it a higher octave what is it it's a bank of faith in the people that's realizing that they are the people of the open book what does it do it elevates your faith to believe that all things are possible I was down to Tennessee here a couple a couple months ago when I I had the privilege go in and pray for sister Erica Parker and as soon as we got in the house you could feel the bank of Faith immediately as you got in there we had a few of us with us that were standing there and all of them witnessed the same power in the room what is it it was amazing to watch I was mesmerized by here's a lady in her condition heat up with cancer so-called that the doctor says that she there's she is incurable but her faith was so strong when I thought I was going there to encourage her she encouraged me you could walk into it it was a wall of faith that we bounced into let me tell you when you can have that kind of faith in you on your dying bed and you eat up with cancer let me tell you ever Endeavor in hell would never stop the faith of a son and living God if in the Church of the Living God when that faith is there hell don't know what to do with somebody when the message has been waived over you it produces miracles Hallelujah that's why we've got full opportunity to preach that Jesus is still Jesus he still does Miracles he still gives a holy ghost he's still a Divine healer he's still a Waymaker he's still a promise keeper the message has been waived over the Church of the Living God what is it it's the revealing of the son of man [Applause] I'm not looking at little William branham's I'm looking at Messiahs that believe that they're Jesus Christ in human body form again let the lepers come let cancers come let demons come there is no power that can stand before our living God what is it the message of Malachi 4 has been waived over generation it's a sign you're going into rapture we had a forerunner told us that we were greater than a grave we had a forerunner that told us that we was greater than sin I'm not preaching above you today Emma you remember you remember out in him old western days it used to be an old scout to go out he'd go out before before the rest of the wagons and he'd go out there and he'd what was he doing he was looking for the trails to the easiest trails to go down what was he known and he was known as a forerunner that Scout was going out there and when the Wagon Train was perishing out there in the wilderness in the hot desert and they're going through the Prairies they were looking for water so they had a scout out there and that Scout would ride past the Indians he'd ride past all kinds of all kinds of things that that would maybe try to slow down the Wagon train but that Scout was a forerunner and he would come up across a mountain and the mountain would be up there and the mountain he'd get on top that mountain and he looked down there and he'd see that there was water over there even though that Wagon Train was back there and they were perishing and they were without hope but there was a scout that went out before him and said hey and he went back and he told the boss of the Wagon Train said look here there's water over there get your wagons together I'm here this morning to tell you to get your wagons together there's water out there there is a fountain open in the House of David ever Endeavor in hell is going to try to stop you from getting to the water but the angels in it thank you every Devil's trying to guard it but there is a fountain well I keep going back to The Well of Grace full of power and full of Truth what are we doing we're getting to the water Hallelujah your brother random said that that Old Devil he's sitting up there in a machine gun and trying to trying to stop the people from getting to the ward getting to the Forerunner but there was somebody that went before him they done ran up the hill and went to the Machine Gun Nest and there's a devil repairs got his gun trained on you but Jesus is already up there he's going to stop the machine gun tactics from destroying your life Hallelujah hallelujah what happened on the day of Pentecost it was waived over them I know you I know you might think this is hard to believe it's a pretty decent sized room here but when they got up there in that Upper Room they were up there thanking God and praising God before the blessing ever came they were up there waiting on it because Jesus said you're going to be a witness under my under me and unto myself and he told them to go up there to Judea and wait until you're endured with power and they were up there I don't know how exactly how big it is but they had 120 people in that little upper room they climbed up them stairs and they had a little candle sitting on the windowsill and they were up there praising God and blessing God and singing hymns and praising the Lord and when there when the whole is so when the Holy sound of the Holy Ghost began to roll through there brother Branham said there wasn't enough room in there for them so they jumped out in the windows come down the house they get a dance and shout all over the tongues in tongues and begin to dance and shout and people begin to hear them in their tongues what was it it was that the Holy Ghost had been waived over them they were up there waiting for it but I want to tell you Full Gospel Lighthouse you don't have to wait for the Holy Ghost don't wait for it they were waiting for the blessing but you don't have to wait for it when he released it on the day of Pentecost I hear people say well I gotta wait 10 days for it you ain't got to wait 10 days for it this is the refreshing of the Lord for Isaiah said in Isaiah 28 11 that this is the refreshing of the Lord that with a stammering tongue well I speak unto my people this is the refreshing of it oh where are we living at where are we living at you don't have to wait for the Holy Ghost I've been talking to a brother that's been seeking a baptism my Holy Ghost I want to tell you you ain't got to wait for a One Day More you ain't got to ask for it you ain't got to beg for it you ain't got to plead for it God's more willing to give it to you than you're willing to receive it all I say is just get in the water I'll say Jesus has come here this morning looking for you what's happening this morning the message is waving over the people come on now come on get with me real quick they were all there double-minded had their own ideas they was going to go about their business and if they didn't get it today they was going to leave no they were there in one mind they were in the right atmosphere there was moisture there they knew how to praise God they've been with the seed word before they were not worshiping a dead God they were worshiping a God that they had already seen that could produce miracles don't you wait on it oh wait on it your blessings in the room your blessings in the room your Holy Ghost is in the room when he can take a little girl and change your life remember when William Branham was there just excuse me but we and Brandon Walks Into he walks into a a psychiatric ward and he's waiting on that he's trying to figure out where to start at and the room's full of all kinds of people that are mentally insane and lost their minds and remember he goes to a little girl he goes to a little girl and so where do I start at she said start with me start with me start right here with me he said well you're not a patient are you and that girl had been in church all her days but she got out with the wrong crowd hung out with the wrong boy took her down a dark Road and got doing this and went to this church meeting went to alcohol and all of this she lost her mind you know the story but William Brandon prays for her she prays she said I'm going to be different now I'm going to turn a new Leaf he said no you've done that before but this and you know the story but since you got back down again and she got [Music] but this is what I want you to catch is the power of the blood of Jesus Christ he said when God got done with her he took her back to the days of her innocency justifies you as if you've never done it in the first place the blood of Jesus Christ can take you back before you ever did wrong before you ever told your first lie I know I know that every devil in hell is trying to stop this but there's going to be an outboarding of the Holy Ghost there's going to be an auction when somebody receives what God is wanting to give out what he was was the first one to come to maturity but it's a sign it's a sign you can have the Holy Ghost it's a sign you can have your healing it's a sign you can be delivered it's a sign this morning don't stay there no longer rise up out of your sin rise up the way she's been waived over you the Dynamics are here you can put two cars on the same assembly line but one of them's got the same power as the other ones die but it ain't got no spark it'll never get off the track but if you ever get the Holy Ghost if you ever get a party if you ever get a spark of the Holy Ghost upon that engine it'll run down the road at the octane power that it's built for this ain't Homer Fraser's church this ain't Ron Spencer's church this is Holy Ghost Church this ain't our idea this ain't our fault this ain't Luther's day this ain't Wesley's day this ain't the restoration of the gifts this is the bright age where the son of man's been waved over that the message has come to full maturity it's message time it's bright time it's Holy Ghost Town it's receiving time I tell you what it is it's changing time the time is at hand it's time to leave this whole world it's time there's been churches churches Brides brides where there's got to come one that's both mechanics and Dynamics and she's here this is your hour this is your time this is your moment oh Ezekiel can these bones live again oh thou knowest your bone of his bone life of his life power of his power don't you sit there wondering if you can do it let the wind of the Holy Ghost

marriage of the Lamb he said this bride has the material to dress herself in what happened the world is going to turn their back on this there will be people that said in meetings just like this some sitting here today they say well I'm not going to be a part of that the Lord woke me up early this morning and showed me that there was a dark spirit that was going to try to condemn this meeting but this lady doesn't care about the Five Sisters out there on the back side of the porch she's heard the Scout tell her that the wagons was coming they may make fun of her they make Maeve make fun of how she dresses and how she acts and how she handles herself received a kiss oh yeah she's received a kiss come here baby that's you Reagan two days ago it was her 12th birthday and ain't she turned out

laden I'll give you rest father what are your children today and Lord we are asking that the god that can Purge our conscience our memory channels our emotions our imaginations father there is where the enemy battles us so much is in our spirit he spends so much time afflicting our identity of who we are and what we what we can and cannot do we spend so much time in our imagination in our reasoning and our mind battles but with all that I pray that the fire of the Holy Ghost what birth burn over the five senses of our flesh burn through the five senses of our spirit and burned a spot in our soul that'll seal us into the day of our Redemption father your children are here today we've witnessed the power of your presence as you've come and spoken unto us that you're the god that

thought that they could I pray that the supernatural would be expressed through my brothers and sisters right here Lord you said if we'd lay our hands upon the sick they shall recover it's a covenant unto us Lord that if we believe that not even cancer could stand before our prayer father hence in the name of Jesus Christ that we stand here under our commission and we believe father that you are
