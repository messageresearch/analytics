you pray as he prays this evening we believe all things are possible [Music] foreign gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for bringing us here this weekend we thank you for the powerful weekend that we had last week and as the lives were changed and I believe the sick were healed it is just up to us to be able to believe it and take it on Lord Jesus and as we take each and every one of these needs unto you we are coming to you because you are a living God the world can have each and every one of their gods whether it be the sport gods or whatever they may believe but we know that we have a message that has been brought forth to us and you sent a prophet that you that he could just speak your word and just have us to believe and that's the only thing that you ask us to do is just to believe your word and I'm looking at a people across the audience here and even across the Airways of the internet that they come to you every weekend they come to you every day in prayer and eating of the word because they believe in a God that can answer every single one of their needs we see the people that we work with and the the ones that are around us that may not even be here among the church they come to us because they know that there is something different about us Lord and though we have different things that we may fight within our own personal life I just ask that tonight we could just draw closer to you we know that we know our own personal battles we know the things that we are dealing with whether it's spiritual whether it's physical no matter what that may be Lord Jesus I ask that you will just come down and search Our Lives just as we heard last week if if the angel could walk by our road if the Holy Ghost could just search Our Lives what what would he find Lord Jesus I just ask it as you anoint the minister of the hour tonight that he may speak and call out anything that we may need to be cleaned out because when that time comes Lord we know that that you are coming for your children and that day is drawing ever close and that cancerous devil he may stick around for as long as he tries to fight but as soon as you call us home Lord Jesus and I'm not calling by the way of the grave but by the way of the Rapture that is so close that demon will he will flee he will be defeated because there is not one demon that will stand in your presence and I believe and as you sweep through the audience tonight that whatever demon is fighting your people the doctors can give it a give it a name we can give it to own our own names that that we may say that we are fighting but we know exactly where it came from and we're we are calling it to go right back to where it came from and that is the hell itself and Lord Jesus I just ask that if there is prodigals out there no matter where they may be there is not one that has gone too far we see the testimonies coming out of the past weekend service and I'm believing that even this weekend Lord Jesus you know the sons and daughters the brothers sisters the moms and dads that are out there that that your children are praying for that you will just sweep across right where they are at and you will speak to their hearts and you will just draw them closer to you allow them to to get into a church somewhere allow them to see exactly what they are needing and that is to be drawn closer to you there is not one thing this world can offer them that you can give them in one instant we just think for what you were doing we we ask you to be with our pastor continue to strengthen him we thank you for giving him the strength that you have given him over the tour last two and a half years but I'm looking for the day that he comes across this this platform and tells us he is cancer free there is not one there is not one moment that I that I pray that we don't pray for that you that you will just come and answer that Lord Jesus and we believe it in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen at this time we're going to receive this evening's offers brother Denny and brother Joshua that would come my sister Autumn should come sing for us tonight if you would and then after her brother Nathan Noel you'd come see amen God bless you you give this evening after you've given you can be seated [Music] all that he does [Music] lighter good right every day not even his words [Music] oh happy place [Music]

everything to me precious [Music] there's not enough [Music] we live in a country the greatest on Earth [Music] Miss Liberty let's go [Music] [Applause] me blessed [Music] is [Music] under his wings [Music] the reason I see [Music] this is [Music] something [Music] and God has been good so [Music] I have been blessed [Music] [Applause] thank you I've lost some good friends Departed in heaven to stay but thank God I didn't lose everything [Music] I've lost faith in people who said they care in the time of my crisis they were never there but in my disappointment in my seasons one thing never

God why don't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise Hallelujah Hallelujah that's our God Hallelujah God bless you this evening we'll let you have your seats just for a moment and man we'd like to just say it's a privilege to be back in the house of the Lord this weekend and wow what a wonderful meeting that we had last weekend Hallelujah Hallelujah to me it was one of the most dynamic meetings most epic meetings there's not enough adjectives that I could give out of how awesome last weekend was and to me to watch to watch what the angel of the Lord did last weekend is just it's so humbling to to recognize that we are a part of this great move and and to see what the spirit of the Lord is doing under the ministry of of this message and we're just so thankful to see all of the lives that were changed people go back home filled with the Holy Ghost completely delivered from all kinds of all kinds of things and just to see hearts changed and just to stand here under the the hour of this Revelation and see hearts stimulated by the preaching of the word it it does our heart so much good and I would like to just take this moment to to just thank you as a congregation to to witness what we witnessed as a church last weekend and I tried my very best to pick out each and every one of you I'm rooting for every one of you I'm the I'm one of your coaches in the corner or not how it done my heart so much good to watch you be so blessed by the preaching of the word and it does our heart wonderful wonderful things just to watch what the Lord is doing but we would like to take this moment just to just to take a time of appreciation for our people here at Full Gospel Lighthouse to have a meeting of this proportion and to have it go off without a hitch to God be praised for that and and we're just very thankful very very thankful I would like to just I'm going to go down this list and I'm going to stick to this this list so I don't cry and if I do cry I'll try to stick to the list anyway but I just there's so many things that we're thankful for and I know that I'm going to miss something but as as a leader here we're just we're certainly thankful but we we want to thank the Frasier family brother Vernon's his children and his grandchildren they they were the ones that were responsible they don't want me calling their name but I'm going to but they were the ones that were responsible for giving out all of those bags and all the goodies and we'd like to personally thank them for doing that the church didn't have to supply any of that it was just taken upon their heart and we want to say thank you thank you for all your hospitality that you've shown and we know that brother Branham taught us that you take on the spirit of your pastor and to watch what has transpired and transpired here we recognize that that this church has taken on the spirit of its pastor and I don't believe there's a greater friend in all the world than our Lord Jesus Christ but for brother Ron Spencer we have shown he has shown us the spirit of hospitality he's shown us how to be a friend and and that's being recognized around the world when when people come here and say this is the friendliest Church there is we're very thankful for that and I just want to say God bless you and that and we'd like to we want to thank all of the the brothers that were helping Park last weekend and and we're certainly thankful for that one thank our deacons our ushers all the personal workers brother Adam brother Gabriel to see these young men stepping up if you see brother Adam or you see brother Gabriel come and pray with these they are under the they are under the leadership of the ministry here they're doing that my duty is to stay behind this pulpit and worship and to lead and to preach and I've got these brothers that are designated to help me pray and so I thank you for watching what the spirit of the Lord is doing and raising up personal workers if you go to listen to the message you'll find that brother Branham had personal workers and and we're certainly thankful for these brothers uh we had we had the Youth Event last Saturday and we could not have done it without the help of sister Anna brother Jeffrey brother Adam sister Carly brother Jim and sister Charlene and uh we as a we as a a youth group could not have done it without out those words cannot be said to handle Our Youth and to handle everybody else's Youth and to watch the spirit of the Lord just get behind it our musicians thank you thank you very much thank you to I've had so many compliments come in from here and around the world about our music here and about our worship and just to watch the atmosphere that you all set and to say to say that we're blessed is an understatement just to add this in we have we have a family here that has has desired it's no secret that our our Believers that are coming from Durham North Carolina they have made this their home church and they've been praying and asking that the Lord line up the stars for them and on October the 3rd brother Randall Griffith will be starting here in the Shenandoah Valley and his family will be moving here and it looks like the stars are aligning for our brothers and sisters so I know that they would appreciate your prayers and their move here we're certainly thankful to have brother Randall his family here just so we're so blessed to see his children to see his children his family I tell you we're just a blessed people our sound and our video team thank you thank you so much there's so many things that you all have to do that I never want to do and to grab the atmosphere that is in this building and to transfer it onto a stream so that others around the world could be blessed I have had so many compliments and so many things and these brothers these brothers and sisters didn't have a clue what they were doing when they got selected to be placed up there they didn't have a clue how to run cameras they didn't have a clue how to run sound we placed our hands upon them and asked the Lord that he would bless them in it and the reason why we have this today is because there's brothers and sisters that have put their shoulder to the wheel and we're so thankful for each and every one of you the atmosphere the atmosphere that can be felt on the other side that's a very hard thing is to capture on video to capture and people texting me and emailing me and telling me that they felt the atmosphere of the holy spirit in their room and in their kitchen and in their car and it's just an amazing thing to be able to capture that and we know it's not the same but if we can capture just a little bit of what the Lord is doing here with that's we're very thankful but none of this could be done without our pastor brother Ron and we just so appreciate brother Ron with all of our hearts oh man we appreciate you for making all of this possible before we go to uh the word this evening I just last weekend as you know we had had a baptism after the after the meeting there and we're so thankful that we were able to baptize five in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of their sins and to see them take on the name of the Lord and to be filled with the Holy Ghost but last weekend I just want to make mention of this you know we baptize we'd baptize a lot of people throughout the years and you'll watch as the spirit of the Lord will will work and they'll they'll get under the anointing but there was not one last weekend as soon as they hit the water or as soon as they were coming down into the water they were filling the atmosphere and every every single one of them you watch as their their countenance change the spirit of the Lord was there Supernatural things were happening we we were able to baptize brother Isaiah Robinson that had just come back to the Lord a prodigal had been away from the Lord sister Khan sister Erica Hensley brother Tyler Chris and then at the end we just fell down felt an unction you know we've already prayed with everybody but we felt deduction to ask is there one more and sister Jenny shifflett I'd had her I'd had her taking pictures for us there and she said brother Andrew you've got one more God's good he's really good is there one more the atmosphere that me and brother out and as we were baptizing in that water was that of what I've never witnessed the dove of the Holy Spirit there that water that was was still water it began to churn and turn and as the angel was in the water and we just recognized that we're very close we're very very very close and and we just want to say thank you from the depths of our heart thank you today is a very special day a very very special day some of you are aware of it some of you are not but today is brother Ron's 15th anniversary from going through the fire 15 years 15 years Satan swore that he would destroy but it's still standing we've got a God that knows how to go through the fire and get you out on the other side so that he don't even feel or don't even smell the the smell of smoke on you and God is still God tonight 15 years and he's still God aren't you thankful that you still have a pastor aren't you thankful that Satan didn't have enough Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah to all of these things we are so thankful to God be praised to God be praised let's sing that song we've been made more than conquerors as we go into the preaching of the word have you come expecting this evening and amen thank you for allowing me to take that time I know that I missed somebody but we could not do all of these things without a team like we have here and to watch the spirit of the Lord get behind it you're just you're just an awesome group of people and I I thank the Lord from the depths of my heart that it I get to preach to you every single weekend and one of these days we're going to preach our last service one of these days we're going to baptize our last one but I'll say is there one more is there one more we've been made more than conquerors will overcome [Music] [Applause] [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ we've been made who we've been made more than [Music] who we've been made of through the blood of cheese Jesus Christ may come who knocking at your door but don't be afraid no it's not like me before [Music] then well don't let it get you down but you don't have to worry [Music] [Music] even made me glorious go through the blood of Jesus Christ Lord to be a sanctuary [Applause] and holy who tried and true oh with thank you [Music] oh for you if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the Book of Revelations chapter 10. Revelations chapter 10 and verse 1. amen Hallelujah I'd like to again I'd like to again speak to you on this thought for the third time on on When Heaven turns loose when Heaven turns loose let's just let's just speak to the author of the word this at this moment father we so fill the atmosphere charged with your Holy Spirit Lord recognizing that your your word is here father as we recognize that Eagles have gathered one more time to to feed on your carcass Lord and we've been reflecting and thinking about the good things of God about all the things that have transpired and it has happened here this past week but father we've come one more time to eat upon the the body of the son of man and father we're asking Lord that you would have control in this service father you'd bless your children according to your riches and Grace father that you'd minister to them on their on their their their lives father and contact them contact their Spirit just now and minister to them who the preaching of the word and Lord may you just come by our way and we'll be careful to serve you in Jesus Christ's name amen well the random said in the events made clear by prophecy he said the Bible foretells by prophecy what day that we're living in and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time not one time has it ever missed and it won't for you for who are predestinated to see it will see it Jesus said no man come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come it's the word joining with the word let's say that together it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else we know it the day that we're living in Revelations chapter 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders had uttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heavens and the things that are therein and the earth and the things that are therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is closed in the hand of the angel excuse me and take the little book which is open let's say that which is open in the hand of the angel what a day that we're living in which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand notice who John represents he represents the bride and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth Swedish honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we we just referenced just for a moment if you'd flip over just five five chapters back you'll find that when John is standing there in Revelations chapter five not just to read it for time's sake but your reference here we reference back and we recognize that when when John is standing there and John is weeping and he's weeping there because no man has found the worthy in Heaven Nor found in Earth heaven in Earth now or no man was worthy to be able to open those open the book and the loose the seals but there was a voice that came out from behind the throne that said John weep not for the Lamb of God has has come to redeem and to loose those seals and look at the hour that we're living in where we recognize that we are in the hour when the lamb has stood up in this hour and we recognize that that where we are that heaven has has come down to earth and to think that that when Jesus was standing there and his disciples were asking him teach us how to pray and he told he taught them how to pray thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and we recognize that his will is being done right now that all of Heaven's will is being done on this Earth on these Tabernacles where God has so pleased to be able to come and dwell in a body that to think that God now again has a body that he can rest himself in that he can lay his head down in that he can fellowship with to think that that God has a body and to think that the hour that we're living in it is it is the hour of the revealing of the son of man the very the very prophetic word that is being revealed in our hour and to think that that all of the prophets desire to to look that where you're looking at and to say that we are blessed is an understatement but to think that that even Moses desired to see God you see you're living in an hour that that we recognize if you go on reading over in the Book of Revelations that you'll find that there is where you see Christ in Revelations 1 that you see the seven personages of Jesus Christ and we're looking at him face to face but even the Bible tells us that Moses desired to see him and Moses was asking God can I see you can I can I look upon you and he said no you can't see me but I'll hide you over in the clap of The Rock and I'll let you see the back part I'll let you see my back I'll let you I'll let you look at me and as we see that when you go to read in the scriptures that Moses was hid in the clef of The Rock and he's seen as God would walk by he's seen the back part of God what was he looking at he was looking at God's theophany you recognize that tonight that God has a theophany and you have a theophany and to think that under Moses's Ministry after he'd come down after God had given them the two tablets of stone and he come down with the levitical law and he come down with the law that God had written with his own fingers that the Bible tells us that the law that the that the ministry of Moses was So Glorious that the children of Israel could not even behold Moses's face that they had to put a veil over Moses's face so that they could stand to look upon him but you recognize that Paul told us that we are not under that Ministry but we are under the ministry of righteousness and he said if you could look back and think that the ministry of Moses under that law that law there that it was so glorious he said Paul said but how much more is the ministry of righteousness this glory and to think that tonight that his glory came down on Mount Sunset and came down and revealed to us and told William Brandon to go back and to preach the Seven Seals it was the same Glory that was up there on Mount Sinai it was the same Glory that was up there with those with those Shepherds up there when there was an announcement that the King was coming it's the same Glory that's here tonight and it's that same Glory that is here and to think that where we're living at is the greatest hour Hallelujah notice what Paul said in second Corinthians 3 and verse 13 He said not as Moses which put a veil over his face he said that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded let's say blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even under this day when Moses is read the veil is over their heart say heart the veil is over their heart but nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now I don't have to tell you what the ministry of Malachi 4 was to do it was to turn the hearts is that right to turn them back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers but he said but when the veil is upon their heart he said but when it is turned but when it is turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so tonight to say that you're looking at Jesus Christ face to face and the veil has been taken away what happened it was the ministry of Malachi 4 that turned your heart and took the veil off of your heart so that you could stand here and you see that the son of man is being revealed in this hour notice what he said verse 17 but where now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass of the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord and to think that our heart has been turned tonight to think that our heart has been turned and to think that you were you were walking one way but when the ministry of Malachi 4 came your way the veil was taken off of your heart and you could see him to think that that you were blind until this ministry to think that you were sitting there with without an understanding but the Bible said in James chapter 1 he said if any of you that lack wisdom let him ask and to think that today that God that God foresaw you coming that God saw you coming and to think that your eyes are now open to recognize that there is a liberty in the spirit of the Lord there's a liberty to see that we're Sons there's a liberty to operate like Sons I'm gonna tell you you go back and read in second Corinthians 3 and then chapter four I happen to believe that those are some of the most powerful chapters throughout the Bible and we could say like Paul said that we have this treasure we have this treasure in Earth and vessels this treasure what is it it is that of the Holy Ghost to think that it was the veil was taken away by the turning by the Turning of the heart I could say I could stay 10 000 years preaching right there on the Turning of the heart but you think about the woman at the well when her heart began to turn what was it it was when the word saw the word on the inside of her and he saw something valuable on the inside of her what was it he was that Jean seed of God that he had placed there before the foundation of the world and she's just out there on another ordinary day just another ordinary church service for her going out there and getting her bucket full of water and going to return back to her way of living but this day was just more than just another ordinary day she was going to meet the word that saw the word on the inside of her and she began to speak to him and he began to contact her spirit he said woman why don't you go get your husband she said I don't have any he said no you're exactly right you've said the truth you've had five and the one that you're living with is not yours he begins she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet what was it this prostitute this woman of ill Fame this woman that didn't have a chance God saw something on the inside of her that nobody else seen and she dropped her water pot because she had representation by predestination it was that seed that was laying there that when the water Struck it it came to life to think that when that Waters took the Pharisees they called it be else above but when this water hit the woman at the well it brought it to life you watches people that turn their face towards this but oh Lord we're like Peter Lord where would we go the water has struck our heart it's turned our hearts back what is it we have come back to a complete circle that this is that that was prophesied by the prophet Joel that in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh what was it it was a water that struck that seed just like when when Philip began to testify to Nathanael he said look man we have found him you don't mean him oh I mean him the one that our Daddy's talked about the one the one that our daddy had talked about the one that they said would come the one that the prophets had prophesied he's here Nathaniel said oh no there can't be any good thing come out of Nazareth but when when Jesus when the Lord saw the word on the inside of Nathanael he said in Israelite in whom there is no guile what was it it was the seed under that Wonder getting struck underneath for that water what did they have it was that seed that was laying there to catch the attention what makes you so special it's him you think about what's happened and transpired in your life that's LED you here it's him it's nothing that you did it was nothing that the pastor did it was nothing that your mama did it's been the Lord he may have used your mom and he may have used the pastor but he was the Lord and it all it's not I it's not the man that works it up it wasn't the prophet he was the one Hallelujah he was the one that sent Malachi for that turned your heart towards this ministry without that seed being there you'd still be out there but because God saw you but for the foundation of the world you couldn't stay where you were little chicken you are an eagle to begin with that seed was laying there waiting on the water to come some of you waited all your life for this it was hungering in your heart wondering where can it come from where can it be but when the water struck oh I wish somebody would testify when the water struck their life why don't you have a testimony service when Satan comes around and he tells you you don't have it why don't you testify that the water struck my heart the water turned me the water made me who I am it was him that made the seed come to life [Applause] what's wrong with you what's wrong with that group they've been water struck this is none other than Jesus what brother Banner told us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's his threefold purpose coming down he's revealing himself in the in the form of the son of man in Luke Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 and he's having the preeminence in his body his voice is in his bride she is the live voice she has the voice of Resurrection on the inside of her and he said a third poll purpose was to restore of the Kingdom what is that it's the body change and you receive your body change when the last one comes in that's why I'm preaching to you if there's a water in the rock and you're still in speaking distance with it I want you to know there's water in this rock there's steel that water followed Israel everywhere they went there's water here tonight and you might be the last seed you might be the one that we're calling for is there one more let the water strike the seed oh God let Heaven loose in this place [Applause] it's a powerful thing it's a powerful thing when water gets cut loose all of you know all of you know you got water in your house you don't want it to freeze and you don't want it to bust out because you're going to have a mess but you put that water in the right channel it's a real blessing to you you can drink from it you can bathe in it somebody say hallelujah right there but it's a very powerful thing if it's in its Channel if you can get that water in the channel that it was destined to be here it's a powerful thing there's there's some power I have some powerful storms that are coming across this area and they're dropping rain which we love which we need these farmers are loving all this rain that we're getting this summer but rain is a very powerful thing it brings life in the natural and it brings life in the Supernatural it brings life in the spiritual if there is no rain in your life if there is no water in your life then something's been cut off and if there's a devil that's cut off your water why don't you go to him and tell him my Jesus paid the bill cut the water back home you can try to shut down the channel you can try to shut off the water but there there is a water that's coming by your way and it's going to strike the prodigal seed it's going to strike them where they are it's the water oh let Heaven turn loose [Applause] rain's a very powerful thing it had never rained until the days of Noah but it rained so much that it covered all of the earth 40 days and 40 nights but could you imagine to think that we're sitting here tonight and we have the ability by the preaching of the word to preach and souls be changed Souls come back to the Lord but no one was preaching on his ministry and he only and he knew that only eight was coming only his family was coming but for a hundred and twenty years Noah preached it's going to rain it's going to rain and I don't know who he is and I don't know who's not that's why I'm preaching to you it's going to rain because Dole chapter 2 told us that in the latter days I will pour out my former rain and I will pour out my latter rain the former Reign is the teaching grain but the latter rain is a harvest rain and brother random told us in the church age book that the Harvest rain is a rapturing faith and to think that this water that you're under let the water that you're under is giving you rapturing Faith which is more than William Branham this is the Angel of the Covenant that is standing right here to make Joy I know you've been led to the water but it's time to drink it's not a time to sit there and look at it and try to find your reflection it's a time to look and drink [Applause] I'm like David said in Psalms 34 oh taste and see that the Lord is good I think no one's preaching 120 years it's going to rain but I got good news for you the Bible said in Genesis chapter 8 that the heavens were shut up and the rains restrained themselves from reigning but the rain that you're under it's not going to stop raining this rain's going to fall on you until you have a body change what you are experiencing is the Holy Ghost this is the latter rain for a lot of people the rain is over but for you it's raining until foreign that look at it and say man it ain't raining over here let me tell you just stick your hands underneath of this Cloud one time put yourself under the seventh angel one time and you'll feel the rain you'll feel the rain I know exactly where I'm at I'm under the ministry of Malachi 4. we are under the greatest Cloud movement it's none other than our Lord Jesus Christ the player yeah yeah it's beginning to rain oh look at your neighbor and say it's raining it's raining in here brother Adam said in the key to the door he said therefore I believe in the Full Gospel he said every word of God that turns the power of God loose that turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks it now we know we go to reading over in Revelations chapter 4 that there is a door open that no man can shut so let me let me just grab your mind just for a minute and give you give you a little illustration maybe to help these little kids we got a little door right here we got a door that's standing right here and his name is Jesus and on the other side of that door is your blessings it's your healing it's your Miracle it's everything that you prayed for it's your deliverance it's your breakthrough freedom from depression freedom from anxiety freedom from back pain freedom from eye trouble freedom from circumstances is on the other side of this door what did Jesus tell us in John chapter 10 I am the way the truth and the life I am the door to the Sheepfold on the other side of this door on the other side of this door is everything that you have need of now just give me give me just a little bit of Liberty right here but brother random said it's the Full Gospel that unlocks the door so what is it this is before the seals were ever released and he's telling us it's the Full Gospel that is the key to the door so what do we do to open the door to these blessings we take the opening of the word and we open the blessings can I get on the other side of this door real quick you look good with your Miracle on you you look good with your blessing on you you look good with your prodigal sitting beside you you look good delivered you look good set free what was it it was the opening of the word that brought your Miracle by your way oh I wish I wish I had time to preach this but let me let me say this this door is open and hail itself can't shut it foreign [Applause] that's telling you that you're not going to get it that's telling you that your Miracle ain't your own your way that's telling you that you're going to be the only one in your family why don't you stop that devil right in the face said this is my inheritance this is my blessing this is my anointing everything that I have need of was locked up on the inside of almighty God and he loosed himself loosed himself ah brother Branham goes in 1956 and preaches he preaches a junction of time and he tells us that at a junction Angels appear prophets arise signs and wonders were done at a junction and to think that his angels are here the miraculous is here laughs how many is a miracle to be in the building now we've already know that the Bible tells us in Psalm 34 that his angels are going to keep he's going to keep he's going to encamp about you so we know his angels are here you've proven that as miraculous as here we've laid our hands on a sick and they've recovered what is it doing it's proving that he is the omnipotent one but he also tells us in the junction of time that counterfeits our eyes now what is a junction brother Bynum goes in he he spends a lot of time in 1956 and you'll hear him because of that because of that sermon you'll hear him grab from those seven sermons and he preached it all the way until his death that there is a junction and a junction is it is a changing over on the road it's a blending between two Roach it's a blending you're at a junction and you you got to make a decision you're at a junction whether you turn light turn left turn right you're at the blending and here we are we're standing right here at the blending of time and the blending of Eternity but notice the omnipotence is always there at a junction and you go back and you study out that that message on the junction of time brother Brandon ain't got time to go through it my brother Branham goes in there and he lays out seven major Junctions that happen throughout the Bible and to think when brother random comes here he tells us he said it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence who raised their hand said to your Miracle to be here it takes the miraculous to speak of the omnipotence now hold that in your heart he's he said now omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that he said teaching of the word is a very fine thing he said faith comes by hearing and hearing the word he said but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence still lives and he still Reigns he said we must have the miraculous and I believe that the church is now standing on the greatest on a threshold of the greatest Vindication of the omnipotence that the world has ever known and there ever has been and to think that when William Branham is preaching that in 1956 he's looking into your day he's looking into a day when the seals have been released that the church is not just waiting but the church is now here on the threshold of the greatest Vindication of the miraculous that's ever been done brother went on to tell us he said Moses before God ever liberated before he ever liberated Israel from Egypt he showed that he had the supernatural I was reading the other day brother Brandon when brother Bynum is standing there and he and he breaks into heaven and he breaks in on a conversation but here's my deliverer down here in Egypt he's just a little baby Pharaoh's trying to kill him everybody there everybody's trying to kill every two-year-old son I'm blow trying to kill out the Messiah trying to kill out the deliverer is that right and and God and brother Bynum goes in there and breaks into a conversation and he goes up there and he tells the porters of Heaven he goes in there and tells those angels you get down there on that Riverbank you get on that Riverbank and you tell you tell every crocodile you step on him if a wood comes if a piece of wood floating wood comes near it push it away and brother random said one of the Angel asked him where are you going to be at Lord he said don't you worry I'm going to be at the receiving end when Moses gets to his destination I'm going to be there let me tell you when you get to your destination you're not going to be disappointed he's already at the receiving end everything Hallelujah everything you have neither Jesus is at the receiving end [Applause] I know somebody's catching a prophecy right here you are going to meet that one that loved you before time began he's at the receiving end oh I think I'm just about speaking tongues the rest of the night but I got to preach to you for a moment but the miraculous is always done the miraculous is always done in a junction and when David when David was walking out there oh just another ordinary day just another ordinary day 12 miles from his household 12 miles from Bethlehem and he goes to the valley of Eli and he hears a disturbing sound he's here's a disturbing sound of a devil defying the armies of the Living God it was just an ordinary day David didn't come out there to be no national hero he was simply under the leadership of his father going out there to check on the welfare of his Brethren and see how they were doing taking them some cakes out there I tell you what I wouldn't mind being for him to David I like cake so you know anyway let me get back to preaching I'm telling you it's going to be good tonight he didn't go out there to be just another he didn't go out there to be a national hero but he walked out there and David understood that there was a reward for victory and he asked what shall be given to the man that wins this victory for Israel and they screamed out Saul's daughter is going to be given to the man that takes down this champion and I know we've preached every side of David and Goliath we preached every single thing but I'm sitting in my study today and a thought dropped in my heart wonder what goliath was thinking that day I wonder what the what was going through Goliath's mind it's just another day brother Ron said he got up and he ate 40 eggs that morning had his trim Healthy Mama I had as all all of his shakes and everything but I wonder what was going through Goliath's mind it's going to be a good day for me just another battle just another victory for the Philistines who's that little scrawny looking punk out there he ain't gonna be nothing I'll hang him on my spear tonight and we'll watch the crows we'll watch the buzzards come down who's that little thing out there I ain't got to worry about him he's so little I can't even I can't hardly see him I've got to look I've got to look and I've got to put on my bifocals just to see that little scrawny looking thing I wonder what was really going through his mind brother Fred when he looked on this David so oh no I got that one by pornography I've got that one by Pride I've got that one by anxiety I've got that one they're not they're not going to get anything out of the service I've got their minds so wrapped up on fixing their lawnmower and their weed eater I've got them so much they they're not going to be anything in this service I I wonder what he was thinking as he got out there and David started picking up Jesus on his way to the fight he starts picking up Faith on the weight of his fight now I know that I know that you know this but you hear it before you ever see it and before Goliath ever seen a rock coming out of that sling he heard a noise he heard a noise now I know I know I've told you this before but when we as little boys we lived right there in Pilot Virginia and those fighter jets would come flying over top of our household and you could hear them before they ever got there and we'd run through teeny's house all of us boys running through there like Bulls in a china shop tearing everything up just to get out there and who was leading us none other than teeny getting out there to see those Fighters that's going over you could hear them about 10 to 15 seconds before you ever seen them you heard it before you see it and to think that Goliath heard this sling going round and round and round and round before he ever seen that rock coming at his head I'd say that the same one that stood there and said who is this little runny thing that's standing out here before me that same Satan is standing up here let's grab his thoughts just for a minute I'd say Goliath was thinking oh snap I have chose the wrong battle today [Applause] wait a minute I've seen them people before they know how to use a rocker Revelation it's a time to start thinking about what Satan thinks about you oh snap hell messed up you chose our own battle you chose our own people [Applause] brother Branham told us in the adoption series he said there's coming a time when the sons of God will walk out there and take the power away from Satan and is this hour in the manifestation of the sons of God when we take the very power of anxiety away from the devil take blood pressure problems away from the devil take sugar diabetes away from the devil it's time that you rise up under the message of Malachi 4 and Ascend to higher Heights Christ descended so that you could ascend it's time to think what he thinks about you you see David knew that there was a reward coming if you don't give up you got a reward coming if you'll press the battle you got a reward coming if you don't give up Heaven is yours if you don't stop praying everything you ask for in Jesus name will come if you'll surrender the Holy Ghost is yours if you don't give up Heaven is yours if you'll fight if you'll battle and just get scarred up for the kingdom you'll take a ride in the Chariot with the King notice Miller Brown tells us he tells us he said you look at the tomorrow in this age it took a look at all the evil spirits and everything that's going on in the morale of the people people becoming more and more desensitized to the moving of God brother Brandon said now look he said when all hell is turned loose all Heaven turns loose when brother Madam says that he goes and he breaks into Isaiah 59 and 19 that when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard what is it it's God responding to the need just like when Nimrod was up there under that Confederation and causing confusion at Babylon he had a man down there that was blameless and his name meant dedicated he lived a life he was so close to God that he walked With God all the days of his life that he lived so close to God what was it all hell was being turned loose but all heaven was being turned loose and Enoch was walking so close to God that God said I can't leave him I can't leave him you study out his name his name means dedicated he was dedicated whether his wife was serving God or not he was dedicated whether his health was going good or whether it wasn't he was dedicated to the cause of walking with that same one that Abraham was fellowshipping with up there and to think that out of Junction Angels appear think about when brother Brown starts talking about thinking on your way that Mary began to think on her way just another ordinary day maybe I should have titled it that just in order their Ordinary Day just another ordinary walk ing down the same streets that she'd walk down before but brother Branham said that she was thinking about Isaiah's prophecy and it's when you go to talking about God is when God shows up what happened over in Luke 24 is those disciples on that Emmaus walk they got to talking about him and that's when he draws an ear but here as Mary is walking as Mary is is reflecting over Isaiah's prophecy and brother Adam tells us that they'd heard Joseph and Mary had heard the priests read that day over in Isaiah that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and you'll call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God With Us and brother Madam said that Mary was thinking about this and there was a flicker of light in the street and she thought wow the stars are a little bit closer tonight they're moving down just a little bit and out out of that flicker of light stepped a six-foot man with long hair about down to the shoulders Joe down to his shoulders and said Mary Mary Thou Art highly favored to think to think Mary you're the one Mary you're the one that Isaiah talked about Mary you're the one [Music] could you imagine you're the one that Isaiah talked about you're the one that Isaiah seeing what was it it was Mary fulfilling prophecy that was laying there could you imagine is all the angels in heaven are gathered around the corridors it's time it's time that I elect My Flesh My Flesh that I elected is now going to bring forth the one that is going to be called Jesus and he's going to save his people from their sins it's time notice the harmony that is to exist between the bride and the bridegroom she knows what he wants done with the word she has thus say of the Lord she speaks only his word she only says what he says she either says what he says or she sets steal do you imagine as all the angels are gathered as are watching this prophecy come to fulfillment and marry but can you imagine all of Heaven all of the Saints from out the ages as they're looking over this is she this is she this is the one we waited on this is the one that God for ordained Brad you're the one You're the One You're The Prophet's prophecy you're going to fulfill it you're gonna fulfill Malachi 4 said about you you'll be both of his bone life of his life power of his power Lorena said no he said dominance is speaking angels are appearing prophets are coming prophets are prophesying Visions are being poured out upon the people of this day the gospel is being preached the sick is being raised up the blind see the death here devils are raging impersonators Janice and Jammers are here but omnipotent speaks Hallelujah we are in the last day we're at the junction she's here you've arrived made Made Alive by the same quickening power laughs that Abraham met with the one that Abraham had been fellowshipping with and to think that the voice that Abraham had heard all those days led him to this moment you think about how you got here if you watch the Gathering of people and you watch the Gathering of this bride you begin to think about how did you get here not just talking about here but talking about to the message you think about you think about it what was it brother Brown said The Voice led him to this he said but why didn't Melchizedek come to him and who is this melchized he said why did Melchizedek come to Abraham he said because he was the one that had the promise I'm gonna tell you God Melchizedek didn't show up down at the church of Christ because they didn't have the promise I don't mean this in no disregard they didn't show up down to the Baptist Church because they didn't have the promise but there is a promise of a people that are sitting here under the ministry of Malachi 4 as John the Baptist was foreign the first coming to reform on the First Command of Christ so were William branham's message forerun the second coming of Christ and to think that you are here because there's a promise that you're going to bring forth a son and brother banham told us and who is a Melchizedek he said we'll take if you've died and you went on to your theophany you'll take this theophany go to meet your redeemed body your feet off and he will come and get this redeemed body he said but if you're here you'll take this redeemed body to meet that theophany oh one of this morning to look for me you're gonna look and I'm gonna be gone [Applause] what was it the fellowship it wasn't just communion it wasn't just eating but it was a fellowship with Melchizedek and this Fellowship was changing Abraham's cells started thinking he started thinking like a young man he started acting like a young man because his sails of his body were changing what was it brother Branham said that this word would put Sail on top of sail sail on top of sail and one of these mornings between the hours of six and nine what did Paul tell us in second Corinthians 5 that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have all one already waiting for us in heaven so you destroy this body and I've got a theophany already waiting on me you can kill me you can put me in a car wreck you can throw me in all kinds of trouble but I've got a theophany waiting on me that theophany is the real you do you recognize God had a theophany and you couldn't kill it and your theophany is the real you what was it it's the word seeing the word I I ain't got enough I ain't got enough preacher on the inside of me to preach to you the way I want to preach this tonight but when when Jesus is walking on the Emmaus Road with his two disciples he's walking down there the Bible tells us he began to talk to them about the scriptures concerning himself what was he doing he was showing them modern events made clear by prophecy and brother Bradley I think it's amazing brother bandham goes all the way back there 2 000 years ago and breaks into their conversation and he has a six-hour sermon with them on Prophecy you see Tom is no limit when you're walking with him things stand still when you're walking with Melchizedek he's been at this for about 45 minutes but if we keep walking we might walk right into a rapture ah he can't be going much longer he typically goes about an hour hour and five minutes if he gets a little long-winded it gets a button sometimes but one of these days one of these days one of these days one of these days you're going to take a walk and he's going to talk to you about who you were down here on Earth he's going to talk about talk to you about how powerful you are he's going to talk to you and tell you you were the ones that led them the ones that didn't have hope they looked at your life the ones that almost gave up they looked at your life but because of your walk this one's here that one's here this one's here that one's here my brother's here my sister's here because of your walk brother Burnham said he goes in there and he starts breaking down prophecy and pulling out prophecy and showing them who they were walking with he said he goes in there in Zechariah 11 and 12 and shows him that the Messiah was going to be sold for 30 pieces of silver he breaks into Psalms 41 and 9 and shows that he would be betrayed of his friends Psalms 35 and 11 he was accused by false Witnesses Zechariah 13 and 6 through 7 that he would be forsaken by his friends and his disciples Isaiah 53 and 7 that he would be done before his accusers Isaiah 50 and 6 he would be scourged by them Isaiah or Psalms 22 why hast Thou forsaken me Isaiah 53 and 12 that he would die between malefactures he was showing them who he was what was he doing he was taking prophecy and showing that it was once history but now it was a reality the Bible tells us in Hebrews 7 and 2 that he's a king of peace and he's a king of righteousness who was Abraham fellowshipping with the king of peace and brother Branham goes in there and he breaks into the king of righteousness and he said it is a spirit attribute he goes into there and says king of Peace he is theophany he said but there's one more King he said when he took on flesh and he raised this flesh back up again he said then he was King of Kings when he raised this body up he became king of kings and to think that tonight the brother Brian I'm standing there and who is this Melchizedek in 1965 he said it's King god king righteousness and King theophany you're not just walking with anybody tonight Church you're walking with the Great I Am you're walking with King theophany all right it's too high that we can't take it but to think that tonight that when he decided to speak to you he was speaking to you about your theophany the theophany is your real you this ain't about the flesh it's about the real you it's about you it's about the gene seed of God brother randoms up there in Colorado Mountain and he's hunting with those Brothers he's something with those brothers and he tells them they're calling for a blizzard they call him for a blizzard and he said now first sign they'd have made a pack and the first sign of snow we got to get back down to camp we got to get out of here but they wanted to stay they wanted to stay there and brother Brandon you know you know the story so well but I just want to take just a moment go right here that he's up there and he knows what he's told those boys he knows what he's told them up there get back down it starts sleeping it starts snowing and the wind starts coming down through and it's blowing he said it's so thick that he can't hardly see where he's at but there was a voice I said turn and go back where you came from turn and go back where you came from man it died in storms like that but he starts walking and listening to The Voice the reason why you're here is because you listened to the voice and you remember when he gets up there and he's sitting there and he said I am the Lord the ones that made the winds and the Seas and he jerked off his head I'm the one that created this created these things that created the winds or created these things I'm the one that told you to create those squirrels I'm the one that told you all of these things I am the one he said speak to the storm and it'll obey you he said you watch every voice he said if it leads you contrary to the word leave it alone he said but I spoke to the Witch and I spoke to the said God spoke to those storms and he said storm stop and when you cease and son you shine until we leave here what was it it was God in creation again speaking he was a Creator working through creation it was a word speaking of the word and I said something strange happened the neighboring cities they said something strange happened there was a blizzard coming but it all of a sudden just stopped brother said there come a wind down through here and it completely stopped he said the leaves had completely dried up where it had been raining on them and sleeting on them and he said I started to go on he said I put my shot my gold my gun around my shoulder and I started to walk and he said I Heard a Voice why don't you walk with me why don't you walk with me why don't you take a little stroll with me he said Lord it would be my greatest honor who are you walking with you're walking with King theophany I remember right and said here we were and I was walking with the Lord it's one thing for you to ask the Lord to walk with you but when he asked this bride will you walk with me and I'm walking and he said it just about my anniversary this is where a lot of brothers and sisters would kill us today he said but it was my anniversary and I'd been away from her every year 22 years I'd be dead yeah y'all y'all be looking for a new guy it's all like I say he said but I'd go up there to a little certain spot and I'd pay tribute to my wife and thank about how she stands between me and the public how she got gray hair and all of those things standing between the people and you know the story I just want to draw your attention to a couple of things right here he said there I was and that's standing there he said but all of a sudden something happened he said I began to think like a boy and every principle I was a boy again and I was young he said then I looked out before me he said there was me to he said I'll rub my eyes and she was young he said then I walked in a little space and said yes that's right well he said what's going on he said that's right I'm walking with you I'm walking with you Lord and remember what he he began to walk and it was he walked to a place and he heard and his tears falling on that on those dried leaves when the Creator does work he does it real well he said what is it he said it was tears dripping off on my face he said I looked out and I heard stomp stomp stomp and it was three deer out there he said exactly what we needed he said but I made a promise to the Lord that I wouldn't kill for other men he said I'd had this burden on my life for I had this burden on me for all those years he said I shoot those deer off and the Lord spoke to him and said you remembered your promise and I'll remember mine I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you you're welcome with Kings theophany and it was just a moment for brother random that he saw himself young again he saw his wife young again but you're walking and one of these days it won't be just for a moment in time all of the cells of your body who creates hell on top of cell and Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting he said then this will be said that mortality is swallowed up by life bless that heaven has touched you we think about all the things that has happened in our own life all the goodness of God that's run after us it's Heaven that has brought you here I was I was flipping through my Bible when I was scrolling through all of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled and a prayer list dropped out the prayer list our pastor and had us make years ago and God has checked off almost every single one of them and there were things that even happened last weekend that the Lord checked off of our list sometimes you're gonna you're gonna walk
