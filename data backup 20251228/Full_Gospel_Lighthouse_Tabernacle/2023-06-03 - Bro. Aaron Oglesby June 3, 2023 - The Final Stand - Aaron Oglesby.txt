opinion God bless you brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] come and gather with Believers of like Precious faith and it's just easy it's just easy you know when when you've had the burden lifted off of you that I've had lifted off of me when you've had somebody that unlocked the prison doors and took all your faults and failures and all your shortcomings and sins I wasn't worth dying for a church but it did it anyway it's pretty easy to worship that it's pretty easy to worship that kind of God Amen Hallelujah he's wonderful he's easy to worship Heavenly Father Lord in this presence tonight Lord this atmosphere Lord that you've stepped into Lord I feel the charge of it Lord I'm asking you right now to help me Lord to step aside Lord I have notes and things in front of me but you know the souls that are gathered Lord and that's what's important Lord I pray that you'll help me to step aside and allow you to feed Lord allow you to deliver allow you to speak Lord the way that you choose Lord we humble ourselves now and recognize our own insufficiencies Lord but you're never never insufficient you're always enough you're more than enough Lord I ask you to come now Lord and speak take control from this point on Lord Jesus have your way Lord in all things that said and done Lord Lord I pray not only that I'll step aside but that your people Lord will step aside and and Lord allow you to hear through their ears that the word would fall on good ground Lord we ask these things in the name of Jesus Lord just bless us in your presence amen and amen amen isn't it wonderful to be in the house of God Amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians and as you're turning um I tell you I feel more than than at home here I'm I'm back amongst my people um I say that because y'all are family to me most of you probably remember it but this was the very first church I ever spoke in outside my own outside of brother Tim's church not my church sorry about him outside of his church this was the first church that I ever spoken and and brother Ron is is uh to say a friend almost doesn't seem enough you know he's he's more than that and the Spencer family and all of them we love them so dearly and and we've grown to love each and every one of you in love of the Lord and I've always treated us so well and we thank you and we appreciate you from the from the bottom of our hearts and I'm thankful to have my family with me tonight my wife Lydia my children Aaliyah and Jude and Jackson and and we're just thankful to be here I always say it you get amongst Believers you feel the same sweet welcome spirit and I I sure feel it here tonight so we love you and we just pray that the Lord will have his way amen Ephesians 6 and 10. verses that surely you're very familiar with we'll read down through verse 14. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness amen I pray that the Lord bless the reading of the word as you have your seats as you read that scripture you notice it doesn't sound like that that the people are getting ready to go on a picnic he's talking about to be strong and put on the whole armor of God and and to be courageous and how we're going to be um wrestling against not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers he's describing a conflict he's just it's not a picnic that we're reading about here but but he tells us that when we've done all that we can do to stand to stand in other words go beyond what you're even capable of after you've done everything you can do when you have nothing left to give give some more but where does that come from where does that extra come from where does that strength come from when you don't have the strength to stand that's where he comes in the picture you've done all you can do and you're about to give up and you're about to quit and you can't go anymore he says stand now if he commanded you to do that but he's already spoke that he understands you've done all you can do but he commands you to do that then he's obligated to come and give you the strength and the ability to continue standing amen we're in a tough spot we're we're in an evil time and sometimes it feels like I just can't go on you just keep standing he's going to provide exactly what you have need of Amen we're going to speak tonight for a moment on the final stand the final stand and we're standing in uncertain and Troublesome times but but only uncertain in the sense of Earthly things amen it's only uncertain in the sense that our politics are corrupt it's only uncertain in the sense of of the education system has become the indoctrination system it's uncertain in the sense that economies are unstable things out here in the world are unstable so tonight if my Hope was in my job if my Hope was in a 401k or in a retirement plan or in Social Security or My Hope was that the government's going to do the right thing to take care of me I would be the most miserable of people tonight amen but that's not where our hope is tonight Our Hope has been turned away from the things of this world and our hope has been turned not from the day today but to a never-ending day to Eternal things that's where our hope is tonight it's in the unfailing God who has given us an unfailing word and tonight we look at that we know if he can't fail we can't fail because he's leading us into battle it's him leading the charge it's him guiding it's him providing if he's unfailing he's never failed he's not going to start tonight Church he's not going to start tonight I look at his track record and I see victory victory victory victory victory what will we have tonight in the house of God Victory after Victory after Victory you can't lose you're not gonna lose don't be scared buckle up go under the battle what's going to happen tonight brother Aaron Victory is going to happen tonight we can't lose but I've done all to stand stand there for you are not gonna lose tonight Hallelujah there will be victory if my Hope was in those things I'd be pretty shook up tonight and the fact is things are pretty stable compared to what they're going to be I don't want to be what they might call a Debbie Downer if there's any sister Debbie's here tonight I'm sorry or anything oh I don't know I gotta go that one I know there's a sister Nancy in this church but things are going to get worse things are not gonna get better but all of these things that the rest of the world is looking at is going to pass away the good of it the bad of it and the Ugly of it is all gonna go because it's temporal and it's fleeting and they're All Shook Up but they don't know what to do about it they don't know where to turn that they they recognize that the day-to-day of this world is messed up boundary stones are being moved Society the the the Fabrics of society are being torn manhood has been torn Womanhood has been torn family structure has been torn economies are crumbling banks are failing and we're staring right down the barrel of World War III and yet here we are leaning on the Everlasting Arms here we are safe and secure here we are not worried here we are not shook up why we have a promise we have something to stand upon our goals are completely intact our goals are everything shaking everything's crumbling everything's falling apart and yet our minds are completely out peace or are completely at peace how is it because in his arms I feel protected in his arms I feel safe in his arms I'm secure there's no place that I'd rather be how can it be that way because whether it's good times or whether it's bad times whether it's well times or whether it's sick times whether it's Rich times or whether it's poor times I'm gonna wake up I'm gonna put on the full armor of God and I'm going to overcome by the spirit I'm gonna have Victory by the spirit I'm going to walk towards a whale Body by the spirit I'm going to walk to a Rapture by the spirit regardless of what shaking's going on out there I'm gonna overcome tomorrow just like I overcame today you may feel worse tomorrow than you felt today what am I gonna do I'm gonna overcome again I'm gonna be victorious again I'm gonna take more ground again each and every day taking more ground gaining more ground and regardless of the conditions of this world regardless of how it is tonight or how it is tomorrow or how it is next week the Bride of Jesus Christ isn't shook we're not Shook Up we're standing on a firm foundation we have a rock like no other tonight to stand upon he's a strong and mighty tower I truly feel this way tonight that I'm not peace how many can say I'm at peace tonight that I know and in whom I have believed I know that his word will never fail and we can be at peace even though we are at War We Don't Preach those things to pretend put our head in the sand and pretend like we ain't fighting we're at War tonight there is a battle rage and I understand it ain't easy I understand that some of you go through things I will probably never have to face brother and you don't understand you're exactly right I don't and I don't pretend it's easy but I do know one who's greater I do know one who will pull you through that it is a war but we're called to stand and we're called to fight and he is not only called us if God calls you to something he will equip you for it so you may not realize it tonight I'm a weakling I'm a nobody no you are the best of the best of the best you've been called for the final battle the final charge the greatest battle that's ever been listen you're like the Eternal Army Rangers he looked around for the very best who can I find to stand in the last day when it's going to be worse than ever when the demons are released from the river Euphrates when all hell is upon the Earth who can I send down there that's going to stand who's it going to be Paul no is it Peter no who's it going to be you he called you he chose you and he didn't choose you to fail and he didn't send you here unanointed and he didn't send you here unequipped he equipped you he called you he sent you and he's anointed you for what victory victory brother Brown says what's the matter with people today who claim to be Christians why are we Disturbed in an hour like this let's not be disturbed let's be soldiers amen let's not be disturbed let's be soldiers soldiers tonight what do soldiers do soldiers fight soldiers fight soldiers fight what are we fighting for tonight we're fighting for truth we're fighting for the faith that was once delivered amen fighting for our inheritance fighting for Hebrews 13 8. I say fight tonight for your children fight tonight for your marriage fight tonight for your peace fight tonight for your joy fight tonight for your health fight tonight because you've called to fight tonight for your freedom fight tonight don't lay your sword down let's be soldiers not rattled not shook oh no they're firing shots yep that's what the enemy does I got some advice pick up your weapon and fire some shots back it's been too long that we've been on the defensive oh no oh no I say charge into the battle take your weapon tonight get back to the enemy's camp and take back what he stole from you that's mine that's mine that's mine I will have peace I will have joy I will have Victory I will have my healing Hallelujah the devil took it but he can't hold it because we coming we coming we're coming we're not gonna sit back and let you rob rockets at us anymore pick it up put it in and lob it right back at him tonight go on the attack [Applause] we gotta be soldiers not worried about everything that's going on out in the world not bogged down by the world but eyes on the prize focused on the goal second Timothy two and three he says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that woreth entangleth himself with the unfairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a Soldier he called you and he chose you to be a soldier listen we knew this was coming I don't understand the shock that we have about how bad the world is how are we so shook up and shocked when things we supposedly believe come to pass oh we're ready for the end time we want the Rapture you can't have the Rapture without the end time you can't have the end time Without End Time conditions oh we're ready we're ready oh no what's happening what the word said was gonna happen what the message told us was gonna happen it's exactly how he said it was going to be if anything this shouldn't Shake us this should make us more laser focused than we've ever been before he said what do you do when you see all these things happening look up your Redemption draweth nah listen I look around at the world today and it don't shake me more than ever I recognize William Branham was a prophet more than ever I say he was the messenger that was Revelation 10 7 because I see what he said happening day after day after day after day well I just don't know what to believe I do it's more clear than it's ever been before this is the truth this is the end the Rapture is upon us now stand It's the Final Stand draw your swords and fight soldiers fight [Applause] Hallelujah this is the greatest battle ever fought we can't be living breathing and eating the news cycle all the time this conspiracy and that fear and Russia this and the lgbtq elementop agenda constantly feeding on it constantly worried about it constantly afraid listen look sodom's going to Sodom let me go and tell you you don't got to read the news tomorrow there'll be some crazier law tomorrow than there was today it's going to get worse it's gonna get worse they're gonna do what they're gonna do that's okay because the bride is going to bride we're gonna do what the bride's gonna do we're gonna get closer and stronger and better than we were yesterday closer to a Rapture more Victorious we're getting look at the headlines look at the right headlines today we overcame today we stood today we were victorious today we were delivered today we were healed today we overcame by the blood of the Lamb there is just some headlines read that feed on that chew on that get your head out of sodom's headlines our headlines say victory victory Hallelujah let's get it on the right News Channel Hallelujah [Applause] listen Abraham wasn't caught up in the 24-hour saddle news cycle Sarah did you hear what they're doing in Sodom today can you believe it Sarah can you believe I was looking at lot's Instagram you ain't gonna believe what they're doing down in Sodom it's getting real bad inside them have you heard what happened no he was in the tent door watching he wasn't watching the news he was watching for fulfillment he was looking for the promise he was looking to Fellowship he was looking to entertain God and because he was watching and because he was looking what happened he received a visitation oh come on church I'm looking for a visitation tonight I'm looking for a visitation not just a not just a one-time thing where we feel the anointing on how I love it but I'm looking for a visitation where my body gets changed like Abraham's was there's a promise son and you're not gonna see it coming if you're looking at the new cycle of Sodom but if you're sitting in the tent door going I'm looking I'm longing I'm waiting Lord come quickly now you want to entertain angels look for them prepare for them have an atmosphere ready for him and get your head out of the news cycle he was in the tent door looking and because of that he received a body change let's turn our eyes back to the truth tonight turn our eyes back to the message back to the task at hand and begin to focus once again on what am I called for because by staying focused on all those other things you're literally getting engrossed in what they're called for I'm not called to what they're called to so why would I feed on what they feed them I'm called to something different so that's where I want to put my focus tonight what am I called to why am I here what am I to manifest what did he manifest why was the son of God manifested to destroy the works of the devil well listen here bone of his bone and flesh of in flesh prophet of God said that the church would have the same type of ministry repeat that the group The Bride would have the same ministry as the groom we got some work to do why am I here let's refocus why are we here to tear down the works of the enemy and you're not going to do it without battles you don't win victories without battles so instead of griping and getting down and getting upset I look I know sickness ain't fun I've been there trouble in the home ain't fun I've been there those things ain't fun but we got to start looking at them as an opportunity for the word to be manifest in our bodies an opportunity to dare to tear Satan's kingdom now you dare come into my home you dare attack my daddy you dare attack my pastor you dare tear up the peace in my home this is an opportunity for me to take the word put it on my lips it'll be the same as deity speaking and what happened when you face the groom is the same thing that's going to happen when you face this bride it's an opportunity for victory you never won a game you didn't play you never won a battle you didn't fight and I'm gonna tell you if every devil is going to be under our feet collectively think about this now then every demon even the most perverse ones are gonna come against people of this bride and be overcome by them in order for every demon to be conquered somebody's got to conquer it these are not characterless events we look at it so well the bride's going to overcome and the bride's going to Rapture and somebody's gonna yeah but we got to quit looking out there for fulfillment and saying what is it I am to fulfill what part am I supposed to fulfill because it's not just somebody it's you you have a part to fulfill amen we're at war with the Devil that's our purpose we're at war with the devil and we are on the front lines and this just this isn't just any battle this is the last battle this is the last one it's a battle for Souls it's a battle for your family it's a battle for the change of our bodies it's a battle for the rapture and you must be all in you are not going to win this battle as a lukewarm cold formal Christian you're not going to win the battle that way I'm just telling you right now if you're not all in if you haven't sold out I ain't saying you're lost and there is still time but I'm telling you there ain't much time you better get serious you better get all in you better push everything else aside quit worrying about this quit worrying about what somebody thinks quit getting offended by every little thing that comes over the pulpit let's get our eyes on the focus get our Focus back on the word I know it's close I know it's coming listen even nominal people know we're at the end they know we're at the end and they don't know what to do but listen I'm telling you we're at the end and you know what to do get in the ark get in the ark get in the ark it's time to go you gotta go all in surrender everything job career you do what you gotta do relationships you got a relationship holding you back it's not worth your soul you gotta be oh we're called to fight called to stand it's a battle and it

no good you wasn't strong enough you didn't have it in you and I look around and go we're still here we're still here he's been test time for you to look at me in the eyes Hey listen you've been telling me that long enough I was going to quit listen it's time that you let him know you don't have enough to make me quit I'm still here I'm still fighting I ain't going nowhere there's still some rounds left in this championship fight and I'm answering the Bell tonight I'm coming to the middle of the Ring I ain't going nowhere I'll be on your hands until you're cast into the lake of fire I can't quit there's a sea Gina God on the inside of me and my flesh may want to it says you can't quit you gotta make it you're called to make it you're chosen to make it you're predestined not to fall that's you tell him I'm still here I'm still fighting I'm still standing the final stand Hallelujah This Is War Satan has masked his entire Army here for one final offensive one final push one final attack an offensive is a military operation that seeks through an aggressive projection of armed forces to occupy territory or gain an objective or achieve some larger strategic goal designed with one purpose in mind to defeat you he's got one more offensive every enemy troop is masked in this age every one of them's gathered in laodicea for you but let me tell you tonight they're not being gathered for your destruction they're being gathered for their destruction oh all the Pharaoh's Army came down there and they thought it was for the destruction of Israel but the Red Sea wasn't for Israel's destruction it was for Pharaoh's destruction and Satan has loosed all his forces down here in this day and they're gathering around and they're laughing and they're sneering and they're coming closer and closer and God's look at going yep he fell for it again he's brought them all into one place again so we're going to wipe them all out and one Fell Swoop listen that trial is not sent to destroy you that trial has been put in your life for you to destroy it it is not your destruction that we're coming to it is the destruction of the enemy it is the destruction of cancer it is the destruction of anxiety it is the destruction of depression that suicide spirit is not going to destroy you you are going to overcome it and it will be the destruction of suicide his Army's all in one place easy target it will be the destruction of Satan and his forces they've all gathered in this age and there's never been a more unbelieving age than the age we live in now just speaking of America I saw a statistics at 163 million Americans do not attend church of any kind 163 million this is the age of doubt and unbelief brother Brown told us that unbelief is the most horrible thing that there is in the world he said the greatest devil the chief of all devils is unbelief the chief of all Devils has infiltrated this age through schools through entertainment through the news and worst of all through religion the chief of all Devils infiltrated through religion Satan has taken 6 000 years since the fall of Man to study your weaknesses he knows us better than we know ourselves he is poked and he is prodded and he has brought his whole Army here and set it in a ray for the battle 200 million demons released from the river Euphrates and you are the target think about it they have purpose within themselves that you will not rapture that you will not be victorious that you will not have peace you will not have joy that you will not overcome and they have created an Eden of hell here upon the Earth I read some of these things it says anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States affecting 40 million adults think about it what we talk about at the beginning Banks collapsing foundation's shaking jobs economies Wars if that's where our hope laid I'd probably be peeled up like one of them people too listen them people ain't trying to be pillhead them people are looking for peace I understand it's real battles I understand anxiety is real if that's something you struggle with I ain't knocking that you can be delivered from it there's one in the house that'll deliver you from that tonight I understand depression is a real thing I've fought that demon it's very real but you can be delivered from it you don't have to walk around bound down by Thing by that thing held down living below your privileges there's there's there there's a freedom in the house of God that'll loose you tonight you'll never have to carry that burden again we don't downplay those things and act like that they're no big deal they are a big deal they're real and 40 million Americans struggle with anxiety 18 of the entire population is on anxiety medication 17.3 million Americans yearly struggle with depression one person every 40 seconds in this country commits suicide it is the second leading cause of death amongst teenagers 40 million Americans say they regularly visit pornography sites one in every five mobile phone searches is for pornography Aaron my kid don't struggle with that get your head out of the sand and recognize the attack that's coming against your children four percent of Christian men and 15 percent of Christian women say they watch pornography at least once a month thank you this is the most unbelieving age that has ever been it is the most sinful age that the world has ever seen when those statistics are being pulled from the so-called Christian world think about that but that's what happens to the Christian world when you don't hold the line when you give a little bit when you give a little bit of ground listen it's a bottomless pit it's a slippery slope so these discussions on well why does this little thing here matter and why does that little thing there matter because we're instructed in the word not to move the boundary stones he set the boundaries for a reason if he put the boundary there it matters if it's in the word it matters and when you start moving it a little bit listen the enemy ain't just after your joy the enemy ain't just after your peace those are just little places he's nibbling trying to get a foothold but he's after your family he's after your soul he's after all of it so I say he can't have none of it listen why we want to wait till he gets inside the house to do something about it I say if he steps on your property get the double barrel shotgun out and get out there and blast him out of there quit wait until he gets in the bedroom quit wait until he gets in the house deal with it now deal with it tonight stand out and say I will fight you're not taking my kids you're not taking my joy you can't have my marriage you can't have my victory deal with the thing fight for it fight for it it's worth fighting for your children are worth it your marriage is worth it your soul is worth it fight for it it's what happens when you don't hold the line it's what happens when you give a little ground you end up the cage of every unclean and hateful bird but in the midst of that unbelieving age in the midst of all that stuff we just read there is a people standing for truth there is a people standing for the faith and they're not just standing for a part of it they're not just standing for a little bit they're saying give me my mountain give me all of it I believe all of it from the beginning to the end you can't just hand pick I like this and I don't like that there's a people standing for all the words tonight amen all of it they believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they believe in the moving of the spirit they believe in the Supernatural they believe in living under the token men God called men and women who stand for truth that stand for all of it why because they've been turned back by the message of the hour turn back to the original and they say this is good ground and on this we'll make our final stand we got good ground church anybody who studies any kind of military history knows the ground many times dick takes the outcome and you didn't like to fight a battle if you didn't have The High Ground We Got The High Ground we got good ground it's worth standing on it's worth fighting on you will come out Victorious if you stand on this ground amen Psalms 18 39 tells us for thou has girded me with strength unto the battle and what do we say Satan has amassed all his forces here and he's in full Attack Mode he's going on his final offensive one final push and there has to be someone who says we're not going to run we're going to stand listen it's not time to back off it's not time to relax listen the current of this world is Flowing so swiftly that if you relax for one minute throw something like a piece of paper in a current it goes it's gone you got to be ever fighting Upstream ever going against the current ever pushing no time to relax ever fighting it's time to buckle up like never before pour your sword out and swing it like never before get into the word like never before and in the midst of the greatest battle ever fought Hold the Line Hold the Line tonight you're not going to have to do it alone you're not going to have to do it on your own strength brother Branham says the greatest battle ever fought she's going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt and my between Liberty and bondage the battle is on Shine Your spear soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen God anoints his army there it is right there that's good enough for me that's good enough for me I ain't got to worry about it because I don't told you he didn't anoint us to lose you're not operating under the anointing of a man I saw another Mighty Angel because you want to know where your anointing is coming from it's coming right there you are anointed to be victorious you are how am I going to overcome depression you're anointed to defeat depression you're anointed to overcome anxiety you're anointed to overcome suicide you're anointed to cast Satan down you're anointed to Rapture that's what your anointing is in this day you have been anointed to hold the line when nobody else could when denominations have fallen away when this one's run and that one's run when websites are making people flee I look around and I say we're still holding the line I still got Brothers on this side sisters on that side and we're still here fighting you know in a battle there's times where the enemy goes on the offensive to take the position that you hold to take what you already possess and in those situations you must hold the line and what does it mean to hold the line it's to Hold Your Position in the face of the enemy to hold against an offensive meant to break you to hold the line you must be uncompromising unrelenting and unyielding on the promises that God has given you and that's what's going on in this day is Satan has come to challenge our position to challenge our position and and what Satan has done in this day is a sort of what's known as a blitz Creek he has masked all his troops and he's attempting a shock in all technique to get you fearful and to make you move from your position and a blitzkrieg was a technique that Hitler would use during World War II it means lightning war in German and it was the it was it was fast powerful strikes where the Germans would use tanks and artillery and swiftly strike at your lines through an overwhelming Force to break through and it would seemingly come out of nowhere everything would be calm and quiet the battle seemed to be died down and all of a sudden a blitz Cree all their tanks all their artillery all their men all of it in one spot and it would hit you with the full attack whenever you weren't prepared and even if you were prepared it seemed impossible to withstand and during this time period Nations crumbled before Hitler and his military in the early years of World War II as he ran rough shot all through Europe fear gripped the world people literally had came to accept and believe that Hitler was going to control the entire world could anyone stand up to Germany in this Blitzkrieg machine and as the war though as it began to drag on into late 1944 the tide of War had actually shifted and seen and things began to favor the allies and Hitler's invasion of Russia had bogged down he had been turned back in North Africa and the Allies figured that the surrender of Nazi Germany was very near the ending had become clear and it seemed as if Hitler would recognize this as well but instead of surrendering what Hitler did is he prepared one final offensive and it sounds exactly like the day that we're living in a message came in power and demonstration night after night Satan was defeated the bride was called out and we're marching you know more each and every day tearing down his kingdom the Rapture is at hand it seems like the writings on the wall brother Matt it's all almost over the writing's on the wall right we're going to win how many believes that we've seen the back of the book we're going to win the writings on the wall and it seems like Satan would recognize that as well but instead Satan mounts one final offensive listen it's in the closing hours of War it's in the I read a thing the other day that said on major construction projects they'll go years without an accident and in the closing days they'll have a major accident or fatality because people let their guard down oh we did it oh we made it man the raptures at hand we've defeated him it's over I mean I mean look at the the there is a spoken word bride upon the face of the Earth how incredible the message has been successful we're called out it's finished brother Andrew and that relaxing moment he's massing his forces he listen victories I hate to tell you this don't lead to less fighting victories lead to more fighting because the minute you take something you're gonna have to fight harder to hold it than you did to get it and the minute you take something from the enemy he's going to amass his forces and he's coming back stronger than ever you're going to have to fight to hold it everything you take you got to be ready to defend listen tonight don't let him steal your Victory don't let him steal your healing don't let him steal your joy I got joy tonight don't let him steal it I got peace tonight don't let him steal it I got victory in my heart don't let him steal it don't let the fire die out keep the fire burning Throw Another Log on the Fire tonight protect it be ready to fight because I'm telling you he's coming you got to hold on with all your heart Revelation 2 25 says but that which you already that you have already hold fast till I come he said you already got it but you better hold on to it you better protect it you better be ready don't let the fire die because Satan's mounting one final offensive against the bride around the world and they'll forgive me for a little bit of History I tend to like it Hitler believed that Germany had one last chance to strike at the heart of the Allies in the West Hitler ordered his commanders to prepare an all-out offensive against a strategic soft spot in the Allied line located in the densely forested region known as the ardanes the result would be the largest military battle in American history we call it today the Battle of the Bulge but if we're speaking spiritually it's the greatest battle ever fought even though victories at hand and even though we can see the Finish Line the enemy's making one final push and I ask you tonight are you ready for it is the token applied or their sacrifice being made per Adventure are you praying for your kids are you guarding the door of your home in the door of your heart because I'm telling you he's got a Punch coming he's gonna throw a punch at you he's gonna attack you when you least expect it you got to be ready for it because he's building up this offensive in the ordined region was known to American GIS think about this now listen to American soldiers as the honeymoon sector because it's where you went when you were battle fatigued to rest it's where they sent people to relax it's where they sent green soldiers to kind of get used to how things went on a day-to-day basis because no fighting ever happened there it was a relaxing place where they leased expected it when they least expected it listen if you don't think you can get hit out of left field with something you didn't see coming listen everything can be fine and the word cancer can spin your head around like that it can be just a normal Tuesday and everything's good or a normal Thursday and everything's good then all of a sudden out of left field you get hit with a blitzkrieg and your life is turned upside down in one moment's time your whole life can be turned upside down but I'm Not Gonna Leave You There hanging upside down One Moment In The Presence of the king one moment in his present a lifetime of sin can be wiped out a battle of sickness can be wiped out depression can be wiped out you can be changed forever with one encounter with one moment one time in his present it can be in a cabin it could be a youth camp and it'll have you running all over the place saying I'll never be the same I'll never be the same because One Moment In His presence sure the enemy can hit you in a moment it can do a lot of damage how frustrating it must be to the devil he can be after you for years and years and years he can put 30 years into your life 40 years into your life drugs alcohol drinking sex sins year after year after year after year after year one moment gone one moment erased one moment filled with the Holy Ghost sealed saved finished over what are you fighting tonight what are your balance tonight where you at tonight One Moment One Moment just step into that presence tonight for one moment and it'll be finished One Moment In His presence so on the morning of December 16th with a thick Mist blanketing the mountains a German fighting force numbering 200 000 men and one thousand tanks launched an all-out attack on the unsuspecting Allied veterans they would describe eerie red and purple light streaking through the fog followed by the bone chilling sound of what they called screaming memes Rockets and earth-shattering detonation in every direction everything's good in my life brother Aaron everything's good and then Tuesday comes in every direction in every direction we think we're prepared oh I'm ready for anything well quoting the great Wordsmith Mike Tyson he said everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth you better have a plan to fall into Jesus you better have a plan to put on the whole armor of God you better have a plan to run into that strong tower that's the only thing that's going to save you when these things hit you oh yeah I got a plan but what are you going to do when the bullets start flying and the airs start piercing and and this one Falls away and Dad Falls away and Mom Falls away and a thousand falls on the left and ten thousand falls on the right when you can't see anything and it's fogging in the middle of the forest and there's Rockets blowing up and this is going on what you gonna do then I'll tell you what we're going to do we're gonna stand we're going to fight we're going to hold the line because we're anointed for it I ain't running on your brother Andrew I ain't running on you I Ain't Gonna Leave You Stand There fighting this is the last hope this is the last Bastion this is the final battle Somebody's gotta hold the line rock is blowing up people falling people leaving people running not the Bride of Jesus Christ We Stand we fight we remain until the battle's finish I'm not going anywhere I'm holding the line right here tonight Hallelujah [Applause] hold the land it's what you've been called to do Hallelujah Brown says how beautiful it is to find that the true and living God still lives today in the midst of all the chaos God still Reigns that means that right now in your trial God Reigns right now in your battle God still Reigns and your sickness God still Reigns that storm around your family God still Reigns in the midst of the chaos he still Reigns how can I have peace brother Aaron when everything's falling down when the walls are falling around me God still Reigns just stay under that token stay under that message stay there Rahab they told you you'd come out safe if you'd stay under the token but my house is shaking stay under the token but their walls are falling all around me there's people dying there's death and die can you imagine what the streets of Jericho must have been like chaos walls falling Stones falling people screaming don't go out in the street rehab stay under the token stay under the message he said you'll come out he said there'd be a Rapture he said I'd have a bride without spot or wrinkle how's he gonna do it don't know I didn't say it he did just stay under the token stay under the message and you're gonna come out because God still Reigns in the midst of the chaos listen your oppression your depression your sickness your trial is not forever the devil wants to get you to a place where you picture your future and in the future that trial is still there he wants you to think about in the future I'm still sick in the future I'm still going through this in the future my relationship with my with my family still messed up in the future I'm still no no no no no he does not control your future he does not control your future the trial is temporary the battle is temporary so quit letting temporary things affect Eternal decisions he is not in my future he is nowhere in my future it's a good land to make our stand on Church it seems that the time as time goes on there's less and less people willing to stand for all of it they'll stand for their favorite part they'll stand for their favorite Doctrine or their you know their favorite part about Holiness or some little thing that can allow them to lead into legalism or too much or they'll find a peace they like and they'll stand for that it seems actually today the further we go along people tell you more about what they stand against and what they stand for I believe we're a people that stand for things I want to stand for all of it anymore but somebody has to stand for all of it and when you stand for all of it it means a constant battle because you're always going to be attacked on every flank there's going to be an attack here and then there's going to be attack here because you're standing for the whole thing and so it creates a front it creates a place where you're easily attacked and the minute you hold back this attack Here Comes an attack from this side brother Brown says you've got to do it you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground toe the mark with Satan he says isn't that right friends this is not a picnic this is a Battleground see we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle listen don't join the military and act shocked when they send you to fight somewhere who me maybe I didn't read the fine print I I don't I don't know you understand that you joined the military odds are you going to fight don't be shocked when the enemy attacks your position don't be shocked when you find yourself in the battle it just means you have something that he wants it just means you got some ground that he wants to take from you it just means that you got something worth fighting for if he didn't want what you had he wouldn't be attacking you you understand that it means that it's worth defending and it may come for a for a while in a specific way against your family or maybe it'll come against your children or against your health or against your joy or it may come against your worship he'll come and attack your worship yeah we can get right there for a minute but I think that worship belongs to you and you ought to be able to worship as free as you want to worship you ought to be able to let loose the way you want well come on now I say on my watch we ain't going back to some cold formal denomination or put me in a box kind of worship I ain't going back to it if I feel led to jump I'll jump if I feel that the shout I'll shout if I feel led to dance I'll dance I've been set free and guess what your worship is worth fighting for your praise is worth fighting for don't let nobody take it from you don't let no man no Spirit no church take your worship away from you it's worth standing for it's worth fighting for well brother Aaron it's about the word it's about the word it's about the word amen we agree but it's like a relationship it's like a selfish relationship he comes and he gives the word and he gives the word and he gives the word and then we get up and walk out and he's going I did my part I did my part Where's My Worship where's my praise where's my adoration the word is for you the worship is for him don't get it confused and what he does for you and what you're supposed to do for him [Applause] why are we always under attack because we got land that he wants there's been a people returned to the land all the Palmer word eight it's back oh the caterpillar hate it's back all the Locas hey it's back oh the canker wormate it's back shall I put it like this we're back we're back in the land it's a good land it's my land he died for it and now we're standing in it I'm willing to fight for it and the devil wants it and so you're constantly under attack listen you don't gotta apologize for nothing you ain't got a retreat all for nothing healing you can have it Deliverance you can have it Divine Healing we still preach it gifts tongues shouts dance we believe in it you can have it you ain't gotta back off a thing of it well I can't move on from that people want to come and label it just emotionalism oh well that's just emotion it's an attack on the land that has been restored to me and by the one that gets me is somehow you you imply that because we let the spirit have free reign in the service that somehow the word has been put aside and it isn't given the preeminence maybe you don't understand why I'm so excited brother Aaron the seals are open that's why I'm excited the word is restored that's why I'm excited that's why I can jump that's why I can shout that's why I can dance the word is back it's restored it's our land it's ours and because of that I can praise him I can shout I can love him with all my heart that's why we're shouting yeah this is a line that we must hold it's a line that we must I'm not willing to give one inch of the supernatural back I'm not willing to give it I'm not willing to give my dance back I'm not willing to give the gifts back I'm not willing to get discernment back I'm not willing to see people filled with the Holy Ghost back I will stand that's a hill out down I won't give none of it back it's been restored and I'll stand on it I'll fight for it hey in my opinion a restored word deserves restored worship and original word deserves original worship how's that the way they did it on the day of Pentecost when they Spilled Out into the street and they said these men are drunk original word original worship restoration of the whole thing Hallelujah he deserves original praise and I'll fight for it Hallelujah [Applause] we're gonna have to wind this down I always said them Virginia clocks is faster than ours I'll tell you I like it when people get loose sister gets free and gets to shouting screaming or brother gets free gets to shouting dancing puts me in mind of War makes me think about the Rebel Yell listen this whole Union soldier said one time he said one time if you heard the Rebel Yell and you said you wasn't scared you never heard it hang on with me for a minute though he said it wasn't the yell is because we knew what was coming behind it say what do you think it sounds like down in hell when people get loose and somebody shouts the victory it ain't the shout they know what's coming they know what's coming we're coming we're coming to take it back oh it ain't the shout they know we're coming they got death on their hands there's freedom in the house of God they can't hold us they can't stop us they can't move us back in Edge we're coming to take it all back it's our land it's our healing it's our Victory it's my Rapture it's my family I'm coming whoa oh I'm coming Hallelujah and if one of those Devils said they heard it and didn't get scared they must not have heard it I say let them hear you in hell tonight we're coming Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] you give me five minutes and we'll wrap this up because we're still in the middle of the Battle of the Bulge you can't leave history undone the attack was on and America wasn't ready for it two regiments of the 106th division were quickly surrounded by German infantry leading to the single largest field surrender of Allied troops in World War II more than 6 800 American soldiers were taken prisoners 84 American prisoners were executed by German SS in the largest mass execution of American soldiers in the war can't surrender I don't care where you're at tonight brother and I've tried and I failed I sought God and I didn't get nowhere I tried to give up these habits I'm just gonna quit he'll kill you no matter where you're at no matter how hopeless it looks listen help's on the way they'll surrender surrender is not an option you'll never gain Peace by making deals with the Devil Israel will never have peace with Palestine by giving them their land they want to destroy Israel they ain't worried about getting their land they want them wiped out every little thing you give him is just a foothold and if you surrender anything he'll destroy you with it just 24 hours after the initial bombardment German tanks had broken through the thinly defended center of the ordained region rolled West to the Muse River creating the infamous bulge in the Allied line that gave the battle its name using the weather and the intelligence breakdowns to their advantage the Nazi offensive appeared to be working in church if we take a minute and look around I'd say the blitz Krieg the devil appears to be working destroyed Society just in a matter of listen this world ain't where it was 10 years ago it has been hit with the Blitzkrieg and it's falling apart and how many people is working and the world stood there with baited breath they thought Hitler was about to roll right through the allies and everybody thought this would be Hitler's greatest victory there was a few Americans in that Forest the 101st Airborne there was a little bitty group determined we won't surrender no matter what we won't surrender and if Hitler thought that the outmanned Americans were going to lay down and let the German tanks roll all the way through to Antwerp he was sadly mistaken in the middle of it all at a place called bastogne the 101st Airborne was pinned down and surrounded by not not the Infantry for five days now listen to this we talk about circumstance we talk about symptoms here's where they were at they dug trenches in a wide peripheral perimeter around by Stone they had no warm clothes they were in summer clothes look they ran out of rations they've been shot to Pieces the temperature at night was negative four degrees below zero soldiers were crippled by frostbite and trench foot Medics had no supplies so they did amputations with kitchen knives with no anesthesia when things look worse for the Americans here we go when things looked worse for the Americans the Nazi field commander issued an official call for surrender I'll read it to you just a small portion of it says there is only one possibility to save the encircled USA troops from Total Annihilation and as I'm reading this just hear the devil talking like this that is The Honorable surrender of the encircled town in order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note if this proposal should be rejected one German artillery corpse and six heavy battalions are ready to annihilate the USA troops in and nearby Stone the order for firing will be given immediately after this two-hour term you got to have men that ain't afraid you got to have men that ain't rattled and shook they said that the men sit there and stare at the general and waiting to see what his response would be so he took that note and he crumpled it up do it in the trash and scribbled
