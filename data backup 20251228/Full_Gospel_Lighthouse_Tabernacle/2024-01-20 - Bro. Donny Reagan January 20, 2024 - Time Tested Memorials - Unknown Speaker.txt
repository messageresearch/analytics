tell me he can't do it cuz I know that he can amen what a privilege it is for us as his sons and daughters of God to be gathered around the word in this hour where we recognize that God is showcasing his Supernatural power in this last day like never before and you know we're we're so privileged here at this church to to be able to have a meeting like we're having this weekend and to have brother Tim puit and brother Donnie Reagan come and take out of their busy schedule we're very bless people and and um just to maybe kind to put some things at the Forefront here just so that maybe you have an understanding when I flew back from Belgium brother Ron had some test the the very next day and uh the doctors were doing some test on on brother Ron's eyes and things so you'll understand why these brothers are here that they the doctors have found that there is cancer in brother Ron's eyes and uh they're finding that it may have transpired or have went may have rolled from his brain or somewhere else there and um so we you know sometimes you you need sometimes you look out in the battlefield and you you need a Robert E le and you need a Stonewall Jackson to come and I've invited two of God's greatest generals that I have seen in this in this message there's so many that we could call them but the Lord laid on my heart and just to reach reach out to brother Tim and then reach out to brother Donnie and invite them to come and to for it all to work out the way that it did if if you would understand from my standpoint to watch the timing of the Lord just unfold all of these things it would let you know that God is up to something amen because as soon as we picked up brother Tim puit from the from the airport on Thursday there brother Ron got the phone call and they were confirming that there is that there is cancer in his eyes and they're going to be doing some tests on February 14th and February the 27th we don't know what the prognosis or what they are planning to do from that standpoint but I know this that Isaiah 53 has already paid for brother Ron's healing amen amen do you believe that with all of your heart amen as these sisters just saying we've seen cancer disappear we've seen broken hearts restored but I'm going to ask you to do something as a congregation here I'm going to ask you that you consecrate yourself like never before you come here early you read your Bible you you set an atmosphere here I invite you to do that not just here but at your home like never before I'm going to ask you to consecrate your heart and give over so that there would be nothing that would stand in this in this Arena here tonight that would allow our champion to stand up here and start throwing rocks at this giant and we watch cancer disappear so as as the word would go forth and as brother we've asked brother Donnie Reagan to come and to speak tonight and I believe that God set this up he he set this up if if you could just understand you would you would see the supernatural how it has all worked out to just to reach out with them to these brothers within a week they're pastors they have busy schedules and for me me to be able to just to reach out to them and they said brother brother Andrew we we'll be glad to come and we greatly appreciate these brothers they're they're not just they're not just our friends but there's God's generals and I believe that God is in the details of all of these things and I believe that that our God we've seen what he has done for the past four years through brother Ron's Ministry when he spoke to him four years ago if you trust me I use you like never before and we've watched that displayed at this congregation all over the United States and in Canada for the past four years we've seen God use a bride Ministry in this hour and that wasn't just a word for brother Ron that was a word for the bride because bride if you'll trust him he'll use you like never before so if you will let us stand this evening and we get ready to invite our brother Donnie Reagan and come to speak what God has laid upon his heart I I want you to believe that all things are possible I know that you're Believers but I'm going to coach you in these things and preach to you the word give you instruction as brother Donnie preaches the word you say Amen to the word just like you always do you create an atmosphere in here where cancer is not welcome I believe that you have that ability as Sons and Daughters of God to rise to the challenge and to challenge Satan to a debate and tell him to leave from this place key of a sister Cassie yeah they say this mountain Can't Be Moved they say these chains will never break but they don't know you like we do there is power in your name [Applause] we've heard that there is no way through we've heard the tide will never change but they haven't seen what you can do oh there there is power in your name oh so much power in your your [Applause] name oh move the immovable oh break the unbreakable oh God We Believe God we believe for it from The [Music] Impossible we'll see a miracle oh God we believe oh God we believe for it we know that whole is never lost for there is still and empty gra oh God we believe no matter what oh there is power in your your name well so much power oh in your name oh move the immovable oh break the unbreakable oh God we believe oh God we believe for it oh from The Impossible we'll see a miracle oh God we believe oh God we believe [Music] for well you said it for and I believe it well you s and it is done you said it oh you said it and I believe it well you said it and it is done you said it well you said it and I believe it well you said it and it is done you said it well you said it and I believe it well you said it and it is done will move thee immovable bless [Music] [Music] you a miracle We Believe father We [Music] Believe [Music] for oh Hallelujah we are so blessed to be able to believe you believe with all your hearts just in case you're wondering last time I stood here Labor Day you would have never convinced me my little baby girl would be gone in 6 [Music] weeks I didn't believe it for nothing no way I believed it but sometimes God's way is so much different than our way brother Donnie do you still believe him with all over my heart I believe him now more than [Music] ever hallelujah praise the Lord not only do I believe you more I trust him some people can believe him as long as they can understand but the first thing God does that they don't understand then it's like they lose their faith so their faith is more on understanding and it is a revelation but I'm glad aren't you that when we don't understand what God's doing we we can still say I love you so much I love you so much praise the Lord but it's such an honor for us to be here with brother Ron you the church and I want to say from Carol and myself and from Erica's family we so appreciate all your prayers concerning her and her husband and her children and US during this time we thank you so much I believe it's been the prayers and the saints of God that's helped us and we're a family aren't we we're a family we live in different states we come from different backgrounds and all that sort of thing but we're a family and actually if we have family members in the flesh that don't believe this word sometimes we're closer than we are to our own flesh and blood a that right oh and how we appreciate him at the time of trouble I wonder how many like to be remembered tonight as we pray before we read the word Lord Jesus we love you so much we thank you for your presence that we sense here tonight Lord we're asking you father that you would just help us we've come together these two Services Lord that we could worship and sing and pray and praise and hear the word Lord you see this special Needy Time in the life of brother Ron and his family and the church church family and we're just looking to you tonight father we believe that you are a god of Miracles a god of the Supernatural and we believe that Satan is a liar he is defeated and he is a bluff and we're calling his bluff father would you just minister to us tonight Lord take your word help me to get out of the way Lord pray for brother Tim in the morning Lord that you just give him Direction and use him in a mighty way come tonight Lord Jesus and speak to us we pray father in Jesus name amen God bless you if you turn with me tonight in the Book of Matthew chapter 16 Matthew chapter 16 Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood is not revealed yeld it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven we know this is after Peter's great confession Jesus goes on to say and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you believe that with all your heart let's read it it again I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church I want you to notice who's doing it now it's not a bunch of overseers it's not a bunch of Bishops it's not some Pope or some priest it's Jesus building it you believe Jesus would know the right material to use oh yeah now if we sitting here tonight when I come in a while ago it was about 16 degrees and the wind chill it was zero or below and if our building in here tonight was like some of the ones I've seen in Africa that were built out of sticks and mud and thatch roofs y'all would have done been gone but you know what when brother Frasier and the brothers built this church years and years ago they chose the appropriate building material for the climate that you live in amen now next week this weather's going to be gone and somebody said praise the Lord but I'm glad you all use the right material now notice Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it may the Lord bless his words you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight on time tested memorials amen that's right time tested memorials a memorial can be a a great thing let me just read you a couple of things here from the message and the prophet said a memorial is a great thing we appreciate memorials and many times men in this life have tried to leave behind some sort of a memorial nearly all men love to do that so they put it up at their graveyard a great marker and I appreciate that he said that's okay and then many will try to build Great Signs so he said there is Memorials and then there's great memorials no doubt some of you no matter which direction you came to church tonight you would have driven on a road or you came over an overpass or a bridge and it was dedicated to a mayor or a state trooper or some judge or maybe some founding father that came through here years and years ago and you drove to church tonight on some Highway that was named after Andrew Jackson you definitely know you're in Virginia and not in New Hampshire when you're doing that so far they haven't been able to take that away from you have they but you know and you'd say well that's so and so Memorial Highway now you didn't live in Andrew Jackson's day of course you wasn't around whenever him and Lee and all them was here but whenever you will see that sign it's doing exactly what they named it for it's to remind you of that person and the same way with the bridge same way with the building same way with something else well you know God himself was going to build a memorial now it was going to be something that would last for thousands and thousands of years not only in time but this Memorial will merge into eternity so what kind of material would he have to have to build it no doubt this building would stand here for decades the type of material that was used the craftsmanship that was used to put it together the foundations the concrete you went deep enough in the frostline for the cold temperatures and you knew kind of where you were had requirements building permits and all of that and you wanted to build it so that it wouldn't crack and crumble in four or five years what's the use of BU build it if you're going to do that so if we would do that as Mortals how much more would god build his memorial which he's going to call a church now remember Jesus is the first one in the New Testament to use this word this is the first time that Satan heard it spoken so he probably was curious what is a church now to us most of our Liv life we've heard it we passed many coming to this building tonight with all kinds of names did you so for us it's a very common term but think if you'd been living in that day and this is the first time you'd ever heard it in your life you not even sure what it even means but he said I am going to build my church so if he's going to build something then he's not going to build it on a material or out of a material that it's going to last a few days and fall because his reputation is at stake now there are good memorials and there are bad memorials there are things that are built uh many years ago we was privileged to stand in the memorial to the Holocaust brother Tim was there with us at the same time that we were there and as we went through that and you see all those horrific pictures and all those names of those millions of people that were slaughtered and it's it's a memorial but it's not a memorial of happiness it is a memorial that stands there as a witness that they say never again never again so memorials can represent different things I'd like to call your attention to another Memorial in the Old Testament and it was a woman we don't know what her name was but the Lord Jesus referred to her in the Book of Luke chapter 17 and he said remember Lot's wife and you know the story that God because of her unbelief and brother Brenham used her as an example of a memorial and he said I think of another Memorial one day when a woman made the wrong choice she decided to stay instead of being with Abraham in the well-watered plains of Sodom and Gomorrah and be sociable she didn't take the good choice that Sarah chose and you remember the story and he said she was obedient and lovely to her husband in so much that she called him her Lord but Lot's wife of course chose to become the mayor's wife down there and live a sociable life and we remember the end of the story that God turned her to a pillar of Sal now we've been there in that dead hebra the Tim remembers it and that and there's a big rock there which they say is Lot's wife who knows exactly if it is or not it wasn't necessary really that I saw which one that it was because every time I read about this I remember her and I find it amazing that the Lord Jesus never said remember Sarah did you ever notice that and read in the Bible the Lord Jesus never said remember Rebecca remember Rachel remember Leah remember the great women of the Bible and if you read this categorically the way it's written here in Luke 17 that Jesus reminds us of this and it's during the same time frame of the scriptures when he says the son of man was would come again on the earth in the last day so then when he relates about the coming of the son of man then he also reminds us to remember Lot's wife which lets us know there will be people that will actually set under that Ministry of the son of man for a while and they will turn and go straight to Sodom and Jesus said when you do that remember Lot's wife so I remember Lot's wife too but I also remember that ain't me praise the Lord I remember that as a memorial that's not us right sisters that's not you so you see a remor a memorial can be for something uh that is even though it might have been an negative light but you get something good out of that we know the Bible contains many things in that way that are written for our good so the prophet says that Lot's wife wanted luxuries she couldn't stand the thought of giving it up so she went with her husband down to the city and he said as she went out that day of course when the Angels Came and she kept looking back and weeping and grieving because she had to give that up now the prophet goes on to tell us that she actually heard her grandchildren screaming and crying as the fire fell out of Heaven you see around these cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other five cities that was there they had slime pits now it was not mud slime but it was actually bitumin which is what we know as asphalt what our roads are made out of so this was one thing that made Sodom and gomorra Rich Rich was salt and batumin so when the fire started falling from Heaven there was one explosion after another and those pits of tar pitch begin to catch on fire as a matter of fact archaeologically they just found some of those not long ago and they begin to dig around there and dig them up where they had caught on fire and they said it would the temperatures would have been 1,500 to 2,000 de in order to transform those rocks well you know that Memorial don't mean none of us shout does it that Memorial don't make none of us feel very happy at all it kind of makes us feel sad doesn't it but you see God used that as a memorial so that we would always keep that before us so we never never want to go that way am so but when God then used this woman and turned her up into that type of an image you know it's I find it amazing because it was during that time that she was getting a body change Hallelujah it was during the sign of the son of man she was getting a body change but it wasn't a good one was it do you think that this is just happening to be this way that we're in the time when science and medical science and surgeries and hospitals and so on are changing men from men to to women and women to men you see there's more than just us getting a body change but they also are getting one but remember it's a sign of judgment on the earth is that right so it's it's a memorial but alas it's not one that I want to use as my example so what I look and see when I think about her is that she is a memorial of disgrace dishonor is that right because of that notice Jesus said even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he that is on the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it he that is in the field let him not return likewise remember Lot's wife so then Jesus gives us an example or a memorial now let's chain from that I don't want to dwell on her long whenever the children of Israel come out of the land of Egypt and exodus 12:14 Moses is led by God and he tells him and says this day shall be unto you for a memorial so things can be a memorial days can be a memorial how many remembers the day the Lord got a hold to you you see that's a memorial that's a memorial maybe the day you got the holy ghost maybe the day you heard the message the day you you come to this church or whatever it was but it was a memorial memorials can be good now remember God himself is going to build a memorial let me lay this foundation and then we'll get to that so God said through Moses this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations you shall keep it as a feast by an ordinance forever and then notice also in the book of Exodus chapter 28 Thou shalt put two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod now this is going to go on the priest and for stones of Memorial unto the children of Israel so then the high priest is going to Bear the names of the tribes of the children of Israel into the presence of God so the birthstones is going to be on his chest and whenever the the urum thumb whenever the they were seeking an answer from God the supernatural lights would shine upon those different colored stones and they would begin to list glisten and lighten up and produce the rainbow colors so it was a memorial when Joshua and Israel cross over Jordan Joshua 4:6 let this be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these Stones so God said now when you step out of that River I want each of you I want you certain appointed men I want you to take a stone out of that River and I want you to lay this Stone over here and I want you to pack it around with you and then when your kids say now what does this mean what what's this Stone about I want you to be able to tell them this is a sign of our victory that God brought us out now you understand really in the a sense it's the same way of Victories that God has done in our Our Lives when our children will say mama why do we why do we wear long hair mama why why do us women wear dresses and why do we dress God in and why don't our men go around in dresses cuz they're not sissies why don't our men go around you know with earrings and this now and other well it's a memorial now the thing of it is some of you may used to look like that you used to but you don't look that way no more so your look is a memory or a memorial of the Deliverance of what God did for you I'm sure we don't do not understand it but yet friends I was reading this week where that Peter was talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Peter said that it was so great that the angels of God desire to look into it and I looked at that word in the Greek and it means to stoop down and look at something intently and I S the thing that I have in my soul the thing that you have in your soul is so great that the angels of God stoop down to look into it and the Bible said that they are ministers to the Hors of salvation but they don't understand Redemption by experience the way we do they saw their the angels that used to be with them in heaven and when they fell they saw them Angels there is no Redemption for angels and when those Angels fa those remaining Angels saw it and yet they see God redeem us they see God save us and sanctify us and fill us with the Holy Ghost and even forgive us after we become his children and it is so great that they stoop down to look at it and try to understand I hope you understand that God is using the church as a university for Angels God is using the church as a schooling as a tutor to Angelic beings and do you think that it's going to stop once we leave this life this Memorial will endure forever and forever and forever it will last for eternity it must be built out of absolute wonderful awesome material so wonder what he he's going to use so it's got to be Tim tested material what could God ever use how could God use our Humanity I saw some years ago as I was in Rome a great structure there which was built and called The Arch of Titus now it was built some years years after his great Conquest that he went into Jerusalem and conquered Jerusalem and there you see it as it's carved in the great stone and you see them Roman soldiers as they have the manora the seven Branch Candlestick you see different pieces of furniture carved in that stone brother Ron as I looked at it I I couldn't keep from my mind going back to that day and how awful it must have been yet depends on which side that you were on you would look at that Memorial as a sign of conquest and victory but if you were a Jew you looked at that with sadness in your heart you looked at that as an end of an era you looked at that as a dispensational change they would never be the same again and still have not been the same so a memorial it really depends on how you look at it so you see that's why that we are so misunderstood believing that God has sent a prophet back to the Earth to restore the original building material and that's what the great debate really is about anyway because people say well all you got to do is just come to church put your name on a book why you don't have to do none of that other stuff what difference does it make you know about your hair and your dress why some old Barnes need a new coat of paint I three barns do but women's faces don't paint your barn just don't paint your [Applause] face but to me what I see of that Arch when I saw it I saw it as a memorial to the prophecy that our lord Jesus gave about the city that's right now some people could look at us as the bride and they say well them is some of the weirdest people I ever seen but it's strange that when they get in trouble they ask us to to pray for them I think that's more weird than than we are so really deep down inside of their heart they know there's something about you if they didn't when they get in trouble they wouldn't ask you to pray come on now you know it's the truth and that within itself will condemn him at that day but it really depends on how that we would look at the memorial now there's several that we could look at but to save time let's look at God a great Builder so before he was God he was the Eternal and the prophet said to my opinion the first thing that he made was Angels then he became God because God is the object of worship so there was something to worship him so they were created them and they come out of his being those which were of Eternal Essence because we know there are some angels that did not fall and yet there were some that were put on a basis as Adam was in the Garden of Eden to where they they could fall now I love the way the prophet says this God is a great architect he's a great Builder and God puts in his building nothing but the very best so Jesus said on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not prevailed against him which shows us the gates of hell would be against him so what material is God going to use is it just flesh is it just flesh it can't be that it has to be more than that because no man just in his flesh would be able to serve God in a way of completion it's it's to every one of us are full of faults and failures right I'm talking about our humanity and it still yet needs to be redeemed but notice he said God building the foundation he would put nothing else but the best there is because God is thoughtful of his reputation now let me just say to you tonight if God does not produce a bride it's not my reputation it's not brother Tim brother Ron any other preacher that's at stake it's God's reputation but I ain't worried about it are you anybody here worried tonight that God ain't going to produce the church no he's done done it now notice the prophet said God is thoughtful of his reputation he's the god of Eternity god of the heavens and the Earth he will never put nothing in his architect plans here but what will stand the time test for eternity so it fell out of Eternity into a little block of time and then it'll pull right back up into eternity again so we're here expressing something now we in we were there in his thoughts but we were not in existence in a body form just in his thinking and he could have spoke us into existence if it so desired to do so and we would have bypassed all of this and then he could have told us now children I could have been a savior I could have been a redeemer I could have been a Healer but of course none of you all could ever get sick because I spoke you into existence and I gave you a word for embodied that could never have pain or never be weary or anything like that he could have said now I could have become all of that but but I didn't I just spoke you into existence but instead he came this way so whenever it's all said and done it won't be him telling us that he was the Savior instead it'll be us telling him I was lost and you saved me I was undone and you redeemed me Papa God you you heal me Papa God you you understand so even on this negative side of this timeline of contrast between light and darkness it is working it to his good so whenever you and I go through things and we just can't make sense of it and we try to understand it and figure it out just remember that he still has everything in his control and never remind you tonight Satan never brought you on this Earth and Satan ain't going to take you out I don't care what the the devil says he can huff and puff and threaten to blow your house down but he ain't going to do it because almighty God brought you here and almighty God will see you out of here at his time his place his will it is not left up to the devil the devil is a liar and a bluff hallelujah oh my amen so here God wants to build this building now maybe brother Frasier and some of you Brothers maybe there's still some of the ones that was share to help build this maybe you wanted a good deal on material you know we all look for that and we want to get as good a deal as we can get but we wouldn't want something that was termite infested something that was rotten something that you know you might get a good deal but is it really suitable for what you want it for you know I'm with at the age to where that that's what people are pretty much thinking that Jesus is down so low as far as getting material for his church he's just about got to let everybody in I mean everybody's got to get in because he's in such a hard spot God ain't never been in no hard spot and he ain't in no hard spot tonight as a matter of fact the church has never been as good as it is right now because we are closer to the resurrection than any other generation we are closer to the body change than any other generation we are at the end my brother sister there won't be another generation we are it Hallelujah that's why Satan is fighting with everything that he can do but I want to tell him tonight devil you're going to lose this war you're going to lose this war because Jesus has a church and his church will prevail hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord I'm reminded of the man in Australia they was looking for someone to build a bridge some of y'all probably been there seen pictures of it at least and there was many that talked about it and they could do this and do that but they finally chose one man and the prophet when he preaches about this he takes this man and uses him as an example I've been on that bridge it's it's quite quite amazing Quite a feat and brother random lyans that guy in the types like God and he says that man tested every bolt every piece of Steel amen that bridge has such an expanse to it that by the time they get it painted from one end to the other it's time to turn around and go back it's that big and there's so much Ste I mean it's just it's quite incredible to be able to look at it and people said it'll never stand it'll never stand we've always had the them critics the church has got the critics that's what they've said about all them bunch of brownit while they'll they'll blow over it has all over the world oh Hallelujah my there's been all kinds of Cults and clicks and clans that's come around and they said oh boy we're going to do this and we're going to do that and the bride's moving right on more in love with the Lord Jesus and ever before and we're not down for the count we're we're ready for the countdown we're not down we're going for the countdown to leave this world Hallelujah the devil's tried to burn it he tried to drown it he's tried to do everything in the world and here she stands tonight around the world as a memorial of Divine Healing a memorial of Miracles a memorial of the supernatural power of God a memorial Memorial of changed lives a memorial Hallelujah that said he is the same yesterday today and forever he is not dead He's Alive the prophet says time tested I believe every word of God is pure and not adulterated for God is putting his timber because he's positive that his reputation as Savior will not be spoiled God has a reputation I don't care what you're facing tonight I don't care how big it is how bad it is if you'll lean on the Everlasting Arms of Jesus his reputation will not be ruined Glory Jesus Christ God's son who's the architect of the church came to this earth and laid down the foundation when he met the devil he was tested by the word of God and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but every word when he took him to the Pinacle of the temple see the material he was putting into his church wow the material he was putting into his church I thought he's talking about himself exactly right he took him to the mountain he's laying the foundation the blood of Jesus Christ bought a church by the Holy Spirit that's tested every boat you may not be a big main frame a big gerder of Steel 50 foot long and 12 foot high and whatever more you may not be no more than a bat but if God placed you in this church if God place you in his body as a little tiny boat you're what's hold them big pieces together you're what puts it together I'm not important yes you are every young man every young lady every one of you you don't have to be a preacher to be important to the economy of God we need one another like never before United We Will Stand United We Will Rapture united we will cause the rest Resurrection from the dead praise the [Applause] Lord oh God's Building a Church as a memorial a memorial of his sacrifice so it's not this building it's not brother Tim's beautiful place the lord gave them a few years ago all those are dedicated to him but one day these will burn that'll mean nothing but ashes he's not coming for this building Jesus didn't say I go away in heaven to prepare tap racks and when I come back I'll gather your tapes unto myself he's coming for the Living Word so listen to them tapes feed off them tapes the word becomes flesh Hallelujah Jesus ain't coming for your Bible he's coming for the Bible made flesh in you Hallelujah that's what he's coming for behold I go away to prepare a place for you and if I go I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also his memorial think of it it's not like or Roberts University oh it's not like eisen's building this and Donald Trump's great building in New York and this building here but sometimes the members of Jesus body will be the most tried people on the Earth this is only one of the many things that divides us from the church the church could not live six months in your shoes come on the denominational preachers God help them God requires them what they see okay that'll be saved many of them that believe him that that's up to God but to take them out of their organization and take them out of their system and let them try to walk a month's time in a man of God's shoes and the anointed word of this hour they say how in the world can you do it I'm sure you've notice in reading the four gospels that when the Lord Jesus was here all the guns of hell was after him isn't it amazing the disciples didn't hard to go through Nothing But as soon as Jesus went up and the glory changed from him to them oh my goodness it didn't take 6 months 6 years 12 years immediately all the guns of Hell aimed after them when you get saved and you get the Holy Ghost and you find a good message church that preaches the Full Gospel and you say boy I've got her made now what you've got is a big Target on your back and all hell is aimed at you you see what in the world I'm having more trouble than I've ever had my whole life you ought to be shouting your shoe heels off that's a good sign that's a good sign the devil don't want you where you are the devil Don't Want You full of the Holy Ghost he don't want you sitting under a Ministry of the word so he'll try to make you sick he'll try to discourage you but say devil out of my way out of my way hallah Hallelujah I'm part of the building of God you can't tear us [Applause] down [Applause] Hallelujah so God puts in a bolt then a washer slide it through the girders lock washer on the other end a nut on the other end gets his ranches and start seals him in the body oh Hallelujah and then he'll let the trouble come you see it's tried as a bolt before it goes in it's tried as a washer before it goes in but then after it's United it's tried as a unit churches go through those Cycles you go through them cycles of Revival you go through them Cycles seem like everything is going good and then it seem like everything in the world starts happening and then people begin to question am I the will of God oh no I moved here I moved there am I the will of God that's exactly the same thing that happened to Abraham you imagine Abraham going down there in the land of promise the land flowing with milk and honey and when he gets down there what happens famine what in the land of milk and honey a man with all all kinds of promises of God and he ain't even got enough food to feed his own children he ain't got enough grass to feed his own cattle and what did Abraham do he backslid out of the promised land and went down to the land of Egypt and he got in trouble but remember his name was was on the book of life amen God had to whoop him all the way back but God got him why because he let me just tell you tonight if you're running from God and your name is on the book you might as well go ahead and give up because God ain't going to stop until he gets you back to where you belong you can't run far enough you can't hide deep enough to run from our God he will get you oh my a lot of times people say oh I'm so tempted notice brother Ram's response to that blessed be the name of the Lord for Temptations when I am weak then I am strong Paul said every son that comes to God must first be tried and tested and these testings are more sweeter to you and dearer to you than precious gold that's right amen time tested Memorial anybody in your beside me ever pray and you feel like your prayers don't go no higher than your head you ever been to a spot that you was so anxious to hear from God a rebuke would have been a welcome message just a rebuke just just just at least let me know you're here I've heard people say well God loves you so much your picture is on the refrigerator sometimes I feel like he kicked me in the refrigerator both out in the yard but that ain't true your feelings will lie to you what's he doing he's testing me what's he doing to you testing you and trying you all but I pray and it don't feel like it does no difference but what does a real son or daughter of God do keep right on praying keep a r on praying oh but I go to church and they don't feel nothing well I ain't going back in the morning no you're going back in the morning and you're going to pray you're going to read your Bible you're going to keep on Clapping Your Hands you're going to keep on singing come on somebody why because you're going to be a time tested memorial for God and the devil says you can't and you say I can and the devil said I'm going to get you and you're going to say no you can't because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Hallelujah notice job in job 238 behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work and I cannot Behold Him He says I I know he's S I know always there I can seees attributes but I can't see him he hideth himself on the right hand that I can't see him but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold look at the word tried it means to examine Tred prove scrutinize to test to make a trial oh God job says my foot ha held his steps his way have I kept and not declined where are you God and if you read the last chapter of the Book of Job it's absolutely amazing the Bible says when job got got better then all of his family started coming back around oh yeah and every one of them started bringing him a piece of money well he didn't need it then the Bible said God had give him twice as much as he so you saying where were they when the man was broke I've got to say I've had a few family members like that why in the world didn't they come you know why they didn't cuz God didn't want them to I hope you're hearing me today God didn't want him to God wanted him and job to stand there alone oh Hallelujah here they could have come no doubt he had some wealthy family and friends and they could have come but God just said stay away stay away I'm trying this piece of Steel I'm trying this bolt I'm trying this worship maybe he's trying you tonight and you think Lord what's going wrong ain't nothing going wrong you have found favor in his eyes he knows he can trust you he knows he can pull feeling away from you week after week and you still serve him he knows he can allow the devil to come and attack your body and lie to you and you'll say though the Lord slay me I'll trust him I will not turn away I will not turn back I press on I press press on I'm ordained to be a piece of material in this building of God I press [Applause] on as much as we don't like to say it we've still all got a lot of alloy and ttin and lesser quality material in us I said in South Africa several years ago at a gold mine they had a pot of gold there big gigantic smelting pot they had heated it over and over for years the same gold right car it was several several hundred of degrees 1500 1700 something like that and the man explaining it that every time they heat it to this extreme temperature it makes it more pure I know what you're thinking some of you is already sweating me too do we want to be more pure but do we want the process how many wants a testimony I see you've heard me say this before oh my you imagine the fiery trial takes a little bit more of the tin and the alloy and the Fool's Gold the parate the Magnesium the copper each time makes it better and better and better what an achievement almighty God will make when the last one comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the earth not just get saved but sealed into the body and the lamb will step in behind behind as it were the curtains you see it would be Unbecoming for you to see him with blood on his garments and him still wearing Priestly garments now I know you know that already that in the sixth Dimension they've not yet seen the Lord Jesus Peter's been there for couple thousand years he still hadn't seen him yet nor Paul and I know you know that the sixth Dimension is apparently indiff segregated groups because when brother Brandon was there he never mentions nothing about seeing Paul or lucer or Wesley or any of their converts right he saw his own and he said where's Jesus I want to see him he said he's just a little bit higher he'll come to you later so remember they haven't seen him yet why we still need him on that mediatorial Throne is that right as our priest I don't know how and I don't know when and I don't know how long it'll be but I believe it's coming to where his people will come to the place on the earth that all over the Earth they will reach that maturity whether it will be 5 minutes 24 hours whatever it'll be they will no longer need a high priest will it be five minutes before the Rapture probably for a lot of us 30 seconds maybe but won't it be an AB absolute miracle that around the earth the bride will have finally reached the gold quality that is needed to produce a Rapture and the high priest arises from the throne Oh Glory and steps in behind the curtain as it was and the angel stand there breathlessly and they look at him and they say today is the day Hallelujah why because when they recognize that he's took off his high priest garments and put on the marriage robes glory be to God hallelujah and they step out and they look at him and say today is the day don't you understand his sign of changing clothes is a sign you're fixing to amen amen whatever he changes what that means is you you no longer need a mediator you no longer need blood on the throne what that means is you're fixing to get your body that you have waited for all these years [Applause] Hallelujah but before we reach that let me read you this next quote he he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the Life of Christ is reflecting in your life I thought oh my goodness gracious when I read this for the first time many years ago and he says he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test I thought these words need to make a song I said trial after trial test after test and trial after trial test after test when my Lord is done with me I'm going to be my best wow so it's trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test because he don't love us because he doesn't care for us because somehow we haven't found favor in his eyes because we have why he's building this great mystical body she will have such Glory that when John saw her on the aisle of patmas and the angel says unto him come and I will show Thee the Lamb's wife yeah and what did John say a city so a city in Vision reflected you on Earth you on Earth reflect the Heavenly City now I know we have a hard time believing that it much but brother Donnie our Humanity but you're looking at the wrong thing your humanity is not your gold it's what's going on on the inside of you don't you see it was his Humanity the Lord Jesus that blinded them oh I hear the prophet said what was a mighty God unveil before something out in Philadelphia God they always miss you no matter what form you come in you see the bride was hid in the groom before Pentecost but after Pentecost the groom is hid in the bride they didn't see you and him then and they don't see him and you now and what's really sad is many times we don't see him in ourself because we know our mistakes we know our failures come on somebody and we look at oursel I said it years ago and I still believe it's the truth one of the greatest battles we're going to have in this end time is believing over the word of God over the top of what we know about ourself are we going to believe his promise is true are we going to believe he works all things for the good to them that love the Lord do we believe that above our circumstances do we believe his word is greater than our failures or do we say well I guess I'm just not part of it I'm not sure anybody is cuz really I'm in everybody you look at having problems I agree with that I've been serving him for 55 years since I was a 12y old boy been preaching since I was 18 brother Tim preaching younger than me I have never seen so many trials and tests have you on people's lives it seems like everybody you talk to is going through so much stuff so has he forgotten us does he not remember does he not hear our our cries our prayers oh no he hears and he's working man is he working is it just me is it hot in here boy it seemed like it's getting heated up in this Christian walk ain't it but listen what he wants you to become trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready submissive wow willing to turn your head from the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecution it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you and the slowness out of you so you tell me when do you pray the most when you're having trouble or when everything is going well all the bills are paid none of you young ones are sick you're all your tests come back good and boy I'll tell you what it's amazing how folks will start missing church it's amazing boy they'll do this and that and well you can go to church anytime I'm not sure who told you that but they lied to you there's going to come a time you ain't going to be able to find not one member of this Bride on the earth I believe it could be in the morning myself I believe we're that close friend we better we better run we better run and do everything in our hearts that we can clear everything out of our Lives notice he said till you wake up to a place that you can look and see or men can see the reflection of Christ in you the hope of glory oh he said I think of how God takes his children and tests them with an acid test can you imagine dropping a jellyfish in an acid test can you imagine dropping a denominational church member in a real test of the word on some of their greatest trials is as getting ready to go to church and their left false eyelash fell off and they couldn't find their favorite six inch heels to go with their favorite pink miniskirt to go with their favorite tight blouse so they could appear sexy before men and be judging her adulteries they don't have a clue oh he said they are time tested Witnesses of his power listen how he calls you God is building a bridge from Earth to Glory listen what the church becomes building a bridge from Earth to Glory that the wayfaring may come on the highway set down under the tree in the cool of the day by time tested material God is building a bridge you see God passes his seed through his body now I was a Pentecostal for many years of my life as many of you know and I did have a Pentecostal experience experience I received I believe a portion of the spirit of God in Pentecost but there ain't no way in the world I had then what I got now cuz him Pentecostal preachers could not birth me under a message of Malachi 4 with the Pentecostal gifts restoration message I remember whenever Carol read the token she stayed up all night long crying wailing before God because she too had an experience God done something for her but yet she still would trim her hair so when she read the token she was up all night long crying praying crying praying until something happened in a deeper sense than what she had in Pentecost so then she could be used as time testing material Hallelujah this is not about you this is not about me it's not about any of these people here as an individual it's about us it's about us it's about us in India Us in Africa God is building a bridge he's not building a whole bunch of bridges God ain't taking this church and building the bridge to Heaven no he's taking you all and taking us and taking Indians and taking Chinese we are brothers and sisters and a part of one another no wonder the Bible tells us that we to Bear one another another's burdens why if the boat gives way the whole Bridge can collapse if one Bol cracks the whole thing oh my can't you see why you were so important in the body of Jesus Christ right oh my notice this and I'll close the prophet said the reason the old time God heartfelt salvation will hold the reputation of Christ is at it he will not give us something just to build a church out of man-made theology or some school experience or some Bi Bible Seminary a real preacher comes down out of the Seminary of God's grace amen God's calling and it's time tested it'll hold God's got confidence in you and we got confidence in him you believe this friends I know you do let me read you something else here the prophet said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she's glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God you got to be kidding me in us but our faults with our failures with our humanity and in US is summed up the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it he says how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith but remember this bride is made out of not only gold but beaten gold Hallelujah beaten gold our out of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ she is filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind you know our lives belong to him you believe that right we prayed constantly for our daughter Erica brother Ron brother Tim people all over the Earth all over the world prayed for her there's no way that I believe she was going to die no way and God kept it from me as a matter of fact I don't know of any preacher friends that I have around the world that it was revealed to any of them that she was going to pass the first Sunday that I walked up into the pullit at home I sat back in my chair before I came out of the office and I was sick as a dog I didn't think I was going to have the strength to walk out and preach and Satan telling me yeah boy look at you now on what are you going to do you've told people God's A Healer and God's a miracle worker and he loves you so much and he took your daughter 44 years old leave behind a h husband that loved her two sets of twin girls well he's a loving God is he he cares for you hey you've told everybody around the world you've give your heart time him and served him all them years now you needed him and where was he you've been there haven't you face your own trials that way you've been there brother Tim you've been there but I told Carol last week we was talking about and I said you know what Carol our faith is greater now than it was before she was even taken and the devil spoke to me one day in an audible voice I heard it few months before she passed and he said if you will let up on me I'll let up on her and I laughed and said you're barking up the wrong tree you talking to the wrong preacher no way maybe the devil's told your pastor if you'll quit preaching and quit praying for folks and quit doing this and that and the other I might let up on you I'll tell you one thing we don't want to make no deal with the Devil he's the biggest liar you ever seen in all of your life and if you let up then he'd say ha I changed my mind so therefore we ain't making no deals with with no devil come on somebody we ain't making no deals we ain't letting up we ain't backing off we're not compromizing no sir I'm having more prayer lines I'm praying for more sick I'm saying God is a miral worker God Is A Healer he is the resurrection and the life no deals with the devil no deals with the devil say it with me no deals with the devil no deals with the devil hallelujah hallelujah it's not my church it's not brother Ron's Church brother Tim's church it's the Church of Jesus Christ and it will stand Hallelujah out of time tested material oh let me read you this before I turn the service over to Ender the prophet said he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative I told Lance my son-in-law not long ago Erica's husband I said Lance think of it if Erica had never been sick and never went through all this whole thing that she went through how many people would have been touched by her life amen as a matter of fact Erica never did think she was anybody just my little girl she never thought herself important every time I would tell her people praying for she'd cry she said Daddy I just can't believe it I just can't believe it people would love me that much her little little simple life has touched people all over this world is't that amazing only God can do that we know that only God can do that but would the would that have happened if she would have been well would y all would have prayed for her if she was well and didn't need prayer you wouldn't have it's just not the way we do it right we pray for people and we're constant we prioritizing the the the the sickness and the disease and so on the intensity of it we're top you know we're placing the person on the top list of our prayer list and constantly changing around but God somehow use that little life to touch so many people a housewife that Harding nobody knew right she made a trip with us to South Africa she made a few trips here and there not that many Hallelujah but a simple little girl that believed God with all of her heart and I heard her the day before she passed as she pulled her four daughters up and was able to talk to them each one of them and I heard her as she told one of them don't you never forget it we serve a mighty God a mighty God I saw her the head of the nursing come in there an hour or so before she passed walked into the room and Saidi hear you all are the cream of the crop I hear you all are I mean that thought who in the world is this woman and going look like a jezebel talking to us you know leaned over and talked to Erica and said Erica Erica couldn't speak by then I want you to know what a joy it's been for us lives have been touched on this floor by you when she passed nurses in her room crying nurses out on the hallway crying nurses at the nurses station crying don't telling how many people they'd seen pass but you see there's something different when a daughter of God is there so Sisters You Don't Have To Be A preacher come on he's saying oh I've never done nothing for God I've never preached nor did Erica except her children of course she's the Fifth Gospel she never sang that much although someone heard a song that ER Erica had sung about five years ago Carol something like that I've been wanting to get it to y'all so you could hear it the name of the song was he believes in me the words of the song was about a trial and a test and this and that that you go through little did the poor little thing know it was like a PR prophecy he believed in her whenever she was getting close that night I got my phone out of my pocket went over by her bed and started reading the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want aren't you glad friends when we get ready to cross there we've got a Shepherd that can take our hands oh praise speak to God hallelujah he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose he would be the author of frustration and not peace his purpose is after we
