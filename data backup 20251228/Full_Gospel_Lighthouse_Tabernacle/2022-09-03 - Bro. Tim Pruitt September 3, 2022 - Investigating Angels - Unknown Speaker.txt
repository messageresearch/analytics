brother Ron amen foreign Hallelujah wow wow and I'm not even preaching I bless you you can be seated I'm so honored to to be able to stand before you today we love you with all of our hearts I thank you for every prayer every prayer brother Timothy stirred up the devil last night and I had to fight him so last night and so it's quite a journey it's quite a journey from diagnosis to chemo every day for two and a half years and we're still standing [Applause] you know sometimes when it's cancer in just a small spot it's a you know something that's very treatable and you can fight it for a while and maybe six months and it goes away but when they tell you that you've got it in your lungs and your brain and then they tell you for months after months and still tells me that it's not went away but it's stable you know that devil would like to take our lives and he would if he could the strength of your prayers and the strength of the Lord the doctors always tell me they're very phenomenal doctors that have taken care of us for these two and a half years they have told us that your God and this chemo I always add this chemo one of them told me the other day brother Terry that I'm their number one testimony so anyway and so we just thank the Lord for that I'd like to thank you for coming this is more than just a tradition but it's a gathering of the Bride I believe that we're just before the coming of the Lord I am told I'm told by many many different ones that a man's character is known by his friends and if you look around the room the most powerful people on the Earth are set near you so when the devil tells you that you're a nobody just tell him the circle that you set in we are a privileged people because we have some of the most powerful preachers that have ever lived on the face of the globe that are preaching for us because the open book has been given and it stands it's not limited in its power and we're a people that can receive it and rejoice in it and we love it with all of our hearts there's no breaks on it we love it it's our book it's our Redemption and we stand in it I'd like to share a testimony with you if you if you would this this is going to be my first time sharing it in this form about 20 years ago I had finished a meeting and and as the meeting was over with they rushed me to the airport they put me on the plane I hadn't

how things it went a lot of different ways in his life you know when I talked to him about the Lord that God could help him that God could minister to him I told that story over the last 20 years I probably told it at least at least 20 different times looking for that man I was sitting uh about a about four to five weeks ago at our fellowship hall Heaven having dinner after service and as I was sitting there a voice whispered in my ear you're sitting beside of the man that was on the plane and I said I turned to him and I sat down I believe we met before he said no we've never met before I

of brother Charlie Spencer and we loved him and appreciated him and one by one it seemed like they crossed so crosstalk the the curtain but one glad day we're going to be all gathered together again no more partying no more sorrow no more trouble amen what a glorious day that will be amen we love you and we appreciate you very much so if you'll stand with me as we read the word tonight let's go to Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 1. amen and and brother Donnie I know you enjoyed brother Phillips singing but you can't have him [Laughter] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 1. let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for therebys some have entertained angels unawares then turn with me to Genesis Chapter 18 and we'll read from verse 1. and the Lord appeared unto him speaking of Abraham in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw him saw him he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and Abraham hastened into the Tenon to Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal needed and and make cakes upon the hearts and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk in the calf which he had dressed and set before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him and Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of the women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am old shall I found pleasure my Lord be an old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall have assured he bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst life and then one more scripture for your seated Luke chapter 17 verse 29 we'll read from there but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed notice this is not when the son of man comes but when the son of man is revealed amen God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak tonight on um investigating angels investigating angels now the Book of Genesis is the seed chapter we well know and whatever was planted in Genesis it comes the Harvest and the end time and of course um Jesus Jesus told us about that when the sower going forth to Sea to sow seed but actually not only is the New Testament and this the as he said the sower is the son of man so the son of man has actually been so in seed down through the age and so looking at that we understand that this the the Bible is actually prophecy is more than a book of History it is prophesying of the end time and uh so this is why it would say as it was in the days of lot because he's telling us that lot was more than just a story in the Bible but that it was it was um a prophecy of the end time so will it be when the son of man is revealed and there was uh the revealing of the son of man and and doing so and in that time the investigating Angels brother Branham would many time call him investigating angels of judgment and of course he would hear and the The Cry of the sodomites and the sin and come down to Sea and of course that was investigation he was also investigating a lot and there would be um uh um where he would find look he's investigating he's finding ten righteous or less than 10 actually you know the righteous pulling them out and then of course um not only that but he was investigating with Abraham and Sarah a lot of times we just think him looking at um the the sodomites and maybe lot a little bit but actually he's doing even more than that he's investigating Abraham and Sarah because somehow Sarah has to get on board with the promise and she has to start believing and the church was represented um by lot had to get out of Sodom and Abraham was watching because you know he was under expectation so here is the Church of Abraham and there's part of them under expectation and and part of them that are just in the Chant without any expectation and you know there's all kinds of conditions and Abraham is watching because he's looking for another appearing of the angel of God of all the experiences that he'd had before then he is now about to receive um the greatest crowning uh appearing that God would make to him and where he was to be crowned with an experience of being changed to receive the promised son so this was the greatest of all appearings he had already appeared to him and gave him the Divine call that's justification and then the blood offering which was sanctification he led him to that and appeared to him and told him how to offer the sacrifice as Melchizedek King theophany had revealed itself son and served in Bread and Wine as that was shut eye The God Who is more than enough what we heard about last night more than enough and the soils of shady eye it types out the pouring out of the Holy Ghost but now it could send those into God being manifested in flesh and human flesh this would be the capping off of all the visitations of Elohim you see God had led him from the earth the Chaldeans appearing to him in the land of his father and and this would cause Abram the idol worshiper to start seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God and all of this this visitations from the age of 75 whether by voice or by dream or by visions uh and visitations this was now the greatest because God would now take on flesh and he would come and and would manifest himself in a more real more physical way for here it was like the fullness of all the manifestations of the divine presence of God where the word it would be like and it was actually pre-figuring where the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ and let me say that the appearance of God in this last day is again a culmination of all the appearance it is the highest point of the visitations of God since the day of Pentecost and it's not a mere baptism of the Holy Ghost but rather is accepting off of them pouring out of the entire deity of God into his bride body and so in disappearing to Abraham there were three Ethiopians that stepped into uh there are three theophanes that stepped into bodies that gathered from the elements of the earth bodies that were gathered from the elements of the earth and came and appeared unto Abraham now God was showing in types and shadows here that in the last days theophonies are about to enter into view and and when we see them we're going to be chains and receive Christ The Promised Son of God so you see it's actually prophesying that theophonies are about to come into view you are a people that are about to see what other ages only long to see and that is that we are to receive not only the promised son but the openings come from that other realm and when we see them we'll be changed to be like them and in order to do that there are going to be people that has to be expecting his appearing that love is appearing for as he said in second Timothy 4 and 8 that henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me of that day and not to me only but to also all those that love his appearing there's going to be people loving his appearing now is is appearing brother random explained to us was it was different from his coming they're two different things but you see but this is not the the appearance is not his Corporal return but it's where that he comes down and manifests himself in a spiritual manner there as he reveals himself and takes on mask in this end time I'm talking about flesh amen then he'll wrap himself behind dust now this is the end time where angels are appearing and and they as they appear Among Us they are investigating they're looking for the evidence of holiness they're looking for the evidence of the Holy Ghost being in your life they are examining and looking for the evidence of faith they are looking for those that are ready to marry the bridegroom who love the Lord with all their heart with all their might with all their soul so you know again brother Brandon would tell us and and many different sermons about Abraham this is one of his his main theme as he picks up this prophecy that is laying in the seed chapter and he says remember Jesus Christ the son of God said the same thing would repeat again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that God would be working through human flesh doing the same thing that he did then oh God help us to wake up the day of visitation is here you say oh well God doesn't send Angels anymore the holy spirit is that angel the holy spirit is that person amen the Holy Spirit Jesus said he the Holy Ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did he will be with us even in us and he would bring all things to our remembrance that he had been taught and would show us things to come the works that I do shall he do also now we're living in that day we're living in that time I'm telling you tonight we are living in the most awesome hour and I'm aware that God is revealing himself in this day in a very spectacular way now when when the Holy Ghost dispensation came in brother Brandon said it come in and continues on and will continue on by the administration of angels to the to the church truly but there ordained spirits of God sent to carry things out and he said it'll speak and testify of Jesus Christ and it'll produce Jesus Christ to this people now under this Administration they will visit homes that will visit churches how many times have brother Benham say that Angels were walking up and down stopping by every pew and they're investigating they're looking for somebody that will believe somebody that is ready to receive him somebody with me amen and they visit home and they stir the people and then brother Madam said it this way May the angels of God come down into this city the city's roundabout and throughout the country and visit homes and stir the people amen oh my did you know brother random said that when when you feel that that certain feeling coming by you he said you're actually bumping into angels amen that they're here in every service now here in this service tonight and they are investigating they're looking there at your life looking looking expected remember even Jesus said when the son of man cometh will I find faith I'm gonna be looking for faith there's going to be an investigating that is going on and I am looking for somebody who will believe me now God has always used angels in his word all the way down from the earliest Parts in Genesis they've had angels in every dispensation and you know theologians will say to brother Branham they criticized him because he was the only one of them of all of the Divine healers that went forth that was visited by an Angel commissioned by an Angel I often say to people you got problems with this message you got problems with the angels this one not brother Brandon's message amen this was the angel the very angel that has earned the hearts amen the very angels that knew your troubled your problem know your name that never failed it was always right somebody with me tonight amen so if you got problem with this message you got problems not with William Branham you have got problem with the angel thank you even when it would come down to the seals he said I was about to make a horrible mistake I was going over to some of my old notes and things and thought I would preach on that and what this one said and that one said and about that time the angel of God came into the room and straightened out my thinking we have a message that has been delivered by the angel [Applause] [Music] oh but this theologians said to brother Branham said you keep talking about that angel that's a narrow son God don't lead the Church By Angels anymore that's the holy spirit that leads the church in the last day he said that's true but they're still angels amen I said well it's not the New Testament Doctrine brother Brandon he said oh oh sure it is so you believe the Virgin Mary was in the New Testament when the angel Gabriel goes up there so yeah but that was for the Holy Ghost came well what about you for the belief Philip had the Holy Ghost well yes what he told them to go down Samaria to the desert in Gaza for for the eunuch of Ethiopia wasn't that the angel of the Lord it was the angel of the Lord amen not the Holy Spirit he said you you believe that Saint Paul had the Holy Ghost sure Peter had the Holy Ghost uh man Peter's laying in prison gonna have his head cut off the next day and an angel walks into his prison and breaks the chain opens up prison doors somebody help me preach if he did it them he will do it now he'll Break Every Chain Every Chain of Darkness Every Chain of unbelief Hallelujah and you'll say get up from there where you're laying in your depression and your unbelief Amen in one God of your prison cell I've opened the door to you Hallelujah that was Paul after 14 days and nights no moon no star you know nothing to show and then everything was lost and he said the angel of God sets stood by my side there and he said listen stay with the ship everyone that stays with the ship is going to be safe that's what the Angels saying tonight don't leave the ship don't leave the message and but don't leave it because everyone that stays with the message and then they're going to make it safely through don't try to make it on your own don't get out of you in the world don't tolerate sustained by yourself stay with the angel and his message [Applause] angels of God are ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God ministering spirits sent from his presence and it's not just men God visited women with angels by the way in the last day he don't just pour out his Spirit on men but on my sons and daughters amen God sent an angel to to Hagar to the mother of Samson to marry the mother of Jesus to women at the Tomb of Jesus announcing the resurrection and Angels Came not just to great people but to Humble Shepherds you don't have to be great for an angel to come to you amen you don't even have to be a Christian for angels to come to you a wayward man a sinner by the name of Jacob amen the one that was called supplanter Deceiver and that angel would lead him step by step into the place where he wrestled it out with the angel and his name was changed amen he even goes after Wayward preachers to Moses a wayward prophet at 80 years old showing it's never too late to start serving God foreign would even come to false prophet by the name of Balaam and he would straightly charge him don't you try to curse my elect amen God's got an interest in his people amen he would appear to Gideon inspiring in him with faith and courage to deliver God's people from bondage he would tell him things about himself he didn't even know you're a mighty man of Valor he'd never thought of himself before as that in fact the matter is he really had never become that to the angel told him because the angel knows how to bring out things in your life you didn't even know we're there he would appear to Isaiah giving him showing him the throne and the temple and to Ezekiel giving him the Revelation to Daniel and he would say to Daniel hold something I want to hear him say about me you're greatly beloved and that's what the Angel's message says to you tonight you're greatly loved of God to Cornelius telling him to go to japa to Pete and get Peter a gentile he Cornelius was to show get Peter to show you the way of salvation it would go in and there would would give strength to Paul as we said facing the storm telling him he would survive he would meet him on the Isle of Patmos over to John and there are anointings uh anointing Angels or living creatures with faces like a lion an ox and a man and an eagle and you happen to be anointed by one of those four tonight the eagle Hallelujah the flying eagle oh hallelujah amen one that don't have to worry about crossing the river you're not Earthbound creatures you can fly in the heavenlies where all things are possible amen Angels contend with the Devil amen Michael did over the body of Moses Angels fought and contended with the devil when when Gabriel was hindered by Satan who was and when he was trying to bring Revelation to Daniel and Michael had to come and Aid him God centers didn't get in Revelation to his people come on he'll fight to get to you That's How concerned he is about you Amen to be to know that you are on board that you have received that Revelation this God will fight on your behalf [Applause] Hallelujah amen they appeared to John revealing the same lamp stands as what was revealed to Zechariah in Revelation 12 he leads a angel leads the fight and we're Angelic battles become human and and there is a casting down of Satan their Angels strengthened Jesus on two occasions one after the battle in the wilderness and the other at Gethsemane amen Angels were are given charge over us and even even Jesus with just a command just a word of command he could have called 12 Legions of angels who were standing by ready to defend him amen that's exactly what you were you stand here tonight amen because it's not only for Jesus but it's for us he hath given his angels charge over us is that right amen unless we Dash our foot against the stone oh the devil tried to use that but that's still our scripture amen but it's but it's not only for Jesus it's for us and in the last day he stands up for his people in that day Daniel 12 1 at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince is standing for the children of thy people and there'll be a time of trouble as such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book amen the angel of God in our day have stood up to defend this people amen and he will deliver everyone whose names are found written in the book You are not alone you are not in this battle alone Hallelujah we have come to New Jerusalem amen where there are thousands upon thousands of angels innumerable angels angels are always present amen my lights are prayed said Lord I pray open this boy's eyes remember that amen and brother Bradham told us when that happened there he said God didn't send Angels there they were already there he just opened the eyes where they could see them amen you're never alone never alone you see angels have a lot to do with guidance to our prepared places he said behold I send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared Angels anoint men to preach and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven heaven the Everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth Angels anoint men amen that is coming he will send angels with the Great Sound of the trumpet and gather you the elect from the different directions or four directions let's not forget the mighty angel of Revelation 10. Hallelujah amen it is the same angel of God that met Moses in the first Exodus and he's here in the Third Exodus to take a people out of here come on somebody amen an anointing come down amen it ought to make us realize we don't have to leave a hook behind that we can say we're all going amen we're taking our loved ones our children our family our mothers our dads come on the way where the bats live Hallelujah he will seek till you find you he's not gonna leave one of you alone [Applause] brother Branham said it's the theme of my meetings Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because it was Jesus Christ that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the treasures of Egypt that was Christ amen the logos not Jesus amen the physical body hadn't been born yet but that but Christ was always there somebody helped me preach it was Jesus Christ he was in a pillar of fire that same was the same angel that was in that bush and burning the same pillar of power and he has been guiding Angel The Guiding Angel through the years oh I'm glad for that and he wants to visit your home he wants to come by your way he wants to visit you in your seat he wants to walk down your aisle he wants to be in this church and he's investigating looking for somebody that'll believe him amen I remember when he visited our house I remember that day when my wife was blind and couldn't see after having a brain bleed that's been about eight years ago and they're feeling sorry for herself unable to go to the bathroom by herself and all of that kind of thing and was wondering about her life and so on and and as he was blind in her in her peripheral vision the doctor said well we make some glasses maybe you might get some back or whatever but it's really kind of hopeless and and my my daughter had a little 18 month old baby that brother Ron had seen the vision of walking and and there he had an underdeveloped hip was able to stand or walk or crawl or couldn't stand alone by himself he would hold on and just totter like that you know he couldn't take a step and see him Bethany him in that day and set the baby down at the end of the bed and the moment my wife began to turn from feeling sorry for herself and began to have a praise come out of her heart and began to worship God the angel of God comes sweeping over her her sight came back came on down to the end of the bed and a baby who had never been able to crawl or walk jumped up and ran all over my house the angel will visit you tonight but he's looking for somebody that I believe him he's investigating Hallelujah Glory the Bible said when when Abraham saw the Angels appearing he ran from the temp door and bowed himself to the ground he ran he had a passion he must not pass me by I must get a hold of him tonight I've got to have him and he bowed before him and then before the ground the sound sign of submission and reverence of humility and recognizing greatness 1946 the angel of God appeared to brother Branham sent him out with a gift of Divine Healing you know a lot of the critics want to say well William Branham he just tried to make himself Elijah let me tell you something God said it on the Ohio River but if you just read a little history Gordon Lindsay tells it in a man sent from God two different occasions the Pentecostals jumped up in brother Brandon's meetings never had been in a meeting before and jumped up and prophesied and that in one Speaking tongues and another another interpreter said ask John the Baptist as John the Baptist was sent them for around the first coming of Christ you're certainly the message to four could run the second coming of Christ how has John the Baptist how did John come in the spirit and the power of Elijah so you see it wasn't brother Brandon saying I'm Elijah even God said to their own lips that this is Elijah and he said to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers in those meetings he found resistance to the Angel's message of Divine Healing and the old formal established churches it got to a place they didn't believe in miracles even among the Pentecostals the Assembly of God one of them there I think it was in Little Rock all right brother Brown tells about it that he that he treated him so the worst I've ever been treated anywhere was by an Assembly of God preacher and he said I went to the pastor and asked him to borrow some pews because we needed we needed more seats for the 10th and and we we did was running out of a seating room and he said huh I'm not looting my my seats or my my are nothing to this this radical stuff for this Angel come into a prophet I'm not doing that I'm not supporting that you see he only even received um resistance even among the Pentecostals themselves you know and because you know many of them these old formal established churches had got to a place where they no longer believed in miracles they were just not happening in their churches and so to excuse themselves of being void of the power of God they felt with their Superior knowledge of the word they were just too advanced for the Supernatural and they thought the supernatural was only for an infant Church and that if you were really established in the word you know you were just too dignified to believe in childish things that was a thinking during his rest between revivals brother Bradham went up to British Columbia and tired and weary after hours upon hours of prayer lines he spent days away from the pressures of those meetings and refreshing himself miles from the civilization up there in British Columbia he got up there and began to chase a grizzly bear he said I just want to see him so he said I was on my horse and I was I was chasing this grizzly bear on a horse and wanted to see the old fell on I got turned around up in the mountains and I got kind of Cloudy and the snowstorm was coming and and he said I couldn't see uh I couldn't I couldn't I could I found my directions which way to go back because you know there was um nothing for hundreds of miles no roads or anything and and said I was on my way back and I was riding about nine o'clock and I come to an old burn over he said how many knows what the burn over is it's uh where the fire is burning all the wood down and everything like that just a big old tree stands and all split and the sap all born off of them the bark and you stand there looking at big old stately trees and and I looked there and first thing you know it was the it was the most spookiest place I'd ever come to I saw the moon shining on them big old white trees and you know the bark off of them and they're dead and I said it looked like a gravestone a graveyard with a lot of tombstones and and the spirit of God spoke to him says just stop here for a minute and observe and well he's uh you know within this up I'm hurry I'm starved I need to get back and and uh but he just stopped for a little bit and watched and he began to hear the wind come down from heaven and pass through them and the trees went [Music] I don't talk about a lonesome spooky place Lord why do you want me to stop right here and the wind would come again [Music] and he said he began to think of the scripture in the Book of Joel what the Palm warm left the canker worm eating what the caterpillar the canker worm mating and he thought he said yeah that was once a great forest and there were great green trees and that were just like a bunch of churches great big spiers to us like that with would look like tombstones and he said to the spiritual thermometer a thousand degrees below zero walk in there and somebody said amen and they turn around and the pastor get a deacon and take him outside the door what are you interrupting me when you're hollering you're interrupting me when you're hollering me man well you said you interrupt me when you don't holler amen and he said I looked at them tombstones just a deadly Tombstone and then said there was no spirit in it whatsoever and I thought they're just a bunch of tombstones he said no doubt once we're big churches find trees of methodists and Baptists and you know Pentecostal whatever and they were but but now they're they're been burn over and scorched by a fire and and he said I I happen to think you know they were big churches one time but now God can send an old-time Pentecostal Revival and all the churches do is just mourn when he hits them they're stiff and they're dead and they can't move they just go hmm there's no such thing as Divine Healing Divine Healing is gone days of Miracles are passed no such thing as gifts of the Spirit just the poor poor and the holy ghost moving right through the members of oh we don't believe in that well that's fanaticism weird churches we ain't got ritual we're recorded but he said brother you're dead just a bunch of ritualistic Tombstone the only thing you can do is moan and cry but God sent a Revival just the same and he said I thought you know what the Pummel were made the caterpillar ate the Lucas eaten and what the Baptists left the Nazarene eat and what the Nazarene left the Pentecostal eating the old things eaten down and he said he goes on and talks about it he said I said oh God what do we do and then he said I got to thinking about the furthers of the Book of Job that said over in the second chapter of job said I will restore saith the Lord I thought and he said how God are you going to restore that bunch of tombstones dead you know here he's been in meetings and trying to preach an angel came Divine Healing and God's appearing Among Us and he's bringing Deliverance he's showing signs of his power and doing all of that and yet they're they're they're rejecting it and he said how in the world are we going to have a restoration there and he said I look there at the old dead thing in the old stump with the moon signing on it moaning and groaning and it can't give no life in it and the wind goes it comes and goes you can't I said you can't make that thing move Lord they hadn't got any substance it hadn't got no life about it it's all dried up and gone how can you have Revival in these old cold formal churches first place it won't let you in the Pulpit to preach this kind of a gospel oh the guy he's a Holy Roller don't want nothing to do with him the members bring you in all right but I'll have to consult to the board and the deacons and all them and this and we go through that no no no right down the road don't tell me he said I've been there amen and said no none of that in our church he just tear our church to pieces and so he he said as he looked there and he was watching and said Lord what are you wanting me to see I I can't see how you're going to restore these old dead churches but he said directly I heard something going Frolic Frolic Frolic Frolic and I thought what is that and he said there was some undergrowth coming up it's a little bitty trees so there you are Lord I will restore and saith the Lord right in that same Forest come up and undergrowth that they call backwash today that they called for Madison today but look at the difference when the wind hits these Amen to do you say but when they hit some little green trees that's got life in it it just frolics and jumps up and down and old-fashioned Holy Ghost Revival Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Jesus amen for he said I will restore saith the Lord amen he said God wants to restore the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he investigated this age and said you got to have more faith your hearts have got to be turned back to Faith again so he sends an angel love you to turn your heart amen like he did up in the upper room when the angel of God appeared there that time they got life and went to the windows and doors and out on the street and they acted like a bunch of maniacs and screamed and and staggered and hollered and everything else like a bunch of drunk people amen and they said that these men are full of new wine and brother Brandon said the the Blessed Virgin Mary to you Catholic people so it was in there and he said if God Almighty required the Blessed Virgin Mary and wouldn't let her come to Heaven until she got that experience how are you going to get in with anything short of that the peering of angels is investigating angels of judgment Jesus is looking for faith the angels are looking for those who sigh and cry for the Abominations that are done in the city amen amen Mystic lights are in the sky brother random said they don't know what they are he had his own insight to them he said you know what I'm thinking Jesus said before the where it comes before he comes there will be signs in the heavens above did you notice before he destroyed Sodom and gomar because of the sex Affairs he sent Angels down to investigated angels has come to the Earth in the last few years they've been seen among the people I mean honest blood loss people who knows it they've even stood and had their pictures taken that's right Angelic beings has visited taken word back to the father that sin is heaped to the Stars can hardly Shine the moon the whole world's a reeling like a drunk man coming in at night that's right amen but I believe he's got more to tell than that there's reports going back that there is a people that on Earth that our lab you're appearing they're looking for you they want to see him in every service they want to see him in their lives they want him down their homes they want them in their marriage Hallelujah foreign fact say the days of Miracles are passed there's no such thing as a holy ghost no such thing as Divine Healing no such thing as visit of angels amen I've been in meetings with brother Ron and people walk up and say God doesn't visit with angels he doesn't do that he only did that in brother Brown's meetings come on where'd you get that lie [Applause] well God don't send Angels no more one and when did God die and leave you in charge there's no such thing as miracles we've seen too many miracles to know that there are Americans I'm a miracle you're American Hallelujah but when you explain all the supernatural away from the Bible you take God out of the church by your traditions there's got to be an attitude to believing you're going to have to believe in angels before they can help you God can't work against your unbelief [Applause] some weeks ago I preached to own under the oak tree I talked about Sodom is too hot Sodom has the atmosphere heated up the smoke has been released Out of Hell the bottomless pit is open the stench of sin is heavy somebody help me preach amen that's exactly right and and brother Brandon said the lid has literally come off of hell amen's dreams of demon powers pouring from everywhere is conquered the Nations conquered our nation is conquered politics till it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches till they know nothing but denomination you say are you a Christian I'm method of you Christian I'm Pentecostal and let me add well I belong to Message Church he said that don't mean any more than saying I'm a pig or a hog or a horse or something has nothing to do with it you're not a you're a Christian when you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost and not until that you're yielded completely to the spirit if you're not yielded and you're not born again and you don't have the Holy Ghost and you might speak in tongues and shiver and jump and run and do all kinds of Paul said I can move mountains with faith I could heal the sick I can have knowledge of the Bible I can go to Seminary I can learn all this stuff and I'm nothing yet oh my talk about lid off the kettle demons going around powers of the devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrines the Commandment of men Theological Seminary doctrines leaving the Bible alone Hallelujah he said who is able to who is strong enough who is wise enough who is powerful enough to tame this Legion that's stripping the clothes off of our women in the name of preachers Methodist Baptist even Pentecostal amen and brothers I want you to say is not just what you preach Is What You Don't Preach [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are you with me pain in their face like Jezebel bobbing the hair wearing pants like men are preachers not enough get up about them to tell them about it devil possessed it was a legion notorious clothes off of him who is this roaring devil I'm telling you friends we've got an atmosphere out there that is hot hell has enlarged its mouth sin is encroaching our churches Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord you know that we have seen now sin and unholiness creep in women with skirts so tight [Applause] all right you wear these I'm quoting the prophet you wear these little tight skirts they're so tight going down the street so tight to the skins on the outside and call yourself Holiness women is that the way a daughter of God would act clothes way above the knees topped off with painted nails [Music] wearing your makeup and preachers saying uh you know you're you're wearing just a little bit too much makeup I can I I you know I is beginning you know to show a little bit too much look at the Modern one today a little skin down dress that ever formed she can't move without sinning this is the message walking tipping down the street with makeup and cosmetic and cosmetics a Max Factor can put on her nearly and fixing her hair like some little girl and wear a little skirt just up above her knees and she got on any at all but you look at her she's pretty Satan knows how to do it he's the author of beauty that type of beauty which results in sin [Applause] I might be going out on the limb right here and if it is your pastor can cut it off but anyway you know I I see a new style rising up out of hell of these leggings these worldly women that wear them and show every form of their body and you know those that try to be a little more modest they wear a t-shirt you know about down here you know just see you know and and and uh just enough to cover their bottom but now it's coming in with our girls with the skirt that barely covers a knee if at all and then they sit and expose himself to their thigh or their crotch and think they're covered no they're not covered and for people that are expecting or appearing how can we when Angels don't visit places where Holiness and modesty and righteousness don't abound [Applause] I thought it was wonderful you know brother Brandon as we as so many came out of the Holiness move and you couldn't wear a wedding ring and brother Brandon said you should and you know he didn't actually can can we can wear wear a little necklaces sisters and and said yes you know you can wear a little necklace but he said don't look like that you walked into a dime store a 10 cent store with a magnet on [Applause] I I get the wedding ring and I get the necklace that the prophet of God told you could wear but where where this magnet you got on got and you got one on your toe now and one on an ankle bracelet all kinds of other things you know every jangle and bangle and everything else well brother tell me you know you're not one of these modern preachers you got that right I still believe in holiness are you with me how are you gonna run to meet him and you got the world written all over your life and the same thing with your boys picking up every kind of bad that there is amen Abraham ran to me him amen look into passion look at the passion when he saw the angel he must be he must be he must be persuaded to stop [Applause] passes by brother Branham said the young men will sign up for the military and fight their battles and they can be great men of courage and give them their lives for the country and then stick their head up and let somebody shoot it all but he said seldom will you find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of Christ he won't even crawl out of his shade tree to go to church won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend a Wednesday night prayer meeting that's a disgrace it's a shame that's the reason Angels don't visit the churches that's the reason Angels don't visit homes we got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing the angels of God are here on Earth tonight just the same as they've always been Hallelujah and there he would say my Lord if I have found favor in my sight do you know it's Grace that he would come Among Us if I feel in favor don't pass me I'm not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest under the tree you haven't been here long you just come out of the out of the other dimensions you pull together the dust the 16 elements and you stepped into it but while you've walked here you've been walking through that hot sand Let Me Entertain You For a Moment let me wash the feet of Jehovah let me have a Serpent's heart a servant's attitude amen he's here to investigate he's looking for somebody that will entertain him angels will gather the elect from the four directions of the earth to do this angels will have to investigate they're looking for sincere and honest hearts they're looking for those that are zealous to repent the angels are Reapers and and they're separating and Gathering and to do that they have to look and investigate amen so I wanted to say this just who is this that's appearing Among Us brother Brandon would tell us who it is he said it's the same Jesus but this time he's in Bradford same power same church same thing same word the same Jesus Hallelujah the same God that manifests himself in a human body and disappeared a moment that same God would manifest himself in a people human flesh in the form of the Holy Ghost of believing people in the last days at the evening light it's the son of man revealing himself in the bright body it's his appearing but he is not using dust that he gathered up and had 16 elements and stepped into neither is he doing it the one the way he did it with Mary come on listen he had to do it that way at that time because there was nobody redeemed the blood had not been shed come on somebody so what did he do he had to gather dust that's what he had to do but now through the blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is coming to dwell in your dust [Applause] Hallelujah and he's Gathering his dust some is from Louisiana some is from Texas some from Tennessee some from Virginia they remember whatever it's God's dust that he's Gathering and God's putting on a mask and he's got blood is going to dwell among his people [Applause] [Music] brother Madam said he's come in his visitations from Luther back to Wesley then the Pentecostals the Tums and the lips and now it's in the prophetic eyes of Malachi 4 and now there is nothing else left for it to come but for him himself to step into that Hallelujah that's what he's looking for tonight he's looking for vessels he's looking for people he can step into that's what we ought to be saying tonight God use my glass use my gas step into that stuff that's not bringing best dust [Applause] brother Brandon said the angel of the Lord is here tonight he's Jehovah God in your flesh he's Jehovah God In My Flesh that same God Never Dies he just is real again he says I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body except his call amen he said what is it as he quotes Luke 17 30. what is it it's God the Holy Spirit dwelling among human flesh in these Sanctified vessels amen that the son of God's blood cleansed by faith and God dwelling in these vessels performing and carrying on the works of Jesus Christ making him the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah praise the Lord that's what he's doing he's looking for somebody that he can use your hands use your feet use your eyes use your mind come on let the mind of Christ can be of God working in a bright body performing the same miracles the same Holiness the same word the same power the same in every detail except it's called the body not manifested in flesh on the Earth the angels have come to find a bride for Christ and they're investigating they're asking the question where you go Rebecca and in that day when the Eleazar came and allies are prayed come on and he prayed Lord let the one that is willing to water my camels let him let that one be the bride for Isaac and brother Brandon said the angel of God got to Rebecca 30 minutes before Eliezer got there and said get down there to the well [Applause] amen you see it's evening time and it's evening time that the angel of God and of Supernatural is revealing himself to Rebecca the Bride of Isaac and somehow she was moved to get to the Water of Life foreign Hallelujah amen just think about it here tonight some of you have been out in sin some of you were out in the world some of your prodigals but why are you here tonight because the angel of God has moved on your heart to deal with you to bring you to the Waters of life Hallelujah and something began to move on then I've got to get to the water I've got to get down to the well I've got to get for the water of light flows freely and brother Ben said no more then your heart goes to hunger and thirsting for God some kind of a holy ghost Revival will break out somewhere the bride's Revival is happening because God is gathering the bride a people for his namesake Rebecca would have to carry about five gallons of water at a time to water 10 camels would be 300 gallons 60 trips down to the well I remember with every step of it down there walking down there I've been bending down lifting up the heavy jar of your shoulder amen now you don't see what a scene that's ten camels and they're the one drink you know about 30 gallons so here you go you know and she was willing to make 60 trips she had a heart of a servant Hallelujah and brother Brad was told us exactly what that meant he said it was a beautiful Rebecca water in the camels watering the very thing that was going to take her to her bridegroom thank you that's what it is in water and the camel represents power and the Church of the Living God is rejection and watering the power of the Holy Ghost that'll pick her up someday and take her Yonder to meet the bridegroom Isaac in the air Hallelujah the very camels that she watered the very God we preach about the very word which is God the very goddess in the word will raise us up one day he says by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that are critics thank you that are critics are you with me will be killed by the same power that raises you up to Glory Oh my he said rise up and ride on it and he said the way you water that Camel is by giving praise and glory Hallelujah I say we ought to fill our camels up tonight amen we ought to get it tired with the power of the Living God is going to take us to our bridegroom is happening right on it Hallelujah water it is it's the very thing the Praises of God you're given to the word of God is the very thing that's going to take Rebecca can beat her Isaac [Music] you know sometimes we're always worried about our need but what about his need God means object of worship and he has a need to be worshiped Abraham bowed his head to the ground and said let me wash your feet let me wash the dirt off of you you know and the sermon is there anything to the heart for the Lord brother Branham describes Sarah as in a bad mood now she represents the church so does Abraham together they make a church in the sermon there he describes her being in a bad mood you know here it was Angels were passing by and he said Sarah Sarah can I get out of the temp get over there need some bread maybe make some unleavened bread oh it's too hot it's too hot to be making unleavened bread Abraham you got these visitors and you want to make what In the Heat of the day don't you know how hot Sodom is don't you know how much trouble there is in the eggs well I'm just not in the mood to cook today oh man maybe some of you Brothers can thank me after this [Applause] foreign but I want to say it's just too hot they're saying it's too hot to make unleavened bread for the appearance I want to say this too hot not to make unleavened bread because it can't be an 11 and the bread that is offered to Angels it must be the unleavened bread or the sincerity and Truth but Sarah was in a bad mood Sarah was about to miss it but then he called her name because he's determined you're not going to miss it where is Sarah thy life you see God Has Come investigating looking for a Sarah come on somebody he will call you your name where is Sarah thy wife ah she's in the tent you ain't God's passing by and she's in the tent yeah you mean we're over here and she's in there pouting season different she got a bad attitude until you hear the promise instead of believing it in this mood she will doubt it well I don't believe in angels in this battle I'll tell you I that said some bunch of hoopla oh you know that it's just a bunch of worked up people you know that's that that Holy Ghost and talk about is this emotion in this mood she will doubt it it's too hard to believe why Abraham and I have been dead in our bodies for years now it's too impossible my my breasts would never give milk I I don't have streaks to bring forth the power is gone well we haven't had a Revival in years and years and years besides that we already got the Word of Promise we got Ishmael we've had all kinds of denominational moves in the message return Ministry and Coleman Thunders and two souls in perusa and tape only but none of them have produced The Promised son all they do is produce wild men that won't be subject to the word of God well brother Tim but all the promises have already been fulfilled because we now have a perfect word and we can't have those kind of service anymore this is too hard to believe we've given a long up a long time ago thinking we can have uh an experience with God like that this is impossible power of God living in us till we speak with other tongues why you're 99 of message Believers have never had a supernatural experience like that the desire for the Supernatural is long gone you know Abraham and I don't don't even have a love affair anymore there's no pleasure with my Lord we're just content with the child of a bombs woman just going to church a denominational life filling a Pew paying their ties just believe in the message and saying God sent a prophet that's all we know about the Holy Ghost besides that I'm too old I can never feel a baby kick I could never put up with it disturbing me jumping and dancing and shouting around in my womb my nerves are shot I don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures why noise makes me nervous I can't have none of them old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost Field child born of the spirit screaming hollering shouting praising God Father which subset our church order around here I'm too set in my ways by now it might keep me up all night praying it might turn to church into an all-night prayer meeting thank you foreign a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church one in any of these screaming shouting tongues speak in Acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah yeah she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah oh no I'm too old for that a kid running around here it'd keep me up at night we don't want no emotion goodness no somebody's slain in the spirit why we won't have them kind of Tantrums around here and Jesus the promised son is ushered out of his own church I said God changed our attitude from that bad mood foreign by being zealous to repent amens I will not be lukewarm I will not be indifferent I will not be unenthused I won't be enough careless attitude but let me be zealous not laid back or hiding out pouting in the tent sin is just too hot and there's too many trials but at the temp door looking for his appearing God is up to something and I can't afford to miss him thank you Hallelujah Sarah hears it you're going to have a baby you mean a new birth like they had on the day of Pentecost you mean children born you mean and she's snickered and she's got laughing in her tent yeah and unbelief at how ridiculous it will be for her breasts to be renewed and bring milk and nourishment for newborn babies but we don't preach baby stuff here and to think that she would have pleasure with her Lord and enter again to the bloom and Spark in her marriage like that of a newlywed oh it's silly to think I'll ever have my first love back like it was when he first kissed my heart that's been gone a long time ago with me and Abraham you know it's really silly to think an old crab and arthritic church will dance again [Applause] eyes and a spring in her steps that there would be Revival that there would be life put into Earth that faith and A New Hope in God's power and she can believe that there is nothing Nate too hard for the Lord Hallelujah glory to God we've got to have a people that come back to believe again there is nothing too hard for the Lord no cancer no demon no diabetes no point problems no sin problem there is nothing too hard for the Lord all right [Music] where's this appearing happening at it's happening under the oak trees in mammary where a bright tree has been restored do you think an appearing in A Feast for the Lord where we entertain him can happen under a tree that the problem the canker worm the caterpillar and all of that has already eaten it down to snag and all that has become is a buzzard Roots well even our brother and Roost and churches become a cage of every unclean and hateful bird and all kinds of sin sitting in the pew no it's got to be under oak tree where he is restored there is Joy back in the church there's leaves on the tree Hallelujah that Spirit on the tree a man there's joy of the camp and when the wind blows there the leaves clap their hands [Applause] and the trees get deeper roots and the Holy Ghost moves in the church foreign [Applause] there's no such thing as Divine Healing oh it's all gone days of Miracles are passed and God's just pouring out his Spirit right over the members anyway Hallelujah and is he doing does that they say that's fanaticism and then but there's a young crop a restored crops they got leaves on them and the wind blows they fly Hallelujah they lift up holy hands to God that worship they Praise Him Hallelujah they got a Lifeline of faith that got too dark they got true Doctrine but oh today you know the bark gets heat off the tree by the bugs of hell amen I'm trying to find a way to get here but you know someone say well brother Tim you see we got bark we got Doctrine while the seals have been opened to us and we have all the mystery truths do you now Sarah you two don't act like it in a bad mood Surly bitter angry at life laodicea lukewarm cold formal let me just tell you let me just tell you what happens when the book is open Revelation 5 and 8 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having that one of them hearts and golden bodies full of odors which are the president that say and they sung a new song [Applause] they didn't sing songs Under bondage they didn't sing songs of their failure that unbelief they were singing a new song Amen but Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals but that was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us under God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth [Applause] Hallelujah when the lamb opened the book it brought in a time of worship and verse 11 said and I heard the voice of many angels round about The Throne to beasts the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times thousand thousands of thousands saying with the loud voice word to use the lamb that was slain for to see Power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in the heaven on the earth and under the Earth and such as in the sea and all of them heard I said blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that set on the throne to the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and upon the two and twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever [Applause] you see Revelation is supposed to have stimulation in it it's the wine of Revelation remember Sarah says I'm too old for that it's just emotion and brother Brandon says and the scientific theory of this modern so-called religious groups have tried to prove this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion well see it just don't stand up to their scientific theory well I would like to ask them what makes them change what makes the drunkard stop drinking what makes us prostitute cease her evil life what makes the cancer and these diseases depart from the people and the dead deaf and dumb and blind and the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has a motion with it certainly certainly certainly anything that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse the expression but I think we ought to bury some of our emotionless religion here because it's dead it has no emotion in any religion that has no emotion to be buried because it is emotional oh if I were you I would constrain him tonight I'd say come by my pill amen and then to the point when them on the road to Emmaus They begged him to come in amen and amen I'm trying to get through to a place where I can find a resting place for you amen you can be seated for a minute I'm not through part one is complete part two [Applause] foreign just think about that you know Abraham washed his feet he got water to wash his feet he was entertained in Jehovah I know of another woman that the Bible speaks and said it'll be a memorial and it'll be told all over the world here in the end time did you know brother Branham preached that sermon on Jesus with dirty feet are you with me amen he preached it all over the country he started with pride in his own church and our actually in Cornersville Indiana there near his own church he he uh he got into a lot of different things you know um that he that he he would preach it on about that woman with dirty feet he said we've got to entertain Christ but you know again Sarah wasn't in the mood for this your hands when the angel tells her she's doubting I want you to understand something I want to just read just a few little quotes about this because you see here's the thing a lot of times we look at them we say well the bride gets out of Step and the bride did get out of Step In The Vision yeah right but that did not make them non-bride [Music] God didn't give up on them so what'd he do the prophet screams up get back in step and he said I saw her get back in step and when the world went down the others went down this one went up somebody with me now amen now I want you to think about this because you see Sarah represents a part of the church that wasn't under expectation and she laughed at the promise and then lied in the face of God saying no I never laughed but I want you to understand God can't leave her out he's coming looking for Faith but finding none he's going to give her the faith he's got to turn her heart back to believing again do you hear what I'm saying God ain't giving up on you because he found something wrong with you God is appearing but turn you around they give you a heart to believe because the church is going to be there without a Rica the grace of God will do that it'll have to do that he said like he talked to Abraham and when Sarah doubted him he would have slayed slew Sarah right then for her doubting because that's the worst sin there is is unbelief and the only sin and she doubted and laughed within herself when the angel discerned her through the tent is that right but why couldn't he take Sarah because she was a part of Abraham he would have to take Abraham to and we are part of Jesus when we're in the body of Christ Our unbeliefs are excused if we do it ignorantly like she did first she was scared you know we get scared it might not be real we get scared this could be a false hope we get scared well you know what will other people say about us but he can't take her without putting a faith in her all right and he can't just abandon her and just go get another woman he's got to get Sarah on board thank you A Hallelujah amen amen said she came and come forward and tried to deny it God would have destroyed her upon that if she hadn't been part of Abraham and a lot of times our unbelief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us we're part of Christ just as Sarah was a part of Abraham for we are the bride of Christ and we people who's born of the spirit of God ought to wake up and get out of her stews and watch for the supernatural sign of the coming of the Lord Jesus his signs that he's promised now brother Branham brings us down to individuals and Abraham's Covenant confirmed he said now listen I want to drop this in because I believe the Holy Spirit told me to do it you may be sitting there which some of you are I know you are disagreeing with me right now I could call your name if you want me to so I know that but I also can see farther than that that you're going to believe it one of these days Hallelujah that may be your husband that may be your wife that may be your children that may be your loved one disagreeing right now but rather be encouraged by the prophet of God I can see further than that you're going to believe foreign God is not going to give up on you he said Sarah just believed and God would have rubbed her name off but he couldn't do it amen he couldn't do it she's a part of Abraham and and then he he said and if you're not really and if you're not been if you're really not been excited or worked up an emotion I got some church Creed but really received the Holy Ghost and you're really part of Christ and a little skeptic in your mind God will not shove you off of that from that because he can't you're part of Christ he will bring you to the truth [Applause] he said I hope you people catch it you people that believe in God's grace right then God would have slew that woman of her unbelief he wouldn't have fooled with her another minute but he said he couldn't do it because she's a part of Abraham he would have to take Abraham with us and that's where Grace comes in all the mistakes are arrows god holds us because we're part of Christ the grace of God holding us oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he could not take Sarah because if he did he would have to strike Abraham with it he cannot take the church in all of its mistakes it is still his church he can't take it because he's had to take Christ he's a part of Christ she becomes flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone in all our ins and outs and unbeliefs and so forth and Scruples as long as she's in that body her ups and downs but the grace of God still holds her Hallelujah Hallelujah let me get down down here just for a minute now let's just look at this here we are here now in the very appearing of Jesus Christ here he's coming by his church let me just go over this for a minute brother Brennan would talk about entertaining Christ and he would talk about in the message of Pride and the meanest man I know the meanest man in Santa Maria meanest man in town he would entitle Jesus with dirty feet you know Jesus keeps all of his appointments and the worst sinner in town and the worst sinner in town was not the prostitute the worst sinner in town was the Pharisee who wouldn't wash his feet who let Jesus sit with dirty feet come on Church amen and he talks about that woman and how she got to him and he said I remember when I got to him she got hysterical I got hysterical he said I wept and I cried and I shouted I even spoke in tongues I did all kinds of things Pharisees they criticized and they disbelieved they're the worst sinners in town the meanest man in the city the meanest man in Santa Maria but this woman who has watched by my feet who has entertained me who has anointing me with oil who has kissed my feet who has washed him with her tears who has dreaded with her hair this woman all her sins which are many are all forgiven [Music] now what would brother Brown tell us that Jesus is going to be the rejected Christ and the last place he's going to be rejected is in his own church could be on the outside knocking under entertain the unwelcomed and brother Branham tells us he said to Jews dispensation went out and the Gentile came in because the Jews made fun of the upper room experience and the coming of the Holy Ghost and he said the Gentiles will go out the same way with them making fun of the Pentecostal experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said the gospel will turn from the Gentiles back to the Jews and he preaches this in the laodicean church age Jesus with dirty feet the Messiah rejecting now we're here in this last day this is the last place he will be rejected go and listen to laodicean church age the Gentiles will be cut off by rejecting he said Jews condemn themselves by blaspheming the Holy Ghost Call in the spirit of God an unclean thing they made fun of him when they were dancing in the spirit on the day of Pentecost this is our message the message to the angel of the Church of laodicea right and he said the same thing will happen is what happened with the original tree he said remember we're the grafted tree because they disbelieved the Pentecostal message that Paul was preaching and how much more in this day when we are rejecting the Pentecostal message that's come down through the churches how much more is God able to take that old wild tree off anyway and let another one come in because he will reject it because of their unbelief the Gentile church will be rejected but God will get a bride don't forget and Jesus he said ain't going to stand outside your door all the time and knock all the time no you better let him in he said he said don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got at Pentecost with the same type of water baptisms same things they did there don't you let nothing put anything in your heart less than that now so the I'm just I'm just I'm just giving you some of these things now let's come down Sarah the church laughed this is ridiculous me an old woman gonna have Revival gonna bring forth a child it's past we you know even Abraham said let the Ishmael live before you yeah you know and Sarah laughed and God would have killed her for lying in his face now let's look at just another thing Hagar at the same time and her son Ishmael made sport and laughed at the promised son at Isaac's weaning and what happened to them are you with me what happened to them they were cast out for laughing at the promise and they will laugh at the Holy Ghost and will laugh at his gift they will laugh at speaking in tongues and healings and workings of Miracles and mock the word of knowledge they will lie and and Scorn at its inspired preaching they were live at the revealed Mysteries and for laughing the bonds woman and her son will be cast out but I want to talk about Sarah's last laugh and this time God doesn't rebuke her for laughing no rebuke this time Genesis 21 verse 6. and I'm closing and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear me will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah said have given children suck for I have borne him a son it is old age thank you Hallelujah this is Sarah's last laugh [Applause] and she don't get rebuked for it her name had been associated with baroness a long time that bad woman that barren woman Sarah but that's not your name anymore Sarah Prince's is your name Hallelujah you're the mother of a new race and our name isn't Barren anymore we are not the mother of stillborn children who claim the message and their lives are dead in sin and God said I want you to name this boy laughter and I don't believe it was because Sarah giggled and laughed at the ridiculous promise an old woman having pleasure with her husband again I believe it was because God made them to life when the Fulfillment of the promise that God brought the promise to pass there's an old proverb that said he that lasts last last best he that laughs the last laughs blast and I just want you to know I'm already starting to laugh Hallelujah God is making his church to life over cancer to the life of a brain please to laugh over alopecia the life over diabetes to laugh over sin he's making me laugh when I see Sons and Daughters of God and the spirit of God poured out upon him he makes me alive when I see young and old so overcome till they speak in a Heavenly language he makes me to laugh when I see the devil a pornography bound and dead and young people living an overcoming life that man but I'm about to have the last life on that bright and cloudless morning with the dead and crashed your eyes and the glory of his resurrection chair Hallelujah I'm about to ask life I'm gonna laugh when I see my wife Karen in a new body young healthy I'm gonna laugh when I see Charlie Spencer and I see Homer Fraser dancing together I'm gonna lie [Applause] Hallelujah I'm gonna look at the new clothes of my new body and I'm gonna run and I'm going to dance and I'm going to shout and I'm going to take a young man by the hand and we're going to dance together hallelujah we're going to dance like little children we're gonna have the last real life of our sin we will laugh over the devil we will laugh over Asylum and we'll Say Goodbye World goodbye I'm gonna have the last laugh Sarah just go ahead and start lacking now so rejoiced it now start thanking
