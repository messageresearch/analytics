each and every one of these my ass brother Gabriel Spencer if he'd come just pray over these this morning if you would foreign [Music] appreciate all the prayers that you would have for my Aunt Angel we lift her up in prayer about a year ago that's when she actually started recognizing the message and kind of listening into it and became interested and I'm believing that God has a bigger purpose even behind this entire test and I believe Satan's just trying to come in and throw it throw a trick it's a trick of the enemy as she started getting in tune and she listens to brother Ron a whole lot just for encouragement today is actually her birthday and she found out Friday that she was now diagnosed with brain and all the all the conditions there but we know that's just a demon from hell and we know the god that's the power over top of that let's just bow our heads and take these needs to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just we thank you so much for what you've done for us and we thank you so much for the visitations across this entire building last night as that was that was not a man at work but that was you at work Lord and and Lord Jesus you came and your your message is Anointed because we know that you are the word and you come and make your word known and make it flesh and Lord Jesus if if we were not to speak if we were not to cry out the Rocks would cry out Lord but but you've placed a voice inside of us and we know there's we know there's power behind the tongue and and whether we whether we speak positivity or whether we speak negativity in our into our lives that's exactly what what fruits will be produced and Lord Jesus we are speaking we are speaking positivity this morning we are speaking healing into lives we see all the prayer requests that have been brought forward this morning and Lord Jesus I'm just I'm thanking you in advance because I know the power of the god that I serve and I have the faith that each and every one of these prayer requests that's been made known whether it's a whether it's a sickness whether it's a death sentence over someone's life is you could come in and just a sweep of a moment and wipe every wipe every cancerous cell out you can wipe every anxiety every depression spirit you can wipe everything that we are fighting away Lord Jesus we we each have our own personal battles that the person next to us may not even recognize we're fighting at the time but more importantly we we also don't know the the voice that you are speaking in each and every one of our ears Lord and I'm just believing that you will come and you will speak directly to our ears this morning that that everything that we are up against every every battle that we're up against Lord Jesus you can make a way right through it and sometimes you will wipe it completely out and we're so grateful for that and other times you'll you'll make a way right through the middle of the test and trial that that you will be right there with us and just when we think that you're not there you're the one carrying us through and Lord Jesus I just ask that you will come and speak encouragement to our lives this morning you will speak healings but more importantly you will you will speak salvation into our lives that that those who are who are needing a touch from you those who are needing salvation and a saving grace that you will come and speak to their heart that that they will recognize that that they are needing a stronger pull from you they are needing a stronger walk with you and Lord Jesus we know when we come into your presence there is not a stagnant walk we will either leave walking closer to you or walking away from you Lord and I just believe that every every single person within the under the the voice of the of the sermon this morning will begin to walk closer to you and and walk with a higher Faith a higher power Lord and we just thank you for what you were going to do for us and we just ask you to be with the service this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen at this time we'll receive this morning's offering amen my brother Jordan Robertson come sing for us if you would and then after he

Hallelujah amen don't you love him this morning he is so wonderful amen sometimes when you don't see him moving he's moving it wasn't last night just awesome [Music] I have a note that is on our on my on my picture it's a note kind of like this yellow one here it says if you will trust me I will use you like never before [Music] God spoke to me just a few moments after I saw a vision and that Vision was of sister Anna I ran through the house we screamed together Connie and I last night last night sister Esther was watching with brother Jeff in Louisiana last night's sister Anna wore a very special necklace that she was given that came from Shiloh and Andrew preached on Hannah [Music] this morning I'm going to speak to you on it didn't have to be that way the Lord spoke to me two weeks ago to take this subject tonight [Music] there's another part to this story I'll just share it with you now and have held this for three years I was at brother Danny Stevens preaching a meeting brother Jason Jackson mother Tim Pruitt brother Timothy when we're all standing in the same house [Music] the last day before we were flying home I had a vision that I was going into a deep pit worst pet had ever seen in my life as I walked down into that pit seemed like everything was just destroyed never seen anything quite as bad as what that was I saw two particular men their lives were just destroyed those men that's that did happen I got to the bottom of that pit when it came to the bottom of the pit there was a girl standing there foreign [Music] are you ready to go so I'm ready brother Ron and we turned and we walked toward the sunlight that girl sang this morning and I thought my heart was going to explode as she was singing with Andrew just a few moments ago could we just give the Lord a great big hand foreign thank you thank you what a powerful service already amen amen God bless you and uh if you will turn with me to Luke chapter 9 and verse 62 and then we'll go to Mark chapter 10 and verse 17. foreign I love that song Mercy said no if Satan would have been given the opportunity he would have just he would destroy you in a moment in an absolute moment he would destroy you Luke chapter 9 and verse 62. and Jesus said unto him no man have him put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Mark chapter 10 and verse 17. and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I might inherit eternal life he went to the right source and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good for there is none good but one and that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all of these things have I observed from my youth and then Jesus beholding him loved him quite a statement isn't it and said unto him one thing thou likest go thy way and sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God you may be seated this morning it didn't have to be that way I got this sermon about two and a half years ago I was standing outside a here conducting a funeral on the porch it was for a girl that had grew up on this property she was the granddaughter of one that that actually lived where you lived brother Roy and sister Darlene I actually stood here on this stage and married her to her young husband before a service they came in their wedding gown and and several girls and guys were there with them and we had a we had before about an hour before this service we had a wedding the next time that I would see this young lady she would be be gone and as I was there in a large group of bikers came they lined this Hillside with bikes quite a few people stood outside and the reason we had to do it outside it was covered and we were forbidden to to open the the place to do all of that not actually been warned by the health department and also by my own insurance company here and so we had it we had it outside there was another Minister that preached it with me and and uh from down the way and he would later make fun of me but I had to do what I had to do and I stood there and and God just spoke to my heart as I was sitting in a chair and he said it didn't have to be this way it didn't have to be this way here she lived on the property as a little girl growing up growing up in this church actually toward the end of her teenage year she only became periodically because her family only came became periodically and and so she wound up a horrible death just in the last couple of weeks uh three different friends have passed because of Fentanyl you know drugs is a is a powerful addiction but there's a demon that gets into people that wanted a little stronger and a little stronger you see sin has no satisfaction to it and it will take you way further than you ever thought you'd go and young girl 22 years old passes away a couple of weeks ago and a young man that we know passed away another young man brother Jason had brought brother Jason Smith had brought here and he was tattooed up painted painted a lot and it was a surprise to even brother Jason that it seemed like he could get his footing but all of a sudden and then one day fentanyl no doubt grabbed his life if the devil could he would he would destroy us all sometimes I I picked up a statement I want to share this with you this morning sometimes in our own in our own ways we look at things and we look at different difficulties and we have much of a blame game but this Saiyan says weak people get revenge strong people forgive intelligent people ignore I'd like to just share this with you too many people die before they ever really live I'd like to speak to you this morning as we would go sometimes we blame we blame others we blame officials we blame the president we blame the pastor we blame the school teachers School teachers for example they they go to school and they spend years trying to prepare themselves to be able to adequately teach and bring out potential in individuals lives to make them better but many times people set through 12 15 years of schooling and only and only just allow it to go through and don't really get it the light don't come on others begin to Excel and pass and but let me just say you must you must work you must work you must you must put yourself forward because there's potential in every person there's potential whether you're a a poor person or a very rich person there's extreme potential in every individual and listen God don't send nobody to hell God doesn't send nobody to hell your choices oh my brother Ron if only if only if only sometimes we live a life of regrets it's kind of like eating donuts and then regretting that you ate them there's always been a saying that the grass is always greener on the other side before long people begin to explore Satan's got every bait that he can throw at you and let me just say remind you Satan is nobody that you want to negotiate with we're going through this life and we're only going to go through it for just a short time even if you live a hundred years but at the end of it what do you have let me just say sin has no satisfaction there's no bottom to the fall of sin you'll just continue to fall if you'll remember brother Branham when in the souls now in prison and he gives us both sides of Heaven and Hell and when he experienced hell he said it was like falling for an eternity and there was nobody to catch him and he said I screamed for my mother and I screamed for my father and there was nobody there all right he began to tell us that he he said I've never sinned I've never committed adultery I've never done none of those things God will allow him to go through this experience to where that he could help the worst sinner that there would be he would allow him to go through the experience of Heaven to share with us that what life is after here I choose heaven but when we begin to think of these things I quoted this just a few weeks ago I've given God a million reasons not to love me and none of them changed his mind aren't you grateful for that aren't you absolutely grateful for that brother random says he says a lady was driving along with her father and They Came Upon a storm and the young lady asked her father what should I do he said keep driving cars begin to pull over to the side the storm was getting worse what should I do the young lady asked keep driving her father replied and on up the up on a few feet she noticed that 18 wheelers were also pulled over and she told her dad I must pull over I can barely see ahead it is terrible and everyone is pulling over and her father told her don't give up just keep driving now the storm was terrible but she never stopped driving and soon she could see a just a little bit more clearly after a couple of Miles She again was now on dry ground and the sun came out and her father said now you can pull over and get out and she said but why now he said when you get back look at all of the people that gave up and are still in the storm but because you never gave up your storm is over now he said this is a testimony for anyone who is going to go through some hard times just because everyone else even the strongest gives up you don't have to if you keep going soon your storm will be over and the sun will shine on your face let me just ask you the question can our God be trusted remember he is the one that is faithful and he will provide for his promises God's promises are irrevocable because of who God is he is unchanging he sees the end from the beginning he never caught has never been caught off guard or or even unexpected moments he makes no mid-course Corrections he is not victimized by moods hello amen or weather he never changes or casts a shifting shadow our God is faithful God can be trusted to keep his promise he is strong he does not compromise he does not over promise he does not under deliver God is able to Purdue whatever he promises that he can do he cannot lie it is impossible for God to God a rock cannot swim a hippo cannot fly a butterfly cannot eat a bowl of spaghetti you cannot sleep on a cloud and God cannot lie [Applause] he never exaggerates manipulates fibs flatters it is impossible for him to lie the seed is simply but it's not an option God will keep his promises to you I want to say this to you failure for us is not an option I refuse to turn back and go back hmm we all understand that the lack of preparation for storms it's 100 percent the way for you to fail now you say well brother Ron but I I get exhausted whatever the reason too much pressure exhaustion frustration lack of commitment the field to flee and run away to the mountains run from our responsibility refuse to train for the bout pressures all around us whether they be peer pressure or anxiety Within the feeling to escape it all just simply being fatigued and wore out wiped out the things that you've been through agonizing over yesterday it's kind of like just almost having a wreck and then you can if you don't straighten yourself up from that wreck you can't drive another mile but you got to come to yourself we must move forward why brother Ron nobody cares nobody cares for us let me just say this to you in that feeling God always cares God always cares I want you to just drive this down say it with me my God always cares when your phone can't reach nobody where nobody has said anything to you over the last couple of weeks and it seems like that they've avoided you that's just the devil telling you that that's just the devil telling you that but my God is always with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I will be with you whether you can see him or whether you can feel him he is in control of your situation [Applause] never give up say it with me never give up the scripture says that I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me as long as you were a spectator and not a real part of serving God the devil was all right with that I want to drive some points as long as you were a spectator [Music] people can go to a ball game they can cheer but they've never lifted a weight they've never run a mile they've never been hit like a car hitting them men in their greatest conditions struggling over a ball LEDs are destroyed concussions happen people can sit in the stand and make fun they can Monday Morning Quarterback all but they didn't put nothing in a lot of people can Google and say all different kind of things but they haven't said in these seats [Applause] foreign even sitting in these seats if you don't come to worship if you don't come to pull on the word of God you're not going to get anything out the very moment that you start serving God and Raven in your head and worshiping the Lord all hell will break loose as long as you set like a mouse in the church and there's no movement from you whatsoever the devil's not going to bother you too much but the moment that you have a breakthrough how about help me preach the moment that you have a breakthrough where you break through in prayer will you break through in worship where you break through and get something from the word then the devil is going to do his best [Applause] sometime a gold there was brother Brian was sharing this story and it's long but I want to I gotta it's got a point to it some time ago there was up here in Indiana there was two boys that was raised on a farm they were just as poor as they could be Farmer Boys they grew up together and one day one of them got married a few days afterward the other one got married the one went to the city to live and he had begun to play the stock markets and got away from his childhood teaching went into wrong things he played them and he got richer and richer and so they finally become a millionaire he had moved up to Chicago and got one of those great one of those great streets and built himself a palace him and his wife running to the nightclubs and they drank cocktails and they laid out all night long they had butlers everything to furnish them anything they wanted they thought they were really living but a man that lives like that has no peace there is no peace in a troubled heart to a sinful heart there could not be peace from man longs to drink and he calls that life he thinks that he's having a big time and he shows his emptiness you take a man that make a million dollars he wants to you take a man that goes to a party and drinks one drink tonight he'll want to go to another you take a man that lives untrue to his wife once he'll live it again he said it's something that he's never satisfied might have a million dollars in his hand and 10 million in his hand and he lays down at night with a drunken stew on him and he wakes up the next morning haunted nightmares troubled Minds him you call that peace that's not peace but a man might not even have a pillar to press his head to he might not even on a p a decent pair of shoes or be able to have a decent meal in his house but if God Reigns in his heart he goes to bed happy and he wakes up happy it's lasting peace it's something that God does this fella forgot about that teaching he went to gambling and when Christmas time come he he thought of his buddy he wrote he wrote him a letter and one of his names was Jim Rich Man and John a poor man and wrote him a letter John I wish you'd come and see me through the holidays I I'd like to meet you and talk to you again I haven't seen you for many years he wrote him back and he said I'd like to come Jim but I can't come I haven't got any money to come a check came in the mail a few days later come on I want you to come so John got ready country boy put on a clean pair of overhauls his hat little coat different color boarded the train and when he got there there was a chauffeur sitting there to meet him and with a big limousine I didn't even know exactly how to act he got in his limousine holding his hat in his hand and looking around drove up to a great place in Palace in Chicago he got out and he went to the door and rung the bell and out came the butler and he said your card please he didn't know what he was talking about he handed him his hat he didn't know nothing about no reception card he didn't have much of the world's good and he said I I want your card he said I don't know what you're talking about and Jim Jim sent me a letter to for me to come that's all I know he went back in and told the man and he said who hadn't got out of bed yet it's a funny looking man standing at the door he's dressed I've never seen him a man dressed like that and he said Jim sent him he said tell him to come on in he slipped on his bathrobe and he went down the hall and he met his old country friend and of his and shook his hand and said John you don't know how glad that I am to see you oh country fellas standing there looking around in the room said Jim you sure got a plenty now he said I want to show you around and he took him upstairs and they went out on the sun porch and opened up the window he said where's Martha oh she hasn't come in now she was out all night last night oh how how are you guys getting along oh not much John how are how are you and Katie doing just fine is she home yes we've got seven children you've got any children no Martha wouldn't have any of those children she thought we'd be better not having any children interferes with our social life raise back the curtains and said look to here you see that bank over you understand yes I'm the president in that bank you see that Railroad Company I've got a million dollars worth of stock shares in that look down there and seen great big Gardens and everything and how beautiful it looked and oh John stood there with his straw hat in his hand and looked around said that's fine Jim I'm sure thankful that you've got it but me and Katie we ain't got much but we still live in that old split Shingle House down there we don't have very much but we're awful happy just then a bunch of Carol Singers lifted their voices and began to sing silent night holy night all is calm and all is bright round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild Jim turned and looked at John John looked up at Jim and said John I want to ask you something you remember when we were boys we used to go with that little little red Church down there on the side of the road and we'd hear a Old Country choir sing those songs yes you still go down there yeah I still belong there I'm a deacon down there now what about you Jim you was talking about how much that you owned down here but how much do you own up there John I'm sorry I I don't own nothing that way remember just before Christmas one year we didn't have any shoes and we were more interested in getting some of some firecrackers for Christmas and we went out and set some box traps and caught some rabbits and we got some firecrackers for Christmas you remember that morning those big old wood rabbit was in the box trap of ours yeah I remember you were you would you would get some firecrackers and we went and got some and divided it with me yes John I'll divide anything that I got with you but one thing that I wish that I could divide to me I give everything to own I'd give everything I own if I could walk that little Dusty Road barefooted up to that little old church and feel the presence of the Living God when the choir was singing an old country preacher was preaching I didn't give anything I'd give all that I own everything to every share in that Railroad all my part in the bank even this home at all if I could turn again and have that blessed peace that I had when I was up that old road oh John took him by his arms around and said there was three wise men Rich that came and laid all at the feet of Jesus one time as a baby and they received pardoning for their sins I'd although I'd I'd think that you're wonderful Jim and in all that you have been blessed to do and all these things but I'd rather have a wife and seven children living down there in straw tips to sleep on then then have and have peace that's in my heart than to have all of your riches and that's right friends riches is not measured out by dollars riches is not measured out by big names and popularity riches is when the kingdom of God has come into your heart and change this emotion and made him a new creature in Christ Jesus and give him eternal life that's the richest thing that's on Earth brother Branham told this story and no doubt took him some time to tell it and it took me some time to read it to you but I have a reason to do it if you gain this whole world [Applause] if you gain this whole world and lose it all what profits you you're gonna have millions of dollars in the stock market and let it fall and all of a sudden your half is rich you can't control the stock market you can't control nature you can't control governments you can think that you own it all and in a day or two it all be gone the depression proved that many people that were Rich became pulpers and only to commit suicide because they didn't have it anymore but how many of our families live through the depression no stocks in the market no great riches in the bank but because they had Jesus my daddy said I thought everybody else lived like I did didn't know a depression was going on we just knew we was poor I'd rather have Jesus than anything brother Branham said at many a table that was of wealthy people there was he was entertained by a lot of people that was had great wealth but let me just say he would rather have an atmosphere to where the angel would come have a suit that would have a hole in it drive an old car and sleep up under that car at Mishawaka get some stale biscuits he would rather be with Jesus and where Jesus is than to own it all let me just say this heavens and earth is going to pass away all right this story it didn't have to be that way Adam hiding in the garden Demas forsaking Paul for popularity and riches it didn't have to be that way the Rich Young Lula it didn't have to be that way God provided a way even God provided a way for Cain if you'll do like your brother it didn't have to be that way for the young girl on the porch it didn't have to be that way how many peoples have had friends that walked into churches like ours and one received Christ and another make fun it didn't have to be that way maybe you'll have to walk away from many friends in your life but if your friends are drawing you to the darker Realm they're not your friends this may be an ugly thing to say but they're not your friends a man that will pull a beer to your your mouth it's not your friend a friend that'll give you drugs and alcohol they're not your friends here we go they're not your friend it may feel good for the moment but they're not your friend they won't be there when sirosis of the liver is set in they will be there when your brain cells are gone and you don't know your own name people are scared to death to go to the doctor they're scared enough to get a shot but they'll take drugs from God only knows where they came from mixed up in some lab somewhere or another just to get an artificial High they're not your friends are somebody that will stick closer to their brother friends or somebody that will forgive you and overlook your mistakes that will be there at the end to help you get up that's your friends good morning Noah like the people of today they realize the world's coming to an end I'm not telling you no secret whether you've heard a message of brother branham's or not this world's coming to an end you can put your head in the sand and ignore all the signs and quit watching CNN or Fox News or whatever your favorite channel is you can cut all of that off it's coming to an end governments are so corrupt there's no great men among them anymore there's no Abraham Lincoln or No George Washington to raise back up they're searching the country for somebody to step up and give us the answer there's no answer Jesus [Applause] a place where he has prepared for you will walk on Gates of streets of gold and Gates of peril that's a king that's the politics I want to be a part of brother bam says Oh What a Sad thing it's going to be for the Lost that after they have sealed their Doom after they've heard their last sermon and to be in a devil's hell lost no chance to repent at all now notice his statement to remember the opportunities that they turned down you say unto me preacher is there Remembrance in hell yes Jesus said there was and he said the rich man lifted up his eyes in hell and saw Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and he said remember in your lifetime there is a remembrance in hell oh how the Lost what an awful thing that that would be to know that the great meetings that you set in and heard Mighty sermons of anointed preachers of God and not only that to but to see anointed signs and wonders that God had performed among the people and then to remember all of these warnings now be lost it would haunt them forever it didn't have to be that way a young girl was a was an actress she was an actress in Hollywood and she was making her way up played in a movie with Elvis Presley one of the leading ladies and when those directors and those men wanted her to pay the price behind the scene she went back home to her Godly mother and said I don't need that and she wound up in brother John Steven's church and brother Danny Stevens and I was able to sit with her many times at tables and we would talk what a reward [Applause] you know when you come down to die 93 years old and being the most sexy woman in the world there's a price for that there's a price for that but it didn't have to be that way Marilyn Monroe whom brother Brandon would see dying he would detail how she died science didn't say that but he would tell how she died all the men celebrities presidents that didn't satisfy the sinful heart but he said if I could have only got to her and introduced her to Jesus [Applause] it didn't have to be that way I stood at the place in West Virginia where Elvis Presley stood and led singing and his Granddaddy's tent meeting but when it came it's time to die he actually had three different preachers come to him and told all three the same story I have sold my soul it didn't have to be that way brother brother Aaron Oglesby that will be with us a couple of times this year his father and mother separated decades ago they couldn't get along there's sometimes people or sometimes people can't get along with Jesus they had children three children two boys and a girl one was poisoned in this way and poisoned in that way brother Aaron was a very stable young man he didn't take sides he grew up in that atmosphere of a broken home horrible words no doubt backwards and forwards there's you know there's always three sides to every story his side her side to right side [Music] most the time it's selfishness it's just plain selfishness if you listen this is how marriage really works if you can lay your pride down and become humble and serve one and I'm not talking about 90 10. I'm not even trying to get you to be 50 50. but make Jesus the center of your home [Applause] and he's the king he's the Lord he's the Unseen guest at every table talk to him when you get up talk to him when you go to bed have a place that you pray Aaron's father is dying of a horrible stage four cancer he's been in church for about the last 20 years he sets in one place his wife sits in another he sets a very quiet man I'm sharing this story I didn't call to get permission but it's okay it goes with this brother Aaron prayed the other day he said my daddy's in the facility he's dying brother Tim's going to see it and he said God let my mama show up at the same time what do you know prayers come true and brother Tim being a preacher I'll be an anointed man of God one of my favorite preachers on Earth and I you know brother Ron you're supposed to have favorites you're a liar and he shows up and something Supernatural happens he marries this couple that has thought all these years and lived apart all these years and caused all kind of toxins and poisons and on his death bed he marries his wife what good is that going to do it'll do a lot of good when they Step Beyond the curtain of time and they stand and eternity together what God has put together let no man put asunder and they step back into eternity together it has caused a healing it has caused a restoration to that entire family all the words are now laid aside all the herd is now laid aside and now God has brought a healing I pray God raises the man up takes the cancer out of his life and they live another 10 years to the Rapture together my God can do anything [Applause] I want to say something to punctuate that it didn't have to be that way I have a friend came with me to church there's an artist he's now he's now over top the ominous magazine in New York he married the owner's doctor daughter and I read that story for a reason I don't know how many millions of dollars that my friend now makes but I wouldn't change I wouldn't change what God's done for me in my life standing here with the cancer that's really my body and the headache that's taking place in my my my head right now wiping with a wet rag to get through this God spoke to me to preach and I'm going to preach it trade my life for all the things of this world brother Graham said the choices that you make here today if you want to be a real Christian five years from now you can be a real Christian or you can choose difference and five years from now being hell okay I've said it before I say it again take a picture of your life you're beginning your journey right here in this service not only is God here but the devil's here he will try to bore you he will try to get you distracted on what you're going to eat after a while or or whatever that's going to happen this afternoon or or the friends that you're missing right now that maybe is not here and maybe cause you because of Pride to keep you from walking to the altar I've said this many times the greatest steps you'll ever make oh it's the first couple that will get you out of your Pew and walk you to an altar and tell the devil you're no longer the king of my heart I'm no longer a slave to you in a moment your life can change and the old King dies and a new king takes over old habits are gone the new creature takes over in your life Hallelujah aren't in the opposite of that you can receive a spirit whether it's a critical spirit a lustful spirit the devil will only talk you into smoking a cigarette one time he'll only talk you in to looking at porn one time and then your flesh will take you back there over and over again but you say brother Ron and I know I'm only talking to maybe one or two here today but I'm probably talking to a lot on the internet virgin brother come on what would you trade for eternal life Which side will you choose a job that pays you two hundred dollars an hour that takes you away from church takes you away from God takes you away from your family takes you away from your children I want to say this to you now as I set where I'm sitting I love to hear my little grandchildren all the noise that they make I love to hear them make their noise I love to hear them play I love to have them crawl up on my lap and tell me how much they love me there's nothing in this world I trade for that thank you brother amen Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God he had a choice he could have been pharaoh sure Ramses was there but pharaoh before him chose Moses over top of Ramses lot stood with Abraham and he chose the well-watered plains of of Sodom never seeing it being destroyed never thought it would take him to be the mayor of the city he never ever thought that in a very crucial hour he would offer up his virgin daughters to this homosexual perverted crowd to save his own skin Abraham a vagabond and God's speaking to him and him telling him that I've had visitations was not enough to hold lot had aspirations of being somebody in life but look where it took him look where it took him even angels coming taking his daughters and his wife and even in their escape Miss lot turns and looks back of all of the women in the scriptures Jesus calls her remember light's wife and if you'll just think of this just for a moment he's talking about her age he's talking about this Sodom and generation that we live in if you can't see the Rapture coming you're not looking and if you can't see that just any day the Lord's going to come back you're just not looking but brother on Someday I'm listen let me just say this to you like The Sword and it's hanging over my head let me just say enjoy every day that I've got every day appreciate every day but let me just say the sword of resurrection and rapture could happen today I I someday want to preach on the Left Behind there are some instructions that people need to have it's instructions for people that couldn't get their self to church hahaha they couldn't fall in love with God enough but because they see your bodies changed it does something to them that they will walk into a tribulation period and they won't just go to church but they'll have to give their life maybe paying tithes here was too much but they're going to have to give their blood maybe maybe Los Angeles drop into the ocean was a fairy tale but after it happens I after the water is coming up on the ark everybody's a believer of the rest is dropping bombs [Applause] on our American soul you know as long as the battle is taking place in the Ukraine it doesn't affect us too much but let them drop a bomb on your house am I driving my point well brother Ron what if what is the credit to serving the lord can I have five more minutes peace a good family a wife that you can trust a husband you can trust you don't have to search his phone to see if he's doing nonsense [Music] give me this five minutes is going to be tough but you hanging down you don't have to look at his computer and see if he's going to the wrong size you don't find the wrong pictures there you know the man that's leading you in prayer and reading scriptures let me just say you know that man lives right he talks right he walks right and the presence of God flows through your home oh come on we're here I'll take that I'll take that I'll take that young boys you're going to make choices in life that two-bit floozy will not make you a good wife I could use another word shall not make your Good Wife if she'll sleep with you before marriage you'll sleep with somebody else before marriage you're married and you're having trouble and then as Satan will send you a trap don't you think that that woman that wants to sleep with you a man she slept with a dozen mom listen marriage has some tough roads in it it's roads where you get sick and all of a sudden you're the nurse roads where you're watching your husband throw up repetitively over and over laying in the floor screaming and it was for better for worse my cousin had a baby and that baby was born perfectly but it caused her to have a stroke she was almost an envelope at the rest of her life but that man that said I do for better for worse when he saw her in a stroke condition he walked away and my uncle and Aunt took care of her until the day she went home to be with the Lord he didn't love her he didn't love her long and short he didn't love her neither does a man love a woman that he beats on or he speaks too harshly all the time listen you can't say you love your wife when you treat her bad I don't care how how difficult things get in life turn to Jesus [Music] [Applause] brother on but I hang with my buddies you know my buddies and us we got a lot to do let me tell you who your best friend and your best buddy better be sister Connie would you stand up right there is my best buddy right there's my best friend right there knows everything that there is to know about me we do not keep secrets and I don't hide nothing from her come on we have raised three wonderful children and now attempting to help raise six more grandchildren we will do our very best to spoil our grandbabies that's what the prophet told us to do and I plan on doing what the prophet said do I didn't have to read Dr Dobson's book about how to raise a child foreign and I don't believe in children misbehaving in church out of church in school I believe they ought to act right your job is to raise your children and train them up you don't have to raise a brat little brats become big brats and big brats can't get jobs and can't can't have relationships that work out because they never got it fixed at two years old [Music] oh my brother Ron that's so cute what you're calling cute is actually a deficiency just a couple more minutes [Applause] how many teachers and school workers do we have here I'd like for you to stand thank you could you stand now whether you work in a cafeteria whether you're the give them a great big hand here these people don't go to school to make kids miserable they don't pick out on Tuesday Morning seven o'clock on their way to school I'm gonna make Johnny so miserable today I'm going to treat him like dirt I'm going to teach him a lesson of life these people got gifts in their life they can put up with kids that old brother Ron can't put up with you I didn't mind diapering my children but I'm not necessarily wanting to adopt her yours and these people picked a profession knowing that every one of the children that sat in front of them some of us not going to get it but one day the light will come on you've heard the story told about Thomas Edison he got sent home a letter and they didn't want him back again because he was mentally she taught that boy and that boy became a genius but it didn't have to be that way can you imagine being the coach that looked down the line of men that was setting before him eighth graders setting before him and he picks Johnny doe over Michael Jordan yeah yeah come on come on come on if you don't know who Michael Jordan is God bless you thank you for living in a cave somewhere another I would imagine I would imagine that guy has looked back many times and thought what we could have had if I'd only took a little time to develop him so no matter where you're at listen to this sermon give your pastor a break give him a break not everybody's Angels ready for the rapture some of them has been sent right straight from the region of Hell to torment the man's life and yet God put a special amount of Grace in his life because he knows there's a potential of God living on the inside of them and one day the light will come on if they stay there long enough and if the atmosphere will get just right the unbeliever will no longer be an unbeliever but he become a real believer the critic will be a praise worshiper [Applause] Hunter how many think you people was in your class that failed in law school they probably went to school eight ten years to become a lawyer there was days that you felt like quitting in that right there was days that you said I I've chose the wrong profession there was probably never a day that you said I want to be a school teacher Timmy I'm done I'm done this is all free now you wrestle with one of the greatest decisions it's ever been and you came in this office and the Lord spoke to you move Amy had already made up her mind but you see what benefits you now benefits your children and here you have a future daughter-in-law that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and we'll marry in a few days I know it ain't been announced yet but I'm really happy to do it you guys haven't even asked me yet I don't think but might want to get that done leaving a job was hard leaving your homeless heart if it was easy everybody'd do it but you decided one day the cost out has benefits to it and I got to be where my children will live yes I don't lose my children there's a lot of things that you will live through but your children won't Devin you probably thought some of us was the craziest people on the Earth it was quite a little while before you heard me preach you thought the pastor here was Andrew you were right probably some of your friends probably said this to you are you serious you're going to church and you're enjoying it the other night I watched you rejoice and shouting you know he probably looked at yourself probably a year ago I'll never do that I never do that God made a difference in your life you could have went on in life and did the things that you were doing I don't know your history but I got a good idea but you could say this morning as I'm preaching this sermon didn't have to be that way TJ this is a lot better than playing pro ball being my next door neighbor is probably a little bit sometimes stinks but it's better than living beside of a palace somewhere another rich people that won't wave at you it didn't have to be that way but you made a choice Laura you made a choice you thought you were marrying a cowboy I remember that I remember she told me that I want to marry a cowboy you ride a horse and some of you thought Lord I'll never get it and yet you watch her rejoice there was a lot of probably a lot of people that thought you you'll never get it Ron you'll never get it you'll never make it brother homer I'm going to finish with this brother Homer said I was going to live right for at least six months because everybody told me I couldn't remember him telling that he said I was determined I was going to live right for six months and somewhere in that six months he got the Holy Ghost and an attempt made and a preacher walks back and gives him a Bible and tells him you're going to need this nobody in that tent would have called Homer Frazier to be the pastor of this incredible Church but they couldn't see what God saw but they didn't have to be that way let's stand to our feet this morning can I close with One More Story I took a picture this morning of a a young man that about six two I don't have his weight in front of me he was driving a truck and he come up on two angels out of control and he hit the back of their car destroyed their car towed their car completely up on a bank 15 16 feet and what do you know he comes up and asks her are you guys all right and then he escapes the scene God would have two women to come and open the door and one of them would say I'm a nurse and I'm going to stay here with you those two nurses were not the only ones in the car there was actually angels that knows how to spin a car in a certain way almost like a roller coaster and then put you up on the side and then help you to catch your breath and Sister Evelyn got a scratch on her hand there's people that fall off of a three-foot ladder and die I know it because a friend of mine did it Standing On Top of three three foot ladder cigarette in his mouth fell down on that ladder and it crushed his ribs he walked out and finished his cigarette and he died before he got his cigarette done let me just say this to you if God is on your side it's the best choice that you ever made in your life God who is rich in Mercy maybe you're sitting here this morning maybe on the internet you're in between a choice [Music] sometimes decisions are forced Crossroads come in your life brother Branham would look at Billy Paul and say Billy stretch out your arms and he said Billy you're in a Crossroads explain to him that I can't make your choice for you son of a prophet the prophet couldn't make a choice for him it was now his turn he was a man of age now [Music] Billy had to make a choice like I made a choice our heads bowed just

health issues but I've never looked back I've never regretted my choice I could look around and thank God for peace in my life the spirit of the Lord brooding over our lives this church is not an accident [Music] it's been an atmosphere that we have chose to make an atmosphere here where Jesus is always welcome [Music] we laid aside our pride we laid Assad all of our indifferences we laid our rocks down not to throw at one another but to help one another to strengthen one another [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus [Music] I'll take that choice today [Music] Hallelujah [Music] sister Melissa
