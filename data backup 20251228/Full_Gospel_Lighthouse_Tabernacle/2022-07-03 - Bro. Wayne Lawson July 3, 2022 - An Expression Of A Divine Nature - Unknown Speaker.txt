remember brother joe bran brown's mother sister louis passed away this past week so we want to be remembering brother joel brown's family there we want to continue to remember sister denise schifflett that guy would just touch her body and her back there i want to be remembering brother david kegley and the family as his mother passed away this past week as well and they just lost his father here recently as well so just be remembering that family and that church there how many would have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up to the lord this morning we know god can meet and see each and every one of these requests this morning my ass brother gabriel spencer if he would just come lead us to the throne of grace this morning just gonna give a quick testimony just make it short just two weeks ago i was doing my job just as i normally would and when i took the job i knew i was going to be in dangers and between the people i'd come in contact with but regular traffic and as i stopped the truck you came close happens all the time they pull on the white line you can't they can't get over this driver could have gotten over but he stopped in the white line i went up and was going to tell him just to move up onto the shoulder and as i was walking back to my vehicle traffic was pretty heavy that day and two tractor trailers they ended up wrecking right beside me in the in the two lanes right beside me and the truck in the left lane that got hit um locks it up in the left lane which caused all the other traffic to come to a halt stop and as they came to that stop there was a tractor-trailer that went right by me in the right lane i'm standing on the rumble strips of the interstate that tractor trailer goes right by and as it goes by there's a fedex tractor trailer that he turned from the left lane to shoot to the shoulder well the problem was if he's going to the shoulder that's exactly where i'm standing at so as i see it coming i turn and i see him start to jackknife and i've seen plenty of these wrecks enough the trailer ends up flipping and coming into the end of the truck and it just ends up being a massive accident and so i just turned i didn't run i didn't i didn't cry out for help at the time i knew god he sends his angels around us at all times even when we don't have a chance to cry out to him and so i just turned i said well this is it this is it and i turned and just started walking away that way i didn't get hit hit head on in my face i'd take it in the back and so as i started walking forward i got about 10 feet from that the front of the truck i was out with to get around to the other side and that tractor-trailer laid black marks down right in front of the tractor trailer i was out with and if i would have took off running that truck would hit me as i'm trying to round the other truck but god kept me safe so if you end up seeing me act a little crazy as some may say you know why you may say well what's going on with these other people they didn't face a life a life ex death experience well what you're seeing is people who've lost chains chains and they realize that that they don't they don't have to fear that second death because god's came and changed their life and they're just breaking forth in a miriam dance as she turned around and she saw all her enemies drown it in the red sea so if you would just take each and every one of these needs in prayer and if you need something if there's a unspoken prayer request that you need that you haven't spoken out just know that god's right there with you you don't have to speak it to anybody you can speak it directly to your heart because we have one way direction one we can speak directly to jesus christ himself gracious heavenly father lord i just ask you to just come down in this service we thank you for coming and being with us last night you anointed the speaker in a mighty way that he could just speak directly to our needs and we know that we can come directly to you with each and every need that we have inside of our heart lord jesus because you have came down and you are a kinsmen redeemer and we know that you came and if there was if you didn't come we would there'd be no other way for us to be saved we cannot save ourselves we cannot heal ourselves but we can come and speak directly to you lord and i just ask that as as these prayer requests are spoken forth i just ask that you will just come down and be the comforter we see brother ray erickson's church there and the loss of loved ones all around and it seems if it's almost every other day or every other week there's something else drastically happening in a tragedy lord jesus but you we know that everything happens for the good and the glory of you lord and we just give everything unto you and we just ask that you will send that comforter to them in these moments we don't have all the answers we don't ask for all the answers because we know that we are just leaning and trusting on you to bring us bring us that comforter and come to us just as you said you would and as we see here these needs come across the pulpit lord we see that demon of cancer as he tries to rise up and one other person one week and then another person in the next week lord jesus we know that that's just satan anointing the cells within side of our body that that they would just die and they would continue to grow and grow until it becomes a life issue a life that and sometimes doctors don't know what to do with that thing but lord jesus we're we are relying on you you are the true doctor that can come and touch every need and you know exactly how to go in there and wipe and destroy each and every one of those cancerous cells because we know it's nothing but from hell itself and satan has came up and tried to destroy the bride because he knows he knows his times is up lord and i'm believing that that cloud of fear that covers those that that may have just found out the diagnosis will just leave lord and we're just believing that you can just come down and touch and heal each and every one of our lives you know the unspoken request you know the spoken request and the sick that lies here within the building the sick that lies lies on the internet and the airways that that they are listening in just looking in for a nugget to continue to press forward in their battle because sometimes we're not on our mountaintops we're in the valleys lord and i just ask you will just draw us higher give us a word of word of encouragement when we are down lord and i believe in that you will just anoint the congregation anoint us so we can move into the presence of your speaker you know the inspiration that he's under this morning and you know what he's coming to bring and that's not of himself but he's kind he's coming to bring a word of you and i just ask you to just anoint him in a mighty way to speak directly to our hearts and we thank you for what you are doing in jesus name we pray [Music] amen at this time we're going to receive this morning's offering remember the joshua the denny if they'd come to receive the offering this morning amen as i said a little earlier there we're going to have a natural meal so after service this morning we're going to be meeting at spotswood high school for a meal and some games and stuff so just be remembering that brother angel will give you some more details a little bit later but this morning we're just going to enjoy the word amen amen maybe brother uh stephen short prepared to come sing for us this morning if you would and

people got an idea who was around there in those times and they saw that old arkansas boy come up to that altar that night and he never was the same after that they might have not knew what happened but they knew something happened amen because there was some change has come over me amen i thank god this morning that he is still a life-changing god he's one that can take whatever situation you're in and change it and put it back amen and give you the grace that you need to get through it amen amen i want to say it's a real honor to be here today in real grace you can have your seats just for a minute thank you amen i'm just i'm under commission here this morning to say some things to you all from the folks back home we had so many people that had planning to come and we had some deaths and the families of the church there so they they're not able to come this weekend one of them is our of course our brother chuck collins and sister debbie amen they they lost their their son charlie in an explosion there charlie and rachel i know you all know about it but it was you know i i think sometimes we look around at things and we think we can only see the bad in it but i was just speaking on a little scripture the other night and the prophet said you know when you come to be a christian he said there's no promise of an immunity from problems he said but see the scripture actually does promise that problems will come he said many shall be the afflictions of the righteous he said but never forget to look at the other part of that scripture it said he shall deliver us out of them all so you can't get on one side of that you have to also look at he'll deliver us of them all but i've seen god take the situation there with charlie and rachel and actually used it uh to during the just after the memorial service brother danny steeman stuck around and spoke for us on the sunday morning done a tremendous job god so uses brother danny we love him so much he's a he's a real man of god and uh so he was speaking that morning and one of the families um that had been uh brother tom actually uh the tom's sister sharon sproles has got an older son and a wife and some family and maybe a couple weeks before that they had just started coming back around the church a little bit been out of church for years and and they were actually coming around a little bit and that sunday morning but danny was speaking and and they come up as a family and the sister came up and she said brother wayne she said we we've been coming around a little bit she said but just through these things we just realized how important it is to give our lives to christ and and to to get a home church and to be in and she said i'm just wondering if the church would receive us back that we could come home and it's on video you know and i actually just welcomed her home and the church welcomed her home and and her little family there and i walked around the back and was able to shake hands with thomas he was in the back of the church there and he hugged my neck and told me how much it meant to him and he was looking so forward had actually just changed he'd actually just change jobs so he could be at church on thursdays and sundays he said i i he said it's more important than anything else he said we had to move out i think they actually moved in with brother tom and brother tom actually were coming to these meetings and brother ron was there a few weeks ago at our church he actually invited some of the people these a lot of them haven't been down and they really wanted to come and visit and i don't know if y'all know it's a secret but ron spencer's a rock star in ohio he's a he's a very loved man um i i'm afraid he might be that way a lot of places but uh but he's a he's a very uh loved man there and brother tom called me a few days after brother ron left he just you know tom called and he said by the way he said i want to come to them meetings he said but i have to be honest he said we just don't have the funds right now he said but i've made a decision he said i'm just going to sell my gun he said i'm going to get enough money to come down there and he did it he did he sold a real nice gun and he put back the money he said we got our rooms man they were ready to go and then and then just you know last sunday two weeks now uh they lost their son or it's just a week ago i guess they lost their son in an accident after the meetings they had a wedding in the evening and tom and his wife melissa they were actually the ones that were dedicated there and they were on their way home in a a car a drunk driver passed and got right in their lane and there was a head-on collision and everybody in the car was okay except for thomas and he was killed on the impact which was tom's son and so tom called me and and we were talking we actually were in is it okay we were we were in pigeon fours just the brother ron us was that down there we were just visiting and got the phone call and brother brother tom says to me uh i think he talked to me about three minutes there and telling me about it he said can you please tell brother ron i'm not gonna be able to make the meetings so it was the first thing on his heart you know is that he wouldn't be able to be here so i want you all to pray for brother tom and his family because he really wanted to be in these meetings this weekend and maybe maybe maybe next year he'll get to come down and fellowship and be a part and you all keep him in prayer and the family and i'm supposed to give you greetings from the whole church and brother uh brother ray of course and the family there brother erickson has said god bless you all and greetings and so we we certainly been going through a lot there but you know uh what we found out is that god amen ordains our paths and there's nothing can come our way unless he allows it and if god allows it he's already got a way to deliver us from it so we're walking with a great shepherd and trusting his every move and knowing amen that this is this is an ordained path and we can't never forget why we're here right we're here to get the character in our lives that it takes to rule in a millennium amen this is a proving ground for us now what we've found is though is along the way of course there's some heartaches of course there's some things that we don't know how to interpret or whatever but we know god's got it all in control but you know god gives us those little blessings along the way he he just gives us nuggets and and and blessings and miracles in our lives and i'm blessed today to have uh my family with me gracie and brian wasn't able to be here and they send their greetings to you all but i've i've been a blessed man i've got three children they're all serving the lord filled with the holy ghost love this message serving god right with us and and and brother if you don't think that's a blessing that's the greatest blessing that i know of and and god's given us good in-laws and y'all know that's a miracle right amen and we've got we've got wonderful in-laws and we love them and and uh and the holy spirit's been so good to us it was just uh just a couple years ago that anna and zach was having such a terrible time uh trying to have a baby they were having miscarriages and there was all kinds of questions about whether they were going to be able to or not and and i they were living there in the basement zach works as a nurse and he was gone at nights and so anna was staying there and and you know they just started staying around living there in the basement and so i was there when they were praying and when they were getting disappointments and you know how that is it's just like a roller coaster and then and then the holy spirit just began to deal and one day they came brother ron actually was up at the church and they come in a prayer line and i was sitting there thinking i was standing beside brother ron was praying for some people and i was sitting there thinking lord if ann and zach could just come in this prayer line today i believe it would be you speaking you know and the next thing i know i looked up and here comes ann and zach and they come right down here and you know you tell these things but i i don't think we are to ever forget what the lord has done for us i don't think we already ever let the devil take away the reality that god has done miracles in our lives we never forget the tragedies we never forget the troubles but i don't believe we ought to ever let these blessings pass from our memory and you know i i was standing right there when brother ron looked over at sister anna and zach and when he looked at anna and he said you're going to have that child and i don't remember exact words but it was that direct you're going to have that baby anna and it wasn't but it wasn't but a while later of course then uh of course there's no baby coming and you know how the devil when god ain't speaking the devil gets the whispering you know and uh we were actually out at brother wendell martens working on a a parking lot and i was listening to a tape the spear lord just sit right there in the greater with me and he spoke to my heart you're going to have that grandchild and i thought thank you lord for the for the encouragement you know and then it just rocked along a little while and i came out here and preached for you all you all remember and i'm up here telling you i'm going to be a grandpa and everybody's like you got news and i'm like no it's by faith it's my faith and then brother robin's sitting right back there and he hollers they get it on the video and he hollers from the back and he said that's thus saith the lord brother wayne well later you know we found out he had a vision over the thing so he wasn't even guessing he knew exactly what was going to be happening amen he had that blessing and and so then of course then when the lord began to give and we started getting proof with with the test and then we started getting the ultrasounds and and all that was powerful but you know today i literally live with the reality of a fulfilled vision that's happened in my life and and i'll tell you right here today anna and zach sits here and there's little evelyn amen and god miraculously gave us this baby and we're thankful for it and we're going to tell the world god did it for us it was not an accident some little something didn't just change our god intervened and he changed the pattern of whatever was wrong and made it right again because he's that kind of god the god of elijah is still alive today he is still alive he's still moving in the church so i had this on my heart last year up at brother ed biscuit and brother tom ray there at their mount baker camp in the fall in august there and i had this on my heart and right at the end of it i was preaching on visions and talking about the experiencing of of being in the middle of something and not realizing it's a vision and you're in the middle of it and then one day you wake up and whoa this is exactly what the vision was and i started telling about this about this great miracle of evelyn and when i did i didn't know this but brother brian was sitting over there on the piano plane and they had just come through some tragic miscarriages and he said they were at the point of just completely giving up but there i stood with a testimony that almighty god can still change things when you're run out of hope when you've run out of chances when you've run out of testimony when you think it's all finished there's god on the scene to change the situation and when brother ron was there in jubilee meetings there amen he got up and made a testimony and put the picture of his little baby up there listen friends god's still alive and the reason we tell these miracles is because they keep moving and they keep going into other lives and somebody will walk up to me and they say brother wayne i heard that testimony and i believed it and here's the baby or here's the situation or this was healed or this was given because god is still alive we want to thank god this morning we want to thank you for every miracle that's been done in this church we want to thank you for every miracle that's been done across the land amen i believe in worshiping the god of miracles amen i believe we are to publish it we are to tell it we ought to tell it high and far and wide but our god reigns our god lives he's in the miracle business he's in the saving business don't give up hope if you've got loved ones and they're still breathing don't give up hope if you know somebody and it looks like they're outside of the grace of god don't give up on them the god that i serve is a god of first chances second chances third chances he don't quit till he gets what he's after he's the mighty god this morning we we owe him all the praise and the honor he is god and there

children have a lot of grand children and i get to sit in the middle of them and love them you know so that's a highlight for my life right there is to have my kids and grandkids around me and you know god has given mariah grace and brian i don't know how public it's been but but brian is uh brian and mariah is expecting another little girls coming along so i'm trying to work out how is it i'm going to put two on my shoulders but we're going to get her done we're going to get her done amen we thank the lord for his grace amen and second peter chapter 2 chapter 1 verse 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped isn't it amazing having escaped have you escaped having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we ask the lord to bless his words you could be seated this morning i want to speak to you from this context an expression of a divine nature an expression of a divine nature you know the beauty and the most rewarding thing of being a christian is to receive the nature of christ to have the nature of christ is a powerful it's a powerful thing it's the only character in the bible that could save souls that could change things and put them the back the way they were brother brandon said you can go through the whole bible and it's the only character that could save you moses couldn't do it elijah couldn't do it enoch couldn't do it no other character in the bible but the character of jesus christ which is the nature of god it can save us take us out of all of our situations now in the adoption part two brother adam will say this inside of that it was attributes which meant that he was inside of great elohim was an attribute now you know what an attribute is or let me say it like this it was a nature so inside of elohim was an attribute and brother bram says an attribute is a nature so an attribute see inside of him was the nature to be a father but he was self-existent so there's nothing to father by now down inside of that he said with something else that he was god and god is an object of worship but he was self-existent he was elohim so there was nothing to worship inside of that he was a savior and there was nothing lost to be saved inside of that he was a healer but there was nothing sick to be healed or nothing to be sick so now do you get the picture so his attributes his nature produced what is today so because that he was a healer something had to be sick to prove his healing never the will of god that you would be sick it's the will of god for you to know he's a healer amen without someone lost you would never know he's a savior so god never intended for man to be lost he intended for you to have the revelation that you're saved now that's the revelation of salvation in the future home brother branham will say this adam was a direct descent from god and you can only take the nature of your parent and when you were born again you take the nature of your parent of heaven and your parent of heaven is the attribute of the word see the word is the attribute of your parent how can you deny it see for a denomination amen now watch what he's saying the word is the attribute of your parents so whatever's in the scripture is the attribute of the nature of being a christian so like if you read something in the bible that's that's speaking of your nature it's a description of the character of jesus christ every scripture explains jesus christ so you're seeing his nature or his character being revealed now the grace of god is is that you as a believer have the same nature or character living on the inside of you so the word is the explanation of your attribute or your character i'll just say it like this the word attribute can be defined as such an attribute of god can be defined as an ascensional or a permanent characteristic of a nature see they're also called god's perfections individual attributes may be studied by themselves or considering how they relate to overall character of god so brother ram in identifying god by characteristics remember he said god's always supernatural that's how you identify until you you hunters you know i i remember as a kid we used to go quail hunting i shot a bunch of sparrows you know because i didn't know how to tell the difference and they just they were just birds you know hey man i thought i had me uh had me a pile but they were easier to kill than quail you know amen but but it's just a bird unless you know the difference you know but the difference is the character it's the it's the way that they fly it's a certain characteristic about them that you can tell the difference and he's telling us that the attribute of a christian is the characteristic of god there's a character there there's a spirit there of a christian now of course now in the easter seal brother branama really opens something up in john chapter 5 and 24 he that heareth my words and believeth upon him have passed from death unto life and shall not come into condemnation what is it he has eternal life he doesn't come into judgment he's already passed from death and to life then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from mortal to immortality now let me say this again when the spirit has found you this individual it comes upon you it is the potential of your internal inheritance that god thought of you and made you before the foundation of the world there is your potential like if you asked me for an oak tree and i gave you an acorn the life for the oak tree is in the acorn but you have to wait till it grows up so brother brahma is telling us when you receive the holy ghost everything that's going to be an oak tree is in you right then every now you look at that great big oak out there and he has that great big expanse and spread and you think my goodness amen how did that ever got there it got there because the life of an oak tree was put in the ground and the ability to get that talk was in the seed the ability to produce those leaves were in the sea now i know some people don't know the difference in the oak tree and a poplar you know what i mean amen takes a longer sometimes to know everybody knows the difference between pine tree and oak tree but an old tree in a pine tree are two different characteristics of the same life they're ones expressing one thing one's expressing another but you see the potential to do so i i've always said this god's a great big god can you imagine he's so but so big that he can become so small you you wait and you you put a seat in the ground it's an apple seed and you can put an entire uh tree in the ground in a seed can you imagine that amen you can you can dig a little bitty hole and get a great big apple tree out of that little bitty seed that you put in that hole you can let that apple tree grow up in every bushel of apple that ever is hauled away from that tree amen come out of that one seed god can put a hundred bushels of apple in one seed you try to cut that tree down after it comes to maturity and it'll take you a couple trailer loads of brush and wood to haul off a tree that god could give you and one seed see because he's god he can put the potential in a seed and so is it with a christian that god put the potential of everything that ever will happen as a christian in that seed life he put the body change in that seed he put attributes in that seed he put life in that seed it is the potential it is the earnest brother ma'am said the earnest of the potential is the quickening power of the resurrection when you receive the holy ghost it's dwelling in you the potential of it now you're on your way growing to full resurrection no tree comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the grace and knowledge of god you are baptized in the holy spirit and as a pentecostal church baptized into the holy spirit it begins to grow limbs are added they're pruning off but the tree is still growing it's still going because it's got to come to full resurrection it's got to come to full resurrection if you let that which is in you now grow it will grow into full resurrection it will give every attribute of it now a potential you know what a potential is and brother branham says it in that great message spoken word original seed pick up your pen and write how many remembers that he said as this church begins to near the headstone which we are he said when she begins to near the headstone he says what has happened he said they will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and he is and they are his subjects and the headship of christ so so the church will have the potentials of god at the time of the headstones because the church has grown into maturity means that the maturity of what christ was has returned back to the church that's why we're not just in justification or sanctification we're not even in the in the in the realm of the baptism of the holy ghost to reform the gifts we have taken the baptism of the holy ghost and brought on the extreme nature of jesus christ into the church of the living god that's why we believe that there's nothing that cannot happen in the church of the living god because we are not a baby church we are a mature church in the grace of almighty god now in the maturing process we must remember this we have already raised how many knows that the scripture says it we have already raised we have raised from the things of the world and we have went into the promises of god and we have his potential in other words we're raised up out of the things we used to be used to do the way we used to be we have raised out of it by a resurrection power and where we are this morning as a church as a people in the message of the hour as we're praying that famous prayer thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven we have come to the same place jesus was in the fact of maturity is brought us to full obedience to the word of god that's where we're standing we're not looking for ways around it we're not looking for ways to live separate from it but we have realized i and my father are one it's where the church has come i am my father one so the potential of the father is now being seen in the church now watch this beautiful prayer of jesus matthew 6 chapter 9 through 15. this is where the disciples themselves didn't know how to pray and they asked the lord said would you teach us to pray would you teach us lord how to pray now when jesus teaches you to pray it's something you should pay attention to he said after this manner therefore pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in earth as it is in heaven give us this daily bread and forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors now lead us not in temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and the very next words the lord says is for if you forgive me their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you now why has jesus put forgiveness at that level have you ever noticed this in perfect faith brother braham said forgiveness he says faith is based on forgiveness so when you come to the level of perfect faith there has to be a perfect forgiveness in jesus in matthew in mark chapter 11 in the middle of introducing the spoken word to the church he immediately stops and says if you have ought against any and look what he does he brings forgiveness in to the pattern because unless there is a complete open slate then then the very faith that we desire in this age is not obtainable if it's not complete forgiveness now watch the beauty of this he says now to forgive now many times you talk about forgiveness in a church now we're talking about a divine attribute you talk about forgiveness in a church and now any church or anybody and i'm i'm aware people are watching so it's just going different places but in any church or in any a conversation with any family with any situation you all have been through things and most of you have been through a lot of things some of you have have maybe have just been salvaged from some great tragedies in your life and many times i hate to say it but maybe it's even clashes with religious people and situations and sometimes leaves people wounded and hurt and great things happen to people in their lives and i believe honestly if if i were just taking a poll of the message of the hour across the nations and looking into churches i would say probably one of the most the one of the most hurtful spirits that there is that moves among the churches or the people is the spirit of unforgiveness i think it's the most damaging thing that i could think of standing in the platform today i don't believe smoking is just the big problems that we're having maybe maybe it's not alcoholism but it is a spirit that is just as detrimental to a family as it is an alcoholic or a dope addict or anything else because it will end up in the same result even if it's not viewed in the same level amen but in the spiritual world you can look into the realms and realize that forgiveness is there now many times if there's something that is wrong it's because something has been done so like if someone's asking for forgiveness or needing forgiveness is because there has been something that has happened now i i know that i know this from personal uh experience now i'm going to preach from my heart this morning hey ben but there is sometimes uh things that happen let's just let's just give a definition of forgiveness forgiveness is a conscience or deliberate decision to release feelings of resentment or vengeance toward a person or a group that has harmed you regardless of whether they actually deserve forgiveness forgiveness does not mean forgetting nor does it mean condoning an offense now many people can't forgive because they think forgiveness is condoning let's just say that there's someone mistreats a child i think probably the worst thing that i could think of as a preacher is someone who abuses a child i think it's the worst offense could be done to any person in the world is the abuse of a child but if a child someone's abused a child they come to you and they ask for forgiveness for what they've done they want to correct their life as a christian we are duty bound to offer forgiveness to all men so we forgive but that does not condone what has been done it's only forgiveness so as amen that whatever they face as a punishment that's up to them but what i will not allow is i will not allow someone else's transgression to tie up my spiritual life where i can't sing or shout or preach or have a free spirit and love people listen i i want to put it out there very clearly amen that forgiveness is not for the person you forgive forgiveness is for the individual giving the forgiveness do you realize that when you forgive someone you have just released yourself from whatever they have done said how they've acted or whatever else has took place you are free whether they ever become free or not you are free because forgiveness is the thing god gives you to let you walk away from situations that are unfixable situations that could never help you but you could walk away from them amen now let me just say this i will never allow someone else to control my spiritual life i will not let somebody say enough bad things about me for me to walk away from jesus christ i will not let enough preachers criticize me to make me walk away from the platform so the only thing i can do to keep from being a bitter critical person is to say i forgive you whether they've asked for it whether they deserve it whatever happens the thing is i will not allow it to destroy me because it's destroying them i cannot i cannot control what people say about me i cannot control what people think about me but i can control how i feel about other people and i say i have no enemy i say i love every man i forgive every man i forgive every trespass because i am a son of the living god and an attribute of god is to forgive mankind that's what the attribute of god is i'm talking about real christianity i'm talking about mature christians you've got to learn how to shake off what the devil is trying to stick on to you you've got to learn how to shake it off and walk on and say god i don't know what's happening or what's taking place but father i will not stay in this place the enemy has tried to bring me now unforgiveness can we talk about it a minute this morning now what i'm talking about is the attribute of divine nature don't lose our subject unforgiveness breeds things so when someone says i can't forgive what you have done is you're creating an atmosphere and you're inviting other things now now i've got to say things simple because i'm a simple man but i'm a hillbilly i come from arkansas originally before lord transplanted me into ohio and we love we love the people in ohio they tell me somebody said here a while back how's it feel being a yankee i said i'm not a yankee now i'm just transplanted i got a stronghold in the north we laugh about it of course now but down in arkansas when i was a kid growing up we didn't have an air conditioner i know probably all you all know how that feels but now down in arkansas gets hot if we have one a little older we have one in the in the front room but at night of course all we had is that oh attic fan how many y'all grew up with the attic fan edo addict fan now it was a the real problem is three bedrooms so we had to measure you had to measure the windows to make sure nobody had their window up more than yours because you know i always thought my granddad had a house in the back of his head because he'd be back in his bedroom i'd stay night with him me and the cousin sneak out you know he always knew he'd haul her from his bedroom where you boys going how did he know it's because the attic fan was running and when you open the door it cut the air off in his bedroom took me years to figure that out so you always wanted everybody to have their you know the windows the same but but it was hot and you had to cover up with the sheets the most you could stand and a lot of times you couldn't stand the sheet because in the old summer nights they were not just hot but muggy i mean how many y'all have been in arkansas on the july night or august it's muggy i mean it can be 80 90 percent humidity it's like being in the amazon man i mean just muggy so you you don't have air conditioner so you can't cover up now what has happened is all night because your kids you're running in and out the door i always thought the only thing my dad could say was shut that door i thought for sure that's all he knew shut the door but but as kids we didn't really understand the repercussions of the open door until you laid down at night when you're running back and forth though you don't think a thing about it but dad knows night's coming and when night time come you go in there and try to lay down listen if you don't think that one person can make a difference spend the night with a mosquito he is a tormentor i promise you he is a fallen nature keep you up all night and you ain't got an air conditioner so you can't cover up now what i'm saying is whatever reason we was going in and out that door the mosquitoes didn't care the reason they just come through the door the devil don't care why that you open a door he just wants the door open but the problem is whatever reason you open the door other things come in through that door so sometimes you see things start in human they come right into christian lives and you think how did that get in those lives how'd that get there through a door called unforgiveness because someone hurt someone's feelings somebody said something to somebody some situation happened now yeah y'all know i'm telling you the truth amen and when that door is opened amen all of a sudden these other things come in so you never open the door for those things but those things got in anyhow so what you have to do is god gave us a way to keep that door off now ephesians chapter 4 uh paul tells us this he tells us in the fourth chapter the 30th verse grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speak and be put away from you with all malice be you kind to one another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you now look what he says grieve not the holy spirit do you know there are people now this this this verse here can have kind of a double meaning amen and and the exact meaning of it means that that that a man filled with the holy ghost can still grieve god now brother branham explains this in a message lamb and dove and he talks about grieving the dove away he talks about see as a christian your soul is sealed and it's always going to be sealed you're not going to gain or lose christianity what happens is your spirit is affected by the things you do so brother branham says if you grieve that spirit by some action or something he said the dove will go out and fly on a limb y'all remember that he said that devil go out and fly on a limb what you've done is you grieve that spirit away from you and then that's when you get sticky and nasty and mean and you do all kinds of things you never would have did it's because you grieved that spirit away from your life and brother brahm said now there's a way to get it back he said you just repent and that spirit will fly right back on your life and bring back that gentle sweet spirit right on the inside of you now listen we are not we are not wolves we are sheep so we're not going to be protecting ourselves we've got to be lambs if you ever take the nature that you have to protect yourself that you turn into a wolf and you start defending yourself from everybody and everything and it'll give you a nature that's not christian nature at all but if you're a lamb remember this we've got a shepherd and we do not have to protect ourselves our shepherd is our protector and he always will protect us so all we have to do is just let go and let god and not worry with it god will take care of it now people say to me all the time so by the way you talk about forgiveness a lot i do because the bible said as you forgive one another as christ has forgiven you so how how do you forgive someone you forgive them on the same level god forgives you now some of you sitting here today are forgiven people some of you like me have been forgiven a lot of things and any man that has been forgiven as much as i have been forgiven by my father i have a lot of forgiveness to give amen i literally before you even get it out of your mouth i've already forgave you before you even said it i've already forgave you because what i know is that i have been given so much it is very easy for me to give because i can forgive it is the nature on the inside now some people have men never even receive the holy ghost because of unforgiveness now one time a young man came in and counseled something with me he's trying to receive the holy ghost and he was telling me almost that it was god's fault he hadn't received the holy ghost and i got to talking to him a little bit and as we were in council we just sat and talked a while and we moved across different areas of his life and and a lot of times you know young people are suffering maybe with pornography or something going on on the internet and there and it's and it's a hang up for them and they can't get by it and get the holy ghost maybe sometimes there's a little something going on maybe in their life what they've done or hadn't done and you know there's there's multiple things there seems like it blocks people from getting the holy ghost so i was just walking with him through his life a little just searching and all of a sudden something come up about his childhood and his father and he and he said something about his dad and the moment he spoke his dad's name i felt the presence of god dropping the room i said now we've found the problem what's going on and he's began to talk to me a little bit and he told me how he'd been mistreated as a young man and the bitterness that was in his heart and i said brother i said i'll tell you this amen it's not a woman keeping you from getting the holy ghost it's not any habit of your life it's the bitterness that you're harboring in your heart against your father that's keeping you from going into the presence of god because god can't feel a heart that's full of bitterness you've got to get that out of your life he said brother wayne how do i do it i said you go to that mean no daddy of yours and you buy him a gift that you that you think that he would really like and let it cost you a little something and you go to him and give it to him and tell him you love him and you thank him for every meal he ever gave you forever payment he ever made for every day he ever went to work i said forget about the trouble the man raised you he fed you he housed you he got you to where you are amen and and when i said that he said i can't do it i can't do it now now he if he gets this it's all right amen i'd like him to hear it anyhow amen and right now today he's in a world of sin and messed up his life because he could not do a simple thing of letting it go out of his life now listen i know we look at a lot of problems amen but don't you overlook that bitterness that settles in lives and hearts and so many young people trying to get the holy ghost and they can't get above the bitterness that the old devil has put in them against being mistreated or how they were treated in a certain place or what they did or amen forget it anyhow it's not worth your life it's not worth your home it's not worth everything in your life let go of the thing and let god fill you with the holy ghost and god can change everything that happens around now now you say preacher i'm going to need some bible i love the bible don't you it's the potential of the church he said looking diligently lest any man would follow the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up would trouble you or have he says thereby many defiled thereby many of the file now watch this bitterness is a defilement don't let it spring up it's now here's the thing about bitterness it grows quicker than morning glory it grows quick you can be pretty good buddies with somebody and meet them out in the parking lot and not shake their hand right and before they get in the car they're already criticizing you because it springs up so quick now look at what paul was saying to us don't let it spring up and defile you now people say well brother wayne it's really you know it's just a little problem i have and it's not a real issue let me let me let me let me dig in a minute and christ the mystery of god revealed paragraph 86 if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sister you say lord don't never let me have the root of bitterness spring up because it will affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life can you imagine to let something in your heart to take christ out of it amen the poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred will take the holy spirit right away from you and it'll run him from the tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of god it'll drive it away from here it will hurt your pastor isn't that amazing now i'm going to deal with something just for a moment the spirit of bitterness goes right after the ministry every time sometimes when someone has a word of criticism i want you to stop and think about where it's coming from so preacher what are you doing i want to show you something if you hear something bad about a certain person don't ever hear it without looking at the source because the source may have a reason they're trying to tear down because that ministry is exposing ninety percent of the criticism with ministry generally is a spirit has been corrected and they don't take the correction and instead of taking the correction they turn and attack the vessel doing the correcting now i'm a preacher i know amen and the beauty of it is generally the ministry has enough grace that they don't go tell the whole church why they are correcting but the critical spirit makes sure they tell the church and they tell the world and they tell everybody everything it's because their intent is to destroy the voice that would correct them but watch what a prophet does he says now watch he said it will hurt the pastor it will hurt the church it will hurt the life don't you ever let a bitterness get in your soul it'll canker you i don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow i don't care what they think about you you love them anyhow now watch this because unforgiveness it brings bitterness unforgiveness breeds it breached criticism unforgiveness buried things in your life it starts as unforgiveness but it ends up something much different amen it ends up with families out of church now if you will poll it tonight or this morning i guarantee you there are families not just this church but all over the world there are families in this church didn't leave over doctrine they don't leave over worship they leave because they got their feelings hurt we've got families in ohio leave because they get their feelings hurt you got families in tennessee go somewhere because they get their feelings hurt you got people now i'm just going to preach to you this morning because the devil's the devil and we might as well just call that devil out don't i don't want to be uncomfortable let's make the devil uncomfortable it's it's and you can you can ask me and say was there a doctor no problem no sir uh was was was there some trouble spiritual worship oh no sir what was it well so-and-so said something to me and this said that and the next thing you know you see that a spirit is moved a family or moved a people out from under a good ministry to get them in a place where the devil can tell them anything they want they can treat them any way they want and there's nobody there a god called pastor is to beat the devil off of you he's to stand there and take his sword and smack that devil so you can live free that you can live hard that's why oh god have mercy can i preach can i preach amen that's why they they have replaced the ministry with tapes because no tape ever offends anybody they can shut it off because the tape don't look in your eyes and discern what's going on with you a tape don't take a text and walk down and say if you don't get that devil off of you you're going you ain't gonna get right now he meant because the tape has played to a congregation but a preacher is a man of god that sees a spirit moving in a church or moving on a life and he says i'm not going to let that devil take that family i'm not going to let that devil hold them people so he comes against the spirit and the devil turns all hell against him but as the church of the living god you are to be trained enough to tell that devil i'm on the side of the lord i will not side with criticism and bitterness oh glory be to god i say let the power of love fill this room let it fill every heart because that's what we're going to experience in heaven now i know i know some people it seems like to me that they just got your button you know uh i'm glad the bible's here i'm glad the potential's here you know it's like uh you look at a car a corvette you say it can go from zero to 60 and 0.2 seconds whatever it is i don't know but it's the potential of it right can it go and stop and go and stop electric cars got a potential of so far so you know that before you get it what the potential of it is right the potential of your ability to forgive is better than you think god god installed a christian as a as as a factory does a corvette he put a potential in you that can do more than you think it can but your potentials are recorded in the scripture and have told you what you're capable of if you just let god do it this is what you're capable of if god's driving your car look what he says jesus said unto them one time i i love it how peter peters he's the guy peter peter said lord you know about this forgiveness stuff who was it the other day said peter was wasn't aiming at the ear was that you [Laughter] he said he cut off his ear he said i don't think he's aiming his ear he's just a bad shot jesus is talking to peter of course and he's talking to peter about forgiveness peter said lord how much you know how much should we forgive he says well jesus said i say unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven well that's good for a month yeah yeah yeah that'd be good for a year 490 times a year that's better than one a day yeah we'll take that that's okay lord he said no 70 times seven a day now that is potential you have the ability within you to forgive a trespass 490 offenses in one day you are a powerful people now watch this 490 times meaning to me there's going to be a lot of offenses meaning to me if he built you this way there's a reason number one is many people are easily offended number two some people are just offendable there's some people some people says hello when you're offended i'm not really i'm not easily offended personally i'm really not you've got to let me know you're offending me i'm no dumb hillbilly you got to point it out to me otherwise i just think well i don't know what they meant with that and i just keep going you know it comes in handy sometimes you know i'm not really that offendable i'm really not but if you do offend me i'll forgive you now it means then that there's going to be a lot of offenses you could be offended up to 490 times in one day living in this earth now if you're a member of a church probably the chances go up offenses according to matthew 8 and 7 he says offenses woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs to be offenses come but woe unto the man whom the offenses cometh and look what he's saying unto us jesus made the promise offenses are coming can i can i just be real with you here a minute if you ain't been offended at the church you're gonna be if you haven't you're gonna be just hang around if the preacher don't get you the deacon will if the deacon don't get you the song leader will if the song leader don't get you one of the trustees well one of the truth somebody's going to offend you before you get done you you're going to be offended jesus said it's coming so offenses are coming but here's the thing god give you a way to deal with the offenses he said 490 times a day i can let offenses come into my life and they'll go out the exhaust 490 times a day i have the capacity for you to offend me 490 times and at 900 490 times and not have to carry one home at bed at night i have the ability to lay my head on the pillar at night not being offended or have been offended i can just go to sleep because i didn't let the sun go down on my wrath you are a great built church of the living god built so as offenses can come through you and out of you and not hinder the movement of the spirit of god at all i tell you what i love a church that knows how to worship i love a church that knows how to dance and shout and praise god i do i know there's a lot of people seems like it's plum it's offensive it seems like it's offensive to them well we're sorry brother amen but you recognize i recognize something about a church that knows how to rejoice knows how to shout what that means is you've learned how to put stuff aside and come to church because the devil's going to put enough on you to make sure you don't get here if you'll let him i was just talking to brother ron the other day we were down there i'm sure he probably told you as his church but we were down there holding that meeting with him with brother sean martin's meetings and he said he threw up on the way eight times stopped and throwed up eight times on the way his sister connie i guess it was said to him said well do we need to turn around and go back home are you sure you want to go he said no i want to go to the pulpit because i don't want the devil to learn that's all it takes to keep me out of the pulpit because if he learns that then i'm going to be throwing up every time church comes do you see what it is he wasn't allowing the devil to find a pattern in his life where he was stoppable i'm preaching to you now some of you are easy some of you only thing has to happen is somebody put a mean tweet out about you say a little something on facebook about you say a little something on instagram about you somebody don't shake your hand and you're all tore up and you don't even want to come to the house of god and the devil don't have to do more than that you're easy but what you want to do is become unoffendable say satan don't matter what you do don't matter what you say don't matter what happens i'm going to the house of god on sunday and i'll tell you what i'm not just going to go there and sit with my hands in my lap like a sour grape i'm going to stand up my feet and i'm going to shout glory i'm going to let every devil out of hell know you can throw everything you got at me but brother i'm going to keep coming i'm going to keep shouting i'm going to keep praising because i am built to please my god i am built as a son of the living god to not be stopped by some sinful little offense or trouble or trial i tell you amen i'll tell you this i don't want the devil to hold me under something so easy if he's going to get me he's going to be working brother it ain't going to be because somebody said a little something mean about me they made a video about me well they made one about your pastor too that just means we must be hitting hell good we must be a danger i tell you they say well if you don't quit preaching like that they're going to start doing this let me tell you i'm not going to quit preaching i'm gonna make more tapes than ever i'm gonna preach harder than ever i'm gonna speak more than ever i'm gonna talk about miracles and the power of god and divine gifts and a living jesus christ if you think you can stop us with a little mockery or making fun you have picked the wrong church you have picked the wrong preachers because we get up in the morning and say where you at devil were you at devil amen because you're looking for a devil to squash [Applause] now i wish we were divine all the time but the beauty of it is god built you not just divine he built you human so he built you to coexist with humanity and divinity at the same time there's a real powerful sermon you should look into it sometime on glo fish it's a powerful it's a powerful thought i don't have time to preach it this morning but but what it is is that if you want something to act a certain way and it's beyond its nature you have to give it another nature glowfish particularly they wanted in india to be able to identify poison water without test so they decided they would build a fish that when a fish was in the water you could look down at the water if that fish is glowing the water is undrinkable now that glow fish problem is there's no fish glow right so but they had it has to be a fish you can't use it if it's not a fish so they had to find a fish that has the ability to exhibit a dual nature so they go out in the ocean and find a jellyfish he's in the deeps and jellyfish glow they have a luminous so they took the luminous from the jellyfish and they inserted it in a little fish problem is finding one that could do it do you know what they did they found a simple little fish in india the simplest of all the fish but it was the only fish that could exhibit dual nature so the scientist took it in a little room he took it in a little room and and in secrecy he injected in the inner being of that light and then of course then he comes out to exhibit the light he puts it in a in a tank and he shuts all the lights off and then they add a little poison to the tank now the little fishinger might be thinking why they shut the lights off but it's the scientists wanting to exhibit his intelligence that has been transferred into this simple little fish he's wanting everybody to see his great mind was able to exhibit dual nature in something and so has god desired for you as a human to exhibit a divine nature so he didn't make you a god in that he left you in humanity but he put his own nature in you now he couldn't just put it on your skin because first time he took a shower he'd go he couldn't just put it in your spirit because he's five gates to get to it so he had to put it in the soul so that the soul would be in a place that it could exhibit from the soul realm the inner inside of inside and so what he did is he gave you that nature now by changing that nature he gives you the ability to escape now i want to just say this something to you as a human you're you're uh you're you're easy okay as a human because satan has been studying the human nature for six thousand years uh zach sitting over there me and him used to contract my nephews we we took a boat and put in spring river and we'd float and sit and all this well one day one day me and zach was over there and he set in a trap and i said son that won't work and he said dad i think it will i said no son that won't work he said i think it will i said what's your trap i kind of little arrogantly you know what's your trap leave it empty if you want to you know so i walked off and got in the boat come back next morning big old cone in that trap i was like well i guess i got a little learn my granddad trapped and he taught me how to trap a raccoon sitting on his couch he was getting older and he'd tell me he'd say son the thing about a raccoon that makes him trappable is that he keeps habits and a creature of habit makes him trappable he said because you can track him he said so what you do is you learn his patterns and his habits and you use his own pattern to get him he said what you do is you got to learn you got to learn and this is his saying he said you got to learn him to find where he's got his foot stuck out now what that means is now think about this young people you've got to make a raccoon his foot's this big you've got to make him put his foot in that spot and how many how many acres of ground is in this state he could put his foot anywhere in this whole state but you're predicting he'll put it in a spot that big around he could turn and go anywhere he wanted to he could do anything he wants but if you're a trapper you learn the nature of that animal and you can follow that and say right here i'll catch him right here now the thing about um think about a creek bank or a creek or something like that there's places how many y'all ever seen old creek you you live by them been by them and everything else if you ever notice that there's little sand bars in the creek like a little sand bar like this and then and then all of a sudden there's a bluff bank you ever seen that and you look down the creek bank and the whole thing's a bluff and there's a big nice tree sitting on the side now what a what a raccoon will do is when it comes to a sandbar he'll walk high and low like this so you can set a trap there it'll be empty from now on because he'll walk this way and he'll walk that way you come up to another spot and gravel bar and he'll walk this way and he'll walk that way but when that bank turns up it turns flat like this and the water's running next to it well a by nature he'll only walk about elbow deep in that water so if you look down next to that bank you'll see the tracks from last night or the night before and when you see them tracks you know that's his trail right there so what you do is you can follow him a mile up that creek bank and not have no spot to get him but when you get to that spot right there now you got him so you just set a trap right there and you don't have to set a trap down there you don't have to set a trap up there that one trap's going to get him and it's a sure-fired place because he's going to put his foot in it right there that's what's going to get him which teaches us that the devil can pattern your life the devil now what he'll do is he'll trail you he'll watch you daily and being a trapper he don't even want you to know that he has a trap laid what the devil will do is he'll watch your life and watch for the patterns and he's looking for that one spot he's just looking for that place where you got your foot stuck out or where you're you're off of guard that little weak spot he's looking for that one little place and the thing about the devil is he don't care if he gets you when you're 20 or you're 30 or you're 40. sometimes he'll follow a sister till she hits menopause and he'll know i'll get her in menopause sometimes he'll watch me and he'll say when they get to the change of life he's going to want i'm going to get him right there and he knows exactly by human nature he don't have to get you he don't have to get you it's your it's your time you'll think he's going to do this or he's going to do it he's just waiting to find that spot in your life because you're a human being he's waiting for that moment in your life where you stick your foot in that trap now i'm a trapper we me and zach we've trapped that old spring river a bunch of times and and what we really wanted to catch was an otter because the otters paid the most you know they they was the most pain we i hope y'all don't shoot me i hope no peter's here this morning y'all okay with me they'll be blocking this off of the internet uh but but we were we were we wanted to trap otter because that was the best money but now them traps we had i don't know what we get for them traps 25 30 probably for them good traps and and we would we would find a spot where the otter was on the bank or slides in a water slide so we'd find a good spot we set the trap them dudes took our traps i would they take two or three they take two or three of our traps what they are otter's so strong if you set your trap they'll jump off in the water and they'll spin they'll just spin like this and when they spin they'll break the wire off the trap that's that's got it tied down they just take your trap and go with them because they're almost uncatchable the only way you can catch an otter is that you got to put him in a kill trap or you have to drown him you have to have a slide and drown him but we thought we could outsmart him and just catch him so the point i'm saying to you is that we don't want to just catch something you want to keep something so when you sit in your trap you do it so as that not just to trap this animal you're not looking just to trap him and he'd pull his foot out or whatever because if he ever does that one time you'll never catch him after that because he'll know that trap from now on so you you don't do any of that but you put it so as when it sets it'll catch him and it'll hold him you see what the devil is trying to do he don't want to just catch you he wants to hold you he wants to hold you i i i ca can i can i preach a minute i see men that left their families now get this i talked to a brother one time he was a brother he left his family and went with another woman and started living with that woman and and while he was living with her i went to him and talked to him and i said brother you got to go home you got babies at home you got you they need their daddy and i started talking to him he said but brother he said what about this lady what he said i've got her out here in this mess and i'm responsible for and all that and i laughed i said look at that devil what he's doing to you you have left your responsibility and that now the devil's making you feel responsible for this brother you're not responsible for this you're responsible for your wife and children and listen let me tell you this the devil will make you feel like you're responsible for something that don't even belong to you you got to get tied up in some mess that don't even have nothing to do with you amen get your get your priorities in line and know that god's called you to be a father and a husband amen and get yourself in your oh god now now you you see the devil don't want to just catch your brother he wants to keep you he wants to get you in a place he can keep you and you find out this amen brother branham tells us the nature he said that old he didn't trap him with his foot out the way brother ram trapped him is he put nails in her log y'all heard about him tell it he put nails in a log and put a little shiny thing up there and when the moon would flash you'd see that shine back in there and oh will reach his hand back in there and he he can get his hand in now but when he gets a hold of it he'll grip it and he can't pull his hand out and that that crazy will hold on to that and a hunter coming after him he can see the hunter coming up the bank and he won't let go of it listen to me the devil knows you're in the trap he sees you there and he's coming after you don't hold on to it amen let go of the thing this morning let go of it i don't care who did it who's right who's wrong don't make no difference let go of the thing and run for your life run to jesus christ and let the power of god take a hold of this situation in your life listen i i i i know people people probably think i'm insane wait amen but unforgiveness is a prison to you it's just it's as bad as if you had a jail and a bar and a prison because you get away from your friends you isolate yourself from your church you isolate yourself from people that can help you you've got friends you've talked to for years but you can't even talk to them because of unforgiveness you're in a prison you're a prisoner to the thing you said brother wayne now and i'm going to talk to you out of the scriptures in case you don't think i'm crazy man jesus said there actually was a parable of a man that owed a man a lot of money and he went to the man and he said will you forgive me this great debt i forget the numbers i've got some numbers written down here i don't know if it's exact but it's but it's a just to show you the contrast it was about 3.4 billion dollars he owed in today's money and he said will you forgive me and man said yeah i'll forgive you let him go home the same man had a servant that owed him and it was ten thousand talents which is about six hundred thousand dollars in modern money and instead of forgiving that man he had him beat now watch what happens when the fella heard that you beat a man for six hundred thousand dollars and i just forgave you 3.4 billion he said go get that man and bring him back up here and you said what in the world you think god's going to put us back in prison the prison is the unforgiveness see the prison it not forgiven is the prison it is literally the thing that keeps you out of fellowship you can you can kneel down and pray and there's a black sheep in front of you you can't get through you can't worship you can't get you can't get nothing from god because of that unforgiveness is there it literally becomes a prison unto them now i'm sitting here today preaching to you about offenses and 490 times a day and god give it to us i'll give you i give you a little figure 490 times a day it means every two minutes in a 24-hour day you sleep eight so there's 16 hours divided by 490 times in those six is two minutes so what that means is when someone offends you you've got two minutes to get rid of it before it starts hurting when somebody offends you you've got two minutes you can stomp and holler and get mad do whatever you want for two minutes after that two minutes let it go brother let it go and if you're married to somebody that's having trouble with it just tell them two minutes you heard the preacher [Applause] you don't have to say more than that i already said it just do two minutes that's all you got because it's so damaging to your life if you hold it in your heart over two minutes it begins to affect you it begins to change who you are and then now offenses come all the time but can i say this to you i'm talking to what i believe to be a tremendous congregation i respect your pastor your pastors i respect these men of god amen i respect your belief i i think this full gospel is a powerful church it's making an impact internationally in the message of the hour we love you think so highly of you so people say well why would you preach a sermon like that to this kind of congregation do you know it was jesus himself who spoke of john the baptist whenever it was that john the baptist got through in jail y'all remember it y'all remember what he got in jail for he was preaching on marriage and divorce and some people got mad at him amen and they had the power to put him in jail and they put him in jail and john was over there in jail and his eyes started dimming and look at how far and how offended he got at jesus he said is this him or do we need to get another one think of that john got so offended at jesus christ now you say why did he get offended brother mam said it's because it didn't work out the way john had it planned he said john had introduced jesus as a messiah with a fan in his hand and he would thoroughly purge the floor he was looking for jesus to completely destroy that bunch of pharisees and do away with all of them and now he had let god had let john fall into the hands of these men for preaching the gospel and brother braham said he was offended at jesus christ do you know what you know what actually that brother branham says he says that there's more people offended at jesus than there is in the whole world there's more people offended at jesus tonight than they are at any of us amen people are offended at him because things have not worked out the way they wanted them to sometimes we get situations we say it's going to be like this and going to be like this amen but the prayer said father not my will but thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven learn how to pray not what we will what god wills that we don't become offended at the god that gave us grace and mercy in this age when i look at this i see amen that what brother brahm says here he says they become offended now watch this they get offended too quick i love it when they go when john his disciples go to jesus and says he's asked now listen to this he's asked are you him or do we look for another and jesus never got angry what jesus did he said you boys go sit and watch the meeting and you go tell him what you've seen and heard and blessed is he that's not offended in me which was the 11th commandment remember the forgotten the forgotten beatitude was blessed is he that's not offended in me and john had said the worst thing he could say about jesus and jesus said there's not a greater man born of a woman than john the baptist listen to me and the greatest man born of a woman outside of jesus christ was offended at god don't tell me that you can get so big you can't get offended that you can't get offended at one another you can't get offended at god amen but the beauty of it is god has given us forgiveness this morning to let every offense go to let every trouble go now amen i'm going to be closing very quickly so what we see then is we see that there are stories in the scripture that expresses this attribute there is not a picture in the entire bible that would say more about forgiveness than joseph it is the greatest picture of forgiveness in the entire bible joseph never done anything to deserve being treated wrongly never none the bible says they hated him without a cause amen and they mistreated joseph for no reason whatsoever amen i'll tell you what brother brandon said it was he said it's because the devil knew the promised son was coming and he was trying to kill him before he got there so the anger that was in their heart the jealousy that come upon them was just because he was a spiritual man that's all it was because he was a spiritual man his brethren beat him his brethren stripped him his brethren throwed him in a in a pit and sold him he sold him into slavery church now i'm talking about some real stuff how would you feel if we took you out back and beat the snot out of you and sold you off into a bunch of that probably wasn't proper english but but y'all know what i meant hey man but they beat him amen and put him in that pit and then he left the pit maybe go get a little better and he goes to potiphar's house and they raise him up and a woman accuses him of something horrible that he never even done wrong and because they told a lie on him he ended up down there in a prison house the man was thoroughly mistreated you never read joseph ever amen coming back and saying well this is really what happened and this is how it took place and i tell you these people are horrible you never read that in the bible at all amen but because he was carrying a divine nature as a son of god he was the very example of jesus christ and he went through all of it and they couldn't put bitterness in him and because he had no bitterness they couldn't put any bitterness in him and it's one of the most powerful stories i know of when they took him out of the prison and they elevated a gift because of the character it had and they made him ruler in the land of egypt can you imagine when potiphar come riding by and seen him crowning joseph and he went home and he told his wife honey i hope you wasn't lying because that fellow that we put in jail has just become the second ruler in all of egypt once he got in position of power he could have done whatever he wanted he could have sought vengeance on potiphar's wife he could have took his brethren and had him sold asunder and thrown into the pits into the gators he could have done whatever he was in power but the reason he was in power is because of the character he had and if the right man is in power character will show forgiveness every time if you see the power of jesus christ in a man's life forgiveness is one of the attributes look what he did he never he never sought vengeance because he was an example of jesus christ brother wayne should i forgive someone who hasn't asked i don't know of a better example of this than the son of god now he's just been beaten beyond recognization he taught him to a pole and beat him until he can't walk he hasn't done anything wrong have a wrong man he's dragging his own cross and the people that he's going through this for are screaming crucify him it's there that a man named simeon or simon reach us down brother i'd like to have that opportunity when you he says i know you got to do this but let me help you carry it helped helped him carry that cross up that hill they took our lord by vision a prophet gave us a great look right into it out of the rock 55. he said i seen him going up the combo stone he said i can hear the bump of the cross as it goes he said i'm watching his garment he said one spot then another then another he said then it began to join itself together until it would become one blood soaked garment while that blood was dripping and he was walking they were screaming crucify him they were hailing him as a rejected king they were spitting mocking laughing he hasn't done no wrong he done nothing for what good work what'd he do i don't know crucify him something was driving them to get this man out of their midst they took him up there on that cross and he hangs he hangs there he hangs next to murderers to thieves he's hanging there we do a good job as a christian world of putting a little napkin over his privates and giving him a little dignity why he's on the cross but i'm sorry to say there was none that day he was stripped my lord hung naked before the crowd could you tell me why what'd he do while he was hanging there the blood soaked the blood-soaked hair dripping the blood running from there he could see him brother he could hear him the people he was sent to help was screaming crucify him they were spitting at him one of the most powerful scenes in in scripture they offer him bitterness have you ever ever studied it they offered him they offered him a drink he said i thirst and they offered him something do you know what he offered him they offered him a ragweed that is mixed with a certain chemical that it comes from the hemp that it kills pain it's in the sedative they offered him bitterness to deal with the pain listen to me they offered him bitterness to deal with the pain of rejection and crucifixion but he would not receive bitterness when it would even duel the hardest pains listen there's going to be times in your life pain's going to come people's going to do mean things it's going to save me things and satan's going to offer you some bitterness if you could just be mad at them if you could just be wrong if they could just be wrong and you could say mean things you wouldn't hurt anymore amen but if you just open up your arms your type is christ and he opened his arms and said to them father forgive them they don't know what they do look at this he forgave them while they were scheming crucify him while they were spitting and mocking and let me tell you that potential is in you that potential is in every person in this building that has received the holy ghost you don't have to have somebody ask you you've got something in you that can forgive the unforgivable you can forgive when nobody's asked for it you can give back when nobody has asked a thing because you are a christian you are a son of god you are a daughter of god i don't know what the devil's trying to hold on you this morning but i think we are to kill every spirit of bitterness in this building we are to take every spirit of unforgiveness and hang them by their own noose this morning we are to turn right on that devil and say i'll tell you what you try to keep me from loving my brother but i'm going to put my arm around him this morning i'm going to tell him i love him i'm going to tell my sister i love him if i've done anything forgive me please amen make every right wrong make every situation come to the right place you have the potential this morning you do not have to carry that with you another day [Music] he stretched his arms and he took the sphere and as the blood from his side mixed with the blood from his back it dropped onto the ground and healing and forgiveness came at the same time it's mixed the bloodstream mixed healing and forgiveness if you want some healing in your life your spirit forgive if you want to live like a new christian like you'd never like the first night you received the holy ghost fill your heart with forgiveness fill your heart with love for one another let love be your thing let it fill your entire soul there's nothing more powerful on this earth than divine love it's exactly what we need this morning i wonder somebody this morning might say by wayne i want that to come by my seat today i want that to come to my heart today i want out of this trap i want out of it before morning i went out today won't you stand to your feet with us today father forgive them they don't know what they do it was those great words it was those great words that he spoke the only man who was ever right became wrong so i could be go free the only man ever right not one of you is right this morning so i'm in an argument with somebody there's no right there's no right jesus jesus was right and he knew if he didn't forgive you couldn't go new rapture right i was riding brother ron was riding on an airplane home from canada some time ago and i was coming home from a meeting you know how monday's how you do sometimes and i'm just riding i was thinking i got to thinking about pardons and how people get pardons it's been 10 12 15 years sometimes in jail and they never even did it somebody figures out they didn't do it and they let them go i was thinking about all that and i got to think about spiritual pardons and i was thinking about it i thought but lord i i did it and in an instant on that airplane i'm sitting there thinking [Music] i know the scripture says you've never done it but lord i did i really did it i was [Music] it was there it was sin it was horrible i was there [Music] and i just bowed my heart i said god how could you ever brother i don't know if it was audible i don't know what it was but it was to me he said you are libra brother there was a power swept through that airplane i started bawling like a baby i imagine everybody in the plane thought i was insane i just started bawling like a baby [Music] because barabbas had no hope he had no way to get right but because of calvary he didn't have to go [Music] and this morning that same jesus christ is right here in this building blood still has the same power his grace still means just as much maybe there's a situation in your life today and you don't know how to get over it you don't know what to do he said if we sin against one another seven times 70 a day then our god has the same attribute he has the same ability and to think that a loving father this morning all you have to do is turn port home said lord i'm asking you i'm asking you to return to my life maybe there's something you need to correct in your life this morning offense something you've been letting go in your heart for a while and it's changing you it's making you a person you never were maybe right here this morning you'll say brother i want this to leave me this is not me i'm not a mean angry person it's not me as we bow our hearts this morning father i've delivered my heart to your children this morning father maybe someone here or someone watching maybe it'd be a blessing to them somehow father i pray though right now in this building i believe there's hearts here i believe there's needs here in this sanctuary maybe one don't know you just they never really gave their life but i pray right here this morning the lord they turn loose or whatever life they're living and they'd run to you father may be somebody trapped in a situation this morning that's got them it's holding them in sin and they just don't know how to get out i pray this morning they just let go and they run to you maybe the only

say thank you to brother wayne lawson the man of god for coming by our way being obedient to the holy spirit and thank the the lost and family in an entirety thank you for coming and you're not just you're not just an extension of another sister church your your full gospel lighthouse family and we love you from the depths of our soul so let me move on in thought today we have we set these meetings up because we wanted this for our people and we're certainly to have all of our visitors here with you and we set this meeting up and and in minds of of our liberty and i thought today my goodness if we've ever had the shackles broke off we ought to celebrate our victory just just now thanking the lord for it but we we wanted to have a fellowship dinner with our people we we have well outgrown our fellowship hall and we are steadily steadily searching but we we've found a few places that we can entertain some things and entertain some ideas just for the time being and those things weren't available this weekend and we're certainly thankful for the weirs cave community center that has allowed us every about every weekend us as a youth group to be able to go and interact there with our youth but they weren't available this weekend but sister wanda hinkle made access for us to be able to use spotswood high school today and that's where we'll be traveling to here just in a few moments and we're going to be having a fellowship dinner there and you don't necessarily maybe we don't always get the time to sit down and fellowship but that's what this this day is about this is about re restoring brotherhood and enjoying what we're going to be doing throughout the eternities so i'm going to give this address to you at the beginning of this speech and then at the ending if if you can listen this the address is 368 blazer drive pin layered and if you're a visitor and don't know where you're going you just follow one of us elkton people here we'll be going right there we're not going to miss this meal and so if you don't know it's real easy it's about 10 miles from here as soon as you pull out here on 33 you just go straight up straight up 33 west there it's 10 miles on your right you'll see a sign it's what is it the fifth fifth stop light the fifth stop light on your right you pull in there and as you go in it's a big loop just stay to the right and follow that loop all the way around and there's all kinds of parking in there but i was told to tell you this do not park where the red lines are in the fire lane do not look at your neighbor said do not park in the fire lane because the fire marshal uses that as his access right there do not park there because you will get a ticket i don't believe anybody just after being forgiven wants to have another ticket on their name so just don't don't park there but we're certainly appreciative of spotswood high school allowing us to be able to use this facility and it fell in a perfect time and uh we're just certainly thankful to be able to use it it's a place where we can have fellowship dinner there's two different gyms that we'll be using and uh we'll we'll make some more comments at that place there at once we get there i know you're ready to eat we'll pray over that when we get there so we're all on the same page we'll put brother ron at the first line brother wayne right behind him that okay i'm glad you're on the same board of me now we're moving forward but as you enter into the school it's it's as you're looking at the entrance or the the school it's the left major entrance most of us know where to go we've been to a few of those ball games up there so we know where to go at it's where you go in and get your ticket go in there you go in there you're going to get a meal today all provided by brother ron and myself and i hope you say thank you but you're welcome god bless you [Applause] so once you go in there you'll go into the facility there we've got tables set up and i'm not exactly we had something set up yesterday and i'm not i'm not going to speak without the boss being here but we were going we'll give you instructions how to get in the line you'll figure it out you'll figure it out real easy but here's the most important thing that i'm going to tell each and every one of you parents today watch your kids i know that typically right here is where i'd cut off the internet but there's some people out there that love when we give these things because it helps their congregation out so watch your kids if you enjoyed making them babies enjoy watching them babies [Applause] can i get an a-man in the house of the world look at your neighbor and say watch your kids [Music] all right now so there's two different gyms one gym is going to be specifically for the little children for the 12 and under and uh little kids listen up real good right here we've got an obstacle course i don't know if you're supposed to say that right obstacle course obstacle course a jumpy house obstacle course that's for the for the younger kids and some of us elderly might get down there ourselves but that's there's a gym down there there's a gym down there it's got that set up we've got a little volleyball net set up for you and those those type of things but parents if you got two of you it normally takes two and if you're if one of them go with your children down there if you wouldn't mind at least one being with your children down there that way because hey i'm gonna give some young people in a little talk right here if you say you're gonna watch somebody's child you be responsible for watching that child and if you can't watch them don't tell them you're gonna watch them that all right all right thank you then the other gym is for the young adults and in there we're gonna have some volleyball and basketball and and some games there and we want you to have a wonderful time of fellowship but remember watch your kids [Music] this is
