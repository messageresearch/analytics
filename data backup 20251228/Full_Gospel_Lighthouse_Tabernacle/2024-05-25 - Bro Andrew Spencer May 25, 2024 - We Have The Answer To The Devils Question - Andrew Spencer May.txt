we've watched you come in and manifest your power Lord tonight is no different than any the other night Lord we are your people and we have a need of you to come by our way Lord as we just begin to Humble ourselves before you Lord I it just keeps coming to my mind Lord about about that brother across the sea there when he was away from the Lord and had some questions in his mind the angel Lord just touched him on the back there and left an imprint when it come to William brand I'm it matched up perfectly to his hand father I'm so thankful Lord that we've had a message that has touched our lives in such a way that we can say that's not man's doing it's supernatural father I pray that you would just allow your Holy Spirit to come and begin to unravel things in our mind begin to unchain father and begin to loose Lord by the power of your hand and Lord we just ask God that this service would be something special for your kingdom Lord we're your children and we've loved this message with all that is within us father and we've have many ups and downs throughout our life's journey but father we come back here one more time just to prove who side that we're on and to show you father that we're in need of you and we ask Lord that you would just pass through this audience Lord and you would take the children and you would set them down and you begin to teach them from your word and I I pray that you would be that personable tonight you'd make yourself known in a very specific way that we could literally see you by the power of the preach's word Lord we devote oursel to you just now in this service in Jesus name amen am and amen if you have your Bibles we like to turn over to Matthew chapter 4 and verse one Matthew chapter 4 and verse one and as you're as you're turning there I'd like to I'd like to share this quotation from Christ The Mystery of God revealed and basically just draw our our context tonight from this from this quote brother randam said in paragraph 580 he said when we see all these great three-fold revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise he said praise be to God now by by the one revelation of the three-fold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindicated word by his original headship not say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing that ain't it I'm a missionary I've been seven times practically over the world and I've seen heathens and devils and everything else dance and shout and I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestation he said that's carnal he said but I'm talking about that headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the head or the body Matthew chapter 4 and verse one then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into a holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he said give his Angel he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands shall they bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone and Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him may God bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord from these from these thoughts here this evening I would like to speak to you we have the answer to the devil's question question the answer to the devil's question I know that we've got many of kids just now that are that are beginning their summer break or getting ready to start their summer break and I know that every one of these these little guys are super excited about that and I remember as a child I always always prayed Lord let the Rapture happen between summer break so I wouldn't have to go back and while I'm still here preaching and but he he still comes he still comes every time he comes to these services and I know that these little guys are certainly excited to be out on on on spring or summer break and going to enjoy all of the elements of summertime and being away from being away from school but just having this context on our thought I begin to think about I begin to think about when I was in school how that the the teachers the ma especially the Math teachers they didn't necessarily like how I did things because they they would set out problems on a per piece of paper and different things and they'd want you to line out how that you got the answer answer or the solution to the answer and you know I I was that kind of visionary person and I just I found the answer in my mind and I wrote it down well they didn't like that too much and they they wanted to see how you got the answer how that you came across the answer and the solution of it and and brother brandom actually I found that brother Brandon picks that up and proving his word he said he said I remember in school he said I learned something and many of you learn the same lesson he said when you've solved a problem and worked it out you can take the answer and prove it by the problem you can take the answer and prove it by the problem and he he went on to say he said so if you prove he said your answer he said if your answer if you prove your answer by the problem then why not prove the answer that we're now getting by the word of this age he said if the Bible speaks that a certain thing is to happen in this age and he said it's in the Bible it will happen he said then if your answer that you're trying to tell the people if it's proven by the book by the book then it's true it's it's true otherwise it isn't so we literally are able to take the problems that we come up against and we can take the answer and prove the problems that there is an answer there is an answer to all of life's problems right here laying in the word of God now I I know that we're all familiar we're all familiar with going to a car car salesman and and buying a car and having that car salesman experience and there's there's one thing that I personally can't understand about or can't I can't halfway deal with it it gets on my ever loving nerves is when they when you go to a car salesman and they don't know what they're selling to you but me and Matthew we're we're tring to Matthew's my car guru and if I'm buying a truck or buying something for the business I I tell him exactly what we're looking for he studies out every little detail and we show up there we know every we know everything that it's supposed to do where we know all the Dynamics of it because we've studied it out and I can't stand it when when a car salesmen don't know what they're talking about and you can I I hate being a know it all but when you can stand there and start telling that now that that's not right that that isn't for this kind of stroke motor that's for that's for that kind of a stroke motor and you go through those certain things I I really dislike when somebody don't know exactly what they're talking about and they're trying to sell you something that's kind of like a preacher that don't know Jesus and he's trying to sell you something and ain't you ain't in a you ain't in a buying mood you'd rather go somewhere else and buy from it but I believe that I believe that there's one thing about Jesus that Jesus never had to sell himself is that the word sold itself for him he never had to prove that he was a word he simply was the word and the word took care of the matters that had come up against every problem every problem that he ever came up against the word settled the problems that he ever came up against is that right when you look in the days of Noah when you look there there was a problem which was the rain but the ark was the answer when you look in the days of Moses the children of Israel were in bondage but you see the there that was the problem they were in bondage but the message that Moses had received was the answer to the problem problem that they were in and Satan has always wondered if if if this is a seed or is that one a seed could this be the seed could he really be the Messiah could could he could they really leave Egypt could this one really be Malachi 4 or could she be the Bride of Jesus Christ because Satan has always wondered if that's the seed or not now brother random said in the in the message Satan's eating he said I he said I wanted to speak to you something to bring you something to Enlighten you to the promise of of God for this age he said something not something that somebody else was in some other day he said but then he said them things is all right and we refer to those things he said but I thought that I would try to bring you something to your mind with these scriptures he said that I've got written here that would Enlighten you to know or to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you he said that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can he went on to say he said now I don't believe that there ever was a day he said that I've read in history he said there's been great days of persecution when the children of God was put to death on every hand he said but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy he said we've never had a day like this that we're now living he said it's the most cunning and deceitful day and he said when I see it he said it brings this that that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he ever was in any age so the Christian has to be on his guard in this age more than any other age and you see how you're going to get through this age of great deceiving and cunning times it's because of the anointing of the hour that we are under that gives us the energy the pulsation to literally overcome the spirit of the enemy or the Antichrist that we are facing in this hour now we realize that way we are living at in This Time by modern events made clear by prophecy that we realize that we are facing the smoke from a bottomless pit that we read over in Revelations chapter n and you begin to study out Revelations chapter N9 and you see those Supernatural elements or the powers that are there that have rose up out of the bottomless pit that they are they are Supernatural powers that are against the moving of the Holy Ghost they are against the word of God and you watch the king Abad and rise out of that bottomless pit and brother bham picks that up in the Feast of the trumpets and he said it's supernatural demons he said it's supernatural Chargers that had been held for 2,000 years in the river of Euphrates he said they had been bound there they had been bound there all of those years and you notice this king's name abadin which means they destroy an Angel and I'll say he is a badden if I say if I I believe that I believe that John was writing these things down and Billy terms that the devil is a badden he certainly is a badden but a king has got demons that are under his under his handle and those demons are designed or built to attack the very people that move towards the word of God that press towards his presence those demons are religious Spirits those demons are religious Spirits as the Bible would say as the Bible would say that literally their power is in their mouth their power is in their mouth by the tale that they're telling and brother Brandon picks that up and he said he said it's that Roman that old Roman Empire that's revived itself again what is it it's their idology their ideology or their system of ideas now William brandom said he said now he said don't you fear that Iron Curtain he said but you feel that you fear that purple curtain keep your eyes on that he said don't you feel com don't you fear communism he said you watch that devil what is it in Catholicism it is a brainwashing of people through systems where they literally lose their identity of who they are and we're Liv in an age where men don't know what they are anymore and I'm not just talking about natural things but I'm talking about spiritual things Christians that claim to be Christians have lost their identity of what a Christian really is a Christian means to be Christlike and we got a bunch of people people in the world today that call themselves Christians but don't identify as a Christian come on somebody when a dog gives birth to a dog it looks like a dog when a when a cat gives birth to a cat it looks like a cat when a human gives birth to a human it looks like a human and when God gives birth to Sons and Daughters of God they ought to look like Sons and Daughters of God but Christians in this hour have lost their identity of what they are respecting for and what they are to look like that is one of Satan's greatest tactics is to steal away the identity of the hour or the identity of the believer of him and his position that he's standing in in the hour what is it what is it brother Bron would preach it down in Alabama he would call it spiritual Amnesia where the enemy would come in and steal away the identity and that's exactly what he did to that's what he what's that's exactly what the devil did to Legion he stole his identity away from him and what did he do what did he do he stole his identity and he displaced him what did he do he displaced the headship of the home and if Satan can rob your headship he can steal anything away from you if he can steal your headship he can steal anything away from you I I hope you hear what I'm saying to you today I'm not just talking about your natural home but if Satan can steal away the headship of the word of God he can steal everything from you come on somebody if he can steal a way that you don't need to be in church and you can stay at home he has stole away your identity if he can steal away and make you think you can live by just eating one meal every once in a month he has stolen away thine identity but children of God that fully are Under The Fellowship of the headship recognize the power you see what Satan is offering you he is offering you a foundation he's offering you a foundation that has no power Satan has no Foundation his foundation is built upon attacking the value of the word of God you see it literally when you begin to try to pierce through the darkness or the smoke of Le osia it's piercing that that smoke literally Gets In Your Eyes it gets in your it gets in your flesh it gets in the cabinets it gets in the drywall When the Smoke of the Furnace begins to blow you let one of your houses catch on fire you burn a bag of popcorn and you can't get the smell out of your house how much more powerful or pertinent is the smoke out of the bottomless pit when it gets into spiritual lives you see it affect everything it affects your vision it affects your lungs it affects is the way that you praise it affects the way that you pray it's affecting it is affecting the way that people find God people say well I ain't got time to pray and I ain't got time to serve God if Suzanne Wesley could pray two hours a day and raise 18 children and raise up a prophet messenger or raise up a messenger of the age how much more with a p a push button Society should we be able to pray come on somebody until walls fall pray pray until Devils bow to the name of Jesus pray if Satan can steal your headship he stole your joy if Satan can steal your peace he's robbed you and he's giv you turmo instead of peace but God didn't leave you down here God didn't leave you down here in the midst of your crisis without a hope he didn't leave you down here in the midst of battle without strength because you roll the chapter over from Revelation chapter n to Revelations chapter 10 notice the first word and and is a conjunction and I saw another Mighty angel in the midst of this Bottomless Pit in the midst of this smoke there stood up a strong angel I'm going to let him out today come on somebody he didn't leave you without hope Smith wgg Smith Wigglesworth said that a man filled with the Holy Ghost can stand up and laugh in the face of a thousand difficulties it doesn't matter what comes up against you just rise up the Samson in your life and laugh at a thousand difficulties you are not without hope you are not without hope because in this hour you've got the same Authority as the same one that stood there in Matthew chapter 4 when he stood there and said get behind me Satan get behind me Satan Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God when Jesus was in his weakest moment Satan was in his strongest moment but Jesus did not answer him out of his emotions he did not answer him out of his feelings he did not answer him out of his flesh he answered him out of the word of God what are you saying to me brother Andrew it's not what you see it's not what you feel it's not what you're going through answer don't answer out of your weakness answer out of your stress the joy of the Lord is my strength oh glory be to God and a prophet told us that the word of God would affat the devil any time any place under any situation in the belly of a whale in the lon's den in a bed of cancer when you D underneath an automile automobile accident the Lord is my strength it is a tool for the weakest of Christians when Satan comes up against you he messed up because he ain't just messing with a human he's messing with Jesus again oh [Music] Hallelujah Jesus never doubted his position even in his weakness he never doubted his authority Hallelujah even in a situation when people walked away from him he did not question his authority he simply countered the problem by the word oh Lord I'll tell you brother Andrew I ain't got no strength let me tell you when you ain't got no strength he is your strength because Paul said in Colossians 1:11 strengthen with all might according to his glorious power under all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness Hallelujah Caleb said in Joshua 14:11 he said I may not look like it but I'm still as strong today as I was when the day that Moses promised me that that was my land I got enough strength to go out to battle and I got enough strength to come back David said in Psalms 1839 for thou Hast guarded me with strength under the battle Psalms 273 and 26 My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever come on somebody Psalms 28 and S the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am am held therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I Praise Him Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:7 but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power might be of God and not of us who come on problems I got your answer come on devil I got your answer come on turmoil I got chance come on somebody raise up your hand raise up your problems and tell them problems you can't stay when the answer's in the [Applause] way I'mma tell you what I'm somebody's going to have to hold my mule cuz I feel a shout hallelujah hallelujah when questions would arise to our Lord where'd you get this power Jesus had all the answers they began to ask him said by what Authority do you teach these things by what power are you saying these things and Jesus gave them a question to their question he said all right he said by the baptism of John was his baptism of man or was it of God and they knew they couldn't answer answer him on those things they knew they couldn't answer him but Jesus said neither am I going to answer you anymore and the prophet said in God's only provided place he said they was trying to figure it out he said but it was none of their business he had he had a work to do and he finished it he said God help us to do the same thing you don't have to answer the devil's questions come on fear I don't have to answer your questions come on down I don't have to answer your questions come on serpent seed I've got the answer what was it when Jesus stood there they could not understand this but he was literally the answer to all of the prophets prophecies that everything that was laid there all the way back from the Garden of Eden that there would be a seed that would raise up and would bruise the head of the serpent he was that answer now some of you've been praying and you've been asking for an answer but could you imagine waiting thousands of years come on Isaiah where you at wait 800 years for the answer come on Abraham can you can you wait 25 years for the answer now notice what he speaks to them in John chapter 10 and 24 then came the Jews round about him said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly I love this and Jesus answered them and said I told you come on you big dummies I told you I told you and you believe me not it's like it's like when Mama God bless Mama it's like when Mama straightened me out whoop my rear end and ask her do you love me she said I showed you I loved you some of y'all get that today I told you but you believe me not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me so the works was the answer but when Jesus comes down a little bit further and said I my father one they couldn't handle the answer they couldn't handle they couldn't handle the pressure of him and the word being the same thing they could not figure that out how that Moses got that law up there on Mount SII and he says I am that law he could not figure out how that he said I am that I am he could not figure that out they were standing there with some of the greatest minds but they had zero understanding by the prophecy of who they were of who he was and they simply turned on him and said you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost he said but it is it is it not written that I said unto you you or that you are God's you see he wasn't just taking them to where he was he was taking them all the way back to the Garden of Eden and said right there is your answer that Adam was a god back there under amateur form he was a God when he moved the mountains he was a God when he spoke to the wind he was a God when he named the tiger he was a God when he named The Lion I'll say what you are when you cause cancer to be defeated Sals you are acting like a Son of God it was the answer to it they couldn't understand they could not understand this how that this mortal flesh had this much power even the people that walked with him that that had rode on the boat with him that had fish with him that had took up tithes with him that had fed the 5,000 with him they couldn't even understand where he got that power when he stood out there on that water said is that a ghost out there walking they said how does this man have power to control the winds and the waves they couldn't understand it this was a new thing for them it was a new thing for them but you see he was the answer to all of it he was the answer to legion's understanding because Legion was a good man I'm not going into that full story but Legion was a man where the Prophet would say say that every once in a while he would come to himself and the prophet would use this he would use this terminology when he was referring to Christ in some ways he would say that he was a dual person that Christ was a dual person and it's amazing it's amazing how close that Satan gets how close he gets brother bisco would call it a Razor's Edge of how close that the devil can get that it could be that close you look at somebody that's got a chemical imbalance in their body when they begin to get bipolar and they they get in it's amazing how close that that is to being like you and God it's amazing but Jesus said I and my father are one and he simply said un them he simply said unto them you are Gods brother Brandon picked that up he said the principle is God in the people the principle is God in the people you see what you have are experiencing is not a chemical imbalance what you're experiencing is not a bipolar condition that one day you're God and the next day you're not but you're literally under the principal theme of Christ the mystery God revealed that it's Christ in you the hope of glory this ain't some chemical imbalance this ain't some bipolar disorder this is a nature change it's a birth it's a Pentecostal experience brother Brandon would I love the way that he would describe it like this he said he had he had that man that come by his house one day knocked on his door he said he was a Drifter and brother bam said he had no ambition about where he was going in life he just simply went from this play place to that place and he simply asked himself how long where do you where where do you call home he said wherever my hat is and brother ROM would identify that man to drift wood that gets caught up in the river you've heard the story that he would he would identify that man he said a man without Ambitions like that Driftwood that gets caught up in the turns of the river you see he said it gets caught up in the trash of the world and it stays right there in that corner he said but you take a boat that's made out of wood and you let it drift down there in the trash get down there in the turns of life he said what is it he said the difference is is that boat is crafted by a master and it's Guided by a master and it's got a power by behind it to get itself out of the turns or out of the trash of life let me say it like this you may have looked like you were trash you may look like Driftwood but there's a power there's a principal theme behind your life come on somebody the devil may have turned you around the devil may have put you in some real trash but it's a different story now there's a power to get you out of the trash out of the situation Hallelujah you couldn't got yourself out of that mess but the prophet said that Jesus was opening a gate or a door to the sons of God that they could be like him he was liter he was literally opening up a gate I only put know how to put it in Farmers terms in Farmers terms you got you got that fresh cut hay and you got them hungry cattle on that side of the fence you just open the gate one good time and you you'll create a stampede because they feel Hallelujah I feel I kind of feel like that little calf been shut up all win long he gets a smell of that hay get out of his way what was the prophet saying is that God was opening a gate to the sons of God come on in come on in here come on over here maybe they think you can't have the Holy Ghost but come on in here maybe they don't think you can create apple trees but come on in here maybe they think you can't create squirrels but come on in here hallelujah what is it it's bride time it's Malachi 4 time it's manifesting time we have the the answer to the devil's question literally living in the hour of the Turning of the Heart by the preaching of the word it unveils the hearts and Faith begins to turn what is it brother Brandon would say that he literally sent a prophetic gift in this hour to stimulate the faith of the Believers if you ain't you're never going to get anything from God unless you believe him brother Brandon would come to prayer line after prayer line and he would stand there and he would tell the people now look if you're not a Believer and you ain't got faith to believe it would be better for you to get out of this line than to stay in this line to come through it you'd be he said if you come through here as a doubter he said you would leave off better off better worse than what you came in here if you're doubter now he wasn't talking about he wasn't talking about immoral acts he wasn't talking about attributes of it because there were all kinds of immoral acts there were all kinds of Dirty Deeds there were all kinds of just life that came through that line but he wasn't talking about the acts that you did as a sinner he was talking about your faith he was saying do not even enter this line unless you got faith to believe that the Lord's able to do something he was simply challenging the people's Faith to believe that all things were possible possible even Jesus would stand there when he was talking to Nicodemus in John 3:16 he in verse 18 he stood there and said he that believeth is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already what is he saying is a person that believes rolls away the condemnation but the person that disbelieves keeps the condemnation that they are under he said you don't send that God don't send you to hell it's you refusing the accepting power of the Salvation of Jesus Christ that sends you to Hell come on somebody God ain't sent one person to hell you or the sinner has sent himself to hell that's why the prophet would say it's a death it's a death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word it's the hardest punch that the devil can ever receive is when God finds a believer that really believes how many Believers are right in the building but you see all that Satan is wanting to do is simply plant the seed of doubt it's all he's want to do because if he plants it you end up watering that thing you end up watering that thing by going to church you end up watering that thing by worshiping that Spirit you end up watering that thing by by worshiping that disease all he wants to do is simply plant the seed of D doubt just just like when when Jesus is after Jesus had done raised on Easter morning and the chief priest and and all of them found out that Jesus's body was missing they that that the chief priest went to the soldiers and they they begin to confer and talk with them and they came up with a remedy and said we'll offer you all this money if you'll simply tell a lie that the disciples came in and took them while you was asleeping on a job and they came up with a lie but you see what the devil was doing and he was trying to create the art of confusion he was trying to confuse real Believers he was trying to confuse them it's kind of like somebody it's kind of like a a gallant man of this message when people were saying things about the message or bringing up all kinds of questions of what they thought the message was and what they thought the prophet really meant about that and they had this whole line of questions he a gallant man of the message he went up to him and said look them ain't my questions them are your questions he said because all of my questions got answered when I came to this message God is not the author of confusion God is the author of Faith they made my questions I know Hallelujah I know in whom I haveth believed come on somebody come on somebody maybe you don't understand everything maybe you don't see everything maybe you don't understand why or how you got to digest the word maybe maybe you just maybe you got simple questions that you literally need to figure out just to grow in a Christian walk it's a major difference in questioning the message and asking for a deeper Revelation because God gives that kind of understanding is that right and maybe you got a list maybe you got a list of questions maybe you're needing some answers in your life but let me put it to you like the good woman in Daniel chapter 5 when the king belshazzar had had all these things when the handwriting was upon the wall and it was without understanding she said oh King live forever don't just start doubting your doubts because there's a man in the land that is known as the dissolver of doubts he understands the supernatural he understands what it takes to produce the Supernatural come on somebody he's got the answers to your questions let me say that the same one not William brandham but the same one that gave the answers at the pull pit is still here today and I'll say this to you he is the dissolver of doubts why don't you turn on your doubts and say I'm doubting my doubts maybe you got questions but I want to say this to you he's got answers maybe you got problems but he's got a solution come on somebody maybe you got sickness but he's got a cure it's a devil's job to cause questions but the message is the answer the message is the answer let me go a little bit further you're the answer you're the answer to the devil's question let me let me just let me just drop this right here when when I'm kind of in that channel so let me just let me just drop this right here is when when some things were happening around the ranks of the message when you had disbelieve the sign coming amongst us and all these things trying to bring up all kinds of questions about what the prophet was and what he really meant and all the all these kinds of debauchery kinds of Lies brother Matthew had to deal with some difficult things in his life and go through some real hurdles but he was he was given a he was given a list of scriptures from brother Donnie rean he was given a letter from brother Tim pu and given a letter from brother Ron Spencer and he basically walked into this camp and he he basically he basically just put put it down he just basically put down a law he was a man I'll tell you what Matthew's not the kind of guy that you want to tangle with in the spiritual or in the natural I know both glad them natural days are pass me but he literally walked in and walked back he walked back to a to a place walked back to a place and him and his wife was sitting there and he simply and I I forgive me but I'm just telling this story and I hope I ain't telling outside of school or telling something that I shouldn't be telling but I believe I got authority to tell it I'm his brother but he simply walked back to his wife and he said if William brandham is not Malachi 4 then this whole Bible's wrong and when he said that when he said that brother Ron the pillar of fire com sweeping into the room where they were and hung there in the room as a Vindication that this message thoroughly thoroughly Vindicated that William brandham was Malachi 4 and if you stand for this message then God will stand for you you let them raise their questions the pillar of fire is the answer that's why you can stand there and say I am the answer to the devil's question blessed be the name of the Lord I know it might Rock You just a little bit but that same power that was in Jesus that Rose him up on Easter morning is that same power Satan wondered if he was a Son of God but Easter morning proved he was both mechanics and Dynamics that's what this message has done in this hour it's proving that you are beneficiaries of the Resurrection Hallelujah it ain't just mechanical to you you know the Dynamics of it somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise tell your neighbor I am the answer to the Devil's [Applause] question [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you begin to study out that he's a dissolver of doubts you'll find when you start studying in the Hebrew that you'll find that the same word is used in Daniel chapter 2 of shirar the word in the Hebrew Shar it means to dissolve it means to unravel it means to dwell and when Daniel is standing there when Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and he brings his dream he brings us up before his wise men and tells them you tell me my dream and they said you tell us your dream and we'll tell you what your dream means he said you either tell me what my dream is or I'm going to kill you but there was Rose up a man that was an excellent in his spirit that had defiled himself not with the king's meat or the king's drink and he simply stood there and he brought a revelation of what the King's dream was what did he do Daniel went back and recovered the dream when you start studying out Daniel chapter 2 and verse 22 you'll find that there he begins to say that he is the desol he begins to say that he knoweth or he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in darkness and the light dissolve with him the light dwelleth with him the light unravels the light unravels with him the light literally the Revelation begins to loose you sometimes you don't even know that you're loose but he literally the revelation of it looses you it's just like the woman that was caught in ulry she never lifted her head she never lifted her head but when Jesus was standing there he said woman where art thine accusers she didn't have the Revelation yet that the man that was standing there before her was the one that loosed her from her accusers what is it he is the same one that was standing before lazarus's grave he was a du Hallelujah he was a dual nature human being he was a dual being he was both man and he was both God he wept like a man he ate like a man he cried like a man he died like a man but he rose like a god he spoke Lazarus come forth like a god he said peace be still like a [Applause] god come on somebody when William brandham spoke those squirrels into existence he never said in the name of Jesus Christ he said let there be what was it it was a sign that the same son of man had come back in body form again glory be to God oh my I wish somebody had a register that they could put on me I feel like I got 10,000 votes rolling through me he is the answer he's the answer to your habits he's the he is the answer to your addictions he's the answer to it all let me tell you something if you're dealing with alcohol Brother David can stand up and say he's the dissolver of my doubts can I get a witness that he is the answer to the sin question he is the answer to habits he is the answer to problem come on sister Whitney he's the answer to baress come on Sister Crystal he's the answer to the questions that you have is he more than enough I say he's more than [Applause] able come on somebody is he still Jehovah Gyra is he still Jehovah Nish is he still Jehovah Shalom is he still Jehovah shama is he your Victory or is he your defeat I'll say he is my victory he is Jehovah Rah he is my shepherd Jehovah Rafa my [Applause] healer let Dr B rise up let him bring his questions but the pillar of fire is the answer Hallelujah he's the answer to every problem I'll tell you what it is the word literally leads you to him the word literally leads you to him he unravels he unravels he unchains he breaks the Yoke he looses it's exactly what he said in Isaiah 27 that the anointing would be destroy the Yoke it literally the anointing literally breaks it the anointing the supreme power of God breaks the Yoke of the enemy come on it literally breaks it brother brandom has asked a question he's asked a question 1962 and question answer said the question said I live many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother brandom I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored holy again please help me brother brandom I have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again yes here's the answer to the question you have not sin my friend so far and gone but you what you could be restored if you had sin so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored but as long long is there something dealing with your heart you're still in line for restoration [Music] Hallelujah come on somebody I know I'm reading your book you're not sitting that far you got in the building you got a desire to praise him you sitting out there listening to this message over and over again in this community and I want to say to you come get here in the line of restoration come on somebody you give the world a chance why not give God a chance you give drugs a chance why not give God a chance you give pills a chance give God a chance you gave depression a chance give God a chance you gave heartache a chance give God a chance [Applause] Hallelujah you're in line for it you're in line for it open the gate you're in line for it brother Bram goes that little story about Johnny Crow where somebody took that little crow and tied him up to that tied him up to that place Little Johnny Crow had built up an understanding that was as far as he could go that's as far as he could live out but he said there was a good man that came by Johnny Crow and un loosed him and let him go but Johnny Crow stood right there in that place and he kept walking around the same spot because Johnny Crow didn't have an understanding that he was free he goes back to the question will you lay your hands upon me and free me from that he said here this sister dear or brother dear sure I'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you what would free you is for you to understand that you're already free you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free Jesus made you free be not again entangled again in the Yoke of bondage you're as free as you can be you don't have to be tangled up the message literally unraveled your life you had questions do I move here do I keep this job do I do this or do I do that but the message turned the light on and he showed you what the answer was he literally LED you is it possible is it possible to be free is it possible to have that kind of understanding it sure is because the prophet said that you're Justified as if you never done it in the first place God is not looking at you through your problems he's he's looking at the answer Hallelujah you know that it was not a man you know you didn't move here you know that you didn't move out of your altar you you didn't move out of your Pew for some man-made emotion you moved out because the spirit of God was leading you out come on somebody this ain't some man move this is the answer to the devil's question but this ain't some emotional workup because Devils have got that but this is literally the headship oh over the body that's why Paul would say in Galatians 2 and 20 yet not I but Christ that lives within me he hath redeemed me he hath restored me he have set me in this place I read a story this week read a story about this this man that was sitting in DC he sat in DC and it was a soldier as a soldier in Civil War times he's sitting outside the White House and his sitting there looking at it the soldier was just he's literally balling his eyes out the soldier had had lost two of his brothers in the war he lost two of his brothers in the war and he was wanting to talk to the president because his family was without somebody that could work the farm so he wanted to talk to the president this little boy come up to him and said sir what are you crying about he said he said I'm trying to see the president he said but it's real hard to get in there said I can't they won't let me see him he said yeah you're right he said it is real hard he said it is real hard to get in there and see him he said he said maybe come with me real quick so the soldier starts following this little boy starts following this little boy and he he walks past the first guards and the guards don't say nothing to him and he just walks right in walks in past the second guard and just walks right on in now they don't say nothing to him he goes through the front doors and there's guards there they don't say nothing to him and he just keeps walking in and before long he's standing in the Oval Office and the president at that time was Abraham Lincoln and he looks up he said hey son who you got there it was Abraham's son Tad Lincoln that had took this Soldier and had led him in to the White House so it matters who's leading you it matters who's leading you and I want to say this to you it matters when the message of the hour it's ain't some fly night school message it ain't some ideology this is a message of the hour it matters who's leading you if a little bitty boy could lead a little little soldier into the president Hall how much more as the authority as a preacher of this gospel have I got Liberty to lead you right into your healing lead you right into your [Applause] breakthrough you need somebody to lead you in 2007 on September the 10th we about lost a man we about lost our pastor when a fire begin to explode fire explode he was burned 70 75% of his lungs were burnt 177% of his body was burnt his his throat was swelling on him and they literally they got the tubes down this road just in time I say somebody is leading all of these things all of these all of these instruments or these these dynamics of life there's somebody literally leading all the details and we don't just call Brother Ron's name as as just to lift a man up but we call it as a witness that there is somebody leading the events of a person's life that even though they go through questions even though they go through tribulations even though they go through trials Jesus said in this world you will have tribulations but in me you will have peace I have great cheer be of good cheer I have overcome the world there is somebody that is not leading you to tribulation but is leading you to peace brother Ron come out of that took him a long time to get back in the pole pit you remember I I remember going deer hunting with him I remember him trying to just get out of the truck and walk 15 20 yards and sit down and go sit down and trying to hunt because he wanted to be with his boys he'd been robbed from some things and he wanted to be with us and brother Thomas we we'd go over to a certain spot and we'd sit down and and I remember being with him he was coughing all the way through hunting season he coughed through the pull pit he coughed through preaching and but God is the leader of all the details and he was led to go down to Ruth North Carolina and there was a man of God standing there by the name of Eddie bisc that was standing there and it was preaching a message on the order bringing order to chaos and I'd like to share something with you exactly what you stood up for the prophet had people reach reach over and touch someone else lay hand on someone else they to lay hands on one another hey you know what he said deity is not in heaven D in you does this audience believe that then let deity reach out with compassion and touch someone else's shoulder and say in the name of Jesus Christ I'm standing with this brother I'm standing with this sister let's just pray together Heavenly Father this is your commission this is the this is your Holy Spirit this is the voice of God in The Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ is calling for deliverance is calling for healing is calling for these cells oh God to be corrected to for this disorder to come into order that is a very moment that your pastor was standing in that building and he stood to his feet and an oxygen tent come over top of brother Ron and he never struggled with his lungs one day from that moment what was it it was sale on top of sale on top of sale what was it order was brought to the chaos in brother Ron's life it is this same message that has sold you that deity is not in heaven but deity is in you he's the same God brother Ron to bring order to the chaos of your life he is the same God in this building right now why don't you unravel the shackles off of your understanding unravel jealousy unravel your pride unravel yourself when you can unravel and shake the shackles off of your understanding the prophet said that the Holy Spirit could perform a miracle again and you then have the moment and have the authority to say I am free I am healed I am delivered I have the power of God I am a gene seed of God I am the image of God and all things are possible is it possible is it possible is it possible it is can she be the one can't she be the bride I'll say that the same one that was in that Banquet Hall in Ruth North Carolina that could bring an oxygen tent to a man standing it didn't matter who laid his hands on on this one and who laid their hands on that one What mattered was the results what happened to that woman up there that had that sick baby in that balcony when that Mama had something on her heart to pray for that little lady and she gave up her seat said can I pray for you and when she got through the prayer line to William brandom and said you're already healed that woman when she prayed for you brought Deliverance to your home God can use a little housewife God can use a deacon God can use a little child I want to say this loud and clear you are the answer to the devil's question somebody give God praise in the house of the Lord I am completing him he is my everything he is my all he is my joy he is my strength come on somebody he is my provider he is my way maker he is my light in the darkness he is my everything come on somebody he's your Banker he's your lawyer he's your doctor he's your best friend friend when your enemies walk out on you he's right there he said I'd never leave

you're bound with this you don't have an evil spirit that's simply the devil trying to talk you in to talk in his language but the Dynamics of this message change your language I'm not bound I'm free
