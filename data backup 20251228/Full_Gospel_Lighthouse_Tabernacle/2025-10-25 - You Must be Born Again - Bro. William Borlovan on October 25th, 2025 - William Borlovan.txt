While we were yet sinners, while we didn't have our mind on the Lord, didn't really care about the Lord, he already had a plan for you. He already had a redemption laid out for you. He knew you would be here. &gt;&gt; He knew that when he came knocking on your heart, you would desire because you belong to him. You would desire to serve him &gt;&gt; and he has it all taken care of. What a mighty God. From before you ever had a choice, he had you on his mind. &gt;&gt; From cradle to glory, &gt;&gt; he's got it all under control. We get, you know, we get in, as they say, in a tizzy and we get all been out of shape about things and how things can go down here and don't go always like according to our plans, but we're living according to his plan. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? Amen. God bless each and every one of you. Certainly good to see you all in the house of the Lord. We like to welcome you. Thank you, musicians. We like to welcome you to the house of the Lord. Pray you came hungry, ready to feast on the word of the Lord. Amen. We want to continue to remember as was mentioned for uh brother Ron, brother Andrew as they're on the missionary field. We just pray that God will continue to bless them. We'd like to welcome all of our visitors that are with us. I'd like to welcome brother and sister Turner back with us. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jay, Sister Alyssa. Amen. God bless you, Sister Dave. Good to have you in the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless each and every one of you. We'll just go right to the scripture. Not keep you standing. If you'll turn with me to St. John chapter 3 and then in First Peter chapter 1, we'll just have one verse there, but we'll begin in St. John chapter 3. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord, you've got to love his word because he is the word. Amen. We'll begin reading verse one. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he's old, can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it cometh, and whether it goeth." So is everyone that is born of the spirit. Amen. In 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 23 Peter Peter writing here being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. Amen. Let's bow our heads and our hearts. Dear kind heavenly father, we come before you humbly in prayer Lord. Lord, we just acknowledge our and just Father, humble ourselves before you and acknowledge our insufficiency within ourselves. And we just want to surrender to you, Father, both speaker and hear. We just pray you forgive us of our sins. May you come in this service, Lord. And may the supernatural take place, Father, Lord, and may our lives be changed by your word. We love you. We thank you for this opportunity to be in your house in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. With the help of the Lord, I'd like to take a title this this evening here on you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You must be born again. And the word must, that's not an option. &gt;&gt; That's not it' be a good idea. That's not advice. That's not a recommendation. But it's a declaration, a commandment from the very mouth of God himself that we must be born again. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would read that and he would say that that's actually Jesus's first doctrine. That was the first doctrine that he preached was that we must be born again. He was out doing miracles and he he was, you know, dividing the fishes and loaves and he had great crowds. But then he began to start teaching the word and Nicodemus came to him as we read in the scripture there by night and and you know many people criticized Nicodemus for coming by night but the prophet said at least he came &gt;&gt; at least he got to Jesus you know he had a certain status and and and but he still came to Jesus and we find him later in the scripture actually helping take Jesus off the cross. But he came to Jesus and he asked and and he being a great teacher, he he looked at the ministry of Jesus and he said, "Surely with these phenomenal miracles that we've never seen before, surely you come from God. There's you've got to have the truth." &gt;&gt; And he said, "No man can do these works except he be of God." &gt;&gt; So he begins to ask Jesus and and and Nicodemus had to humble himself and he could not understand how can a man be born again. He even asked Jesus the the question, can how can a man can a man literally be born again? And Jesus begins to break down what that means to be born again. Now, Satan, if Jesus mentioned that it that you must be born again, and that was his first doctrine, that means it is a foundation. That means it's foundational. We have to be born again if we are to get our Christian experience right. And as we grow into the knowledge and revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in this message, we need to have the right foundation. &gt;&gt; Because when we don't build a home on the correct foundation, it will then begin to fall. &gt;&gt; So if we try to build our Christian experience and we don't have the correct foundation, there's going to be some things falling apart in our lives. We've got to get things in order and then think God has a provided way for everything. God is a God of order. &gt;&gt; He's not a God of chaos. He's not a god of confusion. He is a god of order. Everything is set in its place. &gt;&gt; So because it is so foundational, Satan has seen to it that in every church age, he always attacks the new birth. &gt;&gt; He always tries to make light of it. He always tries to sidetrack it. Could you imagine as message believers to actually believe that if you came to church and you shook the preacher's hand &gt;&gt; that that gave you the new birth? &gt;&gt; We can't even begin to imagine that. But people actually believe that. &gt;&gt; People believe that because you come and you shake the preacher's hands, God bless you. God bless you. You're born again. You're born again. That's not how it works. We cannot give the Holy Ghost as much as we wish we could to anyone. God is the only one that can give the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if you want the Holy Ghost, you have to come God's provided way to get it. &gt;&gt; Just like there was a certain provided way for you to get here naturally, God has a provided way for us to be born again spiritually. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It could have been a handshake. It could be where where you know where where denominations will put all the emphasis on if you speak in tonesues, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Regardless of what kind of life follows it, &gt;&gt; you keep speaking in tonesues until you're until you you just utter some confusion, live like a devil, but because you spoke in tonesues, you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not emotion. &gt;&gt; It brings emotion. But the Holy Ghost by definition is not emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is not easy belieism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God in the message of Easter Seal, he says, "I'm wondering today is what's happening. Are we really getting the people to God &gt;&gt; or are we just getting them to church? &gt;&gt; Are we really getting the people to God &gt;&gt; or are we getting them to church?" He said we must get them to Christ. &gt;&gt; Where this quickening power, it's good to go to church. Sure. &gt;&gt; If that's as far as we go, it's not far enough. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, that's good. But go on to Christ &gt;&gt; from the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church is not our salvation. The church is a is a body of believers. there. We naturally hear what what my what our eyes see. We are a group of believers that gather ourselves &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; around this unchanging word. But your church attendance does not merit you or me any salvation. &gt;&gt; And I'll even go even preaching the gospel doesn't merit me salvation. I've got to have a new birth just like you have to have a new birth. When I go home, I've got to live this message. Just like when you go home, you've got to live this message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, we must go from the idea that because we belong to a message church that gives us that that that will not get us into heaven. &gt;&gt; In fact, that will make us more responsible because we reheard the truth twice a week &gt;&gt; and hopefully during the week, too. But you at least hear the truth twice a week. And so we then become responsible because Jesus said to whom much is given, much is required. &gt;&gt; So much has been given to us. So there's much to be required of us. &gt;&gt; So we must go from the church to Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the in another sermon, the bomb of Gil in Gilead, he says, you know, the new birth is what people want to dodge. They want to dodge the issue. So the devil patches it up. Said when you believe, that's when you're born again. That's not right. &gt;&gt; Listen, any birth, as I said before, any birth is a mess. I don't care where is that where it's at. If it's in a pig pin, it's a mess. A mess of pigs being born out there, it's a horrible thing. If it's out in a field when a cat's born, it's a horrible thing. If it's out in the pink decorated hospital room, it's a mess. A new birth is a mess. But you have to have that messy thing to bring forth new life. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, dying is the hardest thing for a human to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To walk to, &gt;&gt; we in our in our human nature will do anything to avoid death. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; We'll try and eat healthier. &gt;&gt; We'll try and work out. We'll try We'll try anything we can. &gt;&gt; We'll try and and do anything. But in and in the spiritual, the same thing applies. &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God and you've got to break past yourself to humble yourself &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I don't care how I act. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he wants me to stand on my head, &gt;&gt; to get the Holy Ghost, I'll do it." &gt;&gt; So it doesn't the the pride and and what will people think? &gt;&gt; Come on. That's all got to go out the window. And you got we got to humble ourselves &gt;&gt; and say, "God, if like Buddy Robinson, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, you're going to file a pile. You're going to find a pile of bones right here. &gt;&gt; It's a hard thing, but it's a mess. &gt;&gt; There's no way somebody had a mess getting a new birth and somebody got a new birth." And so that was the most beautiful new birth you've ever seen. &gt;&gt; It's a mess. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus speaking to Nicodemus, he said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit." So see, there's two bodies. There's the flesh and then there's the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now we have three bodies. There's the the earthly, the heavenly, and the glorified. But Jesus is speaking here and Paul picks that up. There's two births. There's a natural birth and there's a supernatural birth. The first birth you is is why we look how we look. That's why you have the personality that you have. That's why you have the problems that you have. &gt;&gt; Is because of the first birth. So, he made a way and that's from our mom and dad. And it's all fleshly. It's all sensual. It's all we're bound by the 10 senses. &gt;&gt; We're bound by the five senses of our body. We're bound by the five senses of our humanity. We've got to look past that. &gt;&gt; So, the first birth is from our mom and dad. The second one comes from above. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:47, he says, "The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthly, such are such are they also that are earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. Now, as we have borne the image of the earthly, so we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Right? &gt;&gt; What does that mean? That means our humanity &gt;&gt; cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; That means we cannot walk into the kingdom of God. We cannot get to heaven because of who our last name is or how we look or our earthly associations or how much money we have. Nothing natural &gt;&gt; goes over there. &gt;&gt; And while I'm here, God does not have any grandchildren. Amen. Preach it. &gt;&gt; He's not a grandpa. &gt;&gt; Everyone, the same young people, the same experience, &gt;&gt; assuming that your parents have the Holy Ghost. The same experience that your parents have, you have got to have. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord carries and you get married and you have children, then your children have to have the same experience you had. &gt;&gt; You cannot hand it down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot give them. As I said earlier, the preacher can't lay his hands on you and in his humanity give you the Holy Ghost. Did they in the book of Acts lay their hands on them and they got the Holy Ghost? Yes. But it wasn't the apostles. It was God still giving them. Because remember the scripture said that the Lord added daily such as should be saved. &gt;&gt; So God does not have any grandchildren. &gt;&gt; It's only sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Good. So we all need our own individual walk &gt;&gt; experience. &gt;&gt; See, we get into the body of Christ individually, one at a time. &gt;&gt; We're birthed into the kingdom. But then when it's time at the time of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're all going to be translated and go up into the rapture as it's called collectively. &gt;&gt; But we're not born again collectively. &gt;&gt; That's for Israel, not for the Gentiles. That's good. &gt;&gt; So in Psalm 51:5, David said, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice. You when you breathe your first breath, you're born a sinner. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Psalm 58:3, "The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray as soon as they are born. As soon as they be born, speaking lies." Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned &gt;&gt; and come short of the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Psalm uh excuse me, Romans 5:12, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." &gt;&gt; But brother William, I was born in the message. &gt;&gt; I never went out in the world. I never smoked a cigarette. I've never drunk a drop. &gt;&gt; I've never coroused. I've never done any evil thing. I'm pure. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; I've lived as clean as possible. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, if your angel wings survive those scriptures, &gt;&gt; this quote should clip them down pretty good. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Which I don't know how angel wings could survive those scriptures because the Bible says, "All have sinned." &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says here. He says, "How are you going to go to heaven?" You say, "I've never sinned in my life." "Oh, the little darling, it was just an angel to begin with." That's a lie. &gt;&gt; I don't care how good you are, you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; And you don't have one thing. There's no priest, no bishop, no cardinal, no pope, no nothing else can save you because he's in the same boat you're in. &gt;&gt; We're going to get to in a few minutes. Just the same shape. The pope of Rome was born in sin &gt;&gt; shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born by the sexual desire of a man and a woman when you where you going to get righteous out of that well his papa and mama were born the same way and when they were born the same way and his grandma and grandpa and on back it's sin to begin with so who can say that this is holy and that's holy there's not one thing holy there's only one thing holy that's Jesus Christ the son of the living God &gt;&gt; who was made perfect and our requirement is to be perfect Now, how are we going to be it? Now, listen what he says here. If I never had an evil thought in my life, if I never spoke a bad word in my life, if I never looked at anything evil, never thought anything evil or nothing, I'm just as rank and black as the smuddy walls of hell. I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; I could come through life and stay locked up in a room like some of the Carmelite sisters or something and never see the world, stay there and pray all my life, do good, born a multi-millionaire, and give to the poor everything I got and I'm still a sinner and will go to hell. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He says, I might join the Lutheran church, Baptist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian. &gt;&gt; I may attend FGLT. when I'm on the cradle roll and live faithful to that church until a hundred years and my life is took and no man could point their finger at me and say he has ever even had as much as a bad thought. &gt;&gt; I'll go to hell just as sure as I'm standing. &gt;&gt; That cuts us all out. &gt;&gt; I'm a sinner. That's correct. I've got nothing. There's no way at all I could find any price to be paid. God required death. &gt;&gt; And if I give my own life, if I give my life, then how can I repent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The debt has to get paid first. &gt;&gt; So if the penalty for sin is death, yes, Lord, I'm a sinner. I deserve to die. Well, the penalty's got to be you got to pay the debt first. So if you give your life for your own sin, then how are you going to repent? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because you're dead. Right. &gt;&gt; See, it's an impossibility. He said, "And God was the only one &gt;&gt; only one &gt;&gt; who could lay his life down and take it up again." &gt;&gt; So he says, "So he could become sin." Now remember, he wasn't born sin. He was not sinful. He became sin. Brother, where did the sin come from? Right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. every human being on earth. &gt;&gt; So he took on that sin on himself and he paid the debt first. &gt;&gt; But what separated him from man is he was God. &gt;&gt; So he was able to die, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then resurrect. &gt;&gt; The debt's paid. &gt;&gt; Now to have the Holy Ghost is to be born again. &gt;&gt; There's no difference. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I want to just labor on this just a little bit to save in save some confusion. You keep following the message in the church age book. Brother Ram clarifies this beautifully. To have the Holy Ghost is to be born again. To be born again is to have the token. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't become born again and then you go on to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now he says, I'll read the quote real fast. He says, "Now before we leave the subject, I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to the word. It's not according to me. It's not according to you. It has to be according to thus sayith the Lord or we are falsely led. He says to begin with, you will notice that in my meetings when I have finished preaching an evangelistic service or some teaching message, I cast the net and invite a response from the people. I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit. My Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I'm inviting people to come forward and be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again. So when I invite those who are spiritfilled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit, these dear ones search forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and to believe, to speak in tongues. This has caused a great deal of confusion. I want to tell you exactly what I mean. I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched. In other words, to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost. It is one and the same. &gt;&gt; So what does being born again mean? What is it? &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It is the literal life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It is not an allegory. It is not a story. It's not a type. It's not a figment. It's not It's kind of like this. It's No, it is a literal. Everyone understand literal. &gt;&gt; Like this is literally a bottle of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is literally the life of Christ &gt;&gt; coming back and living in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Good. &gt;&gt; You talk about a love story &gt;&gt; to come and for God Almighty to come to leave glory and to come and to redeem us and want to live in us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the anchor that keeps the flesh and human spirit in check. Because remember, your flesh is not born again. &gt;&gt; Your human spirit is not born again. When you get born again and get the Holy Ghost, it is on the level of your soul. We are a triune being. We have a flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That is what we see. We have the human spirit which would be like our personality, reasoning and memory and affection and and it's our mood. That's our human spirit. And then there's the soul. Now God, that's where God is concerned, &gt;&gt; right? Because if he can get brother Noah our souls exactly with filled with the Holy Ghost which is what his plan is and we become born again then the Holy Ghost begins to permeate itself on the way on from the inside out and the world will then begin to to to drop off &gt;&gt; different attitudes and different situations of life will begin to take care of itself because you are have you have a fountain that never runs dry. What did Jesus said? He that's born again will have rivers of water like flowing out of his belly. &gt;&gt; A fresh artisian well. When you get depressed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You have something for that. &gt;&gt; There is a prescription for that. &gt;&gt; Peter wrote it out. &gt;&gt; There may be some side effects. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Come on. &gt;&gt; Your life will get cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Your marriage will improve. &gt;&gt; Your family life will improve. &gt;&gt; For everything we have need of the Holy Ghost is the answer to everything. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the answer to everything. It don't our problems can come from a a million different directions, &gt;&gt; right? And I promise you Jesus is the answer for every single problem. &gt;&gt; Every single problem, &gt;&gt; every single situation, every single worry. He is the center &gt;&gt; of our lives. He should be the center of our lives. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a keeping power that keeps you when you can't keep yourself. &gt;&gt; When you The Holy Ghost will also do this. when you don't feel like your prayers, Sister Dorothy, are getting this high, &gt;&gt; but yet you're standing on what he said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; Because remember, we stand on the word &gt;&gt; regardless of if we feel the emotion coming behind it or not. &gt;&gt; It's not the emotion that gives us the confirmation. It's what he said in his word. Like brother Ram trying to teach the Pentecostals about speaking in tongues. He said, "If I've got the tongue of a shoe, do I have the whole shoe?" Well, no. The tongue is a part of a shoe, &gt;&gt; but it's not the whole shoe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in St. John 16:7, "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come. But if I depart, I will send him unto you." The Holy Ghost is proof that Jesus was real &gt;&gt; because how could you? Because remember he said if I go not away I can't send the spirit but if I go away I'm going to send the spirit back. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is actually evidence brother Jonathan that that Jesus Christ came and lived &gt;&gt; and because he died is how the Holy Ghost then became available to us. Without his death, the Holy Ghost would have stayed bottled up in him. If Jesus would would have come and he would have done his ministry and he would have vanished like Melzdc, we would be helpless, hopeless, and lost. &gt;&gt; But because his body was broken, that's what released the elements of the new birth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And made the Holy Ghost available for us. &gt;&gt; Right? And then this also the Holy Ghost also proves that he ascended because he said I go back to the father and then the comforter &gt;&gt; which is God in spirit form will come back to you. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Now how do we get into him? 1 Corinthians 12:13. For by one spirit we are for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have all been made to drink into one spirit. So the way back into his body is the way it came out of his body. &gt;&gt; Remember in St. John 19 when they came to Jesus and the sun was going down and they had to to to hurry up the crucifixion. They went and when they would crucify somebody, they would break their legs because that' make the weight of their body come down and it would kill them quicker. It was an act of mercy they called. But when they so they broke the the two thieves legs, but when they came to Jesus, because there was a scripture that said, "Not a single bone of him was broken." &gt;&gt; When that soldier reared back that hammer, whatever they had, that scripture stood right there would not let him swing it. &gt;&gt; That's how perfect the scripture is. &gt;&gt; Because when Moses gave them order to do Passover, they were not to break a single bone of that lamb on in the Exodus. So, one of the soldiers grabbed a spear and went up to him. And when he he thrust that spear in his side, water and blood came out of his side. &gt;&gt; And he said, and then Jesus cried out on the cross, "Father, into my into thy hands I commend my spirit." Right there, you have the elements of the new birth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; That was the antiype. Whenever whenever God put Adam to sleep in the Garden of Eden and put him to sleep and took Eve out of his side, out of a rib out of his side, that was a type of what was happening on the cross. &gt;&gt; We came from the side of Jesus Christ. Our new birth, what we needed to be with him for all eternity came out of him. Water, blood, and a spirit. So the only way to get back into him spiritually is by water, blood, and spirit &gt;&gt; by justification, sanctification, and then the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, in 1 John 5:7, John speaking here again. He says, "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. These three are one, and there are three in verse eight that bear witness in the earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three agree in one. Now there's a world of difference between being one &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and then agreeing in one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So whenever something is one like the father, the word, and the holy ghost, that means if you have one, you have all three. &gt;&gt; If you have the son, you have the father and you have the spirit. &gt;&gt; If you got the spirit, you got the father, you got the word. It's all one. That's good. &gt;&gt; But now there's three that bear witness in earth. The spirit, the water, and the blood. Now these three agree in one. &gt;&gt; So agreeing means they're all pointing you in the same direction in the same destination. But if they only agree in ones, that means you can have one without having the other &gt;&gt; because they're not one, but they agree in one. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; You can have the the the father, the son, the holy ghost. You can have the word, the spirit. It's all the same thing. Just like the Holy Ghost, the new birth, and the token is the same thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you can be justified without being sanctified. &gt;&gt; You can be justified and sanctified without having the Holy Ghost because they agree in one. &gt;&gt; So it's a process just like a birth, a natural birth is a process. &gt;&gt; Amen. So justification simply just means you acknowledge you're a sinner &gt;&gt; and you realize you need God. &gt;&gt; It's like you're walking in a certain direction and somebody taps you on the shoulder and you go. You turn from your sin. You turn from what you're doing and you begin to repent and you believe that the blood of Jesus cleanses you from all sin and you put your faith in that. It's simple. That's right. &gt;&gt; You confess your sins. You put it under the blood. It don't matter what you've done. Whatever. God puts it &gt;&gt; in the sea of forgiveness. God puts it under his blood. It's over. You're justified. That gives you some freedom. &gt;&gt; But don't stop. &gt;&gt; Because remember, as the Bible says in First Peter 3:21, "Baptism doth now also save us." And Peter says, "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." So when we come here and we're baptized, we are expressing to the church that something happened in us. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; That we have now turned around. We're now repented of our sins. We are identifying oursel in the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. But that's just part of the justified state. But there's still things hanging on you in your life. &gt;&gt; Wrong things, wrong habits. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, someone can smoke and hate doing it. &gt;&gt; Someone can drink and hate doing it. &gt;&gt; Someone can be addicted to pornography and hate it. &gt;&gt; They know it's wrong and they just begin to repent. God, I I I'm sorry I smoked another cigarette. I'm sorry. I just feel so bad. I hate doing it. God, please forgive me. &gt;&gt; He'll forgive you. &gt;&gt; But you still crave it. So, you need God to take away that desire out of your life &gt;&gt; to where actually you don't even want it anymore. or you can't stand the smell or or whatever that weakness, that troubling that that that that that sin is in your life, you don't desire it. That means you're justified. Keep keep it under the blood. Keep asking God to forgive you, but then ask God to start taking it away from you. &gt;&gt; Don't just use justification as a crush and say, "Well, bless God, man. I love to drink. I know God will forgive me." &gt;&gt; Then you make grace a disgrace. But even if if you still have the desire but you hate it, ask God to take it away from you. Ask God to sanctify you. &gt;&gt; Sanctification is cleansing. And then God sets you aside for service, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Now, don't get the born again experience confused with sanctification, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you Now, let me just put this in here real fast. Even if you have the Holy Ghost, sanctification, justification, and even the Holy Ghost is not I've got the Holy Ghost, so bless God, I don't have to repent. I don't ever have to be sanctified of nothing anymore because I've got the Holy Ghost. I've done been through all three things. No, you've got to be cleansed every day. You've got to be You see things the enemy trying to creep in in your life. You say, "Lord, take that away from me. I don't want it. What are you doing?" You're keeping yourself sanctified. You're keeping yourself under the blood. You come in a service like this and the Holy Ghost is so thick, you say, "God, refill me with the Holy Ghost. I need more of you. I need more of you than I've ever had before." You keep repeating that cycle. You never stop. You never quit. You don't Being born again, Brother Gabriel. Being born again is not a graduation. &gt;&gt; It's actually a beginning. &gt;&gt; You're just now starting to live. Do you want me to tell you what the graduation is? Well done. Thou good and faithful servant, enter in the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you from the foundation of the world. That's the graduation party, Brother Matt. &gt;&gt; Getting born again, you're just learning how to walk. You're learning how to, you know, you're part of the family now. &gt;&gt; You're part of God's family, but you're still going to stumble. You're still going to fall. You're still going to scrape your knees. You're still going to going to make mistakes. You're still going to say things &gt;&gt; that you shouldn't. &gt;&gt; Come on. And &gt;&gt; if you don't believe that, get a toddler in your house. &gt;&gt; We have to constantly cleanse ourselves. &gt;&gt; So there is an initial process that you go through justification. And they're distinct. They're clear. They're beautiful. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Justification is a beautiful thing to see someone come off the street, be a drug addict, be prostitute. I don't care what. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And then to come and get cleaned up and be and want to serve God. &gt;&gt; That is a beautiful powerful thing that only the blood of Jesus can do. &gt;&gt; And then you start noticing that they quit wearing makeup and they let their hair grow and &gt;&gt; they quit wearing pants or whatever. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden they God starts cleansing things out of their lives. &gt;&gt; Then they're ready for the Holy Ghost. Now there's temptations and there's desires &gt;&gt; and there's a big difference between the two. &gt;&gt; So a temptation is comes from the enemy and they're a trap that comes from the outside not out of you. It comes from the outside and Satan is trying to trick you to fall, trying to tempt you to do evil, trying to tempt you to do wrong. &gt;&gt; But your desire &gt;&gt; is to please God. There it is. &gt;&gt; Your desire is to live for him. &gt;&gt; Now, the new birth does not make us spiritual robots. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To where God just gets a thumb drive, Brother Jim, and he just puts it right there and he downloads his whole will. He downloads every step you got to make. In a way, it kind of be nice because then you don't have to make any mistakes, right? You just know exactly what God wants you to do. You know exactly what God everything. That's a bad robot, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that's not that's not God wants us to overcome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God ain't going to have robots in heaven. &gt;&gt; He's gonna He wants you if it it pleases him just like you can just imagine how it made him smile. Sit there and look at Job and he knew what was in Job. And Job with through all of that refused to curse God. &gt;&gt; No matter what Satan did to him, Job refused to curse God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the new birth, as I said, does not make a spiritual robots and it does not do away with your free moral agency. &gt;&gt; You can make a terrible mistake, &gt;&gt; but then he'll pay for it. You reap what you sow. That that's God's law. He'll forgive you. But yet, the new birth will align your desire with his. &gt;&gt; Whereas the first birth, you wanted to do what you wanted to do. &gt;&gt; You wanted to go and and and chase what you wanted to chase. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now since a messy experience, you're like, "God, what do you want out of my life?" &gt;&gt; You see the difference in the humility instead of I'm going to be this and I'm going to be that. There's nothing wrong with ambition and and you know, hard work and ambition. I'm all for that. But you got to channel that through the word of God, a thinking man's filter. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So it aligns your desire with his. &gt;&gt; You make mistakes, but you don't have the desire to do so. And then some people can look the part but have a desire for the things of the world. &gt;&gt; See, so they can look like they're Christians. They can look like they're believers, but on the inside they have a desire for the things of the world. That is why we need a new birth &gt;&gt; because we were all born with that. And I want to just inject here my my a part of my little testimony here. I grew up in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. my whole family, most of my my very large family did. &gt;&gt; But see, growing up in the message is a wonderful blessing, Brother Jerry, &gt;&gt; but it's not a shortcut. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing, but not a shortcut. &gt;&gt; So, growing up, you know, we'd listen to tapes a lot and just, you know, hear my parents talk about you need the Holy Ghost. We all need the Holy Ghost. We need the Holy Ghost. So, I began to desire it. And I'd pray. I didn't even know what it I didn't really understand what it was. I just knew I needed it because that's what I heard. So that's what I would pray. That's what I'd pray. That's what I'd pray. I didn't understand everything, but I knew I needed it. So when I was about 12, I had a dream. My sister, older sister, was also believing for the Holy Ghost and and praying and things. And I had a a wonderful dream. I dreamed that we were both kneeling at the foot of a man. He was in a white robe. And my sister in the dream had gotten the Holy Ghost. And this man had laid his hands on my head. And my sister in the dream said, "William, you're you're getting the Holy Ghost." And I'll never forget, I was 12. A sensation went from the top of my head. I've never experienced nothing quite like this. And as and I could feel it traveling through my body. And as it left, I didn't feel it anywhere else. And it literally went out my toes. And I woke up and I was it woke me up. So, I began to I told the dream to my family and I began to testify that I got the Holy Ghost. I even printed it and framed my little testimony that I had the Holy Ghost. But a few years as time went by and a few years went by, my life and the desires I still had did not line up with what I what I felt in that dream. &gt;&gt; So, what was I to do? either it was a beautiful sweet spiritual dream but the the the final evidence is a reality of your life &gt;&gt; now that could even have been God showing for showing me but I took it as when I felt the sensation that's when I got it but my life following after did not follow the dream &gt;&gt; it was a sweet dream but I did not have the Holy Ghost that way &gt;&gt; right In the church age book, brother Ray would make a statement, we have gone by experience and not the word. &gt;&gt; He said away with experience as your measuring line. There's only one plum line, only one rod. That is the word. &gt;&gt; He said, Paul said, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? This is the whole of our problem right here. People repent of their sins. They get baptized in waters, but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost. You believe unto receiving the spirit. Believing on Jesus is a step in the right direction, which is toward the Holy Ghost. But people stop there. &gt;&gt; You've got to go all the way. &gt;&gt; So, a few years later, I was 15. And let me also let me let me say this. How many people here are still single? Okay. Take this opportunity in your life to listen to the message, to study the word, &gt;&gt; to pray, read your Bible, all them things &gt;&gt; like never before. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why, preacher?" Because whenever, just as the scripture says, whenever you get married and ever family comes along, life, even though you think you're really busy now, and I'm not denying that, but if you think you're busy now, wait till you have a family. &gt;&gt; You'll never have the time that you have right now. &gt;&gt; So, whenever you invest, whenever you make that spiritual investment within yourself, &gt;&gt; when the God sends you a mate, and while you're at it, pray for a mate. Say, "God, if if you're not if you know, if you don't feel like they're around, say, God, wherever they are, you bring them to me. &gt;&gt; Bring me to them. Pray for that person." But you're making that spiritual investment in yourself so that when you do get married, y'all are going to be awesome husbands. &gt;&gt; Y'all are going to be wonderful wives. Y'all are going to be wonderful mothers. Y'all are going to be wonderful fathers. Why? Because you're investing in your future. Because now when you come home from work, you come home from school, you don't have the distraction of having to provide and all the things that come with life. You don't have the trials that you have as you get older. &gt;&gt; So make that investment in yourself now. &gt;&gt; Good job. &gt;&gt; So I was 15 years old and trying to do this and I was listening to and I was still, you know, crying out to God and God had revealed to me there were things in my life that wasn't right. Now remember, he's not going to fill you if you're not sanctified correctly. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's not going to fill the glass if it's still dirty. &gt;&gt; So my glass still had to be cleaned. So once my glass got clean, I was in my bedroom by myself and I would listen to the tape of souls that are in prison now. And the prophet of God begins to go through there and he's preaching on the third pool and and and when the part of the third pool and mercy is over and he had that vision of hell and my goodness when I heard that I knew I never wanted to go to a place like that. &gt;&gt; Now everybody has their own sermon. Some people come to the Lord and get the new birth on just on a very on on a very like I guess if I if I can say this correct like a very like a positive note. But those that are in this prison now is a very is a powerful sermon, but it's one of them. &gt;&gt; It'll grip you. &gt;&gt; You having the Holy Ghost that'll still grip you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll make you check up. It's just one of them sermons. And I fell on my knees right by my bed. No preacher, no, you know, it don't have to be. It can be in church. Praise the Lord if it is, but it doesn't have to be. What was that young man that got it on a lawn mower? All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; And I cried out to God. And let me tell you something. It was a mess. &gt;&gt; But it brought life. &gt;&gt; It brought life. So, how do I become born again? How do I get the Holy Ghost? As I said in Acts 2:38, Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. You have to die. &gt;&gt; The only way for Jesus Christ to live in you is you have got to die. In Psalm 51:17, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, oh God, thou will not despise." Jesus said in in Matthew 16:25, "For whosoever shall save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall will lose his life for my sake shall find it." &gt;&gt; That's a deep statement right there. How can I save my life by losing it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You lose your first life, &gt;&gt; and you're going to get it in the second in the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way you can be reborn is to completely die to yourself. That's right. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If you cry out to God for the Holy Ghost and you've got and you've got a streak of of of like a reservement, there's a part of your life you just don't want to give up, God's not going to fill you. &gt;&gt; Because remember, God can see that. We'll come and we'll pray for you. But God knows your heart when you come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he knows if you're really really fully surrendering, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Any part of you that's unsurrendered cannot be reborn. &gt;&gt; You've got to be willing to die out of everything, all your worldly desires, ambitions. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God was saying in the token, full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the token. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Full obedience. So, somebody cannot get the Holy Ghost baptized in titles &gt;&gt; because they haven't fully obeyed. Somebody can't get the Holy Ghost if they haven't been sanctified because they haven't fully obeyed. Somebody can't get the Holy Ghost or get born again when they haven't even repented. &gt;&gt; Full obedience to the word will entitle you to the token. Think about that. It means then it's your inheritance. You are entitled to it. It belongs to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it requires full obedience. &gt;&gt; Abel knew what this meant. Abel was ready and willing to die with the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He was not willing when when he was not willing to appease Cain by being inclusive and saying, "I'll tell you what, Cain. Here's this bloody, messy, nasty sacrifice, but let me get some of you a fruit and just that way we can all get along. You know, you you're really upset about it, but let's just add some fruit to this altar. No, it was blood only. Blood alone. &gt;&gt; In the resurrection of of Lazarus, brother said, Abel led his lamb away by a grape vine, sacrificed him on the altar, and Abel died on the same altar his sacrificed lamb died. And every believer that comes to Christ must die &gt;&gt; on the same altar with his dying lamb, Christ, and die in Christ to be a new creature. Die out to the things of the world and become born again, a new creature in Christ Jesus. Die on the same altar of self-sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But as as human beings in our first birth, we try that. There's pride, maybe a little arrogancy, and there's things that we withhold. &gt;&gt; It's simple. But it's so hard for the human element. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's so hard to just say, "Lord, I'm just no good." It's easy. It's simple, should I say? But you got to be willing to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Galatians 2:20, Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." You're not really ready to live for this message until you're ready to die for it. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. You're not fit to live until you're fit to die. &gt;&gt; You've got to be so convinced. &gt;&gt; Abel never compromised on his revelation. Now think whenever Abel had whenever remember full obedience to the word entitled you to the token. Abel had his lamb on that altar and what did God do? There was canaines here fruit beautiful gold most beautiful thing you've ever seen and Abel's nasty looking altar over here all bloody. So how did Cain and Abel know which one pleased God? God consumed Abel's sacrifice. The fire of God came down and fell on Abel's sacrifice. And God vindicated Abel's sacrifice. And that is what caused the jealousy and hatred to swell up within Cain. &gt;&gt; As long as both sacrifices were laying there, scripture versus scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Quote versus quote. But which one is God going to vindicate? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God preached out of the same Bible as the trinitarian. &gt;&gt; Same Bible. &gt;&gt; But which ministry did God vindicate? &gt;&gt; When God came down and vindicated Abel's message, that's how God spoke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times on tape do you hear the prophet of God preach and he's coming to the end of his sermon and he said, "Now, if I've told you the truth, Let God come and back me up. &gt;&gt; He would never back up. He'd never vindicate a lie. &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated message. When God sees when God looks down and he sees you willing to lay yourself on the altar and he knows that you're just done with yourself, &gt;&gt; that you're literally done with yourself. &gt;&gt; He'll come down in a Holy Ghost fire and he'll consume you. He'll consume your life. You lay yourself down on the altar and say, "God, I've got nothing but myself. I want to lay myself down on the exact same altar and he'll come down and he'll consume you. In Romans 6:11, Paul says, "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection, &gt;&gt; knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; You think of Elijah when he went down to challenge the children of bell. You talk about God consuming the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He went and he had a vision what was going to happen and he goes and he be and he he makes a the prophet of God called their Mount Carmel showdown. And he told call all the prophets of B. said, "You get them all together and you do the sacrifices and let the God that answers by fire &gt;&gt; be God." &gt;&gt; You talk about an unmistakable challenge. It is a clear distinction. The God that answers by fire, &gt;&gt; let that God be God. So, we know the story. And they begin to cut themselves and call on him all day. But in the e at the time of the evening sacrifice in the evening time Elijah begins to rebuild the altar of God. He begins to restore proper worship in Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tell he tells him fill. So not only did he lay the sacrifice all out, but he actually made it more impossible. He said fill four barrels full of water. And they just said pour it on sacrifice. And here goes four. Do it again. Boy, them servants must have been tired. Doing it again. A third time. Do it again. &gt;&gt; 12 barrels of water. It kept getting more impossible, more impossible, more soaking, more soaking. More soaking. &gt;&gt; And then First Kings 18:36, "And it came to pass, sorry, let's read down in verse 38, 37. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, that thou has turned their heart back again. Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, "The Lord, he is God. The Lord, he is God." &gt;&gt; I say amen to that. Samson, he wouldn't fully surrender his life. He surrendered his strength, but remember he wouldn't surrender his heart. So what happened? We all know the story. He found himself in a layan condition. &gt;&gt; He fell asleep in the lap of a woman of ill fame. She lied to him that she loved him. Let me tell you, the world, Satan through the world, through your worldly friends or associates or whatever that's trying to get you away from this truth &gt;&gt; is lying that they love you. &gt;&gt; They're lying that they're your friends. They're lying that they have your back. &gt;&gt; So Samson found himself in the leotan condition and he was sport for the enemy. You think about that here. He went from such mighty victories, killing a thousand Philistines with a with a brittle jawbone of a mule and carrying the gates of Gaza uphill and just impossible feats of strength when the anointing of God would fall upon him. And then at his end, his eyes are put out. He's no doubt naked and he he's he's miserable. He's blind. He's lost everything and he's grinding in the meal for the enemy. Come on. &gt;&gt; If that's not a le oysian condition, I don't know what is. &gt;&gt; Brother dramatizing and he said that Samson, what must be going through Samson's mind of all the victories that he's won? And he's beginning to to to break in on a conversation here between Samson and the boy. And he said, "Little boy, put one of my hands upon this post. It's possible. Oh my. Lead me to the post that holds this because I want to rest my hands. I'm tired. I've been made fun of long enough." In other words, brother Ray, brother Ray, he was looking for that loadbearing wall. &gt;&gt; That's what he was really looking for. He said, 'I know, Samson speaking here says, 'I know, Lord, what it's going to cost, but maybe you will. There is a possibility. You're full of mercy. I failed you, Lord. He said, that ought to be the cry of the church tonight. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Ron preached on once on um try again last weekend. &gt;&gt; You talk about Samson trying again. That's right, &gt;&gt; little lad. Would you put my hand upon one pillar? Yes. Put my hand upon the other pillar? Yes. Is my hands placed right? He couldn't even see. Yes, they are right. And he started to pray. He said, "Lord, revenge my eyes." In other words, I've done wrong, but just once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There stood that big bulk of frame, powerless and helpless. All at once, he began to feel something happening. every fiber in his body began to fill with the power of God. He said, "Those big brrawy muscles straightened up and he crushed it together. Let me die with him, Lord. Let me die with him. You raised me to destroy it. Now I built myself up around it. Let me destroy myself with it. My reputation, my whatever it is, let me destroy it. I want to see the power of God again." Amen. &gt;&gt; Samson's heart in the last few minutes of his life was finally ready to fully surrender. &gt;&gt; Look at what condition he had to get in before he was able to finally fully surrender. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when Samson was finally willing to surrender, he got more done in five minutes, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Than he did in his entire life put together. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he killed more Philistines at that event. That's &gt;&gt; right. that all came to watch and spectate and make fun of Samson. He killed more at that moment than he did his entire life &gt;&gt; because he fully surrendered. The prophet says, "Always when the power of God comes in, the walls that you've built around you fall. &gt;&gt; Your denominational walls will crush and God will be known again." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. his every fiber filling with the Holy Ghost, every muscle filled, every bit of his body was filled up with the Holy Ghost. That was Samson's greatest victory. When he was ready to die, Moses was raised in the message. &gt;&gt; He was raised and he was groomed by his mother that he was the deliverer. So at the age of about 40 years old, he was willing to surrender his throne, but he wasn't ready to surrender his heart fully yet. He still had his own ideas on how to be a deliverer. But then God took him in the wilderness for another 40 years and had to get it all out of him. So when he was 80 years old, you're never too old to be used of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was 80 years old, God got his attention with a burning bush. And let me say this, we all need our own burning bush experience. &gt;&gt; The prophet would call it sacred sands. He said, "Oh, for those sacred sands, he has to take every real child there. He gets you on those places where there's no devil can ever come. There's no teacher can ever explain it away. He gives you something on those sands back there that of experience that you'll never forget as long as the ages roll on. No matter how atheiotic your mother, your daddy, your husband, wife, your associates may become, every true believer has that spot where God met them. &gt;&gt; Now, that is very, very important because Satan is going to test you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, I've had to take Satan back so many times to that spot. There's like a game trail. There ain't no grass growing there. &gt;&gt; Because he's going to try you. That's why you got to have a undeniable new birth experience. Because when Satan comes against you, and he will, you can say, "No, come back, devil. This is where it happened. This is where I got my new birth." And there's nothing that you can do to convince me that that didn't happen. that belongs to you. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every true believer has that spot. There isn't one left out. Every believer has it. Every believer that's born of the kingdom of God knows that spot, that minute, that hour where God took him. That is your sister Stephanie. That is your sacred moment. &gt;&gt; Sister Gabriella, that is your sacred moment. And nothing can ever take that away from you. Moses, after that burning bush experience, he was ready. He had a lot of supernatural vindication. But do you know the highlight of his ministry in Egypt, was not the fleas, was not the flies, was not the frogs, was not the turn of the water to blood. The highlight of his ministry, Brother Chris, was the token. That was the highlight of Moses's ministry &gt;&gt; because all them other things was just to vindicate Moses. &gt;&gt; Vindicate that God spoke was dealing with Moses and it was time to go. &gt;&gt; So we have to do you believe this message enough to apply the token &gt;&gt; after all the manifestations and all the vindication that we seen. Do we believe the message enough to say God sent us a prophet? Right. &gt;&gt; We have got to apply the token &gt;&gt; to our lives, to our homes, &gt;&gt; because it's time to leave. &gt;&gt; Israel had to believe Moses. Now, whenever they were applying the token, there was no thunder and lightning. And it was a very solemn thing, but they had to believe the word of a prophet &gt;&gt; that it was time to apply the token. Brother Ram says, "You say,"I believe. Yes, I believe the message." That's all right. That's good. But you must have the token. &gt;&gt; Remember the new birth, the token, the Holy Ghost is all the same thing. He says, "Do you hear brand of tabernacle?" I like to say, "Do you hear FGLT?" &gt;&gt; You must have the token displayed. Without it, all your believing is in vain. &gt;&gt; See, you'll live a good life. You'll listen to what the word says. You'll go to church. You'll try and live right. That's fine. But that's not it. When I see the blood, that is the token. &gt;&gt; Think of how close somebody can be to have a bucket of blood but be too ashamed or be too proud or whatever and to stick it in the corner of their house. Don't miss the rapture with this message in your house. Don't miss the rapture with the picture of the prophet on the wall. Get the token. That within itself is not the token. But get to what he said. He's pointing us to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied with just a good life. I want him. I want the token. &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "If only in this life we have hope in Christ, we're of all men most miserable." That's right. &gt;&gt; When you have the token and you have the Holy Ghost, put it under any test and it'll prove itself. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Whenever a man comes around a woman with a token, it's laying there." &gt;&gt; When a woman comes around a man that's not her husband, the token is laying there. When you go around in in your daily life, the token is there. &gt;&gt; When nobody is watching, no human eyes are watching, the token is there. &gt;&gt; You've got to be identified with your sacrifice. You can't just have it. It's not good enough to kill the lamb and like I said, you put it in a bucket. It's got to be applied. You cannot be ashamed to have the token on display. Remember the literal blood of Jesus having it on your having it on your hands did not bring a person redemption or the Roman soldiers would have been saved but it's the life behind the blood. &gt;&gt; Now this new birth we're going to find a a spot to close here. the new birth. There's an evidence of a new birth. In 2 Corinthians 5:17, one of my favorite scriptures says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new." One of the evidences of a new birth when you have the Holy Ghost is that this word is everyday living to you. So, what does everyday living to me mean? Well, that means that it's just like breathing. &gt;&gt; No one's got to sit there and say, "Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out." It just happens. Your heart just beats. It's just living. &gt;&gt; That's what this word is. If you find yourself struggling to live and you're finding yourself struggling with parts of the word, not that you can't understand, but if you find yourself having trouble accepting parts of the word, you need a new birth. &gt;&gt; You need a new birth. This word is everyday living to you. If the earth truly receives an apple seed, it'll produce apples. So, the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost, the prophet said, is to be able to say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the best way to say amen with the word of God &gt;&gt; is with your life. We say amen with our mouth. &gt;&gt; But the real amen is with your life. &gt;&gt; Now see, brother Brandham would bring out certain points. See, you have to realize he was dealing with certain congregations who put so much on love. You've got to love. No matter what the Bible says or don't matter how you live, you just have to love, love, love, love. So, Brother Brand would have to get there and dispel that and say, you know, who showed more love? &gt;&gt; Who showed more fruits of the spirit? You had certain ideologies that said it's just the fruits of the spirit. And then he would come down and say, "All right, who showed more fruits of the spirit? When Jesus when he cast down the money changers tables or that kind old priest?" &gt;&gt; So he was, you have to realize who he was talking to. But that does not do away with the fact that the fruits of the spirit are the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; That don't mean that somebody can get a message book, hold it on their arm, and say, "Bless God, I say amen to every word of God." And live like a devil. Right? &gt;&gt; Because they say amen and they've got a quote to say that I said amen to every word. So the prophet of God said I got the Holy Ghost. No, &gt;&gt; you don't have the life, you don't have the life. You don't have the life, you're not born again. You don't have his life. &gt;&gt; So whenever a prophet said that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he that can believe the word and receive it, it's actually magnifying the fruits of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you listen to that to the token message, he talks about love being the evidence all through it as well. So don't get sidetracked. There are fruits of the spirit and they are in Galatians 5:22. But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust. So if like like I said a few moments ago, if you plant an apple seed, you're going to get apples. So if you plant, in other words, a new birth, if a new birth comes inside of you, you're going to get the fruits of the spirit. You're going to say, "Amen. You're going to believe every part of this message. Even the things you can't understand, you'll believe it because you know what? As I said, the new birth, you're you're just coming into things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You don't immediately just mature and just know all things. Nobody does. &gt;&gt; We grow. And the way you grow is by you eating. If you quit eating, a child quits eating, they'll become malnourished. &gt;&gt; Because when God, let me I'll say I'll say this too. When God gives you the Holy Ghost, God is always sweet. The Lord Jesus is always so sweet. &gt;&gt; But whenever you're a newborn babe, he takes special he takes really good care of you. and he draws himself very near to you. And that is the time you got to constantly eat. You got to constantly drink because let me tell you a Christian life is a journey. &gt;&gt; And the journey is not always through an oasis. The journey is not just always by the river and lowanging fruit and everything so wonderful. You're going to go through some times. You're going to go through some droughts. You're going to go through some sticky places. And you got to be so well rooted &gt;&gt; and you got to tap into that that that river that flows from within you, that new birth. You got to be tapped in &gt;&gt; like David said in Psalm 1 that he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. &gt;&gt; Our experience has got to live. It's got to live. Remember when Jesus getting ready to close, when Jesus, he was God from the first breath to the last, he's still God. But when Jesus went to the River Jordan, the Holy Ghost came on him and he was anointed for his earthly ministry. When John the Baptist came and he said, "I have need to be baptized." When he came to John, he said, "I have need to be baptized of thee." And what did Jesus tell him? Suffer it to be so. Now, when the Holy Spirit, when John seen the Holy Spirit descend upon him like a dove, watch the order of the scripture, what did that same Holy Spirit that anointed him? What did that Holy Spirit do with Jesus? Took him right into the wilderness &gt;&gt; to be tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; The spirit allow me to go through hard times and hard temptations. It did him &gt;&gt; and it will us. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, no matter where you are in your journey, we're all on a journey. &gt;&gt; We're a a body of believers and and and we love every single one of you. &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy ever the circumstances of life or the circumstances of of fellowship or whatever it is, don't ever let the enemy think put in your mind that we don't love you with all of our heart. every single one of you. &gt;&gt; And we want our desire as ministers is that we all go in the rapture together. &gt;&gt; That is our desire. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, when when the preaching gets going, it may feel like it just it just you have to draw your toes in, but you know, that's that's out of love. That &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for a prophet that told you the truth? &gt;&gt; There's one quote. I didn't get to it, but he said, "You have to die. The problem is people don't stay there long enough. He said, "You have to rot." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Sorry." He said, "I don't know how else to say." He said, "That's just sass religion." He said, "You but you have to rot." In another spot when he's telling his life story, he talked about him being sick or or something about puking. And he said, "Excuse me." He said, "But I'm just as sick when I puke as you are when you vomit." He just used good old English. And that's what we like. Just tell us what you mean. &gt;&gt; He wasn't pro. He wasn't polished and proper and this and that. And I'm thankful for it because I know I I know what he means. &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful that we have the word that no matter how much it even hurt him to have trinitarian friends and all them things and he would preach the godhead and he wouldn't budge a bit on it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what real love is. &gt;&gt; Do you remember that woman? I don't even know why I'm here, but do you remember that woman that was a Sunday school teacher, &gt;&gt; right? And brother Ram was trying to get her and as a prophet he could see that she was getting a call on her life and she he tried to get her and and and deal with her and he and she got embarrassed and she got out after him after service and said don't you ever embarrass me like that again and he said well sister God was dealing with you and and and I was that was just your that was your time. Well, she went on became a Sunday school and she went through life and she got some kind of disease. Might have been venerial for all I remember, but it was a bad disease. And she went in the hospital and and her denominational preacher went there and tried to pray for her and things like that. And he was, you know, smoking and and living a life unworthy of the gospel. And right at the time of her death when the wrong messengers came for her, let me put it like that. And she began to see in that other dimension and be able to see chains of darkness and and evil spirits and demons coming to get her. She began to cry out at that impostor preacher for not telling her the truth. She said, "You deceiver. &gt;&gt; Real love is the truth." And this message is a message of grace and it's love. &gt;&gt; And as I said, no matter where you are in your journey, I encourage you to keep traveling on. If you're if you're justified and you've repented of your sins and the blood of Jesus has cleansed you, praise God, my brother and sister, but move on to sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a power that can take desires out of your life like this. There is a power. &gt;&gt; And if you're sanctified and you're just on the mountain top that God has delivered you from all these different things, that is so wonderful. That is a work of grace. That is a powerful work of the gospel. &gt;&gt; But then move on to the Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because remember Jesus taught if a person is empty and they don't get filled. &gt;&gt; When Satan is cast out, he's going to go and he's going to try and get other Remember whenever the the the prophet of God would deal with certain bad sicknesses, there'd be different demons calling out to the other ones for help. &gt;&gt; You never found the Holy Ghost doing that, do you? He's all powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the demons would be would be in streaks and and he would see them in that other dimension. So these demons when they get cast out of a life if you don't get filled &gt;&gt; they can come back and be way worse the next time. &gt;&gt; So if you're justified and you're sanctified and now you're just asking for the Holy Ghost and you're trusting God for the Holy Ghost, keep asking, keep knocking, keep praying &gt;&gt; because remember you fully obey the word. &gt;&gt; So now you're entitled to the token. It belongs to you. The token is not it. Brother Ram said the token is the fair has been paid. &gt;&gt; Your future, in other words, your future is clear. &gt;&gt; Whenever the death angel looks at you, oh, he's covered by the blood. Can't touch him or her. That means you're guaranteed to be in the rapture. Your price has been paid. &gt;&gt; You'll be there just the same as Jesus Christ will be there. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. We need his blood every day. &gt;&gt; We need him to justify us, to sanctify us every day. And we most certainly need refillings of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother R would quote part of this song is a poem or it turned into a song. It's called Am I Soldier of the Cross? And I like to just read it here in closing. Am I a soldier of the cross? a follower of the lamb. And shall I fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name? In the name the precious name of him who died for me. Through grace I win the promised crown where whatever air my cross may be. Must I be carried to the skies on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas? Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend to grace to help me onto God? That is a wonderful question for young people, for all of us, but anyone that has worldly associates. It's okay to have worldly associates. You need them in business and in life. But I do I strongly advise against worldly friends. You know, when you read the book of Proverbs, one of the first things that Solomon gives, I don't have it here in my notes, but in the very first chapter, you go read it, and he immediately warns, "Be careful who you hang out with." &gt;&gt; So, is this vile world a friend to grace to help me onto God? Since I must fight, if I would reign, increase my courage, Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy word. &gt;&gt; Friends, as we read in the scripture, we must be born again. &gt;&gt; Brother Ran would preach a powerful sermon called invisible union of the bride of Christ. And he took his text right there from Romans 7 when Paul, it looked like he was talking about marriage and divorce. And he said that if a woman gets remarried before that first husband's dead or she's an adulteress and things like that. And he takes that and he spiritualized that. And Paul does too. He said, "But I speak of the church. Our first husband, our first man has got to be dead." We cannot be married to the world and to the Lord Jesus at the same time. If a man love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not in him. &gt;&gt; I pray in this atmosphere where eagles can be born. that as the word was going forth that if you haven't been born again that you can look down and as the word was going forth that you can examine yourself and as you look in the mirror of God's word you realize I wasn't born for this world &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; my beak it it's curved is meant for ripping flesh &gt;&gt; and not pecking in the ground &gt;&gt; these wings wings. They're not just made to fly from off the coupe onto the onto the ground in some barnyard. They're made to soar into the heavenlies. I look at my feet and they're talents. They're not some short chicken feet made to just scratch on the ground. They're made to grab a hold of fresh prey. This word is the end time carcass. And if you feel that this word has pricked your heart and you haven't been born again, but you really feel like you've got the desire to be born again and know him and you have that desire with all your heart, then that means you're an eagle. [Music] You have that desire to fly into the heavenlies. You're tired of this world. I urge you never stop until you get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We're here and we're here to pray for you and we'll we'll we'll we'll put our faith with your faith, but it's an individual affair between you and God. &gt;&gt; We'll pray with you, but we can't see your faith. We can't see your heart, &gt;&gt; but God can. And when God can see your heart, as I said, you could be on a lawn mower and God will just give it to you. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Let's pray. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we thank you for your word. We thank you for your truth, Lord. Thank you, Jesus, that you've made a way that we can be born again, Lord. that we can that we can that we have a way out of this first birth, this first sticky nature, Lord, that even maybe if if if we deal with situations in life that we have something in us by the way of the new birth that can put that man under subjection. Thank you, Lord, for that. Thank you for the blood of Jesus. Lord, I just pray Lord over this congregation that you sanctify us by your blood, Lord. And if there's one that doesn't know you in the power of the resurrection, maybe they're not even justified. May they just fall under conviction even now by the power of the Holy Ghost and realize that they're living a life of sin and may they repent and turn from their ways and you're just and faithful to forgive them. Maybe Lord, they're in a justified state and they're just so tired of going and being beat around the same things over and over and over again. They hate the different deals and the situations they're dealing with and maybe different addictions and they need to be sanctified. Lord, the power of God is here to sanctify. And Lord, if they need a new birth, the power of God is here to fill them. Lord, if they only present themselves in the right atmosphere, in the right attitude and come with a broken heart and ready to fully surrender, Lord, you promise you to receive them and send forth your word and your spirit. Thank you for each one. Now, we just pray that may this word just continue to be in our hearts, Lord. May the words that we heard, Lord, may it fall on good ground. May it bring forth true harvest for your kingdom. We love you now. We commit the remainder of this service. We commit our lives a new to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And Father, if there's anything in our lives, no matter how long we've been walking with you, no, no matter how many even refillings of the Holy Ghost we've had, Lord, give us another one. &gt;&gt; Fill us again. Fill us like never before. And Lord, I just pray, oh God, that in the name of Jesus Christ that you look while there's still mercy that you look with your eyes of mercy into our very souls. Lord, from the front to the back, from side to side, look upon us with your eyes of mercy while there's still blood on the throne. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's anything in our life that would hinder us from taking a rapture, that would that would hinder us, oh God, from going and being with you and escaping this terrible tribulation that's coming on the earth, forgive us, Lord. Lord, if there's anything in our life that we're doing or or going about and we don't even realize that's wrong, reveal it, convict it. Give us the grace, oh God, to repent. Lord, we love you and we thank you for sending us this message. Thank you for the blood in this glorious gospel. We surrender our life to you and give you all the praise, honor, and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints. [Music] Oh, I was lost and undone without God. for his son.
