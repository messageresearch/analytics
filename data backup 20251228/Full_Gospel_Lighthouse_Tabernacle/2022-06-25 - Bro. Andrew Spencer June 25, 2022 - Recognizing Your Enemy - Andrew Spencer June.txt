draw you close to us lord like never before in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 you might tell brother matthew might just have to have that lapel on hand just in case here you can try to make all kinds of preparations to prepare for meetings and it seems like the enemy likes to get into the details of things and and uh so i pray the lord anoints his microphone tonight i'm talking about me amen ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 i'd like to speak to you tonight on recognizing your enemy recognizing your enemy ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always all praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints may god bless his word he may be seated so sir we'd like to speak to you this evening on recognizing recognizing your enemy and we realize that as as children of god and followers of the message we recognize that we are in the midst of satan's eden and we we realize that that there we've had a prophet come and stand stand and preach to us and declare to us that we are not in we are not in the garden of eden but here we are in satan's eden in the worst of all times in the darkest of all ages and satan has had over 6 000 years of setting up and bringing about this bringing about this eden and brother branham would would tell us when he comes and if you're very familiar with that message satan's eden you're you're reminded that brother branham when he was standing there it's it's a very dynamic meeting or message that you'll listen to and i trust you you're familiar with the with that text that brother branham said he said i thought that i would bring something to your mind or something that would enlighten you to know to know than to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in to learn to learn the tactics of the enemy and i love that that that he brought us something that would make us better soldiers in this field not in the field of luther or in the field of wesley or the other garners but to stand in this field to give us to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you he said that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can he said that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can if there ever was a day that we we ought to be standing and trying to keep the punches off of us it's this day because we are under attack like never before as sons and daughters of god everything that we stand for and everything that we represent that is true and holy we stand against an enemy and he is trying he's not just he's not just standing in the ring and not not throwing any darts at us he's not just standing there and standing back and watching how we handle but he's attacking us day in and day out time in and time out trying to attack us in our flesh and a flat afflict us in our mind and afflict us in our soul but we recognize that that here we are in satan's eating and we can look back in the very beginning at the garden of eden and we can recognize that that that eve was deceived into it and she didn't willfully walk out there but she was deceived into it and she turned down the very word of god and to think that's a night to put it in your mind that here they were they were in the very fortress of the word of god they were back behind as what to put it into our children's mind that they were behind as you were called a fortress or a great castle and there they were they were behind that very word and they were they were they were safe behind that word but when when she stepped out behind that wall of the word then the enemy was able to attach her attack her and to get to her mind and to bring her over into reasoning powers and he made her deny all of the word of god by just telling her just taking away one word you see what he was doing he was out there on the outside of that wall and he was trying to get her to come out there with him you see as long as you're behind that word he can't get to you you see all of his all that is sowing at you as things is things that are close to the word of god they're so close that it would deceive the elect if it was possible living right here in this hour and he's speaking those lies he doesn't come out and tell you that the bible's a lie but he comes in there and he's very slick how he does things he'll make you think that it's so right or so close that sure we're right here in this in it's it's got to be correct but we recognize that we are in a spiritual warfare and the enemy is after each and every one of us he's after our families he's he's after us but we recognize that the bible tells us that the word is our wall of defense you recognize that the bible said in zechariah 2 and 5 that i saith the lord i will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her so we can never allow our guard to get down and what we've got to always as peter would say in peter first peter 5 and 8 to be sober and to be vigilant so because we recognize that there is an enemy there is a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he's going about trying even right now in this service to even hinder every little thing but here we are we've got to be alert we've got to be vigilant because the enemy is wanting to breach the walls of the word so let me say this to you this is not another message this is the message it is a restoration of the very truth of god and christ is our wall of fire and eve did deny the very word of god she walked away from the very word of god because she got out on the outside of that wall but if you can stand where christ is if you can stand where the word is you you'll recognize that christ is our wall of fire but we're not like that eve of the last day you and i are anointed by accepting what eve turned down and to think the power that the bride of jesus christ has is she's not just standing there that's another lady but she's anointed she's anointed to handle the word it was it was the wife it was eve that got us into this trouble it was by her mouth walking out there that got her into trouble and it'll be our mouth that gets us out of trouble it's going to be somebody that'll take the word of god and put it upon their lips the word of god never failed in the mouths of those early believers they stood there toe-to-toe with the enemy and they put the word of god on their lips and we recognize that brother branham said in the god of this evil age he said we find now that this evil age is to prove to satan to prove to satan that she is not like eve that she is not at that type of a woman he said she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried to by the word adam's bride believed every bit of the word but confused on one promise he said that he's the same yesterday today and forever you think that he that's the theme of this message as he's the same yesterday today and forever and satan come in there and slicked his way under that wall and he took her down on this one point that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said under the temptation of the enemy he said she failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face recognize the battle is face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she's to come into contact again by the same thing not just by some denominational truth he said or something he said but by every word of god and we recognize that that the enemy that we're facing is a real devil i'd say that every one of us can witness tonight by uplifting hand that you ran into the devil in some way in your life maybe he gave you a bad thought maybe he gave you a thought that you weren't elected maybe he gave you a thought that that you're gonna die with this certain disease or maybe give you this thought that you're not good enough each and every one of you have fought the devil in some form and when you can recognize what the devil is recognize who he is and what he does and how he acts then you can have overcoming power when you begin to recognize who the enemy is the enemy's not your brother the enemy's not your sister that is sitting here but it's the enemy that's sitting there it's a wolf in sheep's clothing that jesus would stand there he said that in the last days there'll be false prophets that have come in there he said they'll be wary they'll be wearing sheep's clothing there they're they're inwardly a wolf on the inside of them paul would say after my departure that there would be wolves that would come in there and they would try to spare they wouldn't spare the flock of god but first john 4 1 says beloved try the spirits whether they be of god or of not this is how you try the spirits you give them a word test it doesn't matter what it is you give them a word test and if they can't accomplish 100 of it that spirit by the word of god you'll know that it is a spirit of the antichrist you see satan don't want you recognizing who he is and he doesn't wreck he doesn't want you recognizing how he's moving he's because if you recognize who he is and how he moves how he attacks you will be giving you'll be getting that power on the inside of you you'll get a power on the inside of you to deny every every tactic of the devil he will come to you with one key unbelief unbelief is the only sin that is sin is unbelief it's not smoking it's not drinking it's not alcohol it's not all these different things but unbelief is sin those things are the attributes of sin those are the things that take you down that road but you remember that wherever ever wherever jesus is satan is very close everywhere jesus was at judas was real close everywhere everywhere cain was or everywhere abel was cain was there and because of a jealous spirit that came upon him he killed his brother because it showed that he couldn't handle the word truth because abel had a revelation and better cain had an opportunity to follow after what abel did but because he was of that wicked one he could not follow the path of revelation let me let me just drop back and follow let me follow some of the message right here if you can't come and line up with every word of god it'll show who your daddy is but if you can line your life up with the very word of god it'll show where you came from it'll show where are you going [Applause] the enemy ain't too excited about when you just shout he ain't just excited about when you lift your hand he's not just excited he doesn't even move out of his bed when somebody gets excited or dances or shouts even speaks in tongues but he gets excited and rolls over in his bed when somebody starts taking the very word of god as for their truth as for their life and they start stomping down devils and start stomping down kids cancer and stomping down diseases that's when he rolls out of his bed when he recognizes that his props are about to get knocked out from underneath of him i say all hell better watch how there's a church of the living god that knows where she's standing at satan be careful we've recognized your tricks we've recognized your lies and we will not stand for it we will not back off of god's promises hallelujah mother branham would tell us knowing being a being a professional boxer he would tell us in the contest he said you got to have a sparring partner that can that can take you to an edge that can take you to an edge that can hit you hit you like an enemy hits you like the guy that you're going to get boxing in the ring with and when you're when you're dancing out there with that sparring partner you're dancing out there you're not just standing out there watching what he's doing he said but he said you're training to hit the enemy you see it's not just good enough to get into the ring of the message it's not just good enough to stand in the corner and know that jesus is over there it's not just good enough to dance around with the enemy you've got to take what you have been given and you've got to hit the devil you've got to take what you've been given and you've been trained under this you've been sitting here all of these years listening to message after message you are a well-trained body of jesus christ it ain't good enough for you just to sit back and well i listened to one message this week or i i prayed one time this week you got to train to hit the enemy you got to take what you've been given i said devil i'm not going to let you stand there and hit me i'm going to hit you back with every power that i've got i ain't got much but what i got i'm going to tear satan's kingdom down we recognize we have battle after battle you come out of one you're getting ready to go into another one constantly on a roller coaster of battles it'll make you recognize that you're in a war and just because you get knocked down or maybe you lose a battle here or there doesn't mean that you lost the war because i got a great big general that is here to make sure that you don't lose this war matter of fact let me tell you ain't no way you can lose with the god that's on your side and the god that's fighting your battles there's no way in hell that you could lose there ain't one devil lined up throughout all the hell that could stand up against the church of the living god that's why i said there ain't no way in hell hell's trying to devise every tactic every plan there ain't no way in hell that you can stand and lose hallelujah but there is all the way in heaven away prepared for the people and jesus said i am that way i am that truth i am that life you are the embodiment of this truth it ain't just it ain't just sitting on bibles you've heard me say it before it ain't just about sitting on the bible it ain't just about having the books lined up on your shelf having the pictures on your wall you can have hoffman's head of christ recognized throughout your whole entire house but if you ain't got the life of this word living on the inside of you you can know every word of it but not have the life because it is the word the word the letter killeth but the spirit that gives life is that right so we recognize that there's a people in the land again today that are under their messenger that'll be the final voice to the final age and they are the embodiment of that truth and there is an enemy that is trying to thwart your position so let me let me let me just drop this right here satan is not afraid of you as a person he's not afraid of your flesh he he matter of fact he's got rights to touch your flesh he's got rights to get in your mind because that's where the battle's at because you see in the flesh you're subject to him he'll make you sick and you'll get healed and you'll get sick again you're subject to him in the flesh as a mere man you become subject to the devil and try he makes you sick he makes you afflicted and he torments your mind but as a son of god yes as a man satan will whip you every which away but as a son of god you are not a slave to satan but satan is your slave he has to obey what you say when you say leave he's got to leave when you cast him out he's got to go when you say bow down thou o slew foot he's got to bow down to the name of jesus christ i'm not his slave but i'm gonna make him a slave every day of my life he ain't got some pitchfork in his hand he ain't got some long tail except for the tail that comes out of his mouth that's detailed how he deceived all of the angels there that was in heaven it was a tail brother branham's head it was a tail that came out of his mouth but you got to recognize him real brother branham would say he said he said it's not the farmer with him oh hillbilly with him oh hillbilly help me out brother josh suppenders what is it bibs suspender bibs he said it's not the farmer that's got them bibs on out there them suspenders out there that's working out in the field that old farmer he said that's not the guy that you got to worry about your wife he said that's all slicker he's the guy that you got to watch around your life oh come on somebody now i'd say probably nowadays you got some farmers that are trying to slick them ways into certain things but let me say this it's the enemy it's the enemy that tries to slick his way in and try to give you a religion that is so close well they serve god down there on the street they raise their hands just like they do down here they worship god just like they worship down there they say jesus name when they baptize they see this that or the other but they're missing one word and he slicked his way in and he's tried to bring his cold formal ideas right into the message and tell you that if you if you love god you can do anything you want to you better watch out you're dealing with the devil [Applause] is that right am i on basis tonight am i right on point it's the enemy that wants to come in and offer you well let's just worship and we don't need the preaching of the word that's the devil that you're dealing with well there's a devil that likes to walk around the message and said well the days of miracles has gone by prayer lines have gone by healings are gone by that's a devil that you're dealing with you have just recognized there is an enemy in your camp and the only way to get that enemy out the camp is to take the word of god to him when the bible tells us in revelations 12 that there was war in heaven verse 7 and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought with his angels so we recognize that there's opposition between michael and his angels and the dragon and his angels and brother branham said in the greatest battle ever fought he said this great battle that that that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven he said and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings he said then the battle the battle from angels become human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this he said that's what his purpose was was to destroy it he said and then the battle began here on earth and began in us and it's been raging ever since and you'll remember that's right in line with ephesians chapter 6 that we're not warring against flesh and blood but we're warring against principalities and powers and rulers of high places in darkness but if you'll read revelations 12 and 8 it says and they prevailed not neither was their place [Music] the dragon and his angels their place was found anymore in heaven that ought to make you shout right there the place where you're going there ain't no devil there there ain't no beast there they ain't no liars there there ain't no torment spirits there their place was not found in heaven but if you can read over in revelations 19 you'll find your place there you'll watch where the word of god came out of the out of the one that was riding on that horse you watch where it came out of it came out of his mouth what came down in the prophet's hand in this day the king's sword the king sword came down and this what is the third pole it's the opening of the word and when a people start lining up with what the word said what the word calls for us to do you may not commit you may not create squirrels you may not create life in a little fishy but there'll be somebody that'll rise up and take this third pole right onto the coming of the lord and live and overcome in life i don't care if i create a squirrel i don't care if i cast out a tumor i don't care if i speak to a storm let me live a life let me live a life lord jesus take this third pole and live the life of jesus christ so close that he can't leave me here [Applause] oh well brother adams would tell us in the greatest battle ever fought young people if you ain't listen to it go listen to it study it it'll help you get through your your christian walk as a young person greatly he said but he said in any battle he said there's got to be a choosing place he said in world war 1 and world war ii he said they chose that no man's land and they went out there and fought on it he said but god had chose the heart he said but satan chose the mind he said and that's where the battle begins he doesn't say that's where it ends at he said that's where it is that's where it begins at you see he's wanting he's wanting to start in your mind and war with you in your flesh and give you worry and worry causes cancer he starts in your mind and moves his way down into the body what is he trying to do he's trying to steal the house that you were built to be the house of god he starts in the mine and he rolls in there with temptations of the mind he rolls in there with all kinds of complexes and stigmas and people talking about you and people saying all kinds of things about you and he tries to roll in there and tries to give you a disease of spiritual amnesia he tries to roll in there and give you all kinds of ideas to make you not believe that this is the truth that's where it begins at but i love what paul would say in the letter to the philippians in foreign aid he said finally my brethren whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are holy whatsoever things are just if there be any virtue if there be any praise to think on these things there ain't one thing just about the devil there ain't one thing holy about the devil there ain't one thing pure about the devil but there is something honest and pure and lovely and great there is virtue in the lord jesus christ and satan don't want you thinking about what god did for you he don't want you thinking how god loved you he don't want you thinking about how he's had you how he picked you up out of the mirey clay he don't want you thinking about praising him and glorifying him for reaching down his hands and picking you up he don't want you thinking about that he because you recognize when you start recognizing the god that's on your side you'll start recognizing the devil that's against you oh if there's going to be something we're going to think on let's think on the word of god it's the only thing of rest it's the only place of security in this hour is to rest in the very word of god you see you see the further and further that you get away from satan's reach the more he recognizes that you are a real son and daughter of god he got you close to the walls one time he tried to bring out there was some kind of lie he tried to bring you out there with some kind of dirty website and all kinds of deadly things he tried to bring you out there close to the wall but there was somebody on the inside said get back on in here you're not safe out there you're not safe out there in laodicea young people you're not safe on those phones you're not safe on those websites you're not safe on social media get back in here you're my children you get back in here that's why it's got preachers that stand up in the pulpit today and preach the truth saying get back in life get back away from the walls so the enemy can't touch you there's going to be somebody that'll listen to the voice of resurrection they won't stand near the wall just so close that they can get by they'll get back in there so close to god that shaking can't touch a hair on his head until he gets permission from my father daniel in daniel chapter 10 i ain't gonna read it to y'all tonight it'll take too long and ain't got enough time to read it to you but the bible tells us in daniel chapter 10 that you'll find that there daniel there he was in persia there with cyrus the king and there he was and he the bible said that daniel was mourning for three weeks because of the things that he was seeing and the things that was going on daniel was mourning all of those days but there daniel was praying daniel was praying those twenty and one days daniel begin to pray you recognize that what you're facing tonight is the very prince of persia that is the prince of the power of the air that is trying to stop you from getting to a heavenly atmosphere is that right he's trying to stop your prayers he's trying to stop your breakthrough he's trying to stop you from getting all the way to god he's trying with everything that was in his might but the bible tells us that daniel began to pray he prayed on one day he prayed on the second day he prayed all the way through the first week but still there wasn't no answer he prayed through the second week and there still wasn't no answer but daniel was a man that had purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's land and the king's meat but daniel stayed there now you're gonna face some devils you're gonna face sometimes in your life when there's storms over you and it looks like all of heaven is shut off but that ain't time to give up that's a time to keep praying that's a time to stand there like daniel and said satan you can stop me or you can try to stop me all you want to but i'm going to keep on praying [Applause] there's power in your prayer and you think well i've done prayed this thing one time and i done prayed it i hadn't prayed it over my children i didn't prayed it over my family i hadn't prayed it over my pastor i've done prayed this what's the purpose in praying pray pray like you've never prayed for for and pray and recognize you're not talking to some weak god you're talking to the god of heaven when you're bowing on your knees you're not talking to some weak angel you're talking to a mighty angel when you're praying i want you to know there's so much power in a believer's prayer that hezekiah prayed one time and he shut down all of the assyrians and one angel came and smote 185 000 assyrians hezekiah knew how to pray he prayed one time when the prophet came to him and said make yourself ready you're about to die but hezekiah knowing how to pray turned his face towards a wall and begin to weep and call out to god brother branham said he asked for 15 more years and god heard his prayer i want you to know your prayer changes the very mind of god there the prophet walked in and told him get ready to die and then the prophet before he ever got out the city said let's go back up there and talk to hezekiah and you've been sitting here saying i've said this same prayer over and over and over again let me give you the example daniel daniel prayed for 21 days and when the angel showed up he said i am come for thy words he didn't come for shadrach's words there he didn't come from meshach's words there he didn't come for a bendigo's words there daniel was the one in the fight you're the one in the fight you're the one that's got to pray you're the one that's got a call on god god if you're still god let your power show and vindicate that you can still save the loss you can still heal the body and the angel said the prince of persia he withstood me these 21 days but michael but michael came and helped me i want you to know christ has come into your situation to help you out of your midst of trouble michael which is christ in angelic form is showing up because of your prayers because of your commitment to god i'm not going to give up i'm not going to back off my prayer life i'm not going to back off my praise i'm not going to back off my worship it's an enemy that's trying to stop that but daniel kept praying it's the same thing with those two women that came into that meeting they came there one with the stomach trouble one with the garter and six weeks later the angel passed through the neighborhood when the one's daughter said mama you're bringing a reproach against christianity but she said i'm healed by his stripes it was the same thing and the same commitment that daniel had and one day she was there and said hey my little children have left some oatmeal here that just tears my belly up but i'm going to eat this in the name of jesus christ and before long she moved over to the next course and before long she ran down the road ran down the avenue and said hey i've been eating all morning she said i'm here shaking the sheets trying to find this order it was because somebody refused to give in and refused to give up what is satan wanting you to do he's wanting you to surrender your rights as a christian to him he's wanting to make you think that you're not strong enough that you're not a bit you don't have the ability to win this the enemy just wants you to roll over and give up if that's you stop playing possum because i know you ain't dead is that right you see some christians they get that possum idea about them whenever the enemy comes close they get in the headlights and they just roll over and act dead oh don't let them see me he's close i can feel him his old nasty breath breathing down on me and you roll over why don't you roll back over and bite him just start gnawing at that devil so back up i ain't some dead possum i ain't some dead church of christ i ain't some dead methodist i'm the church of the living god let me move on this is the hour of the overcomer brother and said it overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's the devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcame him and by his grace bow his grasp by his grace by his grace that'll make you how to make a clip for somebody go ahead make fun of me as long as you're making fun of me you're leaving somebody else alone and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen there's a real overcoming when you recognize he said you look back and you say well i'm doing this i'm doing that he said then you're defeated he said but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he said then you realize that you've overcome and you know that he's a devil now watch this he said you can't say i got a sickness i don't believe it is a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer oh you don't you don't believe it is a cancer he said it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember if we're going to remember one thing this is what we got to remember that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him this is the hour of the overcomer and it's recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks but it's realizing that the god that's on the inside of you let me tell you they ain't no problem that's too big that's bigger than my jesus you can line up every problem that you got in this building tonight and it still ain't bigger than jesus let me say this to you that the house that you're living in is not single occupancy anybody catching my drift tonight the house that you're living in is not single occupancy but it is a duel a dual dwelling place as somebody hey somebody they might there might be times in your life when you're weak and you're frail and there may be times in your life when you feel stronger than others but there's a guy that's living on the inside of the house with you he ain't never weak he never gave up he never lost the battle the guy that's living on the inside of this house it's greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world if you're sealed until the day of your redemption it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter what emotion you feel it doesn't matter whether you feel right or lit your lord doing all kinds of things and it feels like you're not a christian no more and satan's pouring everything on you to make you think that you're not living right but if you're sealed until the day of your redemption you can have mind battle after mind battle war after war but if you're sealed until the day of your redemption you've already received the earnest which is the down payment to get you out of this chaos hallelujah you love the lord brother branham he's he's dealing with a he's dealing with a patient and he said how'd he do sir he said he said now there's something strange about you sir he said satan has desired to take your life he said you're all tore up and you think you've sinned away your day of grace you think your life is ruined then he asked him this simple but very powerful question he said do you love jesus do you love jesus satan's trying to kill you he's trying to make you think he's trying to make you think that you send away your day of grace but do you love jesus we got young people all around this message that satan has lied on that satan's tried to steal and to kill and destroy by his lies but do you love jesus i'm gonna tell you something that's something powerful about loving jesus it's about falling in love with him if you fall in love with him let me tell you you might fall in love and out of love with people of the world and boyfriends and girlfriends but if you really fall in love with jesus you can't fall out of love with him do you love jesus do you love jesus what makes you love him he said before there could ever be anything to there to make you love him there has got to be a creator to create the love in your heart are you listening is that right he said if you'd send away your day of grace you would hate jesus but you love him and you're all right hallelujah and you're all right and the devil's just lying to you you're nervous come here and i'll cast them away for you if you'll believe do you believe it bow your head and keep your heads bowed everyone until you hear me say raise up he said this is demonology he said almighty god be merciful to the boy he stands here and satan trying to get him to to get in this condition to commit suicide but thou art here to relieve the boy and to make this evil spirit go and now has said that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils then upon the authority of god's word as a believer i now ask the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief he didn't call out suicide he didn't call out depression he called out unbelief the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief to leave him go out in the name of jesus christ and bother him no more i set him free and may the enemy be bound and leave this room and torment no one else in jesus christ's name i want you to know this once you recognize the power of the name of jesus christ you have recognized that your enemy is defenseless [Music] if you can recognize how much power is in the name of god the name of jesus christ your enemy cannot whip you he can try to whip you every which way until he comes to that name the name of jesus christ is the highest name in heaven and in earth and there's no other name where men should be saved but by the name of jesus you watch you've heard me say this let me let me say this real quick musicians can come i'm closing you watch an eagle you've heard it before you maybe seen it before but you watch an eagle that's going up against a fight against a deadly snake that eagle has got to change the battle he's got to change the battle because on the ground that snake can whip him that rattlesnake or that viper can whoop him right there because that's where he's strong at but eagle has to take that snake into another atmosphere and when he gets him into another atmosphere when he gets him all the way up there he'll drop him from the sky and when he gets floating through the air he's defenseless he can't strike he can't bite at you so let me say this eagles the enemy that's come in to give you a snake bite is to tell you this word of the lord is to tell you to take your enemy into an atmosphere where the enemy is defenseless he's weakless he's weak and he cannot beat you he cannot destroy you if you can ever recognize your enemy who he is what he is and how he's trying to rob you from god's inheritance take him into the atmosphere of praise one time and watch what you do with him take him into the atmosphere of prayer one time and watch how he loses his power take him into the atmosphere of worship one time and watch how he can't bite at you take him into the atmosphere of the word young people and you'll watch satan can't handle you there and he loses his power to strike at you we're just staying with me this evening [Music] oh don't you love the lord [Music] of the [Music] okay [Music] oh can't you see oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh can't you see
