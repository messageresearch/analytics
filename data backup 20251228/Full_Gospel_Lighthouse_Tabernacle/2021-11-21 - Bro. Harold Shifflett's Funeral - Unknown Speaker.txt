saved him and most of all how god healed him he would always then after telling that stranger about that testimony he most of the time tell a joke and i believe that they would laugh just as much with him laughing and you know what i mean by that because he would laugh as much as he would just shake all over and you would laugh with him just because of his laughter but that was the type of friend he was to us a friend that would make us laugh he was there and in moments where we would sad lift us up he was a comforter to us and during that time he would also ask that same stranger probably if do you have any hunting land because i'd like to run some dogs anyway because harold you you knew where all of his buddies was at because harold when he'd roll in with the dogs all his buddies would roll in too and they could run some bushes they'd run everybody and like harold would always say them dogs can't read harold was a type of friend that was a protector he always enjoyed to protect his grandchildren his family and his friends he would sit at the back of the church there and most evenings as vehicles would come in and out he'd go out to make sure everything was okay make sure everybody was getting in all right another reason why he said at the back is so he could go start the car for denise when it was cool and when he get back in he said all right niece let's go speaking of a protector that brother harold was there was one night that a gentleman come in that wanted money here at the church he was begging for money begging for money and he told harold he said every time i pull my pants up i got a knife on my side harold said well i'd like to tell you every time i pull mine up i got a gun on mine needless to say that gentleman didn't stay around much longer he was a protector we loved brother harold loved him very much and brother harold when many of you know how this goes that when abraham and sarah met the lord they had a name change so did harold denise they met each other it became harl and niece and that's the way we've always heard them call each other harold and niece so i want to say to you this morning that he's waiting for us like he would at every dinner table and at every supper he'd say y'all hurry up it's about to get cold so that's what he's saying up there up yonder this morning going y'all hurry up get on up here we want to join him one day this morning i'd like to sing a song that would be fitting for brother harold this old house so maybe if you know it you'll sing it with me this morning oh this whole house once to my children

acquaintances he was the biggest fan and supporter of his grandchildren and could be counted on to be at their advance with a smile even when he was not feeling well family and friends could always take comfort knowing that harold would be there for them anytime he called his mother mary betty schifflett daily and visited her often to be sure she was taken care of and they shared a strong bond and love for one another his happiness sense of humor and hearty life was contagious and it was impossible to be with him and not leave a happier person we will forever miss his jokes family meals

[Applause] me [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] you [Music] i slipped through the gates as peter greeted me one by one i met the saints i longed so much to see i saw my heroes but before my

it was the worst of all the ages they continued to say how did you live a christian life in such a godless day question after question my heroes lifted me then i heard a voice behind whisper tenderly

slipped away [Music] take your place beside the throne christ is now your [Music] you are [Music] god bless you today we thank you all for for being here and supporting the family and coming to celebrate the life of our precious brother harold shifflett i would like to first offer my condolences and my sympathy to the family and to say how sorry we are for the passing of our our brother harold we have not lost him because we know exactly where he may be found he was certainly a dear precious brother in christ and everything that you hear and everything that you see today i was just speaking to my dad brother ron i thought how amazing that this is is that you can be gone but you can set this up that everything that is sung here today the words that will be spoken before brother harold was gone he was preparing for this day and just like a a master artsman where the herald was designing this day he picked out each song picked out how things would be laid out and things would be done it's kind of like brother harold's life there's been ups and there's been downs in it but it's like a famous artist he comes and he he doesn't just bring in the sunshine but he brings in the shadows to bring out the magnificence of the rays of light and today we see that our lord jesus christ is very near when you hear him coming when you hear him speaking these are things that brother harold wanted done sister denise last week when brother harold was going for his surgery the lord laid this scripture on my heart the bible says in psalms 34 and 15 that the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are upon them up open unto their cry the face of the lord is against them that do evil and to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles every tear you cried sister denise was not in vain he delivered brother harold out of all of his troubles but the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit and many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of all of them david would go on to say that he healeth the broken in heart and he bindeth up their wounds and when jesus would come and he would take the script he would grab over in luke chapter 4 and he would say that the spirit of the lord is upon me to bind up the broken heart our lord jesus is with us today and he told us that he would never leave us nor forsake us and when our loved one cannot be there our lord jesus christ is always there and when you call on the name of the lord he said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be there in the midst of them right now there are cards there are flowers that are coming in there is food galore the refrigerators are full cards are coming in but there will be days in the coming weeks that you may feel like nobody remembers or nobody is caring but our lord jesus christ says that i am the god of all comfort he will be there in your worst moments designing the great artwork of this life and when he was finished with brother harold's life he signed a signature upon it his life is not in vain when you think about harold's life there are many things there are many things that we could say today that we won't bring up because of children's ears but we will certainly miss the enjoyment of of life that harold brought to the table as it were every joke every everything that he would do in his own ways and everybody here every brother and every sister knew that harold cared and cared about them and every brother here that was a hunter has a hunting story that they could share with you or a joke that he'd just heard or if you were playing rook his motto in life was if he ain't cheating he ain't trying there's a lot of things that i that i learned from my buddy and the very first time i ever went turkey hunting i was in my teenage years and it was with my uncle harold and he was teaching me about hunting but he also took upon himself to teach me about something else because he felt like it was an uncle's duty to teach me about the birds and the bees and by the time we got done that day i was no longer concerned about hunting turkeys but concerned with something else i got an education i wish i had a notepad and a pencil that day one of the he probably didn't think this was funny at all but it was one of the greatest memories that i have to date of of harold and we were we were doctoring on some cattle and we had we had this one one cow there a steer that was giving us a fit and we had him in the chute and granddaddy and me tj and matthew were working on this on this cow we were doctoring them up and harold just got off of work and come in and done had a shower he's ready for family dinner there nice clean shirt on smelling purdy and that cow decided that it was it wasn't going to take those shots we was given and that thing bucked down and threw manure all over harold and if you knew harold he couldn't handle it he went up to the water spigot he said that always happens to me right after i get a good shower brother harold was a was a real man there was no funny bones in his body you knew who he was and he knew what he stood for but he believed in the lord jesus christ and it was not a shame like paul said that i am not ashamed of this gospel and the power of its salvation and harold believed in the supernatural power of god and as you have heard today and you'll hear throughout telling his testimony of life that god was a savior and god was a healer brother herald was was a man that we watched here as a church family we watched him receive miracle after miracle and continued to confess that god was a healer brother harold believed in the supernatural power of god in one service we were having a prayer line here and and we were coming around and and brother harold was standing at the back and everybody knows that brother harold was a as brother matthew said was a protector he was standing at the back with sister denise and was making his way around the line making sure others were getting into the line and sister heather schifflett was standing back there in that corner and she was praying about a certain need and brother harold went to her and said sister heather the lord just laid on my heart to to come and say this to you that whatever you're praying for god is going to grant your desire well sister heather was praying for her daughter that was struggling in school and in life at that time and we can look at the life of sister caitlin and we can see that god fulfilled the desire of sister heather brother harold was a real was a real brother in christ and he will certainly be missed but he's not gone neither will he be forgotten his life is etched into our memories and daily we will go in and we'll grab out memories things that brother harold did and things that he would say there's not a time that us boys take lunch without thinking about harold he would look at us he would say boys it's time for a nice hot meal and there's things that we'll go in and grab out of hunting stories i don't think any of us boys could walk into a set of woods anymore without thinking of harold and the things that he would do or say and the best land was just on the other side of that sign there but we'll go in and we'll grab those memories we won't lose those memories but we'll go in and we'll grab those memories and we'll put them in the memory vault and we'll bring them back out and we'll look at them again but we will not forget the one who said to harold i am the resurrection and i am the life and though you were dead yet he shall live again i sing that song i know my redeemer lives after this song if sister whitney braden could come and make her way and then brother shannon sister tracy and sister heather come who taught the sun where to stand in the morning and who told the ocean you can only come this far [Music] to leave me whose words alone could catch a falling star [Music] well i know [Music] oh i know that my redeemer [Music] the very same god that's been stings norby runs to the [Music] and the same hands that hold me when i'm broken [Music] to bring me [Music] yes i know that my redeemer [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] my redeemer

of the ground [Music] there ain't no grace down [Applause] you today is a difficult day for all of us and we're reminded that we're not alone but there's another realm that is very close to us as we heard his father tell him in the song go rest high on that mountain he was part of the welcoming committee that was with brother homer and many others as he was standing when jesus took him by the hand when doctors could do no more harold is loved by every one of us here today i was his brother-in-law for all of these years harold and denise were the first ones that was married in the brick church on summit avenue in 1976 when i came into the family harold gave me the same speech he gave you it's amazing with harold we loved him with all of her hearts you could go squirrel hunting and come home with a deer just amazing how that happened you know the incredible stories that he told us through the years his love his incredible love for his family his wife his children he didn't mind telling you about the lord whether it was at an auction or stopping for a sandwich at at time to to finish with the deer hunting he did not appreciate the dogs eating these sandwiches and he he didn't mind sharing with you that he didn't like that one of the first visits that he came to our house and that time i lived in a in a mobile home and i it was probably a 14 by 56 mobile home and you know how those things are and harold had took a shower and he was in the shower and i was outside washing the car and i was right at the window where harold was at and i could hear him in the shower in there temptation overtook me and i began to spray that cold water in the shower and i you know you know how it is you could hear him running backwards and forwards niece he thought niece was doing that to him we were across the mountain one day and we were hunting and i'm not going to say where because the landowner may be here today and he had taken me and thomas and them and went another way thomas and homer went another way and i was with harold and harold was going down and was coming up this beautiful ridge and he stopped me and he said he's in a ronald if you see anybody run the other day he called me he asked me to come up to the house we were going to have this conversation it was going to be a difficult one he'd went to the doctor that day and they had told him to begin to prepare for today and he asked me to speak his funeral there that day as luck would be the chance i got the same conversation the doctor it must have been the day for doctors to tell the patients this the doctor told me to get my funeral arrangements ready we kind of joked about it who would be first well i guess i'm getting to fulfill the duties of speaking his funeral he knew death was coming this life is way too short it's just way too short the one thing that i can share with you today is appreciate every day that you have and if you neglect to appreciate it it'll slip by your way too quick harold's was complications of diseases of a heart kidneys and a multiplicity of other things that was attacking his body minor stage four cancer that's in the brain and in the lungs and a lot of other places now but i can tell you this in a few days i'll shake his hand and we'll both be young again and we're going to be all right i read a story by d.o moody i think it's a good good place to share it said so very sorry to hear this but if you could only grasp what heaven is really like then you would feel sorry for those who are left here this present earth in its condition at its best the closest redeemed will ever come to hell that's quite a statement and for the sinner it is the closest they will ever come to living in heaven our stay here on this earth is in its fallen condition is only a place of preparation to go to a place where we truly live your loved one made his preparation he lived for this moment we have something to rejoice in that you do not lose him because you know where he's at dr luna would have liked to have been here sitting in the company today i was just with him on wednesday we shared a lot of stories about harold and homer he loved harold and he said i'd love to come he said but i'm running a a vaccination clinic for children and he said i got it all together i'm going to vaccinate a hundred children to covet he said i'd love to come and i just looked up at him and i said if if you'll write something down i'll read it for you and i'll do my best to represent you he's a caring doctor he's a loving doctor he said to mr shifflet and all of his family it was an honor and a real pleasure to care for you during the good days and the bad days i always cherished your visit where despite your ailments you always had trust in me and in your loving and your lovely wife who was always there for you every single minute i am sure that you were very much deserving of the love and she has always had for you i will miss your visits but will remember fondly our time together when i see the rest of your family in my office where we also share good memories i have of your dear father-in-law warmest regards max luna that doctor could only take him so far they care they try to help suffering humanity but i'm thankful to god that we have a higher doctor and he is the great physician that knows how to heal a broken body when it comes to his end brother harold arranged who the pallbearers would be his honorary son brother jeremy do you have a picture for me all right are we coming his honorary son killed this buck this morning brother justin brother justin was wanting to save it for harold but harold didn't get to make that appointment i think it's kind of neat how god arranges certain things on certain days and when you think there's no god he really cares about those things that you care about god bless you brother justin you like the rest of us he taught us how to hunt taught us how to love and how to care and i thought it was just really special i hope that was alright to share with this audience today god bless you may you take the things that you've learned from harold and some of them and share with your children i'd like to thank brother mike and brother lloyd walls for being here from richmond in washington they were dear friends to brother harold thank each and every one of you that are here today neighbors friends co-workers family members thank you for being here in psalms chapter 46 he says god is our refuge and a strength and a very present help and trouble therefore we'll not we fear though the earth be removed and though mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake and the swelling thereof there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place the tabernacle of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and be right early the heathen raged and the king was removed and he utterly uttered his voice and the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob our refuge jesus turned to his disciples knowing moments like this would come and he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also understand brother harold this is just the temporary house that he lived in these 65 years jesus built him a house a house without sin a house that will never be touched by heart problems kidney problems situations and pressures of life it's a house built like the lord's himself jesus would say this through the through the prophet david the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want he provides everything that we have need of he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside of the still waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his namesake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me and let me just say this to you men can only take you so far our mate can only go so far with us but aren't you glad sister denise that you knew when he left your hand he had the hand of a man that had a scar in it and that's the only man-made thing in heaven is the scar and that scar paid the price of redemption and you took his hand and put it into his hand and he could take him the rest of the way sister mary betty life is not made for us to watch our children perish it's not made it's not the natural cycle of life the natural cycle is the opposite way but your comfort today is harold's not in that box he's watching from another realm and he's standing where a reunion has taken place and he and your beloved husband is standing together maybe sharing some stories just now and this is not disney and it's not a fairy tale jesus said i'm going to take you through the valley of the shadow of death and i'm going to walk with you it's been quoted before i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you man will fail his promises if you don't believe that just try washington d.c but god will never fail he's never lied he's never failed he's never been in a crisis when adam fell in the garden of eden god made a way back because you and i was in god and when jesus was laying in the tomb and the scripture says i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption you was in jesus and satan couldn't get to you then he can't get to you now understand this now satan has done his worst damage that he could do to herald but he can never touch him again let me just say this to you if you haven't made the preparation for this moment like brother harold because brother harold had he had warning that this was coming amen he had a warning that it was coming this did not take him by surprise he made a preparation but he started making preparations decades ago when brother homer was looking for a church and by vision it would be a church just up the hill here where the ceiling was falling in and it would be a place that was right across the road from harold's family because god needed to get harold and denise together so it was more than getting a church building you see god's been at work a long time at this you can't beat god's program he knows how to put things together as i've marveled as this service has been so well put together i want you to understand god has watched over i'm thankful that we've got somebody that can watch over us and as a child of god psalms 91 tells us that the angels of god are standing watching over us we are protected greater than the president of the united states we're protected better than any diplomat in the entire world let me just say this to you harold was protected the other day when an operation with incredible risk was involved willing to do whatever harold was a friend of this church he was a friend to you he loved you he cared for you jesus was this kind of a friend there was a time when jesus's personal friend was sick and was dying and it seemed like jesus went the opposite direction his disciples would even ask him about it and jesus would turn to him and said he's sleeping like all humanity we don't understand death a lot of times when he turns and starts making his way back to their house news is coming that lazarus has passed away it doesn't deter the commission that jesus is on his way mourners are there they've already placed him in the tomb and his sister asked him about him and he said he'll rise again and he said well she said well i know that he'll raise on that resurrection day and he explains to her that i am the resurrection and i am the life now we marvel at him turning water into the best wine that there could possibly be at the marriage feast as a matter of fact if you go back and look at it in history he didn't just turn a little teaspoon he turned 62 gallons of water into the best wine in the hole in the whole community when he told the boys that were fishing cast your net on the other side they said lord we tear it all night there ain't no fish in the sea cast your net because he knew the fish was there when peter he turned to him one day when they had a tax situation and he said take the hook and go fish in its mouth you're going to find money harold would tell you sit here sit here at the street don't move i'll come back for you or he may tell you to stand at a certain spot when the dogs were running and he came running by me one day and he said did the dogs come this way and i said no but i think they went up on the mountain the mountain was the park he said you know them dogs can't read and jesus told peter they'll catch a fish it's got money in it i want to say this with absolute consolation to you today without a shadow of a doubt harold is not dead but he actually lives better now than he's ever lived in this temporary life it is we that should be sorry a lot of regrets in life a lot of times that you may have missed i maybe you were too busy to have a certain conversation but let me just let me just share this with you as i end don't be too busy to spend time with jesus don't be too busy any of you knew harold knew he was not shy about talking about the lord and he wasn't ashamed of him he was our greeter here at this church he said on the he was set many times on that on our on our steps out there and greeted people as they came in he was quick to go out and greet whoever was coming make sure everything was all right whether you know he was our guardian angel here at the church we're going to miss him but not for long because god made us a promise amen and i like how god operates he makes us a promise buddy we'll miss him he'll miss his laughs miss his stories we'll miss those those deer stories especially what we'll miss more than anything is his love for us because he shared it it was on his cuff he didn't hide his love for you denise he loved you he didn't hide his love for you girls matt he didn't hide his love for you he didn't hide it at all when his last conversation was got to get a bigger buggy death was coming down but he was ready to get a bigger buggy so that you guys could could go hunting thank you harold thank you for a life well lived lord jesus i want to thank you for touching his life that he'd be a better touch to us could we just bow our heads and pray today father as jesus said into thy hands i commit my spirit and you did that that we could live not just live here but live eternally now lord i can only say the words that you place on my heart but you can come and be there maybe like a presence in the room like a touch of the heart lord now i ask you to touch sister denise minister to her father mary betty his brothers touch them
