he's worthy of it isn't he amen amen as we go to the prayer requests this evening want to continue to lift up many needs here in our local body also want to remember our brother Donnie Nicholson that God would just continue to touch him also our pastor brother Ron Spencer that is dealing the from the recovery from the heart attack and the three stance that he had put in uh very weak this morning and so we want to pray for him that God would just strengthen his body also just drive out that cancer and heal him of that he we serve a miracle working God don't we amen so all things are possible U want to continue to lift up Sister Deborah Watson's cousin Becky that God would touch her of that liver cancer also sister Deborah Watson's father brother farmer that God would touch his body and strengthen him and just minister to him there Sister Barbara Gregory has asked us to continue to lift up Sister excuse me not sister but uh her grandson Charlie for his liver condition there so I want to remember him also sister June shifflet and many of our elderly want to remember Sister Janetta Thompson's daughter Olivia as she's in the hospital for a cyst near her ear so want to remember that that God would just help help the doctors figure that out want to lift up sister Sonia grief from brother Joe Green's congregation that is fighting that lung cancer and brain tumors there also our sister Pat Gooden as she's recovering from that surgery as she has therapy and slowly improving so remember there uh my friend Josh asked for prayer for his mother Annabelle who is suffering from cervical cancer thank you God bless you brother Joel strike so just remember that need there how many would have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up to the Lord this morning I'm going to ask brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come pray for these needs for us this morning I just want to say thank you to everybody for the prayers last week for the the ones traveling as well as for our pastor and you know I thought it was pretty special just talking about how special group we have as children it's a youth camp you know you've got 500 kids there and you've got workers there that they have camps coming in camps coming out and they see they see the kids and um I happened to go back with brother Ron took him back and when we took him back I kind of walked back to where I was staying at and it just happened to be guided by God that that would happen um as I'm walking back there's a PA workers they older couple uh they were walking up and they kind of called out to me and uh they said you know hey we just wanted to talk to somebody here at the camp we see all the kids we see them hanging out and you know the girls and they're they're holding hands and in groups and the older kids are so well behaved and just bragging on the kids and they hadn't heard the message at all they didn't hear what was being preached but they saw the life that that the young kids all across the bride was living and so they they began asking me what you know what we believed and got to talk to them a little bit about what we believed and they said you know for people to come so far there was there was two boys that drove 32 hours from Canada and they said for for people to drive that far to come in here y'all must have something worth hearing and so they asked what time service was they had just went through a tragedy lost a home in a hurricane and were just there working at the camp and then so they ended up coming to the service that evening just to hear hear what was being preached on Friday night you know you don't you don't know what and whether they got something from it or or what their mind is I believe that God touched their heart in that but to see that we had a group of kids there that showed God so much that they would want to come and hear what message was being preached is very powerful very powerful and also again just praying for a pastor he he surrenders his life for this message and you know we're seeing that right before our eyes he's fighting cancer he has a heart attack and if it was his choice he'd be here preaching this morning and that's that's what he is that's who he does and he's he's a true servant he's living the he's living as a preacher and a servant that the scripture talked about when when Jesus came so let's just take these kns to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so grateful to be able to come and be here this morning and to be able to come and come and be able to to listen to a message and have a message brought forth in this day where there's such evil around there's there's technologies that can take our kids can can take adults into places that will cause them to cause them to live a wicked life and to be able to live a life that you don't have to say a word but you could just F the feel the evil presence about them and that's the time we live in but Lord there's a message that comes that we just have a life that we have to live and it will it will draw folks that they've been around churches they've been around religions but there's there's just something different about the group of people that we have and I'm not just talking about the church and the youth that we have here we have such a great group of people a great faith believing people here but all around the world Lord you brought us a message you brought us a bride and not everyone may see it but we're thankful that they that they recognize that that is Jesus Christ living within them and Lord Jesus all the prayer requests that have been brought forth I'm believing that you could come and you could just touch each and everyone you could come and you could heal everyone in a moment Lord it may come in stages it may come in the exact moment we pray but Lord Jesus you are the god that that heals all that delivers all and brings prodigal home Lord and I'm just believing that you even go to our our pastor is Adam you could go and give him a supernatural strength like never before you came with a wind when he was listening to a meeting and you touched his lungs and you healed his lungs in a moment after the fire and I'm believing you could do the same for his heart and for his muscles and even for the cancer just wipe it all out there's a purpose behind it and there's one thing we could say here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we have a we have a pastor that lives this message and shows that this message Works he shows that it's battle tested and he's not doing that for the glory of him but for the Glory of you and so he could be a help to others and and I just know I've seen it and our our congregation have seen it and Lord I just ask that you would just touch our pastor this morning and go in touch brother Andrew as he brings forth the word it's such a powerful sermon last night that we all need to apply to our lives now Lord Jesus just come and anoint this service this morning anoint the words allow them come to life and just be able to allow us to draw higher and bring a faith like never before we're just so thankful for what you were about to do in Jesus name I pray amen [Music] amen at this time we'll receive this morning's offering May brother Malachi Spencer come sing for us if you would and then Sister Abigail Morris she would come after brother Malachi

they were facing was fearful their ship seemed so small in the waves and the winds just kept blowing harder but yet they were still also safe from out of the dark he came walking he had never lost

tried Your Vessel with fire you'll never come forth as pure gold I I didn't know how much he loved me until I passed through this storm and looked back I didn't know Jesus was all that I needed till he was all that I had sometimes the storm that you're facing may seem like your whole world has changed and the fire just keeps getting hotter as the Potter keeps shaping the clay French Jesus he knows what he's doing even though it causes you pain he just wants us to know he's still in control and that he is still the same and you'll never be filled till you're empty until you're broken you'll never be home until the Potter has tried Your Vessel with fire you'll never come forth as pure gold I didn't know how much he loved me until I passed through the storm and looked back I didn't

verse 11 and then to Deuteronomy chapter 20 verse one yeah I feel good this morning hallelujah amen uh let's just go to the Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly Father we we beseech your presence Lord Jesus the god that wrote the word father the god that said in the very beginning Let There Be and there was father Lord we recognize Lord that we're not in the presence of just mortal men Lord these are the redeemed of god father you thought of these children father before the foundation of the world they have something on the inside of them that has attracted them to you father I pray father that today Lord when would be so special for each and every one of us father you know how just to be personal to us you know how to make yourself real father and how to come to the level that we are on Father some needing salvation some just needing deeper Revelation father I believe that you can be God from the little child all the way to the eldest person in this building today and Father I just invite you father to come and take the word just now begin to Express who you are to us oh God and begin to take us Lord from from Genesis to Revelations father and to show us who we are in our position as sons of God lord we stand here as a body of Believers holding our pastor brother Ron before you father Lord a mighty man Lord that needs a touch from the master today I pray that you would surround him with the glory of God the healing that you paid for 2,000 years ago I pray father that the angel of the Covenant would just sweep into the room where he is there father and Surround him with your glory and strengthen him in his innermost being father Lord not just not just coming out of surgeries and out of a heart attack but coming down from a meeting the taxation of that upon a body father it can be so so heavy on one father so father you see every detail of his energy of his body and I pray father that you would just go through the blood cells of Ron Spencer right now and let creation take its perfect work in its body in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that you'd be with him and bless this service today in the name of Jesus Christ amen Joshua 5 and verse 11 and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the tomorrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parts corn in the self same day and the Mana ceased on the tomorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year and it came to pass that when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said n but as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant to me this is one of the most beautiful scriptures that there is that God can take you from the place that you are and make you a worshipper I love this scripture because Joshua is what we know as a man of war but immediately in these moments of the presence of the Lord Joshua becomes a worshipper and I believe that no matter where you are no matter what your your state or your career of life is that God when he shows up that he desires you to worship Him and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so I think that's beautiful right there I think it's really beautiful is that God gives the commandment and then Joshua follows it I think it's really powerful things that we just read over sometimes how powerful that it is is that God doesn't just give us a Commandment that God doesn't just give us a rule God doesn't just give us a word but the power in your life is you obeying that word of God Deuteronomy chapter 20 and verse one and the Bible said when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and SE us horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be when you are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them here o Israel you approach this day under the battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies and to save you may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord and I would like to speak to you from this context today I would like to speak to you on a thought on the angel goes before you and your Victory is sure the angel goes before you and your victory Victory is sure ain't that a wonderful thing to know that if he's before us that our Victory is sure and now we know that as Bible students and message Believers we we we've studied the words of God and we we understand that God and believe that God has Legions of Angels at his dispersal and throughout the span of time that God has allowed Humanity to be able to look out and to see these angels as they've came into existence and anytime that anytime that we see an angel or we see we see them show up in the scripture it's a signal or it's a sign that there is a junction at hand and God allows men to be able to a be able to fellowship and to be able to converse and to sit down and feel the very effect and than the influence of that Heavenly realm because we recognize that when an angel shows up that it's aign to a generation that God is getting ready to do the miraculous that God is getting ready to change over and you watch what is happening with Joshua that that he goes from this spot of eating this is the last day that he eats of the old corn of the land of the Mana that fell so God is taking him in to a different position God is taking him further into into his inheritance now notice that we know this that that that the angels of God are encamped about the children of God brother Bram would say it like this in expectation and what love is he said May the angels of Heaven come down through off of the ladder of Jacob and take their position now as soldiers at their post of Duty setting every place every corner every place and take their positions and may they not leave this building until the Revival o is over and I pray that that that is the same exact way here this morning that the angels of God would come and take their position and that that they would not leave their position until you have your personal Revival until you come to your full victory in Christ until you come to your personal experience I pray that the angels of God would come here today and watch you worship and watch you praise and and watch you come to your position as sons of God those angels are in their position but they're watching and waiting to draw you into your position because Angels the angels of God are here and are here on purpose and their purpose is to draw you not into their presence but the Angel's purpose is to draw you into Jesus Christ's presence because their presence is only something that signals us that there is a supernatural realm here but if we can get in the presence of Christ it won't just change our demeanor it won't just change our outside but it'll change our Outlook it'll change our soul it'll change our body we don't want to just be be people of words we want to be people of Destiny we don't want to just be people that say the right thing we want to be the kind of people that live the right kind of things we don't want to be the people that stand around and say what the prophet said we want to stand there and live what the prophet said and if angels are at every corner and taking their positions how much more as Sons and Daughters of God should we rise to our position Hallelujah William Barham said in a spoken word is the Original Seed he said the spoken word of God is a seed it's got to come back to this word and that word will produce what it says he said that's the reason that I believe in Divine Healing he said that's the reason that I believe in Visions that's the reason that I believe in angels He said that's the reason I believe this message is because it comes from the very word of God that's the reason why we preach the message that's the reason why we preach that God's got a holy ghost for you it's because it comes straight from the word of God and I believe that you can trace your very existence all the way back to the word of God and I believe if you've not spent much time in the word of God I believe that you ought to do it because I believe that's what Christians do that's the right thing that Christians do no matter what they do no matter what they say they always bring everything back to the word of God and if they ain't correct in the matter they'll take it back to the word of God and repent of that matter but I believe that you can you can trace your very existence back to the word of God and when you go to searching out your hisory history and searching out your inheritance and searching out your heritage that you'll find that you came from the very mind of God and I believe that's why Joshua could stand there with such a fervency in his heart as a leader of all of Israel he could stand there because he knew that he was called by almighty God he was elected to stay with the word of God and that's one thing that God is always look for in every generation and in every time that God has always looked in every age for somebody that will believe him against hope when there is no hope God is always looking for that one who will stand up in the face of opposition and that they will be a real believer he'll be a real have a real man of Faith a real genuine Faith no matter what the situation is that Jesus would say that when the son of man comes in the last days will he find Faith so it shows us that we're living in an hour when men do not believe in the word of God anymore but I want to signal to all of Heaven There is some Believers down here at Full Gospel Lighthouse that truly believe all the word of God and I believe that that that was the kind of man that God had found in Joshua that he was a man that was going to fulfill prophecy that he was going to align hisself or match hisself match his testimony with what the angel was saying and I believe that that God had found somebody that he could hook his word in brother Chris that really believed him let me say it like this I believe that that the Lord allowed Joshua to be close to him was because he knew that Joshua wasn't going to walk away from him when things got hard and when things got tough Joshua was allowed to be close because he wasn't going to walk away with all of them old dead Fighters that that had left the had left the Mana that had left the things and wanted to go back to Egypt Joshua was allowed to get close to Jesus because he was elected to be close to him Hallelujah and Joshua had a desire upon his life to stay right there right there in the presence of God to stay right there God knew something about Joshua that maybe maybe maybe today that maybe you don't fully understand who you are but God knows who you are and maybe you've been called to a position and maybe you don't understand how you're going to get in that position or how that you can stand in that position but God has deposited something on the inside of you he knew that Joshua would not run from the freight he knew he wouldn't run from the battle but literally he would turn his eyes towards the battle and that's what God is looking for somebody that's not afraid of the battle but somebody that is certain of God somebody that knows who they are Hallelujah now in question and answers he said which is it he said an angel's a servant he said but we are Sons and Daughters he said which is the most thought of your servant or your son or daughter he said Oh my he said prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel yes sir because he's a son W woo he said that's right my brother my sister you don't the church he said I don't believe that this side of Eternity how will ever realize how that what you are and the position that you are that God has placed you Spirit-filled people that you're sons of God why angels are servants but you're the son an angel can only bring a message but you have to act amen you're the actor on the scene you're the son the angels are servants to bring you to the message said I brought you to this message for you to do such and such this is from the father I bring it to you that's all that it is amen you're Sons and Daughters of God now look at this Jericho was before Joshua and the angel was standing there but when the the angel shows up it signal to Joshua that the victory was assured now Joshua is one of the or Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in all the Earth that Jericho had had been had had been inhabited you can go back and study out the history and find out the potteries and different things that they laid back there in the bronze ages and all the different things and they found out that Jericho is one of the oldest people pieces of land or real estate that there ever is in all of humanity that was inhabited but it was going to be the very first piece of real estate that Joshua was going to go and possess he wasn't going to have to buy it he was already give to him but Joshua had to go and make a claim upon it you see Joshua done seen the supernatural he does seen the supernatural in his ministry he doesn't seen Visions he's done cross the river of Jordan he done sent spies over the Jordan he done send a family over there apply the token he done sent some take boys in there preaching a message and they went in there and they got a lady I know I've been leaving you there for a little bit Rahab but today's your day today's your day Rahab I know you've been sealed up in there since Joshua chapter 2 but I want you to know that your deliverance is in the room now notice he said one day while Josh was out there he he was studying a strategy for the attack upon Jericho he said and one day while he was walking out there or one morning looking out towards the gates all over how great it was they could run the chariot races on top of it in some places it is said that they could run three to five chariots around the top of them walls they were that thick and Joshua was out there looking about a strategy and Joshua was looking out there he looked and standing over there against the wall and there stood a man had his sword drawn Joshua drew his sword I went to meet him and Joshua screamed are you for us or are you for your enemies he said but no I'm am the captain of the host of the Lord he was signaling to Joshua you're on my side you're on my side I want you to know that that angel is in this room and he is is signaling to you today that you're on his side you're on his side and if you're on God's side you are assured the victory I love I love what the prophet does here and the great warrior Joshua notice notice how that the prophet identifies the mighty one that Joshua is standing there he calls him the leader of Israel that he's none other than Jesus Christ that he's the Unseen Captain he's the same one that was there in the pillar of fire he is known as the angel of the Lord he is the omnipotent one he is the invisible one and he is the same one that Abraham met in the one MDC notice what the prophet is doing he is saying and signaling to this generation that the one that has stood up is none other than than our Jesus Christ now the angel that stood at the pulpit with William brandom was not the mighty Angel it was an angel from the presence of the Lord but if you read Revelations chapter 10 it is Christ The Mighty angel now notice that one that is standing there brother brother random would take some time in this and he would lay some things in and I don't want to spend much time here but he would tell us he said now that one that appears to me he said now that's not Jesus he said because this man this Angel is a very tall man a big man about 6ot dark hair all of complexion Got Deep set eyes he said but Jesus is a real short man now I'm I'm going to leave it right there but when Jesus Hallelujah but when Joshua is standing there he looks out there and what does he see he sees the captain or the mighty Angel himself standing there with a sword in his hand I want you to notice this that when the angel is standing there with a sword in his hand he's already got it un sheathed it's already ready it's ready for battle now notice when Joshua is standing there he when Joshua is standing there when he begins to signal to him who he was and who Christ was what does he do he simply puts Joshua and he positionally places him as Jehovah savior as Joshua the one that was going to bring Deliverance to all of Israel what was he doing he was standing there this is an attachment that this is not this is not just a angel that is standing here this is not just one of the boys that is standing there this is Jesus this is MDC this is hallelujah I know that I know that sometimes people hear the angels near and they misconstrue it but it is this this Mighty angel that you see in Revelation 10 notice how he signals himself by his name he's not a weak Angel he's a strong Angel he's not a loose Angel he's a mighty Angel and he knows what to do with the word of God and notice when William brandham is standing up there at Pulpit Rock he's standing there and all of a sudden he said there's a good place to pray right here and he started praying and when he stood up what was in his hand none other than the King sword the same sword that Joshua looked on that angel and he saw that sword which is the word of God ah Hallelujah this ain't some special sword that was just given in this generation but it was this age that it was UN sheathed it had been locked up it had been sheath for so many thousands of years but in this age in this age our Joshua our leader unath the sword as Charlie Torres would say it's time to sink the sword Hallelujah some of you is here and you know what I was talking about some of you won't brother Adam will tell you about it I got to reading this book I got to reading a book this week about about a battle that took place in the 1500s and it's called the rise of the Dutch Republic and the and it describes these battles that was taking place in the 1500s between Holland and the European cities there and Spain and and and the word that the that the author wrote it said that with with God on our side that we are in the majority I find that amazing that William Brandon would would say the same exact thing to us is that when you and God are together that you are a majority now notice notice what in the book here it said that there that there was a letter that was in there during these times of war from the a from the prince of orange that Howell that he had raised up and men were asking him about how he was going to do the battle and he said that you've asked me if I have entered into a firm treaty with any great king or potentate to which I answer that before I ever took up this cross before I ever took up this cause and to and of these oppressed Christians in these providences he said I have entered in to a close alliance with the king of kings and I am firmly convinced that all who put their trust in him shall be saved by the almighty hand that the god of armies will raise up armies for us to do battle with our enemies and his own that go Hallelujah if an Earthly King an Earthly Prince could literally write these words that you ask me have I come in close relationship with any of these other colonies and any of these other countries out there but I'll say this I have come in contact with not just a king but the King of Kings notice he did not say that just was a king sword but he said this was the king sword so you're not just fighting with the king of Egypt you're not fighting with just the king of England you're not just fighting with a king of Spain sword you're fighting with the domain of Heaven now William bandham would tell us in the message that they that God the greatest gift that he ever gave to humanity he said the most powerful weapon on the face of the Earth he would tell us it's prayer he would tell us it's love and he would tell us that it's the word of God so if we're going to go to battle we've got to have love we've got to have a prayer life and we've got to have the word of God hallelujah hallelujah the Lord knows how to to appear to you in your situations of Life some of you are in need of Deliverance today and I want you to know I want to signal to you that the deliverer is in the room some of you are in need of healing and I want to signal to you that the healer is in the room today some of you are in need of peace in your marriage and I want to signal to you that the king of peace is in the room I know what I'm talking about because he knows how to make himself known to you in the attributes that you need him at the moment what did he do when he showed up to Abraham he showed himself as MDC the king of righteousness and the king of Peace because Abraham needed a peace in his body that would bring forth and manifest an 18year old man that could produce an Isaac so he showed himself as MDC the king of righteousness when he showed up to Jacob he showed up to Jacob and the prophet was distressed of the conflict that he was having with his brother so what did he show up to Jacob as he showed up as a wrestler so God knows how to show up to your wrestling match he knows I'm right on point I'm right on point he knows where to show up at he knows how to S signal to your situation that I am that I am come on somebody and when he showed up to Joshua he didn't show up there with a pacifier in his hand he didn't show up there with a bottle in his hand he didn't show up there he showed up as a warrior he showed up as a warrior because Joshua was in war church we in war if you ain't figured this out by now hell is against this church and we are in the midst of battle but God did not show up here as some weak God he showed up here as a mighty God in pattle he said you watched him as a Healer but get ready to watch him as a warrior Full Gospel Lighthouse I want to Signal this to you and the body of Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus Christ is taking the case of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we won't lose and we won't back down how do you know that brother Andrew because when the angel shows up your Victory is assured how can I say your prodical are coming because God said so how can I say your healings in the room because God said so Hallelujah so our Lord knows how to show sympathy and to show up to any condition of Life remember when the prophet is there in his room and that evil spirit is tormenting him and remember when brother Adam said these words he said Satan you're an offense to me leave the brother mam said then the sweetest presence come in the room and he said never fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go wherever you go I think it's very powerful because it shows if you cannot fear it shows you've got a great weapon on your side You've Got Love on your side don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the ever failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you now William brand said now God is always present he said if we can only remember that that the angel of the Lord encamped about those who fear Him He said in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is a host of angels thousands of them gathered around Hallelujah I can feel them in the room you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they are here if that isn't so then the scriptures isn't so if if the scripture isn't right then God isn't right the Bible said the angels of God are encamped about them that fear the lord they don't leave you they stay near those that fear Him Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them then that makes him in a world that we cannot see that our five senses does not contact Jesus Christ is here he's present if he if we could be only conscious of that what is an angel It's a messenger that God has a messenger in this room and that messenger is the word of God it is the Holy Ghost I pray that the Lord God today would do for you like he did for Gesa when Elisha stood there and he prayed over him when Gesa was fearing when Gesa was nervous when Gesa looked out there and seen the host of the armies of the armies of the Syrian Elijah said these words Lord open his eyes that he might see that there's more with us than there is with them because the prophet knew that Psalms 91 said I will give my angels to take charge over [Applause] you we neither in the room Hallelujah them Angels ain't leaving you I know his little children they know that song Angels watching over over me maybe they don't know that song but if y'all need to hear it me and Gabriel can sing it we sang it when we was 5 years old I was probably I was probably nine he was probably five we can sing it for you we look like a bunch of kids up here probably need tiny to play the cords CU I don't know them but there's angels that are lit they're literally watching over you that's why William Brandon would stand there and he would tell us now you see that picture he said it he said it influences he said you ought to have that picture of that angel watching over those children going across that bridge you know what I'm talking about got that got that board that's missing and there's an Angel that's watching over it he said you ought to have it in there because it's an influence upon that little child what is it doing it's signaling to their subconscious that there's an angel that is here that's why David would say I have heard Thy word in my heart that I might not sin against you he always constantly he wrote it up on his bed post he wrote the word of God wherever he was because he wanted to be conscious he wanted to be conscious that he was always before the Lord now angels are throughout all the Bible Angels appeared to Gideon and they placed him as a mighty man of Valor when Gideon didn't even know that he was a mighty man of Valor what was it it was signaling to all of Israel that he was a god of Deliverance and that it was proof that he was God going to be God Our Savior notice notice in demonology if you ain't listened to it for a while go back and listen to it he said now up here now notice this is what I want to get to you you watch the very power of the realm that you're fellowshipping with all right watch the realm that you're fellowshipping with if you're feeding on things of carnality that's the realm that you're fellowshipping with if you're feeding on the word of God it shows what you're in fellowship with he said now up here he said Christians are influenced from above he said this is a parable he said up here is another ghost the Holy Ghost the ghost of a man Christ Jesus he said the Holy Ghost influences his church in the realm of mortal so it shows us that our Lord Jesus Christ can influence the very life matters that we are in is that right he controls the winds and he controls the Wass is that right so the holy goes influences CH his church in this realm of mortal he said the Devil by these Spirits influen men now look the next is Angel the next is God and now every Mortal here is influenced by one of these worlds so we don't see it with our eyes here though some of us have been granted to be able to look in there and see the pillar of fire or see a supernatural Haze go over the congregation but it's got to go beyond these five senses it's got to we've got to go into a realm where the supernatural God can take us into a supernatural world and produce Supernatural Miracles because if we are ever going to be the people of God and know that he's God then we've got to know him in the power of his resurrection and we will do exploits when we know him when you start looking at that Unseen World and you start looking into it by faith what is going to take place William brandham said that when two omnipotents meet that the omnipotence is going to that the miraculous is going to take place it is an angel it is the Angel of the lord it's the angel of the Covenant it's the pillar of fire it's MDC that he said in Exodus 23 and 20 that I will send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him so what is it it was the same one that was leading the children of Israel that that stood there in Exodus chapter 14 that showed up as a pillar of fire and he opened up the Red Sea then he opened up the Red Sea brother brandham said that one writer wrote it this way that God got so mad at the devil that God looked down through there through the pillar fire with Angry Eyes and he opened up the Red Sea I tell you how God how Mad God got it his enemy that God opened up the Red Sea five miles wide don't tell me God don't know how to make a way for your business to prosper come on somebody if he's a way maker and he can open the Red Sea five miles surely he can prosper your business surely he can give you health surely he can give you wealth surely he can prosper you surely he can deliver you it's that same Pillar of Fire that led them by night and would stand there and be a cloud to them by the day now let me say this to you that the one that goes to you that goes with you in battle it matters I'll just be dead serious with you I don't really count on President Trump or president Bren or President Obama and any of these presidents that are down throughout our history to go into battle they won't matter too much to me in my battle because I'm not fighting them kind of battles but I am fighting a spiritual battle Lord have mercy don't lock up on me if you're trusted in that kind of man you need to come to the altar because that won't get you out of the battle that you're in there ain't no salvation in Trump come on somebody you're fighting a bigger battle than Biden can figure out you're fighting a bigger batt that n Yahoo can figure out you're fighting a battle against spiritual wickedness in high places but there is a God he's the god of armies that controls the wind that controls the waves it matters who goes in the battle to you if you got one walking in with you brother Jordan that's liking to the son of man you going to step out of the fire and not even smell burnt if you walk into a valley and there's a Goliath that's down there calling your name you're going to come out of winter when you walk into a valley then when you walk into a pit that's full of lion Den there's one in there with you that the pillar of fire has showed up that them lines can't eat you I tell you the God I'm talking about is a God that knows how to walk on water it doesn't matter the battle that you're in it doesn't matter the situation that you're in are you hear me today the god that I'm talking about will walk on Waters just to come to you he'll make a highway out of waters let me tell you something when Jesus was asleep in the boat the winds didn't wake him up the waves didn't wake him up but woke woke what what woke him up was the sound of his children's voices calling his name ah come on now come on I'm in the battle I'm in the frea but don't you give up don't you give in the winds ain't going to wake him up the waves ain't going to wake him up but if you call on his name in the midst of your battle come hell or come high water let floods come let Fire come let lions come let Giants come let torment come blessed be the name of the Lord Our God will raise up a mighty [Applause] warrior what are you saying brother Andrew when he's there when he's in the room when he's present when you can feel him Hallelujah when you can feel him in the room when you can touch him we can handle him I ain't talking about some emotion I ain't talking about some psychology I ain't talking about some chill running down your back and running down over your neck I believe that can come to you too I believe that he can manifest himself and he'll sweep over this congregation and pour out his Spirit but I'm talking about when you feel him in the room not by your emotions not by your feelings but by the word of God you said you know that he said that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and when you know that he's in the room and when you know he came for your case when he know that he ain't gave up on you what am am I saying to you your Victory is assured Joshua was a man who knew about the cement he knew he built these walls before he knew it was going to take a supernatural element to conquer but he showed up because of who you are why' he come in 1950 and have his picture taken over our prophet he showed up because of who you are come on somebody look out there look out there on Mount Sunset look out there look out there what is that out there don't look and try to see the angels in the cloud see the one that showed up it's him Hallelujah he has Vis he has visited this generation he's appeared to this generation but he did not appear to you to leave you in Creeds to leave you in dogmas to leave you in change to leave you in man Hallelujah he showed up here as the mighty Angel the angel of the Covenant and when he showed up here he didn't show up here sister Phyllis with a clo book The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to loose the Seven Seals thereof Hallelujah what's he got in his hand what's he got in his hand he's got your name and the reason why he showed up here is because you mean something to him Hallelujah when Jericho when Jericho was over there can you imagine oh I hope you hear me today I'm enjoying myself but when everybody else can you imagine all the city it is said that anywhere between 2,000 and 7,000 people are on the inside of Jericho that's a big number but they're all dead so they can't tell the testimony so how'd you hear the story always love that we got a Bible that tells us a story but anywhere between 2000 and 7,000 people are there in Jericho all shut up why because of you amen you know how powerful that you are let me remind you how powerful you are that if Satan touches you if he touches your womb and tries to take your virginity away from you that God will literally shut up the kings of Egypt's towns that they will completely become desolate that's how powerful that you are I'll tell you how powerful you are is that when you pray God God will send an Angel by your way and if you're still right in line with the message God has got angels to show up at your Juniper Tri El to minister to you to touch you to fellowship with you he's got Angels at every hand he's got angels that can March over you and one person can pray and 185,000 Assyrians are destroyed by one Angel what are you talking about brother Angel I'm talking about you are living in an hour you're living in an hour that he's here he's here he's here now his Corporal body is coming for you one of these days but his physical presence of Jesus Christ the anointed one is in the room and he's looking for myates that will literally take him at his word and destroy the Yoke of the enemy I can point you back to where he was with Abraham I can point you back to the land I studied the lands out I've looked over it I can point to you where Abraham was I can tell you where he met mzc at I can look at the Battle of Jericho and I can point it to you on a map where they say that Joshua was looking at Jericho but I don't want to just be where he was at I want to be where he is now stop wishing you was back in William brenham's day you don't need to be where he was at be where he is now right now in the presence of the Living God the same God that would stand there with Georgie Carter and raise her up and would stand there and tell people what their address was is the same God that is in the room how bad do you want to get loose Rahab how bad do you want to get out of your prison house how bad how bad have you spent your time standing there in prayer asking for your dad to get in asking for your mama to get in how many it ain't in vain Rahab he's in the room and he's showing up to bring Deliverance to your house what is it what does he do to us give me Revelations 10:8 please and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the book take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel what are you doing with this message and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book come on John I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up I ate it up I didn't let it sit there stagnant I didn't let it just stay on the real to re I didn't let it just stay on the tapes but I ate it up I became the book I became a physical living image of Jesus Christ I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter what am I saying to you that when you eat this word it brings merror to your bone but it causes a war on the inside of you but he gives you some instruction this ain't just William Brandon that's giv you instruction this is the mighty Angel this is Christ himself saying and he said unto me John thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings what are you going to do brother Andrew I'm going to say what the message said what am I saying to you that your time of silence is over Saturday was silent but Sunday there was proof there was an empty tomb it's a new day it's a dawning of a new day the son of man is up up the Son of God is here what is it the time of silence is over and it's time to release everything that the prophet has given to this generation what did William brandham say that you would be a final voice to the final age that you have got to prophesy you've got to take your position as a son and daughter of God if the Thunders have shouted out their voices and he woke up the sleeping bride The bridegroom's Voice what is it it has awakened you to realize who you are as a Son of God you're not just a churchgoer I know I might be talking to churchgoers but I'm talk I know that they might be hearing me but I'm not preaching a message to just churchgoers I'm not just preaching a message to Spectators I am preaching a message to a virgin born bride the Bible said in 1 Corinth 14 and8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle there ain't nothing uncertain about this message because it's not our words and it's not a man's words it's the Angels words William brandham said in the uncertain sound he said soldiers in the days of their training they are trained to those bugles how them sounds to retreat and and what they are to do and everything they're trained by a sound that if they don't know if they didn't know that sound how in the world would they know how to prepare themselves that's right but they've been train to that sound and they know when that sound goes off it means a certain thing I'm not trained I'm not trained to their message I'm not trained to the Catholic message the Catholic sound doesn't signal anything to me come on somebody when the pope gets out and sends up a smoke signal that they're asking for a new pope I don't send any signal to me but when I hear the voice of this message it signals something to me that there is a Harmony there is a Harmony between the soldiers and the sound what is it you're trained to it you listen to these things you listen from 47 you listen always 65 you know these sounds you know what he's talking about in deity you know what he's talking about the deity of God you know what he's talking about the godhead explained you know what he's talking about why some people can't live a Christian Life you know what when he's talking about when he says why I'm a Holy Roller you know what he's saying to you when he preaches marriage and divorce you know what he's saying to you in invisible Union and things that are to be and communion and fellowship and love divine the lamb and the dove you know what he's saying to you because you're train to it there a there's a story in a battle I I look forward I can't find exactly where it is it's a story that they were they were in they're in the middle middle of a war and and and the captain's looking out across the war he's looking out across it and he sees how that the enemy is getting is getting control of it excuse me how that how that the enemy is getting control of the Battleground and the Battleground is is is being overcome by the enemy and the enem is coming in close and the captain and the captain of the of the of the army begin to holler out to his soldiers he said sound the retreat but the man that had the bugle had never trained for the sound of retreat so we just kept sounding Out the sound of charge and he just kept sounding Out he said hey sound out the retreat and he just kept playing charge he said no play the sound of retreat and it kept playing charge I said sound off the retreat but it kept playing charge and the men heard that sound and they went out there and they won the battle the captain took him to the side said son I told you to retreat he said let me tell you I heard you loud and clear when you was was saying sound the retreat but I was only trown I was only trained to play charge I was not trained to back up I was not trained to give up on God's promises I was not trained to give up on our young people I was not trained to give up on the Rapture I was not trained but I am trained to say little bride you got everything you have need of got it off now sound the charge we're not giving up we're not backing up we're not giving up on brother Ron we're not giving up on our prodal sound it charge come on little bride you got the message you got the sound you got The Voice come on Rahab get ready you're getting ready to come [Applause] out I'm not a crazy man some of you don't understand what I just did but the air was blowing on me if I didn't if I didn't put that coat on at that moment I was going to lose a voice thank you brother Matthew how how you here without a Preacher Brother Homer's voice has been silenced come on these other brothers voices have been silenced but God still has a Voice come on somebody God ain't looking for somebody that's dead in the grave for them to sound off he's looking for you to sound off come on Moses did his part but this ain't Moses's job come on somebody this is Joshua's turn this is your turn it's time that you turn from the old corn and go onto the third pool Ministry it's time that you start prophesying we don't need squirrels we don't need to speak a snowstorm out of existence but we do need a rapture we do need a body change we do need our loved ones we do need healing we do need miracles now Josh is a warrior he's trained for this and he's standing there brother bam said he's out there looking at Jericho studying it out how am I going to destroy this city how am I going to destroy this city I've got a lady on in there it's got the token how am I going to go in there and get her out and destroy all the other thousands of people that are in that City and then upon that moment the captain of the host stands between him and Jericho I love this that the angel wasn't looking at Jericho but he was looking at the one that held the promise the angel wasn't looking at the problem the angel was looking at the problem solver the angel was looking at the one that had a commission on his life that every footstep that he took was ordered of the Lord the angel ain't looking at cancer the angel ain't looking at heart trouble the angel ain't looking at sugar diabetes the angel ain't looking at arthritis the angel ain't looking at covid the angel ain't looking at the flu the angel ain't looking at your little puny circumstances that's so minuscule to the angel the angel is pointing you to the solution of your condition what are you saying I'm saying the angel between you and your problem is the solution how did Eve get in trouble trouble is when she stepped out behind the solution she stepped out and she took her guard down she got out there out behind the Fortified word and every single time young people when you get outside of that fortified word you are living a defeated life the moment that you step out upon your own condition and upon your own thoughts you are living a defeated life but if you can keep the angel between you and Le oy between you and your bank account between you and your prodal between you and cancer between you and your heart problems between you and your restrictions between you and your Rebellion between you are you getting the picture now if you can keep the angel of the Covenant between you and your situations Victory I tell you what it's probably a good saying they taking that platform down today cuz I could probably shout all over top of that thing right now if you can ever get the angel between you and your problem people get ready people get ready what am I talking about it's time that you prepare yourself a dancing party it's time that you prepare yourself to have some victory you've been living in defeat for too long you've been praying over the same situations for too long you've been asking and got the same prayer list for the last 2 years years it's time to change your situation from mourning to dancing it's time that you change the feet into Victory it's time that you turn things around and you've got the ability Joshua Joshua 6 says now Jericho the problem the situation the cancer Hallelujah was straightly shut up because of you won't you tell your problem to shut its mouth come on somebody why don't you tell cancer why don't you tell addictions why don't you tell anxiety and depression and all those things to shut your mouth going to be a good day going to be a good day I told you I feel good this morning I done have myself 15 cups of coffee and I'm ready I've been up before the crack of dawn so I deserve 15 cups of coffee I didn't wake up this morning to see you down here Walling around in your distress living in your defeat I'm here to get you to the way that God saw you before the foundation of the world job where was you where was you J Rob I saw you [Applause] shouting not crying shouting why cry unto me speak Hallelujah and they were shut up because of the children of Israel and none went out and none came in I'm talking about your problem shutting its mouth so that it can't utter a word let me put it in picture for you all of Harrisonburg was shut up because of you and none of them came out and none of them came in I don't know about that brother Andrew actually well let me put it in the picture for you there's about 3,500 people that live in Gros so we'll put it right in the parameter of Jericho that none went out of Grotto and none came into Jericho because of you now you can imagine this Jericho can be seen they can look at the river of Jordan all the way over there you can watch the Panorama brother Tom it's a beautiful thing all of a sudden you're standing out there on the wall you're looking at the wall catch a nice little nice little sunshine it's a tropical place it's a place of Palms palm trees it's a beautiful place it's known as the desert place and people out there got their suntan on they've got their Sunray Visions on they're getting ready for the the lunar eclipse and all these different things they're getting ready for it they're out there and they're ready let's just get myself a good tan let me put some of that Browning tanning lotion on that look real good when I go before the king so let's go up top here let's get a good look and all of a sudden what the world's going on back here do you see them Waters they spread wide open what in the world what in the world is going on it's two million people coming across that thing I don't think they saying there hey we got plenty of room in here in Jericho for you come on in we got plenty of groceries and toilet paper we've been stocking up since Co don't laugh about it you know you still got reserves I'd say they were screaming what on Earth is happening here it was a signal to Jericho that the people that Joshua had sent over there in the first place were coming to take what was rightfully theirs where's well over 200 people in here today and it's a signal to all of hell that we're coming for everything that is rightfully ours and the Lord said un Joshua see I have given it into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall Compass the city all you Men of War and go around the city once thus shalt thou do six days and the Seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram horns and seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow the trumpets and it shall come to pass I love when God says it's going to come to pass because this ain't my word this ain't a man's word and it shall come to pass that when they make a loud blast with a Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound of the Jubilee trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend what is this message it's the message of Ascension what is this message read 1 Thessalonians 4 what is it it's a shout it's a voice of an archangel it's a trump it is an ascending message and the walls shall to fall down flat and the people shall Ascend upon every man straight before him I'm going to ask you to do a little exercise for me today cuz I know what kind of people I'm talking to I've seen you at your ball games don't get all dignified on me today come on you sure rooting for them tar Hills and them Blue Devils he said no I wasn't I'm a hokey I Senor te ball games you don't mind who's sitting beside you when a little Junior hits a home run you don't mind at a football game riping well we got the wrong crowd here these people don't rip their shirts off these people don't get excited about church like some people do they they're them quiet kind of folk I done sat beside you too long I've been right there in a lawn chair bear with you now come on now I didn't help you shout at at Junior's baseball game surely you can help me shout at my game nah nah y'all don't want what I got y'all don't want it y'all don't want it y'all don't want it come on now come on now you know who you talking to I'm your pastor I've been with you I seen you when you shouted I seen you when you got up you grabbed your little B on you had rocks in there and that sounded like a freight train coming down through there you let out one of them Rebel yells That's my boy blue I ain't talking about some ball game and I shout with you with them I'll go with you y'all invite me I'll go with you we'll go final four we'll go you take me I'll go with you but I cut that off internet I probably just got dismissed from message churches all all over the place but let me tell you something I won't act no different there than I would right here I know how to live an overcoming life in church out of church in a ball game at a hospital in a bar I ain't never been to one but I know how to live I know how to live an overcoming life you put me anywhere because it ain't me it's the king come on somebody come on somebody nah nah you ain't there yet you ain't there yet some of y'all still been out them ball game shouting so you ain't got no voice you got so excited about your team that you ain't got no voice left that'd be a sorry outfit to come to house to the house of God and you can't praise God so because you're so wore out by being out there living with the devil all night now come on I was with you Nate when he was running that football I was with you Adam when you shooting them three-pointers I was with you I was with you Seth I was with you I've been right there with you Malachi but I ain't fighting for something carnal I'm fighting for eternal [Applause] life hallelujah hallelujah it's worth it brother alonza it's worth [Applause] it it wasn't just shouting just to make noise I know a lot of people get get confused they just they like it loud in that place well anything and anywhere Jesus is it's always got a little noise about it but they weren't shouting just to make some noise they were shouting to match the message you hear what I'm talking to you you picking up when I'm putting down they were shouting because they were matching the message what was it Joshua had talked face to face to the captain of the host of the Lord he told them what to do to March around the wall sound the trumpet and let out a shout remember Joshua who gave you the Liberty to shout remember little bride who gave you the Liberty to shout I got big huge walls in front of me brother Andrew I got huge obstacles in front of me but the shout that's coming forth from your lips is a supernatural shout what was it their shout was in harmony with the Angel's words but I'm afraid that too many times people enjoy their silent time well we done got the seals brother Andrew we done got perfect love and we've got all these things and you know we We Believe in holy hushes I tell you what we don't believe in getting emotional well let me tell you if you felt like we [Applause] did I believe there's a time to be silent I really do believe that what's that word um against popular opinion I do believe in silence because Silence has its place but too many times people's victories are held up by their silence too many times they keep their children locked up because of their silence too many times people keep them locked up in their bedrooms doing their own things because of their silence come on too many times people enjoy reading Spurgeon more than they read William brandom they enjoy their Silence of the man age too many times people enjoy being silent because they don't know what to do and what they're doing they're leaving their Victory on the outside because of their silence now let me tell you you don't walk around this thing for so long we ain't built here to be a bunch of MSY pamsy silent IC [Applause] Christians let me tell you the angel is here the angel is here the lord of the Covenant is here and when he shows up your Victory is at hand I know this don't make any sense to you I know that this is a paradox I know that you can't understand that if you shout that walls are going to come down I know it don't make no sense I know sometimes you don't understand what I'm talking about when the angels and in the room I know that sometimes you don't understand what I'm talking about that all you've got to do is reach out and accept the Lord but I'm telling you that on the other side of your shout is your Victory come on somebody come on somebody come on somebody what is it the shout of the message has woken this bride that's why he's appearing to you this is the rising of the sun verse 15 and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose up early about the dawning of the day and they Compass the city after the same manner seven times and it came to pass here it is there it is and it came to pass at the seventh time when the PRI blew with trumpets Your Leader Jehovah savior said unto you the people that matter the people that's been elected to get close to where he's at because you wouldn't walk away he allowed you to get close to him he allowed you to fellowship with him he allowed you to handle him he said unto the people of the open book this is you shout shout for the Lord hath given you the city I'm signaling something to you right here this is more than just me going down traditions of following out a series the angel of the Lord led me to this point I was standing with brother Michael Ray in the Bible Museum and the Lord showed me a vision that it's laying right here that it's time you put up your stones and stop throwing on everybody else and lift up a shout unto the Lord for the Gate of the city is yours shout your victories in the room shout shout it out the angels in the room angels in the room he's moving he's working the city is yours your problems are ceased don't leave them locked up come on you done prayed about it you done ask the Lord about it but the Bible didn't come to you in this generation to give you a bound up book but a loose book an open seal an open voice your shout has been loosed you're not serving God from some Fable you're not serving God from from some from some tradition you're not serving God out of ideology you're serving God because the shout matches the Angel's message let me tell you something too many times people have been bound up and been told not to shout and been told not to praise and been told not to loose their mouth because they're afraid they can't live to match the message but the reason why you're shouting the reason why you got a voice to shout it's because your life matches the [Applause] message I give you your Liberty in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] prison doors fling open house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ look to the rock that is higher than [Applause] I I don't know what you talking about brother Angel I'm trying to tell you this that on the other side of your shout is your Victory walls fall when you shout oppression leaves when you shout I ain't making you emotional I'm trying to attach the spiritual parallel between the opening of this message to your physical manifestation of you enjoying the presence of God walls fall Giants fall trouble cease chains are broke I'm going to need some quotes brother Andrew I'm glad you ask we can just shout that down he said if the walls of Jericho fail by some shouting well why a little bit won't hurt us now would [Music] it just a little bit come on now come on come on now I've been watching you and you're right there on It come on Joshua you're right there at it yes Hallelujah you done camped all night on this thing you done camped all night you've been praying all night on this thing it's time today's the day today's the day a little shout wouldn't hurt you now would it maybe the shackles would fall off there I know I know you've been going through through some stuff sister Rachel I know you've been going through it and the Lord's dealt with me about this thing it ain't nothing but an evil spirit that's trying to block it look at Joshua look at Joshua before one rock came out of that building of the walls of Jericho Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory what is a prophet signaling to you before you see your problem solved you got to shout the [Music] victory sometimes you got to praise God before your husband comes to the Lord sometimes you got to praise the Lord before walls fall before Giants [Applause] cease there it is there it is your Victory is behind [Applause] it this ain't some mental workup this ain't some emotion this is a party of the Holy Ghost led by the shout I know what I'm shouting about I know what I'm dancing about I know what I'm praising about all right all right for by faith he saw the victory he know the walls was coming down and he armed men and walked around and around and around and around around Jericho come on Denny get you seven men get your seven men let's walk around this thing get some men some men that know who they are some men that know who they are been redeemed been called been elected been chosen all right real men real men come on come on today's a day today's the day today's the day trouble cease when you begin to see the victory problems are over when you see that Christ holds it [Music] ah I ain't working you up I'm signaling to you that there's elected men of God that'll bring the strongholds of Satan down well I want to join them well get in line get in line get in line get in line today's a day Rahab today's a day you waited for a long time and we're on our seventh round these guys got some reason to walk these guys got some reason to shout Joshua it's time to possess your inheritance [Applause] some people may laugh and talk about me when I shout but there's one thing for sure I know what I'm shouting about when I left my sins at Calvary I'm a covered by the blood I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm cradled in his [Applause] love [Applause] come on W you take a lap for brother

forgive me for not making mention of this sooner but we want to officially welcome them to full gossip Lighthouse they they made their home here this week they've been this has been quite some Journey for them to get here and we just want to welcome them and say God richly bless you on your Journeys here I think it's a pretty good service to make us your home Church in and I tell you if the Angel's for you he got Victory ahead of you so we want to welcome them make them feel welcome here and you that's been coming and know know the journeys of it you know how to pray for them some of you don't understand what's going on but brother alen had a vision many many years ago and uh he probably don't want me to tell this but I'm I'm going to that uh it's back when back when we had some real circumstances here and people kind of just things rejected the Lord showed brother out in a uh a church that was on fire before God and at that time if you remember we probably we probably what maybe 1005 120 people we don't measure we don't measure by numbers that by no means I take five that's in the will of God but I just want to show you that we're right in Step the Lord showed brother alen this church exactly like this completely full to the brim not of make Believers but real believers so you're right in line brother Shannon so I I just want to tell you if you don't you don't like what's going on here make room amen make room because we got a Rapture to take and we got a body to prepare and we're bringing in anybody and everybody we don't care what their name is don't care their circumstances we just want rugged real Believers here and the vision is coming to pass may God bless you today as you go go out reverently I know that it's hard sometimes just as you're exiting because of those the vest of you the way it is but I ask you to be very reverent here I know that we have a project that is going on but we we want to do that reverently as well and I think this is a signal to us here projects going on weddings that are being prepared I think that we ought to witness the signaling of the Holy Ghost that God has major plans in store for us so as you go today go reverently and may God's blessings be each be upon each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ go loving each other and loving the Lord we dismiss you today in the name of Jesus Christ God richly bless you oh the way I'm going all the way oh all the way
