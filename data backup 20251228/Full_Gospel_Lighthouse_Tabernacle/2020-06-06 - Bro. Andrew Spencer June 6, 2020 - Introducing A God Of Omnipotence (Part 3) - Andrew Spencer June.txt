you're a child but it's even an incredible scripture to me now amen i'd like to i wanted to speak to you this evening just for for a second if i could and evening time i don't feel quite as well as i do in the mornings and i'm a mo bit swell this evening i feel i feel a lot of things but you know in spite of your feelings sometimes you just have to do and so we thank you for your prayers and we love you with all of our hearts and you're such a wonderful people i thought about the song that was sung and matthew sung it earlier tonight it's still the truth it's still the light it's still the message [Applause] no matter what we're going through no matter what trials we're in it's still the truth god knows what we'll be going through in our lives he's so good to us i think about the time that we're in now when the world is rioting and they really don't know what they're writing about sometimes if if we take note of all of the noise that's going on god just allows a lot of things to happen and if you look god's doing something he's doing something riots were happening in 63 and the seals were being re-released it didn't bother god's program none whatsoever and it don't bother it tonight they were rioting when when jesus was at the at the hall and they were standing there screaming and they would choose barabbas they would choose barabbas and their their jesus was today they've chosen another leader and they turned down jesus of this day once again even in this hour i think about all that's happened with covet and the different things and i i just think that god has so prepared the bride of jesus christ covet doesn't bother us [Applause] we've got a token you might get sick but we've got a doctor hallelujah i'm glad we got a doctor and he's in the house and he's a provider [Music] hallelujah brother johnny provides for us and sometimes of our lives to where that we think god's been watching over these things for years getting ready for this moment tonight you'll hear the provision to which god has made knowing these trials would come all right and i think i think when we when we listen to a message we think well it's just another sermon but i've come to learn that brother jonathan no sermon it's just another sermon amen i went back over some notes and last night i found this note brother timothy pruitt was standing in the pulpit here and if you'll remember you preached a sermon on the sound of freedom and uh toward the end of the sermon brother timothy pruitt as he's preaching on the sound of freedom he comes to the end of that note and he and he said in the war what they would do brother joe is they would they'd write a note to the enemy and he said they'd write a note to the enemy and here before we would find out about cancer he said why don't you write a note to that cancer devil that's getting ready to be released he said why don't you send him a note tonight because it's a sound of freedom i set where you sit [Music] [Applause] and so you know i i i looked at that last night and that was kind of in my last thoughts of the evening i went and looked at it again i looked at it over and over during the day yesterday i don't think i even shared that with you yesterday because i didn't want to bother your thoughts for the evening but i thought you know i'm going to go to church tomorrow evening and i'm gonna sit where i set when that was sent and i'm gonna put a note on the bomb [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sister anna and i want to share with this with you if you remember my healing is connected to yours and i'm going to be healed [Music] [Applause] tonight put a note on the bomb you know i didn't feel like coming but i thought tonight i'm going to put a note on the bomb and there's no better place than to put the note on the bomb than sitting right here and set in the seat where the sermon was preached and while we're listening to the sermon tonight i'm going to be actively reminding the devil i'm here [Applause] [Music] i'm here hallelujah [Applause] my presence tells the devil he hasn't won hallelujah amen they asked teddy roosevelt a question because teddy couldn't see past the end of his hands everything was blurred they said why are you so interested in making national parks all over the world he said one day others can see what i've wanted to see [Applause] oh what a land oh what a land he may have never been able to see it properly but they put his head as a monument on one of those mountains amen god bless you i believe god has provided for us an incredible sermon this evening and i don't have a whole lot of insight to it tonight but i'm looking so forward to it i so love you with all my heart amen and you pray for me in the morning i'm going to come back and try to preach in the morning so amen god bless you i so love you with all my heart amen god bless you let's stand this evening [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] blessed be the name of the lord well i have to tell you we've already had church we could close up the bibles and walk out right now but i believe he's intended on putting a note on while this while this bomb is going forth so let's let's give him that due diligence and uh you know one night he was he was as this journey began to take and transpired brother ron was standing in that corner over there and i walked out and he said look he said show the devil no mercy he said because he showed me none so as the people of god we ought to show the devil absolutely no mercy tonight we've already heard it pardon the noise pardon the noise it's just the sound of freedom hallelujah hallelujah there was a it was a man that had a lot of afflictions in his life one time he was blind he was death and he was dumb they said and he would go to church every sunday and there was a man that would take him to church and he would go to church and like i come down to a spot and they asked him said why are you going to church i had a way of speaking to him he said why are you going to church you can't hear nothing you can't see nothing can't understand nothing he said just to show the devil whose side i'm on hallelujah i've showed up here just to show the devil whose side i'm on amen hallelujah if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of second kings chapter 2 and verse 11. i believe your little buddy that's that preached on the sound of freedom is listening tonight so i'm sure he'll be sending his amens with bombs right behind it amen i'd like to speak to you again by the help of the lord on on introducing the god of omnipotence introducing the god of omnipotence i believe he's here tonight i believe he's very near amen second kings chapter 2 and 11 before we read of the word this evening let's speak to the author of the word heavenly father we come before your great presence lord just now lord we truly sense the nearness of the holy spirit father lord for we know that that we have gathered here tonight lord to hear from you lord for you to speak lip to ear to us o god and in our hearts to receive the things that you have that you have delivered for this season and this our father you see every you see every person you see every need father you see those that are listening by the way of the internet the the other half of our congregation i couldn't be in this service lord but we know that that day's approaching we'll be together soon father while we're separated in this manner i pray that you'd bless those here and at home lord i pray that you would stretch out your arms of mercy lord i pray that you would reach out and let us see the mighty acts of almighty god father we know that the enemy has challenged and lord we're not standing here on our own front we're standing here upon thus saith the lord lord jesus as i was sitting in the office i begin to feel just the the atmosphere of hell as it begin to get nervous father because it has it is aware that it's going to lose it's aware that it is defeated it's aware that that it cannot hold us and father i pray tonight that the god of omnipotence would show up and show out father we know that in the the meetings of william branham that they would take people on cots and they would take people on in wheelchairs and they would take the blind and they would take the hard and they would take those of different sicknesses and infirmities father and you showed up there and you would minister to those people's needs oh god their faith would rise to meet the challenge to raise above their circumstances o god may we raise above our circumstances and not be under them no more o god but lord may our faith rise to the challenge just now o god as a people of god that are setting here lord i pray that the mighty angel that is that is with his word would stand at this pulpit and direct our thinking and direct our hearts lord may you strengthen our pastor and completely heal his body on this night on june the 6th of 2020 may it be marked down in history that while brother ron was setting in this service that this sweet holy spirit of the angel of god slipped through his vessel and completely restored him i believe you're a god of restoration i believe that that is what you have came for in this hour father to show forth and declare that you're still god and i pray that you would have your will and your way in the service in the name of jesus christ and the bride says ii kings chapter 2 and 11 and the bible says here and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire imparted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces and he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah i'd like for you to speak those words as we repeat them again where is the lord god of elijah and when he had also smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord one other scripture reading before we dive in this evening colossians chapter 4 and verse 2. now the bible says here continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving with all praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery for which i am also in bonds that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak now notice what paul was saying notice the humility of paul now wherewith pray also for me that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds that i might make it manifest as i ought to speak now this message that we have declared in this message that has come to us in this day it did not come to produce another denomination it did not come to educate us into another religion it did not come to build buildings or build bigger churches or to create another another sect or another scholar or to create create theologians of the message but this message came to restore us back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers that was once delivered that this message that was delivered to us is to connect us as a body of christ to the headship of christ and it is this message that is drawing the body of christ right into the presence of god and we see as this word is circling the earth as it's going around and it's and it's finding that fertile ground as it's circling as it's moving and we see those life uh the life of the grain as it's popping up and we see that that this is a move of the of god that these things are of god and they pertain to god and and we realize that this is the same gospel that paul preached and if what paul preached produced christ then this message that we preach must produce none other than jesus christ not a man not at my ideas not brother branham's ideas but it must produce none other than jesus christ and the same angel that directed paul to preach these things must be the same angel that is directing us as a body of believers to release the unfolding and the unveiling of the mighty god as we've seen as we've seen it foretold and here we are we're living out in this last gentile dispensation that god is calling out a people for his namesake he has not come just to create another church he has not just come to create just another religion but he has called to come call you out call you out of the world call you out of laodicea call you out of your sickness call you out of your diseases call you out of your situation call you out of your circumstances the god of the message is the god of the bible and the same pillar of fire that was moving and leading the children of israel is the same pillar of fire that is directing us it's the same pillar of fire that is moving us it's the same pillar fire that is here it's the same pillar of fire that will heal your body it's the same pillar of fire the angel of the covenant that will not back off of his word one iota no matter what is coming up against him he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he had power then he's got power now if he healed cancer then he heals cancer now if he delivered from sugar diabetes he delivers right now if he saves a loss he saves a loss now if he goes after the prodigals then he goes after the prodigals now he's not changing he's the lord our god and he changes not you are what you are watching and what you are seeing is just an introduction of who the mighty god is unveiled before us what you see what i present to you what the ministers of this message present to you is not a god that is dead but a god that is living a god that is a boy god that is capable a god is of the bible that is here and that is omnipotent that is omnipresent that is omniscient he's all-knowing he's everywhere and because he knows all things he can be everywhere and him being able to know everything he can show forth his majesty as the omnipotent god the all-powerful now we realize that his name is not omnipotent but that is a title that we realize that he is fulfilling that portion of that declaration that i am the omnipotent god now his name is not omnipotent but that is who he is his name is not often the present but that is who he is and when isaiah was standing there and then he seen when he seen the future coming of of the christ child as he's looking out there and it would be seven some some seven hundred and eight hundred years as isaiah is speaking those things and he sees as the christ is coming that unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders that he shall be called wonderful now that is not his name he shall be called counselor now that is not his name but he shall be called the mighty god he shall be called the prince of peace the everlasting father now we realize that those are not his name but isaiah was looking at the christ and declaring that he was the almighty god and to think about a prophet that could look into the future be in an eagle eye he could look there and see the christ child he could see him as he is now if isaiah could see him as he was 800 years before what about today as he's looking about upon a body on a body that is called after his name that is taken on his name that believes in his name he has not seen you down here as a weak bride but a mighty bride and he's living in a people and declaring that he is the mighty god are you with me now the bible says in deuteronomy 10 and 17 for the lord your god how many is is he your god tonight for the lord your god is god of god's and and lord of lords and great a great god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward now the prophet said this in the sardisian church age he said god is god and because he is god one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart his will and purpose but him but he being omnipotent is ruling in all affairs and doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure now i have to say that there are some days in my life that i wish i was god that i could maybe move certain things or do certain things but i am sure glad that i am not god are you with me and i'm glad you know that i'm not god you'll never believe you'll never have to worship me as being god you've seen too many mistakes in me but i'd have to i'd hate to have to think that i would have to be god and have to rule in all the affairs of men there's a lot of things that i don't even want to know about my own self but here god is ruling in all of the affairs of humanity and he's declaring himself as the omnipotent god and we see that very from the very beginning of revelations chapter 1 that he is the mighty god and he is walking in the midst of his church and now now bear with me i'd like to read this quote that i read last week and again from the second-handed robe he said but when he came down speaking of elijah and elisha and when he came down to the jordan to face the critical world what did he cry where is the god of elijah it wasn't the robe of elijah that done it it was the power of god of elijah that done it and the thing the world needs this morning is the power of the god of elijah he said you might have spoke of tongues and shouted and run over the floor but what we need is the power of the god of pentecost to produce the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic hour a second-handed robe was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from god he needed a fresh anointing from god he wore a second-handed robe when he came to the river but he needed a brand new first-handed call from god and a first-handed power from god to perform the miracle and a first-handed power from god to perform the miracle so he realized that he was not walking down there on his own accord that if he walked down there and all of the critics of the world was on that side of the river that he would be shown as just a mortal man but he needed a first-handed power from god now you know this in a in a circumstance or any situation as a human saying that you realize that you needed a god that was bigger than your sin to show up so you can relate to it in that manner that you needed a god of power to come and perform the miracle on your life but here we are and we think that well it was just it was just a little it was just a little thing for god to save you do you realize that the same blood that was shed on calvary that if you were the so if you were just a a person that had only maybe sinned or you never even drank or smoke or or doped or anything that it took the same amount of blood for you as the worst sinner there is out there in the world today so don't think yourself in some mirror some small miracle you are a miracle of almighty god and it costs the very life of god for your miracle hallelujah and my brother don't you be afraid i want you to hear me loud and clear my brother don't you be afraid to ask god anything you must demand god or ask god for anything that he promised for if i am introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful and if i be the servant of god i must do the works of god and if i do the works of god i must be a man of god to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible i have to ask him i have to call upon him and stand there and say god you promised it notice what the prophet is saying i have to stand there and say god you promised it oh hallelujah there's so many people that want to separate william branham from being a part of the bride but do you realize that what happened in william branham's ministry happened in the bride's ministry well hallelujah that he was no more than just made out of the same elements just like you and i are but he had a calling on his life he was a prophet for the foundation of the world but he was called and elected to be the bride of jesus christ just like you were called just like you were elected just like you were predestinated so if an ordained anointed prophet of god would stand there and say i have to say god you promised it you're not separate in the manner of being a bride you have to stand there and say god you promised it god you said it god you're committed to your word and he said so to you every person you shall receive power after the holy spirit has come upon you after the holy spirit has come upon you after you're robed as a christian after your faith is set in christ then you shall receive power [Music] hallelujah then you shall receive power there you are hallelujah so we're looking at we see these things that god is no longer a vague god that we probed at or a distant god but he's a god that is nigh he's a god that is here i want you to say he's here and he's ready to reveal himself and manifest himself to the sons of men and i have to say that it is our desire it is our desire that every person every young person every middle-aged person every old person would experience this supernatural god of the bible we're only here and telling you these things and preaching to you these things to present to you the god of the bible hallelujah because i know what he's capable of i know that he can save the worst of sinners i know that he can deliver to the uttermost i know that he's able to reach down his nail scarred hands and pull you up out of the my reclaim i know what he's capable of and it is my desire that every young person i don't care how old they are i don't care how little they are is that every person would experience this supernatural god oh hallelujah if he did it for me he can do it for you and allow these things to become a reality to you you see he's been the miraculous working god all down through the ages and if he has been dealt through the ages and then come in here to the closing of all ages could he belittle himself and weaken his power and say there's no more to it absolutely not you see for him to remain to be god he's got to move the same he's got to act the same he's got to declare himself the same he's got to be the same are you with me if he delivered if he delivered from uh tuberculosis then if he delivered from varicose veins then he's got to be the same now he's got to declare himself the same if you come upon the same basis of faith as this one did and you come upon that you are setting in a spot for god to reveal himself to you brother branham and he his first healing campaign is saint louis missouri they held they held there and brother madam went first and he and he and he met uh brother dougherty at that time and on the first night of the meeting there were some 18 people that were caught up in the prayer line some miraculously completely whole but then on the next day brother random was asked to go to visit a home in granite city illinois and there was a lady who had been paralyzed in her right side for about a year and brother branham prayed for her and then commanded her to rise in the name of jesus christ and she obeyed and immediately raised her right hand above her head and stood alone then she walked back and forth across the room clapping her hands her voice which had been gone was restored and she was able to speak now what was he doing he was introducing a god of omnipotence he prayed the prayer of faith it was not prayer alone that did it but it was the prayer of faith and it was bringing god on the scene and that lady that had been laying there in that paralyzed condition got up out of that condition what was it showing it was showing to you and i that he is still the creator that when satan comes and perverts and pulls and drags down that god is the god of creation and that he is a god is of restoration and he brings it right back to its rightful position one of the first visions in brother branham's ministry was of that sis uh mrs darrell ohania who was a who was a crippled who was an invalid uh being crippled for 17 years and brother branham was directed by vision and and this is one of the first visions brother branham had after after this mr daryl hannah had heard about about mr uh mr murrell that had been delivered from the hospital and god completely came on the scene brother madam has led to this sister's house he goes up and knocks on the door and asks if there's a crippled lady there he goes up there knocks on the door and he sees miseras daryl had as laying there in that condition drawn up like a spider sitting there reading an armenian bible and he goes to her and says god has heard your prayer and as he prayed for her she got up out of that bed now crippled for 17 years she got up out of that bed and started shouting and the people in the neighborhood thought that she'd die and they ran over and checked on her and they seen that she was up walking and shouting and praising god they said well she's just excited and let her muscles down in her legs brother branham ran into her a few years later she said to brother branham said now brother madam you remember they told me that i was excited and i just let the muscles down in my legs she said well i have to tell you i'm still excited because i'm still welcome who was this none other than the god of omnipotence the god of all power the god that is more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in us this same god was declaring himself as a shame hallelujah you remember when he's standing there in front of the crowds and the religions of the world in south africa after he had been entertained all day by the jews of the jesus of the sikhs and and the jains and and the religions of the world and there was a man that was led like a dog up to the platform had a chain around his neck walking and he said i brother branham said now he said i wouldn't have done this if i hadn't seen a vision he said but i stood there and i challenged the religions of the world if your god can heal him let him come let him come he said but i was able to look into that vision and see that man whole and see that he had gray hair in his sideburns he said so i could stand there and know that he was coming out of that condition i want to tell you that there has been a word spoke to you that you're coming out of that condition i'm coming out of it i'm walking out of it hallelujah and when they seen the omnipotent god show up brother branham said it was like a dust cloud taking place when 30 000 raw heathens accepted the lord jesus christ they broke their idols and created a dutch cloud of all of those idols that they had been packing around but this god that sold up on that day they didn't have to pack him around he was the god that would pack them around [Applause] hallelujah what was this showing to you as a body of believers that he's with you he's with you he's not leaving you he's not changing hallelujah so if i could just see a vision brother branham said that if you open up your bible every day you have seen a vision he told us that the vision don't heal you but it is simply to declare and vindicate the presence of almighty god hallelujah turn me to joshua chapter one have you got your notes have you got your notes i'm giving you some bombs tonight let's stick them on that bomb and send it back over joshua chapter one and verse one now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people into the land which i do give to them notice which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river euphrates all the land of the hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast now there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for under this people thou shalt divide an inheritance for the land at which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right or to the left that thou mayest prosper wither thou goest wither so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of the mouth now he's not saying to him that you should put your hand over your mouth and not speak it but he is telling him that you should repeat these things that these things should be coming out of your mouth that these things ought to be acquainted with you and when you're in your downtime as a businessman you need to be reading these things you need to be studying these things go over these things eat these things observe what moses said observe the law but thou shalt meditate in that word meditate in the hebrew means to speak again but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein that's huge that thou mayest observe to do according all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous then thou shalt have a good success have not i who i love it when god talks to us have not i commanded thee be strong be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest be strong and of a good courage you can look over in the bible in proverbs 28 i believe that it says that the wicketh runeth with the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are as bold as a lion they're as bold as a lion they're not afraid to go out there in their own when they're not protected when they're all alone they're not afraid to go out there so a christian is to be bold now the wicked which we know is a sinner we realize that a sinner that there is an element of fear that is attached with a sinner because a sinner has sinned they've got unbelief in their life and if you walk in here with sin on your life there is a certain amount of fear that is attached to you because you don't want that exposed you don't want that called out but the righteous is not afraid of that thing being exposed because he's already brought it under the blood so he can walk out there right in the face of the enemy and say i'm as bold as a lion i know where i'm standing at i know in whom i have believed and here god is telling joshua that this is your commission to go and take the book go into this land get that land i command you to do it that i will be with thee wheresoever thou goest is that not what the angel told our prophet in this day don't you fear to go anywhere for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you whether so ever thou that same angel the same angel is there when you don't feel him the same angel is there when you're afraid the same angel is there when you're in your humanity the same angel is there when you feel like a son of god he's not leaving you hallelujah our duty is to speak that word hallelujah i want to take some pressure off of you tonight because i feel that pressure and i feel that tension that there are people that sit here or maybe don't sit here or maybe maybe it's in the back of your mind or maybe it's on those on the way to the internet but i want to take some pressure off of you so you don't have to live up to this but i want to take this off of you that we're not trying to produce another william branham we're not trying to produce another william branham that would stand behind the pulpit and call out diseases and call out 40 40 things in a person's life i see you're here i see you're from the northland you're coming through a wheat field i see that you flew from here i see a doctor he's he's heavyset and got he's got these ring glasses we're not trying to produce another william branham that could stand there and call out demons and see black streets running back and forth but we are here simply to observe the word of this law and to speak that word and it is not hallelujah it is not the life of william branham that produced the works it's the life of jesus christ that produced the works of almighty god brother burnham was a vindicated prophet had the signs and he was completely identified and vindicated and showed forth and identified himself in the scripture as malachi 4. but this word this word that's been delivered to you is the word that vindicates you whoa ain't that something it took off all the pressure i don't have to identify myself but the word of the hour identifies me with this message with this god with this power hallelujah hallelujah but i love i love what the lord speaks to joshua he says my servant moses is dead but i'm still here come on somebody william branham's dead but the i am is still here hallelujah hallelujah it's an amazing thing to know this evening and i don't have to act like brother wrong that i don't have to act like brother donny reagan or brother tim pruitt the great mature men of god that stand there in their calling and in their anointing and i don't have to produce the works like brother donnie like brother ron like brother tim like brother biscuit but all i'm called to do is stand in my calling and i am called to stand here and god is the one that'll produce the works if he wants to produce miracles tonight he's the god that will do just that hallelujah joshua was not commissioned to stand in front of pharaoh and stretch his rod out and he'd become a snake and he'd become a serpent but his commission was simply to carry the children of israel over onto the promised land he didn't have to stand there and call out pharaoh and tell the locust to go back and the winds of god come down and send them back to the red sea he didn't have to stand out there and stretch out his rod and he command the sea to go to its place and hold in that spot but he was simply to speak what the word said speak hallelujah hallelujah it was not when joshua stood there at the jordan river it was not the rod but it was him taking what the lord told him to do it was him taking that word he didn't stretch a rod out there in joshua chapter chapter 2 or chapter 4 i forget the chapter just now it was not the rod that was standing there but he said when the ark of the covenant hits that water you see it was packed on the levite shoulder and when the ark hit the water the water separated from hither to the other what was it showing to you that the same god that was with moses what's with joshua hallelujah you don't have to act like me you don't have to act like brother branham you just speak the word that's nothing but the truth [Applause] oh give him praise in the house of god hallelujah and joshua stood there under that condition under that commission and he stood there and what did the children of israel do they followed that word right on through hallelujah it was at the jordan river we know what the jordan river typifies to us it was at the jordan river that god proved that he was still with joshua as he was with moses it was at the jordan river when elisha walked down there and he says where be the god of elijah and god proved that he was still god with elisha he was at the jordan river when john the baptist was baptized in there and he said behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world god was proving that he was in humanity and that you could take on divinity and when you walked down to the jordan river of death it was god proving that i am i am i am inside of you hallelujah there's power in that jordan river and you're standing at a spot just now for him to reveal himself to you and declare that he's god and there is none like him you see satan don't mind you coming to church satan don't mind you singing satan don't mind you getting emotional satan don't even mind you joining the choir satan don't even mind you speaking in tongues and hollering and jumping and shouting and acting like a pentecostal goddard satan don't mind he don't mind those things but when you start going and receiving the word of this hour that will whip the devil any time any place under any circumstance that's when satan gets all bothered he gets all tore up and all hails turn loose when you start receiving this word that is an omnipotent word that would do the same thing that he did then 2 000 years ago that's when satan gets messed up he don't even know which way to go he's running around like a like a dog with his tail tucked he's running around wondering how fast i can get back down to hell when somebody starts believing thus saith the lord satan gets scared [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you see satan would try his best to keep the children of israel from going in with false reports and rumors and negativity and tell them that you couldn't make it that you ain't strong enough they chain able that you can't overtake it but there was a believer there was a believer by the name of caleb that said we're more than able i wonder if there's a believer in the house of god tonight that would say that i am here to show that that is a god that is more than able to take us over into that land it's a good land it's a holy ghost land that will bring up a positive report of this land that this holy ghost won't kill you but this holy ghost to keep you you ain't got to be scared of this holy ghost it's enough fire on the inside of it that it'll come and it'll quench all of your sin and drive out all of your sin it's got so much power in that fire that it won't hurt you when it comes on the inside but let that fire turn loose on hell one time it'll drive demons right back to their spot but that same holy ghost is living on the inside of you i want to tell you children don't you be afraid of it you just let him come on in if your parents are afraid to open up a door open up a window let him in if they don't want to hear the tapes play you go up an attic and you let them tapes play if they don't want to see you praying you pray on anyhow you say brother andrew told me to do so i'm okay with it parents just call me up i'll back up what i said i wish that above all things that we'd prosper and be in good health that we would pray daily and continually pray and it is the prayer of faith that shall save the sick and whether it comes out of a two-year-old a five-year-old or a 90-year-old it's the prayer of faith that saves the sick hallelujah you see because satan knew that if the children of israel started going over in there and inhabiting jericho and inhabiting the land that he would never be able to get them out or dispossess them under out of it those believers believed they were under a word covenant to go in and take that land they looked back and they seen the god of history that he was a god of the present and that's what i want to introduce to you you know when you first fell in love with him don't you forget why you fell in love with him but i want you to see these things clear that the god that saved you and brought about a change in your life is a god that wants to come and renew himself to you and make himself known to you and introduce himself all over again you know sometimes i take my wife out on a date because she's still my girlfriend you see what i try to do is i try to keep introducing that flame of fire of love you know what i'm saying so that's what god is trying to do he's trying to introduce a flame of fire to tell you i still love you you may go through some trials but i still love you you may have been hurt but i know what hurt is all about oh hallelujah you say oh you don't understand brother andrew i've been hurt in every way possible i want you to crawl yourself up underneath the cross this evening and take a look up at the cross and see a man that was bruised see a man that was rejected see a man that took on humanity he knows what hurt is all about [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah don't get offended to me when i don't understand you're hurt don't get offended to me when i can't make everything work out according to what you want done but let you come to the cross oh hallelujah it's not a beautiful cross it's a rugged cross it's got splinters on the backside that every time that he would raise his feet up to catch breath in his lungs again every time he'd raise himself up he'd catch a splinter in his back he knows what your hurt is all about when his brother rohan preached the hurt will never stop the music oh hallelujah it is up to you whether what you do with this it's up to you if you'll let your hurt stop the music but i want to say as a member of the body of jesus christ the hurt that i've gone through will never stop the music [Applause] sure you're gonna have walls in your face sure you're going to have obstructions in your face sure you're going to have giants in your face sure you're going to have those things you're going to have those things those things are out there these things ain't make belief there's a real devil out there they came up against one of the greatest walled cities there was but before joshua took that city there was a man that was standing there with a sword drawn in his hand he was showing that he was a lord our god that is mighty in battle he was showing that he was the omnipotent and joshua said are you for us or are you against us he said nay but i am the captain of the lord's host and i want to introduce to you a god that has never lost a battle a god that will take you through a god that'll heal your body hallelujah walls that you see it's your duty to take them down oh my let that sink in the walls that you see it's your duty to take them down that the same god is acting through you it's not by might it's not my power but by my spirit saith the lord it's not up to you to produce the works but it's up to you to believe it's up to you to act it's up to you to move you don't have to produce the works it's the word that goes forth and the miraculous will follow hallelujah he said in the patma's vision he said now i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 22 that whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake whatever you say with that creative power of omnipotence god knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met give him praise how many here got the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah there is an omnipotent god living on the inside of you and your faith in that omnipotent god it brings the miraculous into plain view when you go to acting on what god said and saying what things so ever you need mountain be plucked up from here to yonder and i hear a prophet saying that when you speak to that mountain if only one grain of that mountain falls off it is moving keep speaking keep acting keep believing for jesus said i'm a coming hallelujah when the children of israel were commanded to go there and say what the tape said they went out there and did exactly what the angel the lord said they walked around jericho and they kept their silence for six days but god had finally had enough of silence and it come down to a spot where it needed an utterance and there was a door of utterance that was open to the children of israel and when they stood there and the priests blowed they blowed their trumpets joshua commanded the children of israel to shout shout don't hold your silence no more it is a time in the children of god don't hold your silence no more he has set watchmen on the walls that keep not their silence that hold not their day hold not their peace day nor night but they are stimulated to watch stimulated to speak speak the same thing that he said it'll produce the same works that he worked well somebody ought to shout [Applause] hallelujah it's your duty to shout it's your duty to let out an amen it's your duty you remember what brother branham said about his old dog fritz he told him he said the only thing he wouldn't go after was an old skunk he said but i could say all sick and fritz and he'd run out into that bush and he'd go after that skunk brother branham said now the biggest devil i know of the biggest skunk i know of is the devil and he said every time you say amen it means sick him oh i tell you tonight when the children of god go to amen and what the word says what are you doing you're turning god loose on the devil oh let's turn god loose on cancer tonight let's turn god loose let's turn him loose turn him loose don't hold him back turn him loose let him go let him act let him move let him speak let him perform hallelujah brother branham said now when he's standing there at an altar call and he's telling him he said now look he said you'll be quiet and be referee but when you see the lord perform a miracle you have every right to turn yourself loose to praise him how many is here has witnessed salvation in your life brother branham said that salvation is the greatest miracle that could happen you have every right to turn yourself loose to praise him take a look around devil we got every right we've got every right to turn ourselves loose to praise him hallelujah oh children hallelujah pardon the noise it's just the sound of my freedom it's just the sound of walls coming down it's just the sound of demons being cast out [Applause] you have a right to turn yourself loose to praise him give me deuteronomy chapter 10 and verse 21. let the musicians come deuteronomy 10 and 21. deuteronomy 10 and 21. he is thy praise he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for these these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen he is thy praise he is thy god he is thine omnipotent god these things that we presented to you this is jesus christ oh turn yourself to praising him turn yourself loose turn yourself loose and let god loose on the enemy what can stand against us [Applause] what can stand against the church hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises a standard brother branham said look at that church out there that denies the power thereof he says this and deity of jesus christ in 1948 he said look out there at that church that's cold and formless that is denying the power thereof he said they're taking their stand communism has taken their stand he said but the holy ghost is taking his stand and the holy ghost church of god is taking her stand it's a time to stand children it's a time to speak children hallelujah hallelujah go to praising him tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] look what the lord has done look what the lord has done he healed my body he saved me just in time he changed me look what the lord has done i got every right to praise him when i go to looking over the miracles that are happening in front of us it has to prove that the omnipotence is here and satan hates that that's why he's so against you is because he can't stop the all-powerful you know i was in a battle last sunday morning i was in a i was in a fix i had myself almost tied up and i was wrestling with a demon but i want you to know this that god came out that god came out on top what was it proving that the god of omnipotence was here and if he was here then he's here now i want you to lift your hands up and hold your knee that you have in your heart right now this word that's been delivered to you it's the same word it's the same word that paul preached and it produced christ it's the same word that william branham preached and it produced christ and it's in the mouth of believers it's in your mouth you start turning that word loose joshua realized who he was and he turned that word loose and he said son stand still and the word that was spoken from his lips nature had to obey why don't you just start speaking of that nature and let the supernatural start moving hallelujah almighty god giver of every good gift lover of my soul author and a finisher of our faith you're the one that created the vessels some to honor some to dishonor we stand here as the elect of god being foreign before the foundation of the world when the enemy has come in against like a flood he's come against us he's warned against us and we've stood here in high promises we've stood here in our faith tonight we've come out to see the sow down between god and satan and we are here as witnesses and watching the god of omnipotence so forth his majesty and his power and seeing satan run back run back to where he came from he's not welcome here and we are here to enforce the law to say satan take your hands off of god's property we say son of god oh son of god hang over our knee just now we've lifted up our hands we've lifted up our faith i pray that you show up tonight and let us witness the almighty god let us witness the omnipotent one that is ever present right now oh god you're greater than cancer you're greater than sin you're greater than our hurts you're greater than our fears you're greater than our passions you're greater than our lust you're greater than our situations you're greater than our circumstances you're greater than covet 19 you're greater than all that the enemy would try to throw at us you are a god that told us that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and we stand here as more than conquerors through the blood of jesus christ and we call out through that blood cell right now and we scream out and we command satan to take his hand off of brother ron spencer take your hands off of him the sugar problems that are caused by medicines the sickness that is caused by medicines the energy levels that is caused by medicines all of this is a doing of the works of the devil and we curse the life of satan right now satan you have no legal authority to hold brother ron spencer he's not yours he was god's before the foundation of the world hallelujah and creation is here to prove that he is the one that created it i call for life in that body i call for health in that body i call for strengthening that body that when he stands behind this pulpit in the morning that the almighty god would hold him up hold him up and lift up his hands and let him declare let him declare that you are the same yesterday today and forever oh oh i can hear paul say lift up those feeble hands at which hail which which hang on hell hang down oh we're lifting up our hands to a god proving that you're here proving that we believe you showing that we're on your side the word was on elijah's side the word was on moses's side the word was on john the baptist side the word was on jesus's side and the word is on our side we have taken sides of jesus satan take your leave oh take your leave in the name of jesus christ oh hallelujah speak to him children just speak to him children hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in the presence of jehovah in the presence of jehovah in the presence of the great i am [Music] [Music] won't you let him draw your children draw you into that being of omnipotence and let him declare himself as god god knew before he spoke these words that you would be in on the receiving ground and he knew that it would be this night that you would command the son of god to stand still he spoke this word in this season for you hallelujah i'll come running after you who troll me [Music] oh draw me lord and i'll come after you [Music] who you were for you hold my destiny were you alone or i am complete so draw me [Music] and [Music] oh [Music] the prophet would tell us the enemy could impersonate the first and the second but he could not impersonate this opening of the word the power you have you may feel like the weakest christian you hear a prophet say that the weakest christian when they go on their knees hell trembles i also hear a prophet say that the least little touch of god is omnipotent my dad is very familiar with working with bombs worked in the arsenal created bombs so he understands power so we kind of understand some bombs and
