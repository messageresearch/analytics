lives and he can make you feel like you're the only one sitting here amen I always I'm always marveled at that he can just make you feel like okay all these people are here I'm glad all these people came for my service and so amen maybe you can have a service like that today and amen what an incredible atmosphere that's here amen we just we come to have church and amen and so we just are so thankful for that if you will turn with me to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 amen amen Matthew 6 and verse 9 I would like to take a thought topic today on on the mark on the mark amen amen we have a new baby here with us today amen and so brother Ruben and Sister Abigail their new baby is here I suppose will'll be dedicating it a couple of weeks maybe so amen another one will be here in a few weeks and so if you stick around here it's in the water yeah yeah if you haven't looked around it's in the water here and so now I've done drink my drink of water and so don't expect sister Connie and myself to drink any more water amen if you want to if you can't figure out what's going on here see us after church and we can tell you what's going on Matthew chap 6 and verse 9 and this is Jesus praying and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name can you pray this can you say this with me thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen I want to pray for our nation today our nation is in turmoil whether you're a Democrat or Republican whatever you are uh we are at a very pivotal hour in our nation and yesterday Pro Pro that I pray for our leaders but always remember this we're from another kingdom and when our King came to Earth they murdered him and he died for me and you amen let's pray together maybe you have a need on your heart did you just like say Lord come by my way today I have a need as well Heavenly Father how we love you today with all of our hearts Lord we just pray now as all of our hands are lifted and we have great needs I'm ever amazed at your Miracle working power how that you know how to touch us sister seab breze this week had incredible need and and Lord we pray diligently for her Lord and this week that need came to pass and she was dancing in her house and Lord What a Mighty God that you are how that you so care for us now Lord we ask you that you would touch each and every need here Lord I I just ask you that you'd come on the scene sister Pat has an incredible need but Lord cancer is no great big thing for you and you're you're a God that heals cancer we have now fought it four and a half years five years and Lord whether it be in our brains or in our lungs God you know how to heal it you know how to keep us and and Lord today we ask you that you would just use us to speak to your children Lord we have incredible needs and we ask you to stretch forth your hand of mercy and as we would pray for our nation now Lord I Thank you for sparing Donald Trump and I don't know exactly where he fits into the all the prophetic calendar but Lord Lord we want to pray that God would spare our leaders and watch over them and May the angels of God protect them and and Lord until we go home we want this nation to be at peace that's what we desire to have it as good as we can have it until we come up to your heaven but we're we know in the scriptures when you came here to save us that was lost they took your life and what a brutal murder that they did now Lord Jesus we know they'll never be able to touch you ever again Lord just like when we come up to your Heaven father death will never touch us cancer will never touch us again sin will never be there now we ask you that you would anoint this service if we're not prepared to go to that place I ask you that in this moment today that you'd bring us into a position to where that we can come up to your Heaven Lord minister to us we thank you and praise you without you we're no speaker and we just ask you that you'd help us now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you can be seated when I walked by brother Nathan today I I had prayed a prayer in the back and I heard brother Andrew say what he said that Andrew Nathan had told him that I was one of his favorite preachers and and I prayed in the back and I said Lord if if you don't come I won't be nobody's favorite preacher that's right but you know by the help of the Lord we've we've been blessed through the years and brother Nathan is I remember preaching to him when he was just a little boy and next time I'd go see him and he was a big boy and the next time I would see him he was taller than I was and amen I'll never catch up to you now amen I'm glad that God is a god of variety he wants tall people and he wants short people and skinny people and I'm not even going there amen what a mess we'd be if we were changing oursel up all of the time wouldn't it be a mess in second Peter chapter 1 and verse 16 the scripture tells us and says for we have not followed cunningly divis fables this is quite a statement when we were made known unto you by the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus but were eyewitnesses of his majesty he stood there on the Mount of transfiguration and watch Moses and Elijah with Jesus there what a what an event that had to be for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when we were were come such a voice to heaven to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mountain Mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy we're unto you do well that you take heed as into a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost 40 writers but one author 40 writers but one author now remember this God's purpose can never be defeated if we could repeat that over and over today that would be an incredible thing God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing that can defeat it so happy we ought to be today resting in that beautiful revelation of the word of God that there is neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no death no perils nor nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of God you know we're quoting from Romans 8 what God has a imagine in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there's no demon we ought to sound that loud enough to the devil hears it there is no demon there's no power there's nothing going to separate us from great God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said it that's right I heard brother Nathan speaking last night no way he would know what I would speak this morning and he would talk about about the seed and that seed has everything inside of it for life's journey growing from from a seed under the pond or a a seed on a farm or whatever it be it has all the potentials laying inside of that little bitty seed now I want you to remember God deposited a seed inside of you aren't you thankful for that he predestinated Jew and that seed has the power within itself to become the Eternal thoughts of God that's right now where you're at now is just a temporary part of you and you look at all of your temporary parts and the stuff that you have went through in life and there's a lot of pages if we could write out the pages of your history there's certain pages brother Chris we'd rather to leave out because there's nobody knows you like you know you amen why didn't you say your wife well you know you better than your wife knows youen there's Pages you know that we would like to say I I would rather that that wasn't there but if you can think of it once this life is over with those pages are gone we will never know Moses as a man with high temper we will never know David as a man that K killed Abba uh bash sheeba's husband we'll never know people of that realm anymore it'll be done away with sin will be gone failures will be gone those situations will will be just be stuff so in this realm of Flesh we look at each other through the glasses of stuff and we know each other by the Realms of mistakes and failures and frustrations and overcoming life's journey but but in that realm through the blood that has been applied and our bodies being changed we'll never have these glasses on anymore that ought to make you shout am now and taking sides with Jesus he says what if God would have told John the Revelator now it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming and John would have come back and told the church well I guess we might as well eat drink and be married cause there's going to be many generations and Jesus ain't going to be coming back for 2,000 years 2,000 years plus now and he says so see the church would have been loose amen I want you to watch this term now there would have been no on the mark there would have been no waiting there would have been no expectation and after all it's your anticipations if you fall asleep in that watch that you awake with the same anticipations cuz it ain't going to hinder one thing you're going to be right there on time amen see what I mean when when St Martin awakes in the resurrection and St Paul and the rest of them it'll be just as fresh what a realm of Eternity cause they went right down under the same anticipations looking for his coming and there will come a scream coming oh Hallelujah and it will come for the whole church that's how it'll be so it doesn't matter doesn't matter when you went to sleep it what doesn't matter when your bodies wore out you'll wake with the same anticipations of the resurrection and the Rapture as you went into the ground with now I want you to just think about totally to the on the mark and it has a serval different meanings and i' let you just drop this to you on the mark means to be totally accurate right 100% totally accurate right totally unmovable 100% correct it means even an ownership the belong in to thee I love that last night because it fits right here as Jesus would say belonging to me he prays his last prayer in John chapter 17 I pray for them they are mine I want you to just notice and and and here's a good way to put it there's a good way to put it on the mark that's where we want to be I don't want to be 50% right come on I don't want to be 75% right are you with me now now I want you to just think about this would any of us go to church if you were 177% right I don't think so David you wouldn't come here and want to come and just hear 177% truth but I'll guarantee you most of us audience got up this morning and looked at the weather channel and do you know they're 17% right they're 17 I hope we don't have a weatherman here this morning I don't mean to offend you but I understand you're not in control of nature we were on the road coming down here last night and it was just raining real hard about 5 minutes from here and sister Connie said I hope we're getting that at home and I was thinking I hope we're not getting that at to church right now or we're going to be soak and wet trying to get out of the car and Nancy's Hair is just going to be everywhere that's my thoughts aren't you glad that man is not in control of the weather and I'm really glad that Grace is not in control of man I'm glad that Mercy is not in control of man now let let me just share a couple more a statement called cracking the Whip and this kind of goes with both of these statements here he said they he's talking about an animal between a thorough bread and a mu he said they stick out their ears and don't know where they belong mule he said what what do you mean where where where did get all of this what do you mean the Holy Ghost and I've never heard anything about it and he said you have to have some of this Fanatics and and that they don't know who their papa is or their mama is either and you and and you have to beat them around in everything you do and beat them here and beat them there and beat them over here and beat them there that's just an old mule but I tell you you don't have to do that to a thoroughbred horse you just crack the whip over him one time and brother he's gone I like a thorough breed horse I I I I I like horses in my office there's about 30 horses and he he statues thought I better clear that up he knows what he's doing oh how fine he is to ride a thorough bread he how nice it is to say come on boy and oh man you better hold on tight he'll leave you in the saddle in the middle of the air and that's the way it is with a thoroughbred Christian I'm getting to you receive you the Holy Ghost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins they're just gone just as quick as they can get to the water they can't rest day or night until they receive the Holy Ghost you know a Christian knows who his papa is and it the mule don't know which way Mama or daddy or Papa or who papa is or who mama is but for we that are born of the written word of God that's confirmed by the spirit said on the day of Pentecost if you will repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and breth a real born again Christian on his Spirit as soon as he gets the word he receives the Holy Ghost and in him then something then he knows where he's standing he knows where he's standing he knows about Divine healings and he believes he believes in the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he's born again oh I love that don't you now I you know I'm going to share with you just for a moment human flaw I was around when secret Secretariat w a Triple Crown is anybody in the building old enough to remember Secretariat and it was a horse that was just a phenomenal animal and and I Repent to you I didn't go to church that night because of now this is before Connie and I got married it was before I really got saved and but my grandma loved anything that I loved and she said you know you want to be here to see the race and I did and you can calculate about how old I was I was a late teenager and we were sitting there and now it's going to be the last race he's worn he's worn two legs of the Triple Crown he's a he's a long horse he's actually a his heart was actually bigger than the normal horse and and uh everybody seemed to be betting against him but he was a phenomenal phenomenal athlete of an animal and and that animal you know they that was before all of this scientific video stuff and that animal as it was getting in the in the stocks how many's ever seen a horse race amen yeah some have you seen it you're too afraid to raise your hands and so those animals they've warmed them up all morning and they're getting them ready and they've walked them and they've let them they've let them just do a little Trot now they don't wear them out but you know they trained that animal properly and the jockey on it he weighs about 120 lbs I graduated from school being about that size and so and so anyway he he knows how to handle that horse now the trainers got him ready but that jockey has the responsibility to at the right time turn him loose now the jockey's the jockey's not going to do the running on the jockey's not going to do any of the running but he knows the potential that's laying in this horse it doesn't matter once they get in the gate and how they take off if he's in number 16 or he's in number 10 all he knows is we have the potential to be number one when it comes out of the gate and so this animal Secretariat I'm just going to use it Secretariat steps in the gate now that animal he is ready and he knows as he's getting toward the gate he starts putting his feet down like this right here and as he's putting his feet down he knows what's getting ready to happen and he steps into the stocks and you know he he don't he he don't want to stand still cuz he knows what he's built for and he knows what he's bred for he's a thorough bread and he steps in the stocks and he's standing there and the rider he knows he's waiting he's just watching him and he's stopping those feet and he knows that gate is going to open and it's going to open at a certain second and and when he gets ready it's going to be a launch it's going to be a launch he can't be sitting there thinking about eating a peanut butter and sandwich he knows that this animal's getting ready to turn loose and all of the force that's inside of him is getting ready to happen we can eat grass tomorrow we can eat oats tomorrow this is the moment that I've been bred for he's standing there his muscles are riching he's ready and he's on the mark he's on the mark now that that jockey has a term called crack the whip he doesn't crack the whip standing in the stocks as a matter of fact he doesn't crack crack the whip the first 50 yards because he knows that animal's got it in him and he just starts carrying himself carrying himself there may be 20 in front of him it doesn't matter this is a personal race now now I want you to think and I want to bring you to a couple of spots here if I may and just share a couple of statements with me with you if you will I'm having a lot of trouble I feel like that horse standing in there amen cuz I know where I'm going I I saw where you were going last night with Joshua and the son and I felt like stomping my feet for a while so I'm having trouble keeping my feet still here for just a few seconds amen there's a scripture that says and this is one of my favorite scriptures and I'll tell you why in just a moment in Hebrews 11 and verse 37 they were Stone and they were saw asunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheep skins and in Goat stins being tested tested destitute and Afflicted and tormented the scripture now says of whom the world was not worthy don't ever just sweep across that previous scripture these were people's lives that's right these were brothers and sisters of ours that found that serving God was worth amen being stoned being son a su because serving God is greater than anything in this world it's not a it's not a conven gospel it's not a gospel when you feel like it we are sold out let me just say we are sold out it's not me and the world it's me and Jesus being stoned there's nothing Grand about that but it was worth it to serve God sir being son a suer it was difficult in the moment but what a reward yes sir destitute your family's left you everything is and you're alone Afflicted I stand Here Afflicted but I'm not defeated I spend the week with Specialists this week we we got a whole week of being with Specialists they're they're trying to they're trying to help me with my pents pancreas because it's died and so they're trying to help me and so you know I'm Afflicted but I'm not quitting I'm Afflicted but I'm not going backwards how many's been Afflicted but not defeated somebody ought to say Amen right there they Wonder in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receed not the promise but God having provided some better thing for us and they without us we're the final Runners we're the final Runners having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so let me just say this you as the next scripture will say it we have a great cloud of witnesses are you with me this is better than being at the Olympics all the Overcomers of all the ages are now standing in screaming in your ear that you can't hear come on finish this don't give up now when the devil is whispering in your ear in your closet time and you're a long time let me just say this to you many are screaming to you don't give up give the Lord a good hand right [Applause] there chapter 12 and verse one wherefore see and we're also passed about with so great a cloud of witnesses now notice we have a responsibility let us lay aside every weights and the sin was just so easily beset us oh I'm not a sinner no more but there's things that are difficult in your life that you'll wrestle with till the day of the Rapture some of it's just stuff let us run with p the race that is set before us are you with me now read this next one with us together looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God he says I was going into a baseball football stadium and I seen a little thing hanging over the wall that's always stuck with me it said it's not the size of the dog that's in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog do you mind repeating that with me just now it's not the size of the dog that's in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog of course Connie didn't know what I was getting ready to preach and so we've been away for a week and sister Stephany has kept our dogs and we have we have we have a dog Whitney has a dog they're brothers and sisters they're twins and so they're what they're two sisters and my name mine is named Dorothy and she they are they're bernardes po Doodles so that means that one part of the dog is a poodle and the other is a Burmese mountain dog I'll give you a little history here about a year ago I was in the hospital middle and I and I was walking in the hall and you'll like this and I I was walking and the Burmese mountain dog was going down the hall and the trainer was with it and I said can I have a moment with this dog and I got down and that dog just licked all over me and she said do you have an attachment to this dog and I said I do I said they brought this dog when I had brain surgery and my head was wrapped and this dog climbed up in the bed and laid there with me and I fell in love with these kind of dogs and I said so now we have a Burmese mountain dog that's with a poodle now my dog took after the poodle it's got black all over you stands about that tall it's in your lap it's in the bed it's licking all over you it's the best it's the best caring dog that you can have Whitney's dog took after somebody's neighbor now you got a story to go with that and her dog is about that tall so con Connie is telling me not knowing what I'm going to preach this morning Connie is telling me said you know Stephanie's dog is a Sharky it's an Abomination before [Laughter] [Applause] God and that dog is about this tall and it's got an attitude that thinks it's this [Applause] big and so it's the King of the Hill though it be this tall and this big and I can just imagine our two dogs with it this week and they've got an also a loving attitude so I don't know how it all worked out it worked out okay good I'm really glad it did you know but I've met some Christians that were this big and they thought they were this big I'm preaching to you now they were this big and they thought they were this big D you getting the picture they were this big and they thought they were this big and I've met Christians that were this big and knew how big they were and they were ready to fight now let me just say this you as Christians we don't fight one another [Applause] we were built to destroy the kingdom of hell that's what we were built to do now in Revelations chapter 1 Jesus is standing there with you and his right hand now you say well brother Ron he had seven stars in his right hand but remember you was within one of those Stars you were under the influence of one of those Stars so so he has each one of those stars and he's going to release you at a specific time you could not have lived in Paul's day cuz he didn't build you for that day you could have not lived in John West's day cuz he didn't build you for that day you were built for this day now listen you were ordained to open over come so God specifically builds you as as clay in The Potter's hands and send you into the Earth you're nobody's accident you were fearfully and wonderfully made he knew how tall you would be how heavy you would be he knew everything about you eye color that's right your eye is nobody else has an eye like you nobody else has a fingerprint like you what a great big God that you and I serve he not only created the universes in plural form but he built you specifically so individually that he would meet you on a personal level nobody in this building has your experience every one of you has a personal experience with God Amen now I want to I want to just drop just a few names if I can and if you're here Satan you remember these people amen CU they really worked on your kingdom now I want you to just think when they're released at a certain time this is not Hollywood life isn't going to be perfect so let's just St start with John Wesley now John Wesley is going to be the leader of the Methodist movement he doesn't know it but all he knows is his father's Church stinks he can't see anything of God in his father's church and so he begins he can't preach there and they kick him out and he gets a box and preaches on the street and begins to assemble congregations as a matter of fact John Wesley will preach 88,000 sermons amen an average of eight sermons a day now I want you to just think just for a moment brother Bram says that 20 minutes of anointed preaching is equal to eight hours of work so I'm going to get about 16 hours here so he preaches that John Wesley will be hated he'll be hated you may hear a different story but he will be hated he will be stoned many times in his life and when he thinks his accusers are done stoning he'll lay there for a while until they're gone and after a bit he'll climb out of those stones and go home and make plans to go preach tomorrow listen when God puts something in you there's no he doesn't have a jar called quit he doesn't have a jar called coward it is overcoming power he's got driven he's got passion he's got determined he's got purpose that he plants on the inside of you and there's no going back [Applause] might interest you to know John was not a great big Goliath of a man 5 foot one I like that I like to say it it just sounds nice 5 foot one and redheaded on for those that you knew me earlier in my life I was just red as it can be my wife said she would never marry a preacher or a redheaded man Andrew will you stand up and show him your red hair now everybody blames me for the red hair but right there sets the guy that Vernon can we move on okay well that's a man brother Ron okay I'll pick a female Fanny Crosby anybody ever heard of her she's born blind she's born determined she's born with purpose in her life her purpose is going to be to write thousands of hymns that you and I sing today they invite her to a prison meeting a prison where prisoners are are are are being preached to and during the preaching the pastor has preached he's done with a service and when he gets done there's a prisoner screams out in the back of the building pass me not oh gentle savior and she writes the song pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry she was born in poverty and she would die in povert tre you know sometimes as a Christian we think well if everything's not going great we must be doing something wrong it may be because God wrote your book in a certain way that you could overcome even in pover tre cuz the rich man's going to have much greater hardship I'm quoting Jesus now than the poor man is going to have so here she is in povert tre and she was offered incredible amounts of money to write songs for the world but she refused it and she turned it down it would have made her life much easier she's getting getting ready to go into her house one day and they begin to make fun of her Fanny how will you know him when you get there how will you know him you've been blind all of your life and she said I shall know him I shall know him I shall know him by the nail scars in his hands she said one day that she was thankful that she was born blind because she never got to see the sin of the world and the first time that she was able to see she would see her loving savior what a statement a man named Charles finny are you are you okay with me Charles finny would be a preacher in Rochester New York and as he would preach people newspaper writers would come and know want to know what the attraction of Charles FY was because thousands are coming to hear him and they said that he had a nasal nose SP speech and it was hard to listen to amen he was hard to listen to because of his nasly speech that he would preach with but let me just say this to you they would go back and asked him said what do you think about this they consider you not not able to listen and hear and he said well I'm not the attraction to start off with they come to hear from Jesus aren't you thankful for that none of us are the attraction and I'm very much thankful for that because men and women will let us down when he preached it is said he preached under such an anointing until people would get under conviction five miles away and would drop their lunchboxes they called them pales at that time their lunch pales at that time and give their heart to Jesus Christ Amen brother Ron do you want a Ministry like that I would just love the ministry that the power and the presence of God would go to the back of the building [Applause] and every sinner that would come into the building would want to get this Jesus that's living that's my desire that you meet Jesus I'm not talking about intellectual ability or something that you could put everything together but I'm talking about a real Jesus that'll make you fall in love with him fall in love with one another can you can you say amen amen I have preached in the same building that the same this buddy Robinson preached in he preached he traveled 2,2 million miles for the cause of the Gospel he had 100,000 converts and he preached 33,000 sermons a man named Peter cartright that's mentioned in the greatest battle ever fought you remember the story when the town bully was there and he he asked the man said Can can I have a meeting here I'd like to run a Revival and Peter cart writes the response from the man said you'll have to whip me first and Peter cartright was cleaning the windows and he said well I guess I'll do that next and so he climbed down off of the ladder he beat the man to a pop do you know that man became a pastor of that church if you remember that there was an there was an Insurrection at the meeting and and about 30 men came to whip the preachers and all the other preachers stood back and Peter cartright whipped 30 of them he said I'll take one at a time and he whipped 30 of them listen God don't call Dy men panty waste preachers he's not looking for that kind of guy he's looking for lightning Thunderbolts and pull pits where men are men and they're filled with the power of [Applause] God I'd like to say this to you we're not pumped up Christians don't have to be pumped up all the time I've lost my notes but that's okay they don't have to be pumped up and patted up and baby around Christians are real I like real Christians I don't I don't care too much for Hollywood put on I like real Christians that are Christians when God they're when there's in a good time and they're Christians in the bad time there going to be bad times sure there's going to be bad times it's going to be difficult times I wrote this note and very personal to me and before we go any further because now I'm getting ready to preach to you and I I look at how things are are and I wrote this note where I'm standing at in 1986 brother Bisal preached this a sermon let us run in that service there was probably 1100 people sitting there in that service I felt the challenge to give my whole life life and my whole purpose to sering Jesus Christ and I've traveled around the world I've traveled many places in my life and I've seen phenomenal Miracles and I've seen incredible conversions I've seen things that that blesses my eyes and my thoughts walk dead raised I've seen cancers being delivered but the greatest of all that is when a man gets saved a woman gets saved and the life is trans transformed by the power of Jesus Christ as I was writing these notes for this sermon and I didn't write them just haphazardly and I wrote this that it might be a note even to my children if I am coming to my Finish Line I want to not finish as a coward am but I want to finish as a champion amen where did you draw that thought from well I I'll give it to you in 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7 he says it like this I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only oh I love this part but unto all of them he don't just have it for the preachers how many of you fit in this next verse but into all of them that love his appearing woo I feel like my heart's going to bust Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 Brethren I have not I count not myself to apprehending but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I want you to read this with me I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God which is in Christ Jesus I want you to read that again if you will with that on mind let us run and lay aside every weight and we are driven we are passionate we are determined we are focused you're overcoming whatever binds you and whatever condemns you every demon that tortures you we will overcome that should be more than a song We Shall Overcome let's say it together we shall overcome 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58 therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord can we say those first words together therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord Welly that says a lot of things I want to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord don't worry Gabe he takes too much after you you prayed for this I want you to remember this God's never lost a case I want you to say that my God has never lost a case my God has never been in a crisis repeat after me my God has never been in a crisis he has never lied he has never failed and he is an ontime God he makes one decision and it never changes his mind my God is Unlimited in his power [Music] America will probably never come back to God but last night was an example that close to assassinated a man and he just turns his head I wanted to look it up but they didn't give the calor over the gun of how fast that bullet was flying and God moved his head that quick amen but brother Ron don't bring politics in now I'm talking about you you're that close to a wreck you're that close to a cell turning into cancer you're that close to tragedy and you don't see it but there's angels of God that are watching over you they're protecting you Hallelujah now I want you to understand something tonight and I don't want you to take this wrong they will find somewhere that the secret service failed that a 20year old boy outsmarted all of those great men listen and they are great men so don't you think cuz we used to have one of those guys sitting in this church church and nobody knew it and I couldn't tell it but we had a secret service that was taken care in this church but I want you to understand you've got better Secret Service than they do they're called the angels of God to watch over you and your children Psalms 91 tells you that that the angels of God are encamped around about you I want proof okay I stepped out from behind this stage and I prayed for you on the job and while we were praying for you isn't this right how many bullets did that man shoot at you five bullets Point Blank Range when you've got Angels standing there there's no way they can hit [Applause] I think that's a powerful thing I think that's a powerful thing this isn't a what if this isn't a Hollywood gospel this works this works this absolutely works you were looking about getting a farm and God spoke to you that you hadn't touched the edge of the iceberg amen and now he has a phenomenal Farm let me just say this to you all through this building sister cbze will you stand just now she's back in the back of the building I I want everybody just turn around that's right she got a miracle this week thank you Lord an absolute Miracle this week I want you to repeat this with me if God is your partner God is your partner you just might as well go ahead and smile when you're saying it if God is your partner you better have big plans [Applause] this young man is a what are you an architect an engineer an engineer and he he wants to preach the gospel and so covid caused him to have to work from home and so in the last couple of years they wanted to force him to go back to the office but that was is going to inhibit him from going and preaching the gospel and traveling and so Elon Musk basil yeah even better who owns Amazon is that correct yeah yeah and so the guy that owns Amazon this guy works for him and and what do you build he builds Rockets so he'll bu he builds Rockets I used to build [Laughter] bombs when I walked through the China security they said you have a class one uh clearance I said yes and she said you built bombs I said yes built nitroglycerin she said don't do it here I I was going to do more than build bombs I was going to light some Bombs over there Hallelujah here's a guy that's preaching the gospel and you heard a masterpiece last night and the world thought they were going to force him back into an office and so God opened another door to where he can come to us and preach and to people all over the world and he can go and preach to them and still do a job give the Lord a great big hand right there I've come to a place here I I got a long way to go in my notes but I think I'll tell a story you think it' be a story good story time here my granddaughter the other day she's where's she at Ally Ally oh Allie's in the back Ally you're awake yeah and she says to me there she is she's standing up now she's like paa she needs to stand on a chair and she says to me she was over at the house and she said tell me a story Paul Paul so I told her a Supernatural story that I had been a part of and we I got went to her house the next evening she said Pao tell me another one of them stories and so you know it's kind of hard to tell stories unless they come to you and so I told her another story so every time I get around her she said tell me a story so Ally I'm going to tell you a story we were in China is this okay I know you guys haven't heard it and so we were in China and of course they they were if they catch you as a preacher you'll be there forever in their hard labor camps and so we were preaching for a brother and I'm not going to call his name because it may even cause him problems now because they actually do not have churches now they have to go from place to place to place to and they still do it have large churches that they travel from place to place to place to preach and so so anyway I was at the pastor's church and and so we're we're there and and even the police the chief of police comes in and takes pictures and he comes in and takes pictures you know and you can imagine as a preacher what that's doing to you and so so anyway I'm just watching him take pictures and let me just give you a little background this is not inside of a building it's a building surrounding a courtyard and so they're sitting in the cold and so when I sat in the cold and listen to brother Tom Ray preach I sat in a one of those fluff jackets and two blankets wrapped around me because it was that cold but nobody complained about how cold it was on the last night we had a prayer meeting prayer line i' preached about two hours to be honest with you not going to do that to you today and I had preached and the pastor's wife had a phobia what they call that clean phobia where everything has to be a certain way clean and has to be clean she couldn't have any company in her house no company in her house because she had to clean you know and she had to go behind you set your coffee when you could set your coffee cup down she'd clean behind you and you couldn't go to her bathroom well when brother Tom got off of the airplane he told her I'm going to come to your house to have tea it freaked her out no way was she going to let us preachers come to her house to have tea and we had had a prayer line and now in the prayer line it was Miracle after Miracle after Miracle she would be the last one in the prayer line the very last one and so I would pray for her I didn't know that but I called it out and said you have a you have a disease you have a phobia of dirt is it OCD you have a phobia of that and I called it out and I saw the angel of the Lord going to the building just going up to the building building now I'm going to drop a couple of just notes right here and it's going up through the building and so I told Tom and there's a lot of people left in the prayer line I said Tom we must go the Angels just left the building and there's a Chinese boy that's next in line he's this tall and his daddy standing beside they don't know any English and that little boy turns around to his daddy and says Daddy I just saw an angel go through the ceiling now that'll mean something in just a few moments this sister that's got this phobia it just leaves the next day she invites us as preachers to her place I don't know anything that's gone on I've done done forgot what's said in the prayer line and I looked at brother Tom and I said before we leave I got to go to the bathroom and brother Tom looks at her and he knows this is the ultimate and she says brother Ron you can go and brother Tom said well if he can go I can go amen hallelujah now the man that was in the prayer line and the little boy just only in a matter of weeks they have been given a handkerchief while we preach and we throw our napkin down they would run and grab the napkin and use it as a prayer cloth you cannot imagine how many miracles happened from us taking the napkins and wiping it and throwing it down and they would run and get it the boy's dying and the man grabs the napkin and lay it on the little boy and he comes back to life and doing extremely well give the Lord a great big hand I have just preached to you between 55 and 60 minutes and I want to I want I want to just catch your attention just now when I'm preaching on the mark and cracking the whip cracking the whip gives you and this is a definition of it you got to crack the whip on that devil you got to show him who has the authority and you've got to be on the mark for whatever God wants to do in your life amen when Jesus turns to his disciples and said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if they were just in love with his personality none of these men will be murdered for his personality none of the people will be sa aund and bruised and and be destitute and Afflicted none of them for just his personality but because of the life of Jesus Christ that was placed on the inside of them it's greater than anything in this world it has the power to transform your life amen what did it do to me in 1986 it transformed my life and give me a strength on the inside of me brother Ray There's No Going Back There's No Going Back sister Connie told me something in the in on the on our driveway going home last night she said there's something inside of you that you will never quit I want to Echo that with an [Applause] amen I want to just ask you a question to finish this sermon how many of you whether in the seen audience or the Unseen audience wants to be absolutely on the mark That's the second part of that sermon how many of you will take the challenge and put the whip in your hand and say Satan you're in trouble amen and I have been ordained to crack the whip amen [Applause] wo Glory Glory let others walk away let other say I I can't do that it's not for me I'm glad I'm ordained to say it's for me it's for me I'm built with passion I'm built with service I want to serve the Lord with all my heart God bless you let's stand to our feet today Andrew will you sing that song again that you sung just before just before I took the service amen
