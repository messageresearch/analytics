Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] just want to be with him tonight more than the neighbor beside you more than your family more than your friends just just to be with him the sanon is life to be with him it's a life to be with him brother Josh that's where I want to be it's connected to life I know that we as Christians we we have trials we have things that we go through but every day is a good day every day is a good day because all things are working out just the way he intended it to work it may have been a speed bump that kind of hit us out of just maybe maybe we didn't see coming he did and the world can't say that everything is working out for their good but us as Christians can say all things work together for the good to them that love God all things no matter what comes no matter the mountains no matter the valleys all things I'd say sister Carol Kinser didn't see this speed bump coming but we know that the devil would like to sign a death warrant on her but God has already got it taken control off he's in control of this and we want to lift her up in prayer this evening that God would completely touch her I know that she says that she is at peace had peace with everything there but she want just wants to go and be with her husband brother Sammy there and brother Sammy we have so many so many memories that flood our mind of the meetings and a lot of us spent time there as young people we spend time at those meetings going with brother Homer and being a part of those meetings and they are dear friends to us and when one part of the body is hurting all of the body is hurt and so we just want to take this need tonight we want to be remembering our pastor brother on is their speaking just now they started service there at 5 o'clock their time which is 6 hour time a

mercies and the healing powers of Almighty God and Lord we just pray that you would come on the scene for our sister Carol Kinser Lord I pray that the Holy Ghost would envelope her vessel just now and touch her life Oh God Lord I pray that you'd work everything out according to your will Lord we know that that you're more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in lord I pray that you would bless the meetings in Louisiana I pray God that you would go after that last seed you know where it's at Lord it may be here it may be in Louisiana maybe in Canada but I pray God that you would bring that seed to maturity father that we as her children can go home oh God for our desire is to see you face to face Lord to commune with you Tay in day out father where you are the light of the city where there is there is no darkness for there you are the light Jesus sometimes we don't even know what we want sometimes we don't even know what we need but you've already prepared a city for us that's so perfect for us to our liking Oh God and Lord Jesus I pray that we would have a life here that would match the character of that city I pray God that you would just move on behalf of these needs tonight speak to our hearts tonight through your word and we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the glory and the honor in Jesus name Amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn with me to the book of Romans chapter one and Mark chapter eight verse 34 Romans chapter one in verse 16 and Mark chapter 8 and verse 34 I'd like to speak to you tonight on the thought of never ashamed and we we spoke to you on a couple of weeks ago but without and told me that's how you preach the lights out right there when we pray we preach the power went out and I'll tell you what if if if the power goes out tonight while I'm preaching this service I just say that the devil just don't like me preaching this thought so I don't come too far to go back now so so we'd like to buy the help the Lord speak to you on this thought of never ashamed and as you're reading there in Romans chapter 1 and 16 you remember that Paul here is addressing the Roman Church there at the time and this is the same Paul that if you would read over in the book of Acts you will see this Paul as he is tormenting the church of the day he is known as a destroyer of the church one that once stood against the gospel of Jesus Christ and he took pleasure in seeing out his duties as a priest there as a as the religions of his sect there he took he took pleasure and in carrying out these duties but when he met the pillar of fire in Acts chapter 9 you will see a totally different man that God would change his name from Saul to Paul and then you'll see here in Romans chapter 1 in 16 that Paul says that I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek here is a man as we've just read this a man where we look in one part of life where he is he is so against the church he's so against the everything that Jesus stands for but now he is embodying everything that Christ is and he says I am not ashamed of the gospel mark chapter 8 and verse 34 and when he had called the people unto himself unto him when with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of whom of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels may God bless His Word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord never ashamed there's a lot of things there's a lot of things in life that we could say about our own walk or our own things their own our own life that we could say that we're ashamed about but I could never identify myself as those that are ashamed of Christ I see the works of a Living God as he's worked out things in your life how that he would come by and change or change your walk and change your life completely transforming you by the power of his word I could never be ashamed of that but today we find that it's a very popular thing to say that that that we are or people say that they're oh they're not ashamed to say that they're a part of a certain denomination they're not ashamed they're not ashamed of that they're that it's more popular to say that they're part of a denomination more than they are a Christian you'll hear people say that if you ask them if they're a Christian they'll say that they're a part of this denomination I I've seen that I've seen a lady a while back at a restaurant and I seen she was wearing a skirt and I I did I did as the Prophet had done many times it said he walked up to him and he asked him if they were Christians and they'll say their denomination so I walked up to this sister and I said now I said I see you wearing skirts are you a believer she said well I go to the I go to the Church of Christ and that was her immediate response is that she was identified with the Church of Christ oh wow that's pretty amazing that the Church of Christ preaches holiness even now but but but here her first words was identifying herself with a denomination you see you'll find that it's very popular today that man wants to be identified with the fatherhood of a church more than being a follower of God's Word they they're ashamed to stand with Christ upon his word and so they take an easy road out of just proclaiming their denomination or their Creed instead of coming out and standing on Christ word in which we know that heaven and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away I recognize the night that this building that we're in if time should last that this building is going to pass away I recognize that this vessel that I'm living in is a life is but a vapor but I realized that this life can pass away but there's something packed on the inside of me that can never pass away it's eternal just as God is eternal and I never want to say that I've taken an easy road out by just attaching myself to a a man's thinking but attaching myself and becoming identified with the Word of God is our ambitions as Christians to seek him out to find what he says about me and you to find what he's doing in this hour and doing in this life that's what our key is as Christians is to find out what he said about you and I it's important as Christians to know who Jesus is it's important as Christians to know what Jesus done but what about you today what about in your walk what about in your life what are you doing are you living out this gospel now jesus said now if you are ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed of you because you're claiming to be his when you won't follow him what if I said this little boy he's my son he turned around and say who me be your son what do you think I am it would embarrass me it would embarrass me if regular alley and I would say that's my daughter and they turn around and they saw me be your daughter it would sure embarrass me if they would say those things maybe your daughter it would sure embarrass me but how embarrassing it is for Christ how that he would say that I'm ashamed of you when men say that they are Christians but do not follow one word of his teachings you see they want to be identified with something and still christianity is still the most popular Christian religion or the most popular religion in the world they say by statistics that Christianity in the world is over 33 percent of the world of religions and its field of the rest of mullah Muslim and and Islam and atheists and agnostics they fill up the rest of the part that they've they come up with but yet in that Christianity in that 33 percent you can maybe find maybe one percent that is completely full of the Holy Ghost I hope that doesn't stand are you tonight but to be filled with the Holy Ghost the life of this word is what it's about now Jesus said in Luke chapter twelve and eight also I say unto you that whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man confessed before the angels of God but he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemy that gets the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven and when they bring unto the synagogues and under the magistrates and powers hey keno thora or how or what thing you shall answer but what ye shall say for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that same hour what you ought to say now Webster gives us this the definition of ashamed as we read last time embarrassed or guilty because of one actions or characteristics or associations reluctant to do something through fear of embarrassment or humiliation and you find that often times that when men are reluctant to move forward in the Christian walk it's because that they are ashamed of where they are in their walk they're ashamed of where they are they're ashamed of the life that they're living or they're ashamed of the process that they'll have to go through to take that leap of faith and step out and walk and live for Jesus and to proclaim the name of Jesus they're ashamed of that leap of faith that they'll have to take they're ashamed of it but I want to tell you tonight that that if you make the first step if that's you tonight if you make the first step I promise you that Jesus will make the next maybe you're ashamed maybe you don't know what to say but the Bible said in that self same hour the Holy Ghost will give you that word to say is it alright if I just preach to you just a little bit tonight you know if you would look at anybody any man of God's life tonight if you look at it if you look at brother Branham look at mine look at Billy Ron or looking brother Homer if you would look at any man of God's life I'm sure that you will find that there are mistakes in that person's life you'll find out real quick that that men are men you can look down through my family history and even look through brother branham's life and you can find mistakes there that's the thing to me that what makes this message so real is that brother Branham was a man and he was not ashamed to tell that he was a man he was not pointing us to himself he was pointing us to Christ but you can look at brother Brennan's history look at his life you can look at his own humanity you'll see mistakes there you'll find failure saying you look at my life you or somebody else's life a man of God's life you may have found spots in that person's life where they may arrived or they may have cheated her or they may allowed or may have failed or maybe let somebody down you know there's actually people that have searched out about the ministry and tried to find things found out dirt on the ministry about myself brother on brother Donnie Regan brother Tim Pruett doing background checks trying to find faults in our own ministry or in our own lives trying to put a trying to put a pinpoint on us and say that we got faults well I'll be the first to tell you tonight you ain't got to look very far and you'll find faults in me you'll find where there was mistakes you'll find where I got angry you'll find more maybe I'll let my temper go there's probably some times in my life where I look more like Jesus cast and the money changers out the temple more than I look like Jesus dedicating babies but I'm not ashamed to tell you that I am a man I know I've let some of you down just now because I know that some of you think I'm a an angel or more than that but I want you to assure you tonight that I'm a man and you ain't gotta look very far in my past to find that I'm a man you can find faults and you can find mistakes but let me point you to somebody that ain't got one fault they got one blemish they got one mistake he never lied he never stole the only time he ever cheated is when he cheated death that's the kind of God that I can point you to tonight I know Kingdom builders want to point you to themself and try to boost up their self and build up their self I'm not trying to point you to myself or point you to a man but point you to Christ tonight I can be ashamed of myself sore there's a lot of things in my life that I'm ashamed of or I'm embarrassed stuff where am i reluctant to tell you about but there's not one thing that I'm ashamed to tell you about in Christ's life I can take you through the Scriptures and I can tell you about a God that saves I can take you through the Scriptures and tell you about a God that delivers I can take you through the Scriptures and tell you about a God that raises the dead I can take you through the scriptures and tell you about a God that still cares I'm not ashamed to testify that God still the same yesterday today and forever and it should not embarrass you or make you a saint to testify that God still God are you with me this evening and the message was saying the Prophet said I think of the prophets of old when they come with that message and it embarrass the kings that have made the people feel uncomfortable the priests even they would feel uncomfortable because they were supposed to be leaders religious man when the word came forth in that manner it exposed them and they felt embarrassed or ashamed you know that's what the word does when it comes it comes and it cuts our hearts he cuts our life you know I've I've never preached a sermon where God didn't come and touch me while I was preaching it where God didn't do something to cut something off of my life but I find that where I found where I needed what I was preaching and I'll say this for you if you'd be honest tonight that you'd say that in that that there has never been one service come by your way that the Word of God didn't cut you cut things off of your life we look over in the Bible and Luke chapter 7 you look there and you'll find of a description that we're very familiar with where Jesus is invited to say Simon the Pharisees house and you find in that scripture that there is a woman of ill-fame there that comes into the picture when she spotted Jesus setting over in the corner being the outcast in that party and this catches her attention you see in the Eastern countries when they would invite you to a party they would welcome you to that household they would welcome you in through the doors and there would be a foot wash lookie there that would wash all the manure and all the stink off of your feet by walking in those streets where the donkeys and the horses and the goats and everything was they would wash your feet and here when Jesus walks into the house of Simon they wash they do not wash his feet they do not give him any anointment oil they do not kiss him you see in eastern countries when they invite you to a party they would kiss you the owner would kiss you on the cheek and he would welcome you into his household you see the kiss was what welcomed you into that household and when the owner of the master kissed you you are welcomed to every spot of the household you are welcomed to the fridge you are welcomed to the ice box you are welcomed to everything in that household the kiss made you a full brother but here this woman of ill-fame sees Jesus sitting in a corner a woman that had a very scarred past a woman that had her life was in disarray a woman that we would say that she if we would ask her from this spot about her history I'd say that she probably a little bit embarrassed about her life by a little bit ashamed of where she'd been but don't ever condemn her you see before there was a fallen woman there was a fallen man that calls that woman to fall you see something for the man whom said he searched that woman's life health and he said I looked at it and he said here she was maybe some sweetheart her sweetheart had crushed her life and sent her on this path how many of you were maybe trodden down and broken and in a spot of despair when Christ came and met you there but he never left you where he failed you but he brought you up out of the miry clay I know sometimes as Christians you get the idea that you're clean and everybody else is dirty but let me tell you this if you walk around the world and you think you're something you're not ever going to win anybody to Christ you up down the road as hell they're not gonna make it I highly doubt you ever win one person to Jesus Christ but I pray as Christians that we would have the attitude what would Jesus do more than a bracelet more than a statement what would Jesus do anything my goodness what a shame for them to leave be living in that kind of condition if it wasn't for grace you'd be right there if it was not for grace I'd have been strung out on charms I'd have been laid out in some gutter somewhere if it was not for grace but grace came running by my way and I'm not ashamed to testify but tell anybody I come in contact with it was grace that put me in my place sure the church world would have never wanted a woman like this in the church but where was she welcome at that Jesus's feet a woman that had done all types of wrong things giving a body out to the men of that city but she recognized about our something in a man sitting in a corner that Simon missed you see Simon all he seen was a man where he could get miracles from Simon one of the miracles but he didn't want the word and that's where you find a lot of people today you even hear TV evangelists or televangelist however he's saying quoting brother Branham speaking brother band's name but all they'll tell you that he went off at the end I'd be ashamed to testify of all the supernatural and not testify of the word that came behind it that's not the word come to the Prophet they say he went off at the end that's when it got to me it was not it was not the first pole they got me it was not the second pole they got me but the opening of the word it was that opening of the word that caught my attention and I'm not ashamed to tell you tonight this was more than a man that caught my attention when the president would come to the city or any city you'd hang out you'd hang see out in the streets full of flies you throw flowers out in the street you'd sing the band down to the depot when he would get off the train and you do everything to make him feel welcome but Jesus can come to your city and into your home and you give him a place in the Attic a little prayer room on the outside out on the side or maybe down in the basement if your company's there you have nothing to do with you'll wait till after a while maybe maybe he set the house and you slip up in the attic and shut the door and say a few words to him and come back down ashamed of it that's the way Solomon was he was ashamed of him he was ashamed to kiss him he was ashamed to make him feel welcome I say folk gospel lighthouse never walk in them doors back there until you make him feel welcome this is not about you this is not about how pretty you can sing this is not about the song leader this is about Jesus and if he don't feel welcome here I'm not welcome here we're seeing that song consume me Lord consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit break me Lord if you have to break me Lord and use the broken pieces of my life I want to be used by you but I really wonder sometimes when you're singing that song is that really what you want is Christ to consume you you know when you're singing that song you could be singing your own testimony right there you could be singing the truth or you could be singing a lot I wonder sometimes do we want him to consume I thinking consume I extra-time consume our energies consume our walk consume my parenting consume my social life and consume our relationships if you answered yes I say you're a Christian if not come to the altar do you really want him in every door of your life I know I do but here this woman here this woman has a wrecked life a wrecked life I'm gonna call your name of you puts her name right there here this man antral had a wrecked life this woman had a wreck life the community knew her the community knew what she had done and the community looked down upon her career and looked down upon everything that she was but now she's in a spot in which the town people think that she's embarrassing herself even more she's down at Jesus's feet crying and weeping and washing his feet with her tears when the random said they would see God not her hair was soaked because she cried so many tears if you would have looked in her eyes her eyes were matted up with all the oil that she had done with all of her life all of her career she spent everything that she had on the most precious oil to pour it on Jesus her eyes were matted up the oil was all over her mouth and all over her face bowing down at his feet washing his feet kissing the manure off of Jesus's feet and the rest of the town was sick in my she's making herself a fool and embarrassing herself she has the lowest life in the city but now here she is even more embarrassing herself kissing the feet of this false prophet called Jesus but Jesus turned to Simon when he perceived their thoughts and said if he really was a prophet he would know what type of this was the scripture says that she came behind him and she was washing his feet and Jesus said Simon I have some what to say unto thee and he begins to give him a parable of which one would love the man that forgave the most which water he said the one that forgave that he that the ruler give forgave the most he said you've rightly judged he said this woman has much seen her alive but this woman is going to walk away here completely debt-free completely sin free nor the church world wouldn't want her in that church but she was welcome at Jesus's feet that's why Jesus said go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come Jesus is still calling this message of never being ashamed is about exactly what sister crystal and sister Angela did about testifying of the glass for Jesus Christ for it is the power under salvation and if we're too good to testify about Jesus about what he did for us I'd say we've got ourselves too high we think too much about ourselves I heard brother madam said this week he said when you really think you are something stick your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and say that's me that's me right there nothing but when she came to Jesus I was looking at this scripture today going over these things she didn't have an inclination what Jesus would say to her at the end of this okay I can't I've taken place here she didn't know what was going to be safe but she did not do it because what she thought Jesus would do but what Jesus would say she seen him as worthy she's seen that Jesus needed to have the finest oil that there was she's seen that Jesus's feet needed to be washed she didn't know that Jesus would turn to her and say you've embarrassed yourself you've made yourself a mockery in front of this crowd but all of that sins which are much be forgiven me Oh hallelujah she didn't know that he would say that the end of this account but she did it anyhow it is my main purpose in life to serve Christ it is my main purpose in life to praise Christ I hope you don't mind me talking about myself here for a few moments but it's my main purpose in life to wake up and worship God to wake up and pray to God to wake up and read his holy word it's my main purpose in life to serve Him but to hear him say that I'll make your head and not the tail then I'll fill your baskets I'll feel your storehouses I bless your coming in now bless your going out I'll serve them no matter what but to hear him say I'm gonna take away all your sin to me it's just the cherry on top I did to serve him and I get the kingdom too I can hear him say I forgive you of all your sins I'm gonna take away all of your sicknesses all of your afflictions and all of your diseases and not only that I'm gonna rapture your earth and soul what a privilege it is to serve a king the world wants to tell me that I need to be ashamed of Jesus the world wants to tell me that I need to be ashamed of this gospel the world wants to tell people that they can't call themselves men of God and women of God and Christians in this world they don't want the name Jesus mentioned no more but they've come too late to try to stop me now I've been testifying of the marvelous grace of Jesus Christ for over 12 years now ever since he got ahold of my life and I have no intentions don't stop him now they can try to shut me down they can try to stop me but I'll never be ashamed of this gospel and everything it stands for turn with me to Isaiah chapter 54 when you look in this scripture the scripture is speaking of a people who have been through captivity that's been through Wars been through bondage been through calamities they've been through trials this is a people that have watched their sons and their daughters their lives be destroyed this is a people that's outcasts this is a people that's outside their land there's a people that's a desolate people this is a people that's been kicked around like a rag doll Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 1 sing-sing when you read those words you automatically think about singing for Jesus but what about when you hear somebody that you're very close to and you hear them singing what is it testifying to you they've got something to sing about they're happy they're full of joy but to me it's amazing to watch somebody that's going through a very dark moment and to see them singing when you're going through moments of despair and moments of trials I'm watching you Christ is watching you and to see you still sing it and to see you still praising God it shows me that there's joy in yourself he says scene Oh barren though that did it's not bear break forth into singing and cry loud you got something to sing about now I don't know what his plans are with this but he woke me up thirsty morning and he told me to tell you your joy is returning I don't know if he's got plans I don't know what his plans are to preach a message on that or just to say that to you tonight but he told me to tell you your choice returning your toys return sometimes sometimes it feels Latin all hope was gone and there's nothing left for you but he's got a word for you to tell you that your joy is returning your joys returning back to you you've gone through Laodicea and Laodicea and stripped you of all of your joy stripped you of all of your peace but the word of the Lord says your joy is returning David cried out in Psalms 51 create in me a clean heart and create a ray create a mere clean heart and renew in me a right spirit and restore to me the joy of my salvation I'll restore the joy of my salvation it was not saying that David was lost he had just lost the joy of his salvation that's what sin will do to you it will rob you of your joy it will rob you of your peace it will robbed you of praising God that's what sin will do and he cries out God restore unto me the joy of my salvation maybe you're going through that moment right now maybe you're going through a moment of darkness spare he never lost you salvation you just lost you toll but your joy is coming back your peace is coming back your family's coming back you got something to sing about for gospel right house we are known for praising God we're known for our worship but now you got something to sing about so my admonition to you is sing like you're never seen before praise like you never praise before worship like you never worship before if God cared enough to wake me up early in the morning to tell me that your joy is returning I'd say God is as good as his word that your joy is on its Road don't wait for it it's returning open the door and let joy come on hear the joy of the Lord is my strength [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah we got something to sing about we ain't just beating our hands for no reason we're not just saying it man for no reason we got sucked in the clap about we got something to sing about we got something to dance about and I'll never be ashamed of that I'll never be ashamed of that sing Oh Barry remember who the word was coming to a people that were desolate and people that were broke up the people that were out of their land sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that did it's not travail with child for more of the children of the desolate than the children of the merry wife saith the Lord enlarge the
