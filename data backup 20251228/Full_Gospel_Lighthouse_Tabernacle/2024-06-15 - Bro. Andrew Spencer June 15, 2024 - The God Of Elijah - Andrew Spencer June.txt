softly this evening how many has a need that you like to make known unto the Lord by the way of an uplifted hand amen amen I believe with all of my heart that God is going to do a miracle tonight I believe that you could be the next miracle in this room amen I believe it with all of my heart with every fiber of my being I just I feel the spirit of God just welling up on the inside of me tonight let tonight be your night father throughout this building father hands are lifted up Lord Jesus Lord below that hand is a heart is a need father and Lord Jesus you see every one of these individuals father Lord they have come throughout their week and they have garnered father things throughout the week things of that happened last weekend the Revival that is transpiring right in front of our eyes father 17 father I believe 14 or 17 that had were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ last weekend father to see what you're doing father it is a signal to us as Believers that you are gathering your seed in and I pray Lord Jesus that tonight Lord Jesus I'm just a man but father Lord while I was in my study it just began to well up on the inside of me Father you changed my entire course father today around 10:30 Lord at just to just to preach this little thought that you put on my heart but I pray that you would do the miraculous right here father you see all things and you know all things father and I believe God that if there is a call for a miracle that means that there is trouble out there so therefore we speak peace in the name of Jesus Christ we Proclaim that the name of Jesus Christ is greater and higher and more powerful than any wicked foe that is in all of the land and we ask that the god of Heaven would come rolling down through the corridors of the M magnificent faith of the Bride of Jesus Christ and you would begin to brood over her faith father and may her faith match your word Lord God and I pray that you would do the miraculous right here father I know God that that that there are things that we have carried with us all the days of our life I pray God right here tonight that you would just allow us to step aside from those things and allow us to have a moment with Jesus I believe you're that kind of a god tonight that you are very tangible you can be felt and handled and I pray Lord tonight that you would just set us down and begin to speak to us through the preaching of the word and Lord we be careful to serve you God you know what kind of people that we are and we love your presence and we ask that you come tonight according to Thy word we pray these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over two portions of scripture in 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 14 and Malachi CH 4 verse 5 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 14 and say Amen when you have it this evening and he took the mantel of Elijah that fell from him and smoke the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also smitten in the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over also Malachi CH 4 verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to speak to you tonight on a it's a very broad topic but I would like to by the help of the Lord just take a little little thought here tonight on the god of Elijah the god of Elijah and as as I Was preparing brother brandham brother brandham was uh was saying here in the lay Odyssey in church age he said said but what has happened to the word he said the word has been put aside so God says I am going against you all I will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of Seven Ages I have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine so at the end of this age I am spewing you out of my mouth it is all over I am going to speak all right yes I am here in the midst of the church the a man of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will it will be my my Prophet oh yes that is so Revelations 10:7 that in the days of the voice of the seventh M messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that is John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece as he is as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul notice William brandham or the messenger of Malachi 4 is not bringing something new he is bringing the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect in those elect with him in the last day in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord notice he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallah do you see it and I believe that we recognize that we we are living in a very special hour by by studying out the scriptures we realize that we are living in the hour where we are seeing the very interpretation of the word of God being made manifest as we we are very familiar with Malachi 4 and it's a very prevalent scripture to us as message Believers but we we realized that over 2400 years that that scripture was laying dormant and it was waiting for the manifesting Time of the Season that it was going to be made manifest and that there would come a time after 2400 years that there would come a time where the ministry of Elijah that was going to come and it was going to forerun the very coming of Christ and I would be able to say it along with you that we can now say that that scripture is history now because Elijah has came and forun the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ and we realize that the elect of God have caught exactly that this ministry is going to be a Ministry that will literally cause the very second coming of Christ and when you begin to study out the the the work of Elijah and you begin to study out the ministry of Elijah that this this work of Elijah and the Very trademark of his ministry was to restore the worship back to whom real worship and true worship belongs to and notice whenever Elijah comes on the scene he restores worship notice in the first Elijah he repairs and he restores The Altar and he turns the hearts back to the original and true faith in every single time in the five comings of Elijah you'll notice that the ministry of Elijah does the same exact thing at The Showdown on Mount Carmel Elijah did not build a new altar or build a new religion or did not make up something new but rather he took what had been left aside and what had been broken down and what had been neglected Elijah simply by his ministry placed true worship back in its rightful order and every single time that God ever used the spirit of Elijah he does the same thing in every one of his ministries in every one of Elijah's Ministry he puts he builds upon the same thing that he re it is a message or a Ministry of restoration and notice when you look at the Spirit of Elijah that would come upon the man he would come upon Elijah it would come upon elishah it would come upon John the Baptist then it would come on Malachi 4 and notice there is yet a a future Elijah that is to go unto the Jews of Revelation chapter 11 but notice that that the spirit of Elijah would come and it would it would H it would be against idolatry it would be against false forms of religion including the false or vain worship of the true God notice the ministry of Elijah that it would bring about a much need restoration to the truth of the hour and it would also turn the heart of God's elect back to the true faith and know that we know this by studying out the message of the hour that we've studied it for over 30 to 40 years now we've been real careful students but we realize that the Elijah Ministry was a Supernatural Ministry it was Christ in the spirit of Elijah every single time and Elijah's Ministry was used to to produce and profound to bring forth profound Miracles that were that were laying there in the life of Elijah you can look and you could see in Elijah's Ministry that he shut up the heavens and he caused a drought in First Kings 17 notice he he multiplied flour and oil for a widow he raised the Widow Sons The Widow's son from the dead he defeated the prophets of baale with fire from heaven he brought rain to its end and he ended the drought he destroyed 51 Soldiers with fire and lightning again he destroyed another 51 Soldiers with fire and lightning and notice his last miracle he parted the Waters of the Jordan River but I think it's a very astounding thing that the same miracle that Elijah ends his ministry with is the same miracle that Elisha starts his ministry with it was a signal that it was the same spirit that was upon Elijah it's now back upon Elisha and I think that it's a very uh compound meaning when you can look at the life of Jesus Christ and you can see the Miracles that were happening in Jesus life you can identify that the same spirit that was Upon Jesus is now upon a body of Believers it is a signal under the Church of the Living God that the same power that was in Elijah was in Elisha it is a signal that the same power that was with that was in the bridegroom is now in the Earthly bride now notice in the first two comings of Elijah you begin to see Miracles there's eight Miracles that are recorded in Elijah's Ministry and there's 16 there is a double portion that is upon Elisha's Ministry he has a double portion of the spirit of Elijah that is upon him but when you study out the third coming of Elijah notice the third coming of Elijah was in John the Baptist but he didn't do no Miracles he was simply preaching the word of God and brother Brenham would identify John the Baptist as a powerful preacher that he even Drew bigger crowds than Jesus ever did you see what he was doing he was making a foundation for the Messiah to come he drew bigger crowds but he was setting a foundation for after the third coming of John after the third coming of Elijah came Jesus notice didn't preach too much he was not much of a Preacher but he was performing signs and wonders as of indication that John's Ministry was in its season and it was thoroughly Vindicated but when it come to the fourth coming of Elijah it came in both preaching and in signs and in Miracles Hallelujah and William brandham said and Look Away to Jesus he said I may not do it he said but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so is the message to forun the second coming of Christ and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so it is paralleled in every way and I know it will the message will go on so it literally is a signal unto us whether William Brandon was here on Earth or not but the message would introduce Christ to this world again and there is a man that can turn on the lot he said yesterday's Luther's Mana would not work for Methodist he said Methodist Mana would not work for Pentecost he said Pentecostal Mana will not work for us today see it has it see see what I mean every day it come day by day fresh and so it has through the church ages he said Luther's Mana was the message of justification Wesley's message was the man manifestation of sanctification he said and Pentecostal was the restoration of the gifts but this is the introducing The Headstone the last day the bride tree which is contrary to all of it yet it's the same light it was the same light in Luther's day it was the same light in Wesley's day it was the same light in the restoration of gifts but this light is a mature light and is introducing The Headstone of crying Grace Grace notice in this hour you have watched the ministry of Elijah you have been a witness of it you've listened to over 1200 some sermons that God has given to this generation where the ministry of Elijah would stand there night after night and God would thoroughly vindicate himself through his prophet's Ministry sure there was other great men on the scene sure there was Great Mighty Mighty Heroes of Faith or men of faith and Men of renown that was standing there but there was only one Ministry that was standing standing in this generation that could identify that there was an angel that came and commissioned him to preach and to teach what the angel has said and you notice when that Ministry would come into full effect he would stand there say I now take every Spirit under my control for Jesus Christ men tried to understand God they probed into the intellect of God but this Elijah Ministry did not presume did not probe but it was direct it was accurate it was Vindicated it never missed it was proven and this Elijah Ministry proclaimed that The Headstone was here hallelujah David said in Psalms 81822 that the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes when you begin to study it out in the margin of the Hebrew that this is the Lord's doing in Hebrew that means this is from the Lord that it it is to be traced alone to the Lord God Almighty notice what you are seeing is traced back to The Headstone what you are witnessing is not traced back to a man what you have been a part of is not traced back to a man of 16 elements but it is traced back to the god that created the Moons and stars the elements the atoms it is The Headstone that has come this is not the result of wisdom of of man or or Man's power but the deliverance from danger it is the rising up from the low condition that only God can do no man can take you from one estate and put you in another but it is God Almighty that removes Kings and sets up Kings notice the change by which he who has re was rejected was restored to its rightful place Hallelujah you were cast down you were trotten but he even though you look rejected He restored you right back to your rightful place and any of you that study out the message you know that the Bible said in Romans 9 and33 that if you study out that message if you St out that one scripture you can find the entire message laying in this one scripture behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a revelation of offense that whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so Paul is saying unto us that no one no man no Scientology no intellect can hinder almighty God from carrying out his purpose that this is the the Lord's doing that this is because of the Lord hallelujah the very fact that God is tangible the very fact that he wants to be felt the very fact that the god of Elijah wants to live and wants to reign in you it literally makes me live in awe and wonder of his grander that the god that lived in Moses wants to live in you that the god that lived in Elijah wants to live in you that the God that was in David wants to live in you the God that was in Daniel wants to live in you it's very powerful when you begin to think about the goodness of God that it wasn't just for the forefathers it wasn't just for Paul it wasn't just for William branam but that God the god of Elijah the god of the Moon the god of the Stars want to so inhabit your soul that demons won't know where to run for cover that God wants to so live in you that it can breathe praise out of your lips and it Ador Adonai Hallelujah now the prophets declared that Jehovah wasn't just some mere God like the gods of the Nations but that that had to be packed around like some Idol when the prophets would stand there they would stand there and Proclaim him as Elohim the self-existing one he rules and he reigns he's not a God that you have to carry but he's a god that'll carry you he's God on the mountain and he's God in the valley he's God in the battle and he's God in Victory he's God in storm and he's God in peace and the Bible said in Psalms 93 the the Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wherewith he ha guarded himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved thy Throne is established of old thou art from Everlasting the floods have lifted up oh Lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods have lifted up their ways but the Lord is on high mightier than the noise of many Waters yay than the mighty waves of the sea my testimonies are very sure Holiness becometh thine house oh Lord forever so what is David saying unto us that the troubles that surround you that the Lord on high is mightier is mightier than the waves it's mightier than the voices let me put it to you like this torment destruction sickness Our God that rains on high is mightier than the voices of all of hell he shuts the mouth of lions he stops the winds and waves he slays armies he kills Giants he crushes Nations he heals the weak he casts out Devils he raises the dead He blesses the curse he conquers all things and his name ain't weak his name ain't lost his name ain't confused but his name is Jesus if he can deliver from a giant he can deliver from cancer if he can deliver from cancer he can deliver from depression if he can deliver from depression he can deliver from suicide I'll say there's no God like my God somebody bless the Lord God Almighty hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah ain't no God like my God and job come to the conclusion in his life that this God was a God that wanted to be known job would have never had the idea that God could be known unless God would have implanted the thought on the inside of job and job come out with a resolution that he said I know that my redeemer lives and job 42 and2 he says I know that thou car that thou can't do everything that no thought can be withholden from thee so job recognized him as the god that sees all things that understands all things and nothing can be hidden from him and when Jesus was talking about about the Gospel of Jesus Christ how that how that men would receive it and how men would turn it down in Matthew 9 and 26 but Jesus beheld them and said unto him with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible Hallelujah in Jeremiah 20 And1 The Bible said but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one when you study that out in the Hebrew he means he is El gior that he is God the hero he the Lord is with me as the god hero there for my persecutors shall stumble they shall not Prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not Prosper their Everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten Hannah spoke these words in Isaiah or 1 Samuel 2 And1 and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged Ed over my enemies how many had the devil lie to you this week how many had the devil tell you that that you ain't a Christian how many had a devil tell you that you ain't going to make it how many had a devil tell you that you wasn't going to be healed how many had a devil talk to you this week my mouth is enlarged over my enemies he ain't talking talking about the words of your own mouth he's talking about the words that come from almighty God come on somebody you know that you're own words will never defeat the enemy you know your own voice will not stop the mouth of Li but he says that I my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in my salvation there is something powerful when you put salvation on your lips that the enemy has to bow when you rejoice that he's the god of Heaven he's the god of the baren he's the god of the Red Sea he's the god of the mountain he's the god of the valley when you begin to Rejoice at Salvation your mouth is enlarged over your [Applause] enemies oh Hallelujah [Applause] when mzc came to Abraham and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore and I Genesis 18 and 13 wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a shorty bear a child when I'm old is there anything too hard for the Lord I think it's a good question how many here sitting here 100 years old tonight is there anything too hard for the lord well surely if he can take a 100y old man and make him 18 year old again surely he can take your bruised up mind and your bruised up Spirit and the the agony that you been in surely he can bring peace to your body surely he can bring healing to the marrow of thy bone is there anything too hard for the Lord at an time pointed time I will return under Thee I want to say unto you now is the time I say this unto you that God is going to do a miracle in your presence tonight at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son when brother random comes and he preaches redemption in the completeness of Joy he starts taking us about how the Mana how that they come out of Egypt and they begin to murmur and complain that they that they that they had didn't have nothing to eat and God be to rain down angel food to them that notice that that Mana it never did cease on their entire Journey it kept them through that an entire Journey brother B said I can see those Israelites that had just passed through the Red Sea had just been redeemed by the blood seen the healing power of God or the miraculous power standing between God and between Israel and Egypt and had drowned their enemies behind that he said like that old cancer it's gone forever the blindness was gone the deafness was gone the diabetus was gone everything's done drowned back Yonder in the blood of Jesus how do you feel how do you feel my walk down the street and some old critic say now wait a minute are you sure of that don't you talk to me amen he said I can see them out there talking about Gathering it up he said he said I can see him out there just to Gathering up Gathering up eating having a glorious time he said just like an oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting he said here will come the spirit of God moving over some little saint will reach up and give get it in their heart like that holler praise the Lord just an oldfashioned meeting like that yes sir they were just catching it from one side to the other having a good time well let's put it like this sister India started Gathering down here and brother Denny started Gathering back here and she started saying praise the Lord help me out just a minute praise the Lord how about it sister Katie she started saying and then all of a sudden all the way back there in the back brother alen got grabbed a hold of it what was it they were grabbing a hold of the same Mana they could have been on the other side of the field they could have been in doubt they could have been in fear but there was a old Holy Ghost Revival it was an old Holy Ghost Revival that was breaking out because the Mana never did cease and I'll say this if you can have enough Faith to grab a hold of it right here let's have our and oh holy ghost meeting one more time praise the Lord he's still the same yesterday today and forever well I don't see what they're shouting about they just grabbed a hold of the same manner that was in the upper room blessed be the name of the Lord it never did cease he said it was a perfect type of Pentecost it was a perfect type of Pentecost that that Mana never did cease it never did cease let me say this to you like William brandham said the apostolic day and age will not cease until we go into a Rapture I am claiming unto you that the god that Mary met the god that Peter met the god that Paul met is a God in this room and if you got enough Faith to believe it God will set your heart to believe it that all things are [Applause] possible I don't I don't it's not that I don't have V volume Brothers is that there's no there's nothing to back up there's nothing to back up what's coming what I'm putting out so if you can kind of manipulate it a little bit you see it's preaching and working with a sound system sometimes is like preaching to a real audience you see it's got to match what I'm putting out because the more that I put out the more it can has the capacity to handle the the Lord you say well I don't know exactly what you're talking about I'll tell you it's kind of like the god of Elijah that when when she started when he when he went down there in his Elijah Ministry that there was a woman Brothers y'all y'all doing one thing but God's doing another thing up here so y'all just keep doing what you're doing but literally that the god of Elijah he went down there and he' promised this little shunamite woman that had done showed him favor and built him a house sister Gabriel and had put him into a place and they they love the message that Elijah was ministering and so they built a place to keep him there they built a place to keep him there and that this son died had a heat stroke and and and she went up there where Elijah was up there worshiping and gesus saw her said there' be that shunamite woman that has that boy and he and he began to speak to her said is all well and her testimony was the same as Elijah's testimony her faith matched Elijah's Ministry you see she was putting out what Elijah was putting out her faith was not in his Rod that gazel was told to go out there and to lay it on her faith was in Elijah's Ministry it's like Hallelujah William brandham said it like this he said he said if you come with the same faith that your pastor's got he said you'll match what is being put out and hallelujah it's got to be something take place that little woman went there with the faith of aij and Elijah was that Faith what happened a miracle took place he laid his hand on his hand he laid his head on his head he laid his feet on his feet and before long when the Elijah Ministry was laid over a bride it started sneezing seven times what was it that boy was matching what Elijah was hallelujah what was it God was taking over Hallelujah when it come to first king 18 when it come to mount carel when to come to a showdown whether you're going to serve God either the god of Elijah or the god of Baal it was is coming to a declaration who you going to serve First Kings 18:36 and it came to pass that at the time of the offering of the evening Ser sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou are God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me hear me hear me hear me you worshippers of baale hear me you worshippers of the true God hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou H has turn their heart back again hear me God hear my Ministry hear my faith that they may know that their hearts have been turned back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god he's not a God he is the god the Lord he is the god what was it it was a showdown it was a showdown and God showed up Hallelujah you can put this message in a corner and God will show up you can put people against this message and websites against this message and blogs against this message message but my God in the middle of a showdown will show up in the middle of your crisis he'll show up in the middle of your dilemma he'll show up in the middle of your storm he'll show up in the middle of it in the middle of it in the middle of it I'm going to say this to you loud and clear the Lord he is the god [Applause] what good does it do to preach a god of History if he isn't the same today and brother and sister I say this I read of a god of a history one time I read of him in books I read of him in the Bible but one day I met him I met him he come to me he told me not to drink nor to smoke and defile myself and he had something for me to do when I got older I was just a little bitty boy but he proved that he did it and here's the picture hanging right here where science has took it he's not a god of yesterday he's a god of today and when you have a need your need brings Jesus on the scene you know when when William random is standing there in the marriage and divorce series he's standing there and at the very beginning of that message and the me that that series of services William brandham starts talking about how that this special this spot was real special to him he said because some 40 some years ago or 30 some years ago he said I was in this same spot when I saw my Lord Jesus how did he had his daddy's need you remember he was praying for his daddy and the Lord called him out there in that broom Sage field and he saw Jesus out there it's a sign that your need brings Jesus let me tell you something if you can catch what I just give you it's powerful his C by his need brought Christ by his way it's a sign that Christ does not diminish his attributes are available to you don't you let nobody tell you that the days of Miracles is passed don't know let nobody tell you that the Holy Ghost ain't just the same as it ever was don't you let nobody ever tell you that Jesus is not alive and right here in this church and not doing the same things that he did don't you let nobody you hear me young people don't you let nobody ever try to tell you that God don't give the Holy Ghost don't you let anybody ever try to talk you out of your Pentecostal experience don't ever let anybody try to talk you out of your emotions of preaching and speaking and and living out the word don't you let nobody don't let nobody talk you out of this you got a choice to make you you got a choice to make whether you going to serve God or whether you're going to serve the god of Baal I tell you your cost of indecision will cost you one of these days when you're burning but because of your decision as the Bride of Jesus Christ to stand out for the true and living [Applause] God one day Ronald Reagan his aunt he had a good aunt that was going to take him by sis he was going to take uh his aunt was going to take him by this little place and she was wanting to get Ronald Reagan some shoes and so she she took him by the shoe cobbler and he and he he went by there and and the shoe cobbler asked him said well what kind of shoes do you want he said you want a round toe or a square toe and he said well I really don't know what I want really don't know what I want he said well let me come back to you in a couple days and I'll tell you what I want so a couple days went by and never did come back to the shoe cobbler another another few days went by and and didn't go by there and a shoe cober was walking down the street one day and he saw Ronald Reagan walking down the street he said have you made up your mind what what what kind of shoes you want he said I really don't know what I want well when Ronald Reagan received those shoes the shoe cobbler made one square toe and made one round toe Ronald Reagan said every single day of my life wearing those shoes was a lesson unto me that if you don't make up your mind somebody else will make your mind up for you I say this unto you don't let nobody else make up your mind of what Jesus is I say he's God I say he's still the same I say he's still a Healer I say he's still a miracle worker I say he still gives a holy ghost I say he still has gifts of the Spirit I say this that Malachi 4 is William brandham I say this unto you he's greater than heart trouble he's greater than cancer he's greater than tuberculosis he's greater and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the [Applause] world he's here tonight proven by his church scientifically and all old friends why are we so D why do we sit so drooped let the god that spoke the word let the God as Elijah said Elisha said who came back with a double portion folded up that manle and said where is the god of Elijah let the god that wrote the word confirm the word if this is his word let him stand by he promised it God don't need my help on keeping his word he just needs my faith are you hearing me loud and clear he don't need my help to keep his promise he don't need my help to bring forth a miracle in this room he just needs my faith and William brandom said in perfect Faith he said when there is a faith that is isolated through the world in a newness of Christ he said you're bringing forth bright material then and you're getting into rapturing condition when your faith is isolated away from the thoughts what men have said that God is this and God is that I say where be the god of Elijah let cancer stand up Smite the waters come on somebody let depression stand up and smite the waters where is the Lord God of Elijah come on somebody where is the Lord God that brings prod goes back home where is the Lord God that Health where is the Lord God that [Applause] [Applause] deliverthat some excerpts on what God is Not that God is not some object way off or some historical something he's living his present tense and his word is made manifest God is not in material things God is in men the Holy Ghost never fell on organizations it fell on men God is not an idol God is a spirit God is not understood by knowledge God is understood by faith God is not dead God is not known no other way but by faith God is not the author of sickness God is not three God is one God is Not divided God is not bound up to any denomination or any barriers he's only duty bound to his word y'all like that all right God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God he is a being therefore he is omniscient Omni pressent omnipotent and infinite I'm sorry I'm sliding in a few things on what God is too God is Not un unjust God is not responsible if you die in your sin of unbelief God is not complicated God is not complicated well high five yourself you just got yourself out of the complication if you got God on your side God is Not foolish he's the source of all wisdom God is not a man that he should lie God is not the god of the dead but of the Living God is Not unrighteous and God is not wearied because the Bible said in Isaiah 40 and 28 hast thou not known hast thou not KN hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding let me let me just draw back right here for a minute God is accepting the challenge of your life God is not worried God is Not unrighteous God is not complicated but God is accepting the challenge of your life if he accepted and Portland Oregon the challenge that came up against him when that chief of tribe of demons tried to destroy him and his ministry God accepted the challenge I say this to you that God is accepting the challenge in your life to prove that he greater than Le osia that is greater than lukewarmness that is greater than blindness that is greater than diseases that is greater than your troubles the ability of God is greater than than man the ability of God is greater than Satan because the Bible said in Daniel 3:17 that he's able to deliver Jesus said that he's able to raise up children from Stones Paul said in Romans 4:21 that he's able to fulfill promises Paul again said that he's able to make grace abound he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in Us in Philippians 3:21 he's able to subdue all things in 2 Timothy 1:12 that he's able to guard the Soul's Treasures Hebrews 7 and 25 that he's able to save to the uttermost and Jude 1 and2 24 says that he's able to keep you from falling I don't know whether you recognize this or not God hallelujah is not counting on your ability he is counting on his ability and when you take God at his word and when you realize that God is more than able the miracle will take place on the word of God just like it did in Elijah's Ministry when the woman only had but a handful of meal she simply took God at his word and the Miracle took place after God was stck at his word so the miracle will take place on the word of God Son Psalms 33 and8 said let all the Earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in all of him for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast it is his will to heal it is his will to save it is his will to deliver it is his will to set free it is his will to change it is his will to glorify himself because he has committed to his word I know that I know that you may have shocked the devil just a minute ago when you believed that a miracle would take place in here I like shocking the devil but let me let me let me just lay some Bible Doctrine in here that The Healing Ministry is the Bible way that we realize that by the word of the hour that God is no longer a vague and distant God but he's one that is ready to reveal himself to the sons of men let me say this to you he's still Isaiah 53 I I'll say this he's the god of that scripture he's the god that Health our diseases he's a God that calms the storms he's a God hallelujah he's a God that comes out upon your Troubled Waters he's a God that knows the way in and he knows the way out he knows how to get you out of depression and he knows you how to he knows how to get you into his promise there is no one that can fool a man who has seen God at work before his own eyes how can you sit there and try to tell Lazarus that he was still dead when he was alive try telling the blind man that he still couldn't see when his eyes was open try telling the Bride of Jesus Christ that what she has is false she's got an isolated Faith she don't care what you think she don't care what men say she don't care what critics say she don't care what scoffers say I know that the god of Elijah is the God of this body Bible his power is real his Supernatural elements are in this room heaven is real and Isaiah said that heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol but where is my house that you'll build unto me I want to say this loud and clear shout it over the Internet that God has a house in this bride body that he can work in that he can manifest himself in and we are not ashamed of [Applause] it the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God but he has spewed her out in this generation but he is confounding her through the prophet and the bride they are saying the same thing the spirit and the bride say come he's got a body he's got a house I say this to you this bride is the mouthpiece of almighty God Haddie speak had offer them Sons speak them squirrels into existence speak to that stor where be the god of Elijah I don't need squirrels but I need some girls filled with

never done those things Elijah could have never raised up that boy Hallelujah Elijah could have never called down fire but it was the God on the [Applause] inside when William Brenham laid his hand on Hatty walr that died with cancer in his prayer line it was not Elijah it was the god of Elijah your God said Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover he didn't say if I lay my hands on him if Jesus lays his hand on him if Peter lays his hand on him but if you lay your hands on the sick they shall recover it's not you it's the God on the inside of [Applause] you I enjoy William Brandon's

Andrew Spencer he's the god of Doug Hill kind of like tonight kind of like tonight it was a night like that some six or seven years ago when Doug Hill passed away in this church service I feel the same power of the enemy staring me in my face but he's a god of Doug Hill and Doug Hill ain't in the grave Doug Hill is alive he's the same God I tell you he's the same God that raises little girls out by a wheelchair got club feet and can't get can't even get up out of the wheelchair but when Jesus begins to talk to a man healing comes to her body and she begin to run before an entire audience I'll say he's that kind of a God I'll say he's the kind of God that is still giving babies to people that cannot have babies if he can give a little Charlie green to a n and Caitlyn green when it was impossible I say he's still the god of baren WS but they must bring forth life for 17 years Dwayne and Heather Jackson could not have a child but he's the god that brings forth life I tell you he's a

gone you might think they're Out Of Reach but I had a vision the other day of somebody I to give up hope on and God showed them to me perfectly restored Hallelujah things may not work out the way that

change anything in my symptoms but her faith still believed her faith still believed but there was a pastor that started preaching about the God that does extreme things that he's a God that does exploits that he's a God that does Miracles hallelujah hallelujah and that little lady after hearing that sermon preached started leaning on the Everlasting Arms of almighty God let me tell you there might be times when your symptoms are prevailing over top of what you're seeing but her faith was unmoved and she still believed that he was the god of the miraculous Hallelujah I say hallelujah I say

Gospel Lighthouse he's the god of your situation and brother Brandon would brother Bron would tell you now no now while this is going on you just be real reverent you just be real reverent he said be

many in here have received the Holy Ghost in the last last couple months how many's received the Holy Ghost in the last year I'm talking about a real genuine birth of the Holy Ghost keep your hands up don't you be ashamed let me tell you what you're doing you are showing that the God on the inside of you is greater than gravity keep your hands up say I am a witness that God gives a holy ghost Brother David I'm going to point you out how many's been in here and delivered of alcohol how many in here have been delivered from tobacco how many in here been delivered from all kinds of drugs you got a right to turn yourself loose to praise [Applause] him I think sometimes I think sometimes that we only praise God for the things that we see but the things that you don't see are worth praising him more [Applause] for how many turn down doubt for Faith turn yourself loose to praise him how many stepped out on the waters when it didn't look like it was feasible when it didn't look like it was [Applause] possible God wants to move you out of your comfort zone to produce a miracle I say this to you he's the god of miraculous he's the god of impossibility where be the Lord of our Jesus Christ where is he if he's still the god of Gideon if he still the god of David if he still the god of Elijah where is the god that was Upon Jesus Christ where is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob where is the god that was Upon Our Lord Jesus Christ that these blessings and as it is in the great crisis there they had someone to turn back to oh though Elijah was gone here was the one Elisha that poured hand water on his hands that had a double portion of his spirit so is this sick and sinful world today looking to a real Church of the Living God who possesses a double portion of his Spirit the world's looking for the god of Elijah where is the god of Elijah where is he Elijah ask his where where is he where is he where's he at but he took the same power because he had witnessed that Elijah walked over on dry ground and he took the same spirit and he said if he could do it once he can do it again hallelujah hallelujah you got a right to turn yourself loose to praise Him Matthew mcclard's wife sister Dorothy she had to have open heart surgery one time and after she got out on the other side of that open heart surgery the doctors came and told her said that she still had a hole in her heart Believers begin to pray they laid their hands on her and when the MRI was done the hole was completely gone Hallelujah now a man can't move a mountain but he said if you speak to this mountain and say be cast from here to Yonder is deity in you speaking of that mountain how many needs a miracle I know she here or she out all right sister Whitney has a very serious need in her body is going on right now Hallelujah got a very serious need in in female organs needs a needs a touch from the Lord if Elijah's here it's a signal that the god of Elijah is here men tried to raise up and be conquerors Napoleon tried to raise up and be a conqueror but he died at 33 years old and died an alcoholic but this Mighty conqueror this God of Elijah he rose up when it looked like utter defeat and he proved he was God over hell he was God over death and he's God over sickness sister Whitney needs a god that is a god of the miraculous I don't know whether she's a miracle or not but I believe that the Miracle Worker is in this room right now I was thinking today what's the greatest miracle that I've seen lately what's the greatest miracle and I be to it begin to fail me I started counting this one off I started counting that one off I started counting out all the the exus I start to count all the prodical that returned sister Devon you come to my mind sister Caitlyn you come to my mind I started counting them off and I thought God this whole church is a miracle brother Jimmy you're one of the greatest Miracles Brother David you're one of the greatest Miracles but I'm not going to isolate it down to one person or one family I'll say that the Bride of Jesus Christ to believe against all doubt and all criticism and all fear is a testimony that he's still the god of Elijah how many needs healing in their body want the musicians come how Miss dealing with with arthritis I miss dealing with back pain how many's been dealing with headaches how many's been dealing with nightmares how many's been tormented how many still living in Le oosa then you need a miracle Lord God the god of Moses the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god that spoke and it was Lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in all of you that there is no God like the God of this message Lord I have stood here under the unction of the Holy Ghost and felt the very power poers of almighty God run through my veins pulsate over top of my body I felt the trembling of hell as we begin to preach these things Lord Jesus I believe that right here by the preaching of the word that special Miracles can be done if they can take aprons off of Paul's body and just lay them on the sick and they would recover if the shadow of Peter could cross over those that was laying on the street father we've got more than a shadow here the Bride of Jesus Christ is in this room and you give us a commission right before your Ascension to all them that believe in my name they shall be baptized they should be baptize in my name they should take up any deadly thing and it shall not harm them they should drink in didly thing and it will not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that signs and wonders would follow them all the world so father under the commission of Mark 16 we lay our hands out upon this one and we lay our hands out upon that one our brother to our sister and we ask that the healing Virtues Of Jesus Christ would run through this building father I pray for my sister just now that is on the way to UVA that is dealing with something in her mortal
