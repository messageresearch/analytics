than good to us and uh he's he's been more than faithful and i'm just so thankful to be a part of this great wonderful message and we just love the lord of all of our hearts amen amen amen if you have your bibles this morning i'd like to look over in the book of john chapter one the first chapter there verse 45 and then colossians chapter 2 colossians chapter 2 and verse 6. john chapter 1 verse 45. before we read i'd like to take this take this quote as as a theme this morning on the identity of the believer brother branham said in convinced and concerned he said he said a man's got to be convinced first convinced first and and the only convincing thing is the manifestation or the identity of the gospel being identified in you and when you see that you have passed from death into life and become a new creature in christ jesus that's the identity of the holy spirit that's exactly right how can the holy spirit write the bible and turn around and deny what he wrote see he cannot do it that's the identity of unbelief that's the identity of unbelief but the identity of belief jesus said that these signs shall identify those who believe in me now we know that's god's own word john chapter 1 and verse 45 and philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph colossians chapter 2 and verse 6. colossians chapter 2 and verse 6 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walking in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him what a powerful thing this morning that we know that the body without the life in it there's no there's no without the spirit there's no quickening power there and just like the word that we're reading it takes the spirit of the living god to come and quicken it and make it alive hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses can you thank the lord for that this morning blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on the identity of the believer and we we know that it's in humanity to search out their roots of where they came from and to to trace back their identity and look back at their natural genealogy and see where they came from and and there are some that are that have spent much time in their family history and and searching out for different links of how men are connected back and forth and there's there's even technology today that you can take a little sample of your of your dna and send it off and and you can spit in a little bottle and they'll send it off to a place and they'll send it back and they'll tell you where you came from but we recognize where we came from we don't have to spit in a bottle we don't have to send off our dna but we know exactly where we came from we came from the mind of god and we know that there's nothing that can hinder us from fulfilling exactly what god has destined us to be but men have spent much time in studying out their own genealogy and looking at looking at where they came from and technology has allowed them to look and see what region that they came from and there's so much percentage of so much percentage of norway and so much english and it's brought about and it builds up the human being and i've i've had a great fun with my wife and showing up that she she's militant in her ways and she's got two percent german in her and i i just not nothing against anything german but i sure enjoy i sure enjoy knowing that the militant things there are some things right there that that just but we there's some things right there that we're aware of and so so we know that there are certain percentages of where you came from and where you're going actually that shows up in your natural genealogy but how much greater in our in our spiritual dna that we came from the mind of god that that this is this is his mindset this is this is his doing this is what he brought us here we're not we're not here on our own we're not here and making up this this plan we have a purpose to fulfill the prophecy that was set out before us and and god is determined to make sure that you fulfill the prophecy that is according to to your purpose and to your plan and what you're going to do and what you're going to go through to think about today that god has so lined up everything in your life there's nothing coming and there's nothing going that can happen to you that god doesn't already know about you see you are a spiritual gene of almighty god brother barum said he said he said before i could act as a human before i could walk like a human before i could talk like a human i have to be born a human he said how would a knot on a tree know how i acted how could he ever say i don't act like that the only way that he could be that or would be to be born like me that's the way the organization is dead and draw people away because it went after a creed but in order to be a son of god you've got to be born of the spirit of god and then you become christ-like and do the works of christ then you're not funny to them people you see a human acting like a human is not funny a christian acting like a christian is born of the same spirit and you see you watch people they they make fun of the holy ghost or they make fun of the way that you act they've not been born the way that you've been born but if you understand why they're acting like they're acting a human being acting like a human ain't nothing an ordinary but when men get mixed up in their identities and they start when women started acting like man and man starting acting like women there's something that's messed up but when christians start acting like christians and sons and daughters of god start acting like sons and daughters of god it's not unnatural but it's natural to the mind of god you see god is all supernatural and the god the supernatural is just simply natural it's natural to him to be supernatural and when we see the mind of god coming down when we see the supernatural being manifested right in front of us brother random said that's the mind of christ when you see jesus showing up and when you see jesus sowing out it is the mind of christ that is being dispersed through the church of the living god we know that that we as mortal beings we we went from time beings to eternal beings it is the gene of god that is in us that has made us sons and daughters of god we did not become seed we were seed and because we were seed therefore we could be reborn and there's no one that can match your identity when you say that you have a personal identity there's nobody that can take your spot you can look at all of the samples of your dna you can have a twin but it will not match up according to what you are and what god is destined you to be is exactly what you will be there is no similarity like the bride of jesus christ there is no affinity like the bride of jesus christ it is the holy ghost that is our identification what god has for you is for you it ain't for somebody else god ain't some mailman that drops a mail off at somebody else's house if he's got healing for you he'll drop it off at your house if he's got deliverance for you he'll drop it off at your house if he's got prodigals that are returning because god won't drop your mail off at somebody else's house he knows who you are he knows what you need he knows what you've been destined for what god has for me is for me and hell and how water might come but it won't stop the mail of god getting to me where i'm supposed to be at what god has for me is for me my breakthrough my holy ghost my deliverance hallelujah glory you see man's what man's nature or his style of preaching or his gift god has placed that on the inside of him to meet the challenge of the day and just like with you as you become as you recognize and you are woke up to the fact that you are a son of god god has put something on the inside of you to meet the challenge of the day to vindicate that the true and living god of this hour that the message coming forth in this time is to produce exactly what it is this is what you are watching is modern events made clear by prophecy and what you are witnessing in the pride of jesus christ is the bride's revival it took those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up and this is her revival and she is identified not with some denomination she's not identified with some man-made creed but she's identified with a message and your life has matched the message it's matched the promise of an archangel that this is christ himself that is descended down first thessalonians four and six it tells us that christ shouted sin with a voice and a shout and the trump of an angel and brother burnham said in the message of rapture he said that a god that christ does all three as he's descending what you are watching is heaven descending to you what you watched up there in slovenia canyon that was not jesus it was christ it was the anointing that came down the shout is the message the voice is the one that wakes up the sleeping bride but it's the trumpet that gathers away the trumpet is the day it's the catching away it's the rapture that brings an ascending it's the trumpet it's your day what christ did he descended so that you can ascend but when we go in a rapture it's a signal to israel that she will receive her two prophets that are under the same angelic covenant that this message was under god didn't bring you this message just to leave you where you are he's wanting you to ascend higher come up here little bride this message is a pushing higher it's an ascension message he's not wanting to leave you where you are he's not wanting you to stay in your footprint he's not wanting oh come on somebody they say that when when neil armstrong went up there that his footprint is still on the moon i'll say this hell can do everything it wants to me it can put me in the grave but my footprint will still be here he can try to get rid of me he can try to mock me he can try to make fun of me but my footprint is seen on the face of it's seen on the face of satan and he knows where i'm standing at he knows that i know how i know he knows that you know that you are a son and daughter of god and he's tried everything to keep you from your identity you're not in an identity crisis you know who you are you don't have spiritual amnesia i've seen that water tower i know that it's still there god still got sons that are looking for it [Applause] it's an essential message and there ain't been no other age that's been promised like it's been promised in this age of malachi 4 of luke 17 30 of john 14 and 12. this ain't luther's message this ain't wesley's message this is your message this ain't just william branham's message this is my message it's known you can't separate the message from the messenger but you can't separate it from me either i am the message i am the bride's revival the mighty angel is in me i am she she knows what he once done with the word i have found my identity in the baptism of the holy ghost you can search your dna in the ohio you'll have all kinds of traces better tell you where you came from i have i have come my way and i have seen some samples of where i came from that there is a future there is a future home for me that what i am seeing is these are the things that are to be this is our rapture this is our leadership this is our communion this is the invisible union of the bride i have found myself in this message i found myself in this message i'm not looking i i know that i know i got a whole family that's sitting here i've got a whole family that's going to be there [Applause] i got a family that's going to be there and we are determined to make sure what god took a picture of you before the foundation of the world you might go through some stuff but you are going to find your way to write where god thought of you before the foundation of the world and it might seem like you're never going to get in a family album and satan might do all of he wants to he can do his best but he still don't have enough to stop you if he would have had enough he'd have brought enough but he ain't got enough to stop you when god took that picture of you brother jordan it was not in your best right here but it was in his mind i am the prophet's prophecy this message has brought us into a fellowship with him it's a fellowship with him he didn't educate us unto him but we contacted him we've handled him to get his believing children to to a spot of recognition of who they are and what they've gone through that is why it's appearing to you so that you fulfill your purpose in the promise it's his threefold purpose that he would come and he would restore and that he would reveal himself as a son of man that he would come and he'd have the preeminence and the bride of jesus christ and that he would come in his threefold purpose and he'll change your body when god met abraham up there abraham knew that it was on he knew that the one that had led him all the days of his life this was the same one what did he do he watched and he identified that the one that was talking to him was the one that was standing in front of him and you watch the effect of the revelation that it had on abraham you watch what it did when he changed his name i'll no longer call you abram but i'll call you abraham i put a part of myself in you i put hello i put a little bit of myself on the inside of you so that you recognize that you cannot be broke away from the covenant this is who i am so you see no matter what how old abraham got he was connected to the author of life he deposited a part of himself in his name and you think well why in the world does that matter your name could not be called bride until you had a change but when you knew when god knew where you were he said i'll no longer call you church but i'll call you bride abraham so that you know that i'm talking to you the rest of the church world can't identify themselves with you but you have been identified by him dispersing his seed on the inside of you your seed is your identity oh god help me you're a part of his plan i'm a part of his purpose i'm a part of god's future that seed didn't come from my mom and my daddy that natural seed that passes through that passes through holy wedlock as it works its way to the womb it is bypassing 999 000 just to get to a spot a predestination and god knows what it will be he knows what color hair to have him knows what color eyes it's going to have and god knew what you would be before the foundation of the world and he is going to watch as what he dispersed into the ground of faith and watch as it becomes more than just a seed that went down more than just what he threw onto the ground but he's gonna watch it manifest here imagine as god throws out his seed and he throws out he throws out the seed of william branham and it manifests exactly what it was to be but god didn't just stop right there he had jim noel's that he had to bring up he had some michael buchanans that he had to bring up he had some steven shorts that had to be manifested and it looked like it looked like all chaos was going to stop you from getting here but remember he departed he deposited a part of himself brother brother brother then he he put it there and it's got to come forward you can go through struggles you can go through birth pains but that baby's got to come out you can go through world wars you can go through trials but it's got to come out your greatest character is shown in the midst of a trial and when abraham was in the midst of his greatest trial of his life the bible said he was not weak in faith but he was strong in god oh yeah you can look over on the backside of the old testament and you can see you can see what he did you can see what's over there on the other side of the of the old testament but it doesn't pass through these few pages is what separates the old testament from the new testament over on this side over on this side of the old testament abraham abraham abraham got himself in trouble abraham tried to have the promise to everybody else abraham tried to put the new birth he tried to say it was just for his mom or daddy i'm preaching to you now abraham said i'm too old for this abraham said my wife ain't got enough strength to birth out a son but on this side on the side of the new testament it shows that abraham was not weak in faith it shows that abraham was strong on one side of the blood if you look on the old side yeah i see dirty rotten scandals yes i see all kinds of torah more yes i see you what's no good but on this side of the blood on this side of the covenant it's your identity he doesn't trace it back he can never be found no more i'm not identified with a man that once was but i'm identified in a new identity [Applause] therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature legion you have found your new identity you're no longer in a tomb you're no longer in shackles i am what he thought of me before the foundation of the world sister connie he can try to rob you he can try to stop you but you are predestinated to prove that satan was a liar he can't stop you he can't get to you because there's a promise over you god's going to get us home god knows where you're at [Applause] you watch the effect of the revelation that it had on abraham when he went out there the one that had talked to him all of his life and when elohim come walking down the road what did he say there was three walking there was three walking come here gabriel come here michael i need to use you for a minute i need to use you for a minute and he blew himself a body and he stepped into that body who is this who is this that walked up to your tent who is this that came to your situation who is this melchizedek who is this jesus christ how can he do these things it's the same one that spoke let there be light and you're watching the same manifestation that took place back there in the beginning let there be light let there be seed and it's the same one that's bringing the seed in your life to manifestation it followed him all of his days and you've been a close listener you watched him you ain't understood everything that that's happened in your life you haven't understood why you had to journey like your journey but you watch the effect of the revelation that the one that's been talking to you is the one that's going to come walking down your dusty road let me say this he didn't create he didn't create himself a body and walk down to somebody else's address he knows where he's going sister stephanie [Music] he knows where he's going he didn't create a body so so that he could step in so that he could bring his message to a different destination that was predestinated he predestinated you so that he could walk upon you and talk to you have a conversation with you and when you have a conversation with melchizedek it's given you authority for a body change you may not understand everything that he's doing when he's walking by your way but your identity is bound in this one to loose you to loose you to what you are to be he didn't leave in the same way that he found him he changed him i'll say this when he found me he didn't leave me the same way you left me when he found me right there i started talking a different language i started moving to a different rhythm of the music i started dancing according to the word [Applause] because i found my freedom in him this one that's been walking by your way the one that you've been fellowshipping with you've heard his voice you've seen visions he's led you to this moment for a moment such as this esther he didn't lead you to this kingdom so that you could stay here he didn't just give you this palace so that you could have a nice bed he didn't give you this palace so that you could come in and say i was the one that he chose he sent you here for a purpose when abraham catches a revelation it's the one i've been talking to it's the one i've been fellowshipping with you watch there's three but he says my lord will you watch what happens over in sodom and gomorrah they didn't have the same revelation that abraham had and you think why didn't they catch it because the angel stood up there at the tent with you some of you met that angel at a tent last night some of you met him this morning some of you are gonna walk out of the service completely different than you walked in here because when elohim gets to walking there's going to be some cells that start changing gray hairs are going to start turning back to black hair things that were falling out are now being put back in oh won't it be your time [Applause] you can try all you want to to put the things that have fell off of you put them back in place but one moment you ain't lost one of them hairs you ain't lost one of your children what god put on the inside of you god will bring forth and satan ain't nothing but a pervert but you are a creator and satan's trying to stop your creation you know what you created you created worship you created a vessel for the holy ghost you created a worship you created a heart of praise you created children and satan is trying to stop your children he's trying to stop your worship he's trying to stop your praise he's trying to stop you with sickness but what god has meant for you to manifest you will manifest abraham get ready he's got a purpose let me say you know what you created don't you have yourself a little testimony service right there abraham you know what you created you know what's been told about you you know what's been said that you will manifest have yourself a testimony i created i created a reagan in an alley i created a dance i created a worship i created a praise i created an atmosphere and satan can try to stop what i created but where did i get that from where'd i get what satan can never do where'd i get that at yeah you can go ahead and let that sink in for a moment but when back there in the garden of eden there was an affinity that there could be an intermingling of seeds but god after the garden of eden he destroyed he destroyed that affinity that no longer that intermingling can take place he broke it and science has looked for it it has searched for it and it's tried to do its very best to say that that's where your identity came from it's tried to trace you back to this is what you were this is what and they have looked all over they have looked all over for what happened back there in that garden of eden satan knew that he couldn't create so he worked his way into the serpent because there was an affinity that was there it was a similarity that could be passed through so satan worked his way through the serpent because he didn't have the power to create [Applause] oh now start thinking about what you created start thinking about what you did start thinking about what you prophesied start thinking about what you said what you're coming here to manifest and satan can never do what you have done he can pervert he can take your body and make it sick he can take your mind and put all kinds of things in it and try to bombard your mind but you are a creator satan comes in and he puts all kinds of things in your mind and he tries to tell you that you're not good enough but you watch the spirit of creation start working and you say let there be light over this situation one word one moment is enough to stop satan in his tracks and if you create one sale of faith if you create one cell of worship if you create one sale of praise [Applause] it's more than satan can ever create oh man oh man brother baron said in christ a mystery of god revealed he said identified that's why the devil's howling it's because this is being identified no longer as jesus of 2000 years ago but it's the son of man once again in the form of his bride and what god has put on the inside of her she will manifest and you can try to throw everything on top of her don't you worry about what you've been through don't you worry about what you're going through you will be what god destined you to be you may not look like the picture just now but abraham get ready let me go let me just go a few more chapters here when abraham takes the one that the one that came out of his own loins when he took his own creation upon a hill when he took his own creation up on a hill sometimes you're gonna have to take what you created and put it on the sacrifice line out what you've just do what you've just said there's gonna come a time in your life when god's gonna ask for your creation i'll say this i'll gladly give i'll gladly give abraham this is what i'm asking you to do take your son your creation thine only son he didn't call ismael because ismail was created before the promise ismail was created by his own flesh but what isaac what came out of abraham had to do with a hand of melchizedek coming to his tent abraham take your son your only son isaac up there on that mountain and worship and sacrifice and isaac isaac knew what to do he'd been in a spot of worship before father we've got the fire father we've got the word but where's your sacrifice but you watch the spirit of prophecy come on abraham said my son god shall provide for himself a sacrifice and because abraham did what only abraham could do brother graham said god spoke to him and said abraham because what you did what only you could do not what somebody else did there's going to be there's going to be some people that are rise up and try to take your glory but you're the one that created this there's gonna be some people rise up and say i was there i'm the one no because you did this because you chose the hard way because you chose to live this message so that you wouldn't just identify with just some church building or another movement but because you did what god destined you to do [Applause] because you did this that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies [Applause] brother branham said if that don't make you holler he said you're dead thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy name your gate put it in front of you possess it overtake it this is the inheritance of the saints of the living god what god has for you is for you and you will overtake it and you will possess it why don't you just go ahead and start speaking to the atmosphere this is what i need this is what i want i ain't talking some prosperity gospel i'm talking the sovereignty of the holy ghost [Applause] because you did this because you had faith when nobody else had faith abraham didn't know how it was going to come out you may not be able to look and have the foresight of almighty god but god's got long-range vision over your life and what god has seen over you it will come to pass thy seed will possess the gate of its enemies you watch what will take place when you start believing he ain't asking for somebody else's faith he's asking for your faith he ain't even asking you to believe in your faith he's asking you to believe in him oh man i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and take my i'm gonna take my crossbow and i'm gonna go ahead and shoot right through that thing god don't want your faith god ain't wanting he's wanting your faith let me bring this back so you don't think i'm confusing you he's wanting your faith but he's not wanting you to have faith in your own faith he's not wanting you to have faith in what you think you can do he's wanting you to have faith in the god of impossibilities abraham you can't do this on your own abraham you can't create this son abraham you can't take him upon that mountain by yourself abraham you can't bring him down by yourself but when i go up there when i meet you up there i am still jehovah jarrah i am thy provider i am el shaddai i am jehovah
