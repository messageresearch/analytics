I don't know if brother Matthew said anything or not uh but these speakers that are here on stage these are we we are running some test on these things for our meeting for the Labor Day and uh so that's why they're there they they'll probably be there for a little while and so we can kind of test some things out so if you see it here you see it on the stream it's it's uh it's just us running some test here so and uh we ran some things here last night and we were really happy with it and so just just pray it just pray all of these things work out for the glory of the Lord and amen before we read uh the scriptures this evening brother brandham said in in the conference he said I was reading an article or a little poet said that Caesar was going to ask he said he was going to ride in a great Chariot and he wanted some of his soldiers an honorable Soldier to ride with him down through the streets of this great Jubilee and all the Warriors trim their plumes and their polish their shield and their helmets getting ready to pass by Caesar to review to see who he had to choose to ride with him in this great parade and said all of his Warriors walking perfectly straightly walked by and stood by stood with their salute and said all along Caesar and said all along Caesar looked at each one of them as he come by and said after a while a little bitty old Soldier crippled up in his arm scoured all over his face and everything walked by and he felt ashamed of himself and he kind of bowed his head and started away and Caesar said wait a minute wait a minute there come back here the little soldier walked up and fell down on his knees and he said yes great emperor and he said where did you get them scars said why what are you all scarred up about he said I got them in the battlefield fighting for my Emperor he said you set up here by me you earned a ride mother B said I don't care whether I'm whether I'm a DD a PhD a LD I want some scars to show that I've been in the battle that's what the Christian ought to do don't you choose the flowery easy things I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few Isaiah chapter 53 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground and he hath no form nor commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed in the Gospel of John chapter n and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him may God bless the reading of the word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord and I just like to take a thought that the Lord put on my heart while I was sitting there Sunday Sunday morning last Sunday morning my brother Aaron was speaking just heard the spirit of God begin to speak to me on unhe hurt unhe hurt by the supernatural unhe hurt by the Supernatural and I actually had to look up the word just to make sure it wasn't one of my my kind of words cuz it actually is a word unhe hurt it means not hurt I I thought that was all right holy spirit kind of speaks my language and actually is a words it means not hurt it means not harmed it means free from wound or injury I thought that's that that right there is enough to maybe just to expound on just for a little bit is unhe hurt free from wounds by the supernatural the only reason that we're here is because of the Supernatural and I I know that that being part there are Parts about being a Christian that we would simply say that are just not fun that just I just put it down put it down in in English language there are certain things about the Christian walk that are simply just not fun there are things that we have to go through things that we don't understand and the further that we go in the Christian journey and we look and we see that as the more that we face of leay osia and we see here in per perilous times the more that we see the more we seem to look at things and people we live in an age of people's rights we live in a age of of the woman but we live in an hour where it seems like men and women are not not just Christians but in all in all in all parameters of life it look you look about upon any human being it doesn't matter what what background that they're from it does it doesn't matter it you look upon humanity and it seems that people are more hurt and the more broken and they're more easily offended at because of the the exposure of the attack of the enemy in the hour that we're living in it doesn't matter whether you're a Christian and it doesn't matter whether you're you're you're a uh a nominal person it doesn't matter whether you're an atheist you look out upon people and people are so hurt they're so offended they carry things they carry hurts they carry scars all throughout their lives and as Christians we we we we know that we are to forgive but often times we forgive without forgetting exactly what is transpiring in our lives and you watch people and you you watch their lives you can see that that people carry hurts and they carry scars all their lives and you watch somebody if you're acquainted with somebody that's scarred up or somebody that's been in a battle they they carry those things and you'll watch as scars and hurts they will literally destroy families they they hurt little hurts maybe little words off the cuff or or things of that nature it will literally destroy a family it will destroy a business it will destroy relationships and literally families has been dissolved because one word because of one word you watch and what it is it it's wounds that have never been able to heal and people that do not have the chance or do not give it the chance to allow it to heal it's it's like always it's always like having an open wound as a kid we you you know you scar yourself up and get them strawberries all over your legs mama always said you keep picking on them things ain't going toit heal up and she told us you're going to have a scar there and we we'd heard that statement that girls like scars so we kept picking at them things and and uh you know we still got some of things but often times you you find people that wear their feelings on their shoulders or they constantly have a have a wounded Spirit they're they're constantly they don't allow it to heal and the only way I know to heal a wounded spirit is take the word of God and to allow it to heal because men constantly have have things upon their shoulders and and men don't realize the Power of Words If if we just be real honest about it men don't realize the volume of words that they that their capacity that the words that they have is that words really do hurt people is that right words really do hurt people the people that that man that said that sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me never had a friend stab him in the back because words can really hurt they can they can really afflict but you don't realize sometimes you don't realize the the effect of of of a good word and you don't realize the effect of a bad word how it how it changes a person's uh their their ideas or what they look at for the whole Calamity of the day how they how they go about their life their whole entire atmosphere is controlled upon word you just wake up one morning and say good morning ugly your whole day is going to be completely in disarray because you messed up because of one word you should have been saying that to yourself not to the lady that was sitting there in the bed to you I never been so dumb to do that I didn't marry ugly wife I married a beautiful wife so I know I ain't never going to have to say that but it's amazing when you just say one word you understand what I'm saying right here you understand where I'm going it's it's amazing when you drop a word because a word is a seed and if you drop that word you don't realize the power or the effect of that word it's just like it's just like the preaching of the Gospel we really don't know who is and who ain't elect our job is simply to preach the gospel and let God do the Gathering is that right so we don't realize sometimes the words that we are speaking is it you a word is a seed it's like a it's like a little apple seed that you plant into the ground and you planted it there 20 years ago all of them apples that you ever see was in the life of that seed when it was planted right there and sometimes you don't see the root of bitterness you don't see the root of of depression and anxiety when you say one word when you say you don't realize the complex that's going with it we I remember remember in high school when when Matthew planted he planted a little oak tree outside that that he got there in school and he planted it right s right right outside of Dad's house and you know we we didn't we didn't think we be honest we really didn't think we'd still be here to be honest and he planted that tree about 30 yards away from Matthews or Dad's house there and as that thing grew up over the years we had to cut that thing down because in branches then branch has done reached all the way out there and has getting close to the roof of the thing you don't realize sometimes what you're planning you think well it seems so small you just go cut down that tree and have to deal with all the branches and all the all the brush that comes off of it you'll find how powerful that little seed is you see the Bible said that Proverbs Proverbs 14 that the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can bear it you see it's kind of like it's kind of like how brother random would describe it as a cancer that that cancer is a bruised cell he said he literally said it's a backslid sail he said it was a good sail that got bruised and it's backslid and what did it do all of a sudden because cancer is a scavenger it's a buzzard it starts eating on dead things and that cancer begins to work and it goes to get to getting to eating on that dead thing and it's amazing how that your entire body can suffer because of one bad cell in your body it's amazing because it only started with one thing and you begin to watch some body then when they we begin to suffer from that that Calamity or that or that word called cancer it affects the entire it infects it infects and affects the entire family when somebody has been diagnosed with cancer but worse than the cancer of a body is a cancer of a spirit or a soul it will literally eat up every good cell that there is because that's what cancer does it attaches itself to all the good cells in which it's most built to build you up that cancer will come down and begin to eat down the good cells because of what because of what it does because of it is a life that is laying behind it you ever watch somebody that has ever suffered from the infirmity of a lie when somebody when somebody told something on somebody that wasn't true and that person becomes they become a a a a prisoner because of somebody else's lie I I remember as a as a little boy I remember watching this I be I'll be honest I thought he was I I really thought this was one of the strongest Christian brothers that I'd ever been around I'd been a lot of places and I I really thought a lot of this brother but there was a there was this this brother he was away from here he he had a lie that was told on him and and and it really bothered this brother it really bothered him so bad that this brother went from a strong Christian to the weakest of Christians in a matters of moments because somebody told a lie on him and and he literally he he be to begin broke down he began to get broke down and before long he was believing that lie and it was a complete lie that somebody told on him just because people people are rude ain't that crazy that people would do something kids are kids are just mean they're they're just mean and because because a rumor circulated that brother became one of the he he was a strong man in the faith he was a he was a real Christian and before long that man lost his house he lost his wife he lost his children and he lost the headship of Christ you see Satan cannot do anything until you believe him and you just flip it just a minute God can't do anything until you believe him it it is all upon on what how you receive it is that right and you watch you watch you begin to watch it's you just deal with people's lives you begin to see I I remember one time just dealing with a young man who had fought some serious demons because of of a parent because of a parent that said something to him when he was a child and he carried that all of his life he had lived with that scar his entire life and this this young man was not even close to what that what that Daddy had said about him but because of that word that a father figure had in his life he lived with that complex over top of him it's amazing the power that words have I I think it's I think it's uh incredible when you begin to look at the at the whole scheme of Christianity of our life that that God ain't offered us uh flower beds of ease he's not offered us he's not offered us days where we're not going to get sick he's not offered us days where we're going to be we're going to be blessed and never going to live in famine we're never going to have to go out and worry about our flat tires we're never going to have to worry about our our cars breaking down God doesn't offer us those things but he offers us healing when we are sick he offers us joy when we have sorrow you're going to go through some stuff as a Christian and you're going to go through some calamities of life but let me say it like brother Ron says it I've been hurt before but I made it I've been sick before but I made it I've been broken before but I made it I've been let down before but I made it I've been nervous before but I made it so the enemy can whisper all kinds of Lies the wi the enemy can come in and try to rob you of your joy but recognize immediately that Satan cannot do anything to you unless you believe him the only Power of a lie is when you believe that lie the only Power of the truth is when you believe that truth and you're going to have to go through some stuff if you're going to ride in The Chariot with our Lord Jesus Christ you're going to have to go through some battles God has God has not sent us here on a picnic but he has sent us here on a battlefield and Paul said and I believe this is some of the greatest words I believe that some of the greatest words in literature that has ever been written but not just only in in literature but in the word of God Paul said that I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy be to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us that the things that you're going through right now are not worthy let me say cancer is not worthy to be compared to the glory which Ron Spencer will receive let me say this to you loss of loved ones is not not worthy to be compared to the glory that's going to be revealed in you come on somebody a loss of friends because he came to the message it's not worthy to be compared to the Glory Hallelujah you're going to go through some trials you're going to go through some calamities Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1 and5 for as the sufferings of Christ hath abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ let me read it to you in the passion it says as just as we experience the abundance of Christ Christ's own sufferings even more of God's Own Comforts will Cascade upon us through our Union with Christ if troubles weigh us down that just means that we will receive even more Comfort to pass on to you for your deliverance for the comfort pouring into us empowers us to bring Comfort to you and with this Comfort upholding you you can endure victoriously the same suffering that we experience Paul said I have been through some suffering times I was with 39 minus twice I was I was shipwreck sometimes I went through some things but I went through these things to give you comfort when you suffer in your body when you suffer in your life when you suffer I say this to you that your suffering is a Crown of Glory when when one of the most precious people in my life my teeny when she was going off the scene she was a she was a spiritual Rock for the Spencer she was a she was a kind of lady that she she was she was them kind of lady brother brother Doug that spoke spoke softly but she carried a big stick she was the kind of woman that prayed real silently but she moved all of hell and heaven at the same time she was that kind of a woman and just days before just moments before she passes away brother Davey is in an accident and he we don't really realize what all brother Dave is going to go through in his in his walk and in his journey when he wrecks up here and he wrecks on black ice we didn't know whether he's going to be paralyzed we didn't know if Whit he was going to be without a husband but just a few moments later my teeny starts dying with a terrible heart attack but the Lord had spoke a word to brother R said oh thou suffering stand and be healed and literally in moments of us getting to the hospital we watched a Lady of Grace die Like A Champion the doctor asked her said are you ready to go she said oh I'm ready to go she didn't die like a coward she didn't die like some wimy little Christian she died like a soldier in the army of the Lord and you might have to go through some calamities of life you might have to go through rumors of life you might have to go through downtrodden times in life but suffering turn it to standing for Joy Paul would say when he was going down to Jerusalem in Acts chapter 20 he said I'd go Bound by the spirit to Jerusalem he didn't know what was coming by his way he didn't know what was going to happen down there to him he said but none of these things the things that I don't know about the things that that are uncertain none of them things move me Hallelujah I don't know what's coming but I know that God is leading you see in all of these things the Supernatural is present to Prevail over all the hurts of the enemy now to be honest with you I would have titled this sermon completely different I would have titled it healed by the supernatural but I've been doing this long enough time to tell you that you can be un hurt by the supernatural somebody may have done you wrong you can be un hurt by the supernatural business might be slow but you can be un hurt by the Supernatural friends might walk away from you but you can be un hurt by the supernatural let me say this to you there are going to be some times in your life when you have to leave the Comforts of home when it come to Joseph and Mary I I sat down had a had a conversation one time with a with a man he he he stood there and I I was preaching on I was preaching on the cost to leaving home and what it cost to leave home and talking about Joseph and Mary having to leave their home and go all the way there and the brother come up to me and he said look he said them was hard times for them they done receive myrr they done receive gold and they receive frankincense I said brother have you ever had to leave home without wanting to leave home you talk about a story when you start looking at Abraham Abraham had to leave all the Comforts of home you ever have been pushed out of your house whether by whether by eviction or whether you just needed to move you don't like leaving the Comforts of home is that right the devil don't leave don't like leaving the Comforts of home that's why he pushes against this gospel truth but Abraham had to leave his Comforts of life to follow the Supernatural and Abraham's faith is a testament that the Supernatural will lead you past your hurts the supernatural will lead you past your hurts and Abraham's Faith his faith literally produced Jehovah Gyra I'll say this again Abraham's Faith produced Jehovah Gyra it wasn't until he got into a spot when he was challenged to sacri sacrifice everything that he ever loved everything that he ever hoped for he come to this spot in Genesis chap 22 can you imagine the hurt brother VJ when he is asked to sacrifice his own son but literally because of Abraham's Faith Isaac is unhe hurt by the Supernatural and because of Abraham's Faith there that word was spoken to them thy seed shall possess the Gate of its enemies and literally because of Abraham's faith that three Hebrew children were able to possess the Gate of that furnace and walk out of there unhe hurt by the furnace because of Abraham's faith it doesn't matter the crisis it doesn't matter the calamities the supernatural God is close you you see where God found you at he found you in your Brokenness he found you in your mess he found you in your trial there was none of us that are sitting here today in the same spot that we are in right now when he found us can I get a witness or is is the rest of the Angels here tonight he found us in our Brokenness he found us when we were that without hope he found us when we had give up hope but Jesus spoke these words they that are whole don't need a physician but they that are sick need a physician I want to be very clear to you when we showed up here all of us were un we were all of us showed up here as damaged goods we showed up here and the things of our life were Rocky they were shaky there were things that we were nervous about none of us showed up here like the picture of Grace we showed up here like a disgrace Hallelujah come on somebody that's the kind of people that God is looking for people that don't think they're perfect people that realize they're not whole he's looking for somebody that he can make whole and all my life I am ass short of this one thing that Christ takes my Brokenness and makes it holess in all my life I can assure you Church of the Living God in your sorrow Christ will be your joy in your storm he will be your Refuge when friends walk away from you he will be your friend and you can say I am unhe hurt by the supernatural all of us have had crushing times we've all had moments of Despair we've all had moments of Doubt whether you want to say man to it or not you all had moments of Doubt we've all had those moments that like why'd God take them home why didn't he take that one home instead of this one that's what Papa Charlie said to us after tiny passed away he said I prayed to God God would have took me instead of her he would just he was just moly grubbing around about it kept saying it day in and day out dad finally had enough of it he said he said Dad we prayed the same thing literally why you asked you how many times why did God take this one home why didn't he take that Bootlegger home instead of a Christian real saintly woman a woman that believed him why did he take her home why' I have to get sick why' I have to go through all of that I me come on why's brother Ron going what going through what he's going through why did this one hurt me why'd this one take my seat why is the air condition running too fast why is the music too loud am I hitting anybody in here tonight why can't they see it the way I see it why can't I be healed like this one why haven't I received the Holy Ghost yet if they received it why do I keep falling why do I keep making mistakes why why let me just be very clear to you all of these things I've just spoke to you these are not moments that you post on on social media right he honestly you want to see what somebody posts on social media they post all the good things I went for a hike today and I went 12 miles but they don't post that they seen the waterfall because they fell down a 40ft cliff they don't post the scars they don't look at that I messed it up my face I messed up I messed up I messed up the money maker they don't they don't post bad things literally did you imagine the the children or you can imagine the boy in John chapter n who sent here the mother of the father I highly doubt that if this blind man in John chapter n was taken selfy saying bless God I'm blind again [Music] today I mean really how many of you that have social media post all the bad things that happened I now don't everybody raise your hand well I'm going to start posting he said I don't post those things so I guess I let me just prove this to you people are not what they suppos to [Music] be but literally why why do we post why do we why do we major on the major things we don't I'm to be honest we don't to be honest you're going to going to forget about this service you're going to be like man why didn't we have some jumping screaming and shouting tonight I was really looking for it Zoe said before church she wanted to dance tonight and if I got people dancing after this service praise God you know it was God but literally we focus on the good things instead of the bad things that's human nature people got mad at us when brother Ron was laying in the hospital people literally got mad at us because we stood there wait we had that thing called Karen Bridge at that time and we was posting out brother Ron had a good day today brother Ron's doing well every day he's living by Grace we were posting those Saint people were mad at us when they showed up there and brother Ron looked like a burn victim but ain't a Christian supposed to speak from Faith aren't you supposed to see what you're wanting to see instead of the things that you're seeing are are you with me tonight that man I'd say that man in John chapter n never went back to saying I'm blind and posting selfies bless God I'm blind again I'd say from that day forward he was saying thank God I'm Healed I'm not blind no more I met Jesus and Hallelujah there are going to be some times in your life when you don't feel like shouting but that's the time to shout there's going to be some time in your life when your business is on the bank Brinks of bankruptcy but you still got to bless God there's going to be some times in your life when you can't pay your ties but you better pay your tie there's going to be some times in your life when everybody has got their knife out and ready to stab you in the back but at that time David say I Will Bless You Lord at all times Paul said in second Corinthians 4 and8 we are troubled on every side who's Paul talking about Christians we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed overwhelm my life but I'm going to make it I got chaos in my family but I'm going to make it no one wants a no one wants their heart broke no one wants to be crushed by life no one wants to be on the other end of the phone when the doctor says I I'd like for you to come in I'd like to talk to you about your test results in person nobody wants to be the person that the principal or the teacher writes writes the parent says your child is a troubled child or they're failing nobody wants to be that person nobody wants to be the person that the people that you love turn and hold their heart where you can't love them no more no one wants to be that no one can explain what it's like to feel so utterly incapable and un unable and Afraid like Jesus because when Jesus goes to a spot that he's been many times he's been there with his friends and his friends couldn't stay awake with him so it's proof that if friends couldn't hang out with Jesus through all of his trials your friends can't hang out with you and all your trials your friends will go to sleep on you they say they got your back but they will go to sleep on you young people the only person that you can count on is Jesus come on somebody I'm not talking about I'm not talking about we're living we live right here right here in these moments all the time I realize that these are the highlights of your week these are the highlights of your week but it's these moments of victory that gets you through your despair come on somebody it was in the moments when they were watching Jesus be beat that they remembered that he that he had the power to raise from the dead so what am I saying to you that in your hurts realize that you can be unheard by the supernatural Jesus had been here with his friends he goes to the Mount of Olives where JW Judas knew that he'd been there often times and Jesus prays in MA or Mark 14 and 34 brother Chris he prays this and said my soul is overwhelmed by death he he begins to pray this kind of prayer he's under so much pain that scientist explain it that Jesus was literally dying from a broken heart because the only time that this can transpire that sweat turns into blood is when you die from a broken heart and here Judas is in the garden of olives with Jesus with Jesus and he's turning him over he's turning him over brother Bram says and lean not to thine own understanding he said Judas thought that Jesus could get himself out of it because he lean to his own understanding this is a significant spot because this is a spot of the crushing of the Olive and you think wow that's a beautiful olive tree that's a beautiful it's a beautiful it's a beautiful nut it's a beautiful fruit it's a beautiful life but the real beauty is not expressed until it goes through the crushing your real Beauty as a Christian life is not seen in in public but it's watched in private when you're all alone and you have to prove whether you're a Christian or not you can't see your real Beauty until you go through some crushing times I don't believe that any of us signed up to be Christians just to have just to have complete we we didn't sign up thinking that we're going to we're going to go through life and never have calamities and never have problems but it's literally in the crushing of the olive that literally the most beauty that the crushing is the way of preservation for the Olive that it's also the way to get what is most valuable out of that Olive what does God think about you as a church that he would send you as a church through all of these things with brother Homer through all these things with brother Ron all these things that you've dealt with I'm not just excluding I'm just I'm preaching to you anybody else that hears this on the stream they've got their own problems that they they've been crushed by but what does God think about you that you've stood here and you watched a man fall out of a tree stand get get ran over by get ran over by a ran over by a tractor lose his leg sit here in a in a wheelchair and preach to you be therefore ready what is God think about you as a church that you can handle the crushing that in the crushing it brings forth the real value let me let me just let me just stop right there on that moment brother Homer was a testament to this church and to all of the Bride of Jesus Christ that he lived out the words that Paul said in Romans 8 and 38 that I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come nor angels nor principalities no powers that nothing shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus when he stood here when he stood here when he was in pain that he broke all of the bones in his hip when he sat here in a wheelchair and his leg was cut off he said I am persuaded that this gospel is more valuable than the hurt that I've been through Homer Fraser was a testament to say I am persuaded I've been hurt but I'm going to still preach I've been bruised but I'm still going to testify I've been broken but in my Brokenness the crushing is not the end of the story you might look at the crushing of the olive as the end of its life but I want to say this to you it's not the end of the story and Satan would like to whisper to you that even though you may have been sick and you got this and it looks like you're going to die with it and you got this trouble that Satan would like to whisper in your ear and tell you that your story is over but I want to announce to all of Hell your story is not over Lazarus this sickness is not into death this is going to be Jesus's greatest Miracle one of his best Miracles but it's going to be his most questioned when you look at your life sister Brenda you are one of God's best Miracles but by the people that know Lazarus it's going to be the most question are you with me are you with me Brother Sam you're one of God's greatest Miracles but it's going to be one of the most questioned it's because the enemy will always whisper that your story is over but Lazarus I want to to say this to you your story is not over it's just beginning come on somebody there are going to be people that say why didn't you show up here why didn't you show up on this time why didn't you show up on this day when Jesus is late he's still on time come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah come on Lazarus you don't realize what's coming your way but you're story ain't over you might have gone through death you might have gone through sickness but Jesus is on his way for one of his greatest Miracles what he had to do to Lazarus he had to make him Undead he had to make him new again Devon what he do to you he un hurts you by the supernatural come on brother Jordan you had some real hurts you had to leave family you had to leave all that you knew to come out to serve the God that was not a dead God but a living God and we look at your life the Martins are a pillar in this church but it did not come overnight [Applause] come on somebody you didn't get where you are overnight you battled through it you prayed through it you cried through it you went through it but you're still here un hurt free from wounds by the supernatural brother I'm not going to spend long right here I'm not going to be much longer at all brother maram says he said before you can be in the Hall of Fame you got to go through the Hall of critics he said before you can be in a Rapture you got to go through criticism he said they're going to say everything about you they're going to call you Holy Roller he said but if a person but if You Can Only Hold Your Position in Christ he said then someday he'll take us into the Hall of Fame you see a lot of people can't stand it they can't stand to go through that Hall critics they can't stand to go through it when anybody can enjoy being accepted but receiving rejection if you're going to go into the Hall of Fame with God you got to go through some criticism you got to go through some moments when when people don't think you're good enough when people don't look like when people look down upon you but Paul finished out the chapter of 2 Corinthians 4:17 said for our lot of fiction is but for a moment it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not of the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal you you go to watching the Chicago campaign brother Mar starts dealing with a starts dealing with a lady he comes up he comes up before this lady and he tells he tells her he said he said it's a lie been told on you he said there's a dark shadow he said it's a lie been told on you he said and it was a preacher that said that over you that said you had a wit that you were a witch he said that wasn't nothing but a lie he said you had all this nervousness he said that wasn't nothing but a lie he said go he said you're you're free from that it's amazing what people hold over you it's amazing the complexes that people live under because of what somebody else said Hallelujah you there sometimes you're hurt and you don't even know why you're hurt sometimes you carry things and you don't even realize you carry them there are things that you go through I was reading today when brother Brandon when brother Brandon was talking he was talking to a patient he said he said you have a very serious nervous condition he said you have a very serious nervous condition he say very serious and he said he said that's not all he said he said I see you he said you cut your hand with a buzz saw he said he said what he did he cut those nerves in there he said he cut those nerves in there he said but he said but go home you'll be made well right now you see that man didn't realize what caused the ner nervousness but because of a of a prophetic word it went into the regions of his spirit and it brought out the things that was afflicting him that caused a nervousness in his Spirit Isaiah said for thus saith the high Isaiah 57- 15 for thus sayith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite crushed humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for I will not contend forever neither will I be always WTH for the spirit should fail before me and the Souls which I have made for the iniquity of his covet this was I Roth and smote him and I hid me and I was wroth and he went forwardly in the way of his heart I have seen his ways and will heal him I will lead him also and restore Comforts unto him and to his mourners what are them scripture saying to us brother Andrew that you are un hurt by the supernatural you might miss God and you might miss your opportunity and you might feel like God let you down but I want to tell you that God will not miss you he will not allow your healing to roll off on somebody else when it's your healing you may have been disappointed in people but you'll never be disappointed in God you may have been abused by people but you'll never be abused by God you may have been broken by your father or by your friends but you'll never be broken by our Lord Jesus Christ if it's for you God will not allow it to miss because brother Bram was dealing with a lady one time he said there's a lady sitting back there with your hands up an elderly he said you got a pocketbook laying on your lap he said Do you believe me to be his Prophet you haven't got a prayer card I see you you believe with all your heart thank you that's what the angel said if you believe me he said now you look straight to me you're straight in front of me yes you're suffering with a nervous condition is

disappointed recently let's see when you were disappointed in this meeting last night you were disappointed in this meeting last night if I had made another call you had a prayer card last night and you didn't get one tonight how many times do we show up here on Saturday and we get disappointed but God still finds you on [Music] Sunday you were disappointed and you didn't get one tonight is that

love the Lord Jesus do you you believe you're healed you are God can't do nothing for you unless you believe him you're healed you are stand upon your feet just a minute as a testimony now go home you've been all nervous and shook up and everything you're going home to Meade well I sat with a I sat with a I sat with a pastor that had been that had gone through let me just had gone through some real trouble had went through some real hurtful things because sometimes there's sometimes that people that when you begin to see a young Minister rise up there you begin to see you begin to see people of old old the Elders of the church they begin to get a little sometimes that's not the case here never has been the case here brother Homer and brother Ron were very gracious to give me give me ample opportunity and actually put me put me in a position that I could be mentored by them they were they weren't jealous of my gift they weren't jealous over me they they literally wanted to see the supernatural take place they were very gracious but I I was I was speaking to this this individual and he was so hurt by the elders he was he was so hurt and there was some things that were said and he he he he he was just there was some things there that he he completely decided I'm giving up on the ministry I'm not going to preach no more I'm not going to do these things but in a moment it come to a spot where where they were where where they had come to a meeting and he literally said these words I forgive you and the Holy Spirit fell in that place and simply it was said that it was a supernatural element of the third pole that broke that broke the situation literally forgiveness is the key to unhe hurting and unchaining your situation you say well I want to have the faith of the third poor of Mark 11:22 of have faith in God speak to this mountain just read down and what's connected to Faith forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness if you can't forgive your brother then how can can your father forgive you how can you have Mountain Moving faith if you cannot forgive your brother or your sister I don't know if you remember this or recall this but brother Wayne Lawson stood here on July the 3 2022 and he stood here and he said he said of a poll of all the message churches that I've been to all over all over the world all over the all over the all over the US and all over the different countries that he' been in he said if you take the poll he said the most most damaging spirit in the message is the spirit of unforgiveness it's amazing when you don't allow things to let go let me say this to you let it go if you have been suffering with with thoughts of well my daddy died of this I guess I'm going to die with that or maybe you have suffered well there's cancer in my family I guess I'll have to deal with cancer I want to say this to you let it go if you have dealt with things in your past and you feel like you can't forgive yourself because of the mistakes that you fell in I want to say this to you let it go if you are living under the shadow of Satan's snare and he set a track for you William brandham said that repentance got you out of the Trap of the devil if Satan can hold you under that kind of a trap to make you think that you're still trapped all you have to do is say God I completely turn away from that which I was and you become Unchained by the anointing I want to say Let it go Let it go we got a Rapture take Let it go Let it go Let it go you may have made some mistake I want to say this to you let it go because the Book of Micah tells us that my enemy when he rises against me and he says things about me he said if I he said when I fall I will rise again it's not it's not if I fall but when I fall I will rise again and you may have failed today but get back up you need to rise with the same per per perseverance that Paul had that I am persuaded that I am persuaded that neither death nor cancer nor troubles or life are going to be able to separate me from the love of God I'm not going to let bitterness stay in my way I'm not going to let calamities I'm not going to allow the things of others stand in my way I refuse I refuse to allow the devil to bring a snare of entrapment of just a mind battle and keep me from my Liberty brother Ron I'm I'm closing with this my brother Ron was was given a word he was given a word in the midst of in the midst of his battle you have the capacity to handle or I would not have given you the battle that you're in I'm thankful that I don't have brother Ron's battle I'll be glad I I'll be honest I'm glad I don't have your battle because God knows how much you can bear and how much you can handle but he's given you a capacity to handle all of the trials of the critics of the circumstances of the chaos and you are built to rise above it all 38 years laying at a hospital 38 years of chances that had missed him he'd watched the angel move he'd been in Supernatural moments I'm going to bring it real personal and I'm I'm completely closing with this all but I I don't want the musicians just to come real quick I want you to I want you to be real attentive right here 38 years of being where the angel was 38 years why watching it come time and time watching it come weekend after weekend watching the spirit of God move on this one watching to move on that one watching the holy ghost live in them and watching them get up out of the hospital bit and go home 38 years of why 38 years of Why Not Me 38 years of am I not good enough I don't have friends to help me get in this you may have been sitting here for 38 years and you may have been hurt you may have been broke you may have even criticized whether it really was the angel or not maybe it was some just some kind of earthquake that caused it maybe it was brother Andrew pouring out some Gatorade back there and all the people getting hyped maybe he had a conspiracy just talking to these it seems like it's always the same ones it always gets a blessing 38 years of sitting here wondering why not me I want to say this to you Jesus has come to your heart hospital room to let you loose amen he's come to let you loose you may have been hurt but if you'll just allow yourself to have a conversation with the one that was doing the trouble in anyway you can leave this building unheard by the supernatural you can leave here well my daddy did me wrong and my mama did me wrong and this one done me wrong and I'm not going to get married and I'm not going to have a husband because I witnessed somebody in my family beat on my mama and you built up a complex and I'm not going to get married because some man will beat me like that you can leave here unhe hurt unscathed free from wounds by the Supernatural and let me say this to you when he gets done with you at this hospital room he's going to say to you don't go back to them thoughts pick up your bed and go back home leave your problems here when the woman at the well had complex after complex had been hurt after hurt she didn't just leave her water pot at the well brother Shannon she left her hurts she left her pains at the well because she didn't need it no more I say unto you rise up and walk now let the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah you go through life and you you see car wrecks happen and you think that could have been me tiny was always the kind of person it must be her night I keep calling her name tiny was always a person if Dad's if Dad's flight was late but God seen that that plane was going to wreck you know she was always she was always looking at things like like that but you literally you you begin to think about the supernatural elements that that is involving all of your life like we're boys we're just we're just Farm boys and we just we just do stuff sometimes you just do stupid stuff don't even think about it you think I think about the times that I think about the times that me TJ and M created basically human catapults and basically flung oursel across a creek because of strapping trees and different things of that nature you imagine all the things that you've been through and you're still here that's just a natural thing but you think about all the calamities of of life and you're still here I remember one time we were tearing down some pallet racking while we was tearing
