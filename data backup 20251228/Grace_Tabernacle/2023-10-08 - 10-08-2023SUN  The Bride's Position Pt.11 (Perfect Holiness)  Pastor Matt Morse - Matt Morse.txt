body to be able to sing praises unto him and gave us the ability to be able to come here this morning and and to dedicate our hearts and our lives to to him again and I just I don't think it's a burden I think it's a privilege amen I don't I don't do it just to uh because I have to I do it because I want to amen I love the Lord amen and we just want to Bow our heads this morning and we have a prayer request for sister uh Sharon Barnhill asking for prayer also remember uh brother Jim and my sister Sandy and at home and I know she really wants to come to the service I went and visited with them this week and she said you know she watches the services online but ain't the same as being there so but we just trust that the Lord would make a way uh that be able to be in service also brother Randle is still recovering so just want to remember them in prayer if you have a need on your heart this morning just go before the Lord maybe lift your hand and won't each one just pray by some for somebody that's near you just have them on your heart this morning and I know we we often see our own needs and pray for oursel but maybe there's somebody by you that really needs a touch from the Lord and and won't we just pray for them amen that the Lord will come by and speak to every heart amen let's just pray together gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and Lord how we realize the weakness of our flesh that we come to today Lord just to just to hear your word and Lord to get into your presence again and Lord realize that we are a a people that have needs and weaknesses and faults and all the things that goes along with the flesh that we live in but Lord we come to rely on you this morning Lord knowing that you know all things Lord you know every sickness every problem every trial every battle that every believer faces and Lord you know those that aren't even Believers Lord maybe those that are listening to this service maybe Sinners that are watching and Lord but we ask Lord that you would speak to every heart Lord that knowing that when we leave this place that we would leave changed God that something would happen in our heart that we would draw closer to you and Lord that we would give our life over to you and Lord that we would leave this place and and everything that has been done or said Lord would be pleasing unto you Lord I pray that you would move about this building Lord I pray you would meet every need you would speak to every heart Lord and we'll be careful to give you the glory for what you do and in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the second book of Corinthians in the 7th chapter and we'll start in the 10th verse so 2 Corinthians 7 and the 10th verse and give you just a moment to get there how many's looking forward to the meetings amen and they're bringing the tent out this afternoon to get that set up and uh just can't wait to to be able to get there we have the uh we're going to work on to I guess guess this afternoon some are kind of helping get that uh going and then also uh uh tomorrow and uh just just making a way to have it we have people coming from a lot of different states and so we're looking forward to a real outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen I just always come expecting a move of God Amen I believe that believe that's the way we ought to approach every Service uh I believe we come this morning for the same purpose we come expecting God to move and to speak how many expect God to speak to your heart amen I believe that you do or you wouldn't be here I believe that's your purpose of being here is you have confidence not in a man but that we can get out of the way and allow God to speak to us amen that ought to be our desire I want to speak from 2 Corinthians out of the seventh chapter and we're going to read from the first verse Paul said having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God and would us ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word and I want to speak this morning on a subject we've been preaching on a on a series of the bride's position and uh and I want to have a sub text this morning on a perfect Holiness a perfect Holiness uh I hope this has been a blessing to you we've been uh speaking on this along these this series on the position of the bride and and I hopefully that uh that that that you've seen the connection in it if you've been listening to each service that uh that there was a purpose of that the purpose of it I I'm not uh preaching this just to uh to have a series or look like I'm important or something like that or to uh have no motive that way at all but uh but there's really a connection that the Lord has been uh just opening up to my heart and and the the very purpose of it just to speak my heart this morning is is to bring people into their position in Christ I believe that's where we all must be and so uh it has to be preached or people can't get there that's the way we get to get to our place but said see what God is trying to do he's trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through and say there is my spirit flowing freely there it is he said now then I can work and then he'll go and he'll get another one and over there and he'll Place him and so then he'll go brother Jared and get another one and place him and another one and place her and and the whole entire time God has building up a people that he can work through and speak through and and manifest himself through brother R said this is what the uh this is uh the purpose of God it's adoption and placing and manifestation and uh you this is what the Bible says brother Mark it says that all creation is waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God so we've been uh speaking on this uh series for that very purpose to bring people into their position in Christ I I don't know the saddest thing that you ever see is people that live below their privilege can you imagine having having a few million dollars in the bank and not knowing how to write a check it'd be a sad thing to know that you had access to the funds but you was living in broke and living in poverty and the and the whole time you had access to uh to to funds and so we just want to be able to be in our position and recognize who we are and be able to take the checkbook that God has given us and write it for what we have need of him so in this series of the bride's position we started out with uh having power over the devil or that the bride's position was over the devil but under God how many remember that when we started it was because we were subject to the word that's what gave the church power we went through all these different parts of of the purpose of God and the life of Joseph and went through all how God would would bring you through to get you to the place that he wanted to he'll you know he'll do whatever it takes we we spoke on the king's invitation and how that the only way you can come to this position is if you were invited to it so it isn't just everybody uh that can that can have it but God invited you so we have a we have a reason to be here this morning and you say well how how would it be done then I spoke on by my spirit sayeth the Lord not by might or by power but only by the spirit of God and and went through how that it was paid for the price of redemption through the Book of Ruth and how that he that he purchased possession to bring her into a place it wasn't for it wasn't that he paid for it all brother Mark to get the land or to or to just redeem the Earth but he wanted the bride that was in the earth and so uh you know as we went through this down to the last service and uh on the last service we were speaking on the bride being the Overcomers of leot DEA this was two Sundays ago and and so he took that direction of of being an overcomer and and had went through how that we had returned back into the land and in this land it was filled with the promises of God and and we received those promises so I know I'm just kind of giving a background because it's been a few days but how many remember the promises that God had made us so remember it was the Overcomers of laod DEA they would receive a promise how many how many recognizes that you're those people that God has given you a promise in this day and so we preached on this last time of how that he said I'll make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall he shall no more go out I ride up on them the the name of God they'll be clothed in white rment I'll will not blot their name out of the book of life I will confess his name before the father and before the angels I will give him a white stone and on that stone a new name written so if your name was bad it's okay he said I'll write them a new name it was it was Mrs Jesus Christ they would take on the character of Christ so it wouldn't be by your own flesh or by your own failures but it was the but but it was his fa it was his flesh it was his life that that was given for you he said I'll give them power over the Nations I will give them a Morning Star you should not be hurt of the second death I say Amen to that he'll give you to feed of hidden Mana he'll give you to eat of the tree of life that was in the paradise of God the very that that Adam had lost he would return to the church in this last day and then finally he said I will grant to him to sit with me in my Throne he that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne and brother martin these promises they weren't just for they weren't just put out there for for for some great body or something like that but they were promises to individuals how many say Amen to that it was promis proes to individuals it was you and I how many how many could put your name there this morning and look at the promises of God and say that was designed purposely for me can you can you think of that brother Tom that when God wrote this and he had it on his mind and he came down and put the V the vision in the heart of a prophet that was laying on the aisle of patmas and he was praying and God gave him that Vision he gave the vision with your name on his mind he said this is the promise for Jared hams this is the promise for Travis ker this is the promise for Wesley this is the promise for David M this is a a promise for Ronnie mansfi this is this is a promise for you it was a personal promise an individual promise to you and I but after preaching on these promises as I was praying about the service this coming week I came across this uh the scripture the Lord just opened this up to me and after preaching on all these promises it brought me to this place where Apostle Paul says he says having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God it brought me to this part this is the bride's position is a perfect Holiness here you know whenever you go to speaking on Holiness you realize there's two sides to Holiness or maybe many sides but but there's one group that'll tell you that there like the Pharisees that they were in the days of Jesus and they and they they dressed everything right they wore everything on the outward outward appar was just right brother Mark the robes went down to the ground the bells were in the right place they walk they walked according to the to the law of God and many today will do the same thing and if they can get you dress right they think you're okay and if they can get you to look right on the outside well then they think you're okay and and but but just as the Pharisees that just wasn't enough and then there was another group that says well it don't matter how you live as long as you just accept Christ and and because you have Christ well then you're holy and you can you can live any way and you can you can dress any way and them other people are legalist and so you see there's a there's a Far Side one way and then there's a Far Side the other and and ain't neither one of them right and you know and I I think about how the world has gotten today and how that that Holy H is a thing of the past it's something that's old natured it's something that's oldfashioned and and you realize that the world today has replaced Holiness with religion and they they've replaced Holiness with going to church and they've replaced Holiness with with being a part of a body of people or a part of a group and and they replaced Holiness with having a a priest or a bishop or a pastor or somebody that that they set as a hierarchy over their life and as long as that person accepts them well then God's going to accept them so it didn't matter how they lived and so they made men holy they made churches holy and theyve established these great holy movements and things like that but brother brma said like this he said see the almighty God The Great I Am he has come as a spirit to fill his true church and he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to he said that's why we don't make any holy men Among Us he said but the whole Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is he the holy spirit that is Holy it's not the congregation of itself you see so so rituals they'll never make you holy Holiness is an inward work brother Mark and it's expressed outwardly it's something that God is doing on the inside of a life and he expresses it on the outside of a life I know sometimes people they'll live years of their life they'll listen to messages and they'll go to church and they'll they'll listen to the preaching of the word and but they'll still yet do things that they know are wrong they'll come to church week in and week out and they'll go out of church and they'll do things wrong and they'll do things that they know that are not pleasing to God and and they know that are not according to the word and they use this very quote as a crutch and say well after all Holiness is an inward work and it's expressed outwardly so whenever God takes that desire that I'll quit doing it and and if God will deliver me when he wants me free of it then God's going to come and he's going to supernaturally he's going to take that out of my life and when God wants me to be free and he'll take that from me and when he wants me to be free he'll take this from me and when he wants me to be free he'll cause me to not have a desire from it anymore that but let me tell you something friends that God is not going to deliver you when God wants you to be free God is going to deliver you when you want to be free see there there's something that we have to do I think people have heard so much but the mark that they think they have nothing to do with it but isn't what Apostle Paul says he said let us cleanse ourselves it ain't just something that God's going to do but it takes us Paul said let us cleanse ourselves let me ask you this this morning what good is religion is there if there's no life to back it up what good is going to church if there's no life to back it up this is a the very human nature that we live in brother Mark misunderstands what to be holy even is they're waiting on God to do something but Paul said let us cleanse oursel see God has called the church to a place of Holiness he's called us to a place of Fellowship a place of true worship a place that we can fall in love with God again where you can look at yourself in the mirror and you realize that the very life of God that is living on the inside of you that that it supersedes even the mistakes that you make that's the life of a believer of a Christian but he called the church but it's up to the church to respond he called you as as an individual but it's up to you to respond we're not waiting on somebody else to tell us how to how to act and and how to conduct ourselves and but God is calling us and he's waiting on you to respond see to be holy means to be dedicated or consecrated to God it's a dedicated life a consecrated life to God I I remember when God Called Moses you remember the story the first time you see this great call of God all the way back whenever the children of Israel were tied up in in in in this land of Egypt and God had called Moses to come down and you remember whenever God or Moses is going out through the Wilderness and here he is walking alone and and and he and he comes out one day and he looks up on a mountain and he sees this this curious side of a bush that was burning with fire you remember as God called him he's about to call call him to go do a work for the Lord he's he's going to use him he's going to use the gift that's in his life and so God begins to call on him and when God calls him notice he takes him to a place of Holiness the very first place that Moses goes to is he comes to this place and the Lord says Moses take off your shoes for you are standing on Holy Ground isn't it something that when God was ready to use him brother Mark first he brought him to this holy place he brought him to a place that that that that was such a a holy place or this Holy Ground brother Mark it was so esteemed by men today watch the the nature of humanity not even understanding Holiness that today that you realize there's a monastery that actually sits near the bush where they believe that Moses went to in sin Egypt you can find it's called St Catherine's Monastery you can read about it but there this Monastery sits and they're protecting the actual Bush that was either the bush or the descendant of the Bush that Moses that God came and spoke to Moses on and they said well it's such a great Bush and it's a holy Bush and so they they've built this this way this is the nature of men you remember well on Mount Transfiguration when the disciples went up there with Jesus and and so when it they went there remember they saw Moses and Elijah and Jesus standing there remember he was transfigured before their face and into this great light and so remember they they had a desire we're going going to build three temples one for Moses and one for Elijah and one for Jesus and and so they they went out and all of a sudden they heard this great voice speak and said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him but the presence of God Brother David it was so strong that they fell on their face before the Lord they because of the presence of God brother Mark this became a holy place because God was there and all of a sudden as they fell on their face Jesus come and he and he said arise and be not afraid and he touched them and the Bible said when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man except Jesus only but remember whenever Peter goes speaking of this later and he gives testimony of it he said Remember the Holy Mountain remember what happened on the Holy Mountain isn't it something about the nature of men that they put a monastery on Moses's on the on the bush where Moses went to and said Remember the holy Bush isn't this something here Peter says remember the Holy Mountain this is just the nature of men but we realize that we're always trying to make something holy we always trying to make somebody holy or or something holy or some place holy but you realize that the mountain wasn't holy at all it wasn't a Holy Mountain the ground wasn't Holy Ground the bush wasn't a holy Bush the man wasn't a holy man you say but but God said it was Holy Ground but the only reason he said it is because the presence of God was there so we find out there ain't but one thing that is Holy and that's the god of Heaven that's why the angels of heaven are sitting around the throne today and they're crying out holy holy holy unto the Lord friends if you could tap into it this morning and you could hear the angels of God You' hear them crying holy they're crying all day today all night tonight holy holy holy before the Lord God Almighty he's the only one that is Holy in this flesh this flesh ain't never holy that mountain was never holy the ground was never holy the Bush was never holy the only thing holy about it is that God was present in that place and wherever God is is a holy Place friends I got news for you this morning he won't dwell in a dirty house hello somebody he won't dwell in a dirty house my I thought about this brother Mark if the presence of God can make ground Holy Ground you ever thought about it the presence of God could make dirt holy the can you imagine this old dirt it's the filthiest thing there is it's what your mama makes you wash off your hands whenever you go inside it's where all the dung and all the garbage and the filth of the world lands it's the filthiest thing there is if he can make dirt holy then what can he do with you you and I what can he do here this morning with a heart that is surrendered a ground Brother David that has no will has no willpower has has no desire and he could call it Holy Ground then what about a human being that surrenders to the will of God my I think this is so powerful this morning to think if the presence of God can make the dust of the ground Holy Ground that that dust of the ground that is that is made up of the elements of the world of oxygen and carbon and calcium and potassium and sodium and magnesium these are not these are not holy elements they're just the elements that God created the world with but he looked at it and he said take off your shoes for the ground you're standing on it's Holy Ground oh my isn't this something don't you know that whenever God made man in the beginning brother Wes I think this is wonderful when God created man the Bible says God made Man Out of the Dust of the ground I thought isn't it something that if he could look at that ground in the days of Moses the very same elements that are in that ground that Moses was walking on are the same elements that are in your human body today I thought my and if the presence of God can make that dirt holy then the presence of God can make this dirt holy if he can make that ground holy then what about this ground if you can make those elements holy what about these elements but what did he do he proved it in the days of Moses that it was Holy Ground you say well how did he prove it he proved it by the supernatural he proved it by there was a bush that was Burning Brother Martin that wasn't consumed see here God he came in and he dwelt in this place and he vind V ated his presence in that place by a bush that was burning that wasn't consumed isn't it something he vindicates by his presence by the supernatural but say see remember he said it had been very marvelous three and a half years in Jerusalem that had a Revival the great anticipations waiting upon the people on a man that the world and the church rejected the Lord Jesus he was considered a fanatic he said we'd call him today if we put it in our words we'd call him a Holy Roller my Jesus the Holy Roller we'd call him a Holy Roller he absolutely disagreed with their theology but yet God Vindicated that he was with him isn't that something Jesus the Holy Roller he disagreed with their theology but God Vindicated he was with him by the Supernatural That's why Peter would say he said you men of Israel you should have known he said for this Jesus of Nazareth was a man approved of God by you by signs and wonders watch how God vindicates that it was a holy place he vindicates Ates it was a Holy Ground by the supernatural Peter said see Jesus of Nazareth was approved of God among you by signs and wonders which God did by him in the midst of you all and you are all you know and are witnesses of but with Wicked hands you've crucified him you're Witnesses of it you all saw it you seen him when he hung on calvary's Cross you saw him when he was at Pilot's judgment Hall you saw as the people they they they they freed barabus and and and Let Jesus go to the Cross you all Witnesses of it and you saw it but Peter said but we're Witnesses of another thing he said for the Jesus hath God raised up and wherefore we are all Witnesses of his resurrection he said see you witnessed one thing but we've witnessed another he said you witnessed to crucifixion but I'm a witness to the resurrection you're a witness of his death but I'm a witness of his life friend let me tell you this morning I say to every critic and to every Challenger of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the critic Witnesses every backslid church member but I'm a witness when they came back to God you're a witness whenever they went out in the world but I'm a witness when they came down to the Altar and they repented of their sins and they gave their heart to God let me tell you it may look like a bunch of Unholy people to you it may look like people that fall and make mistakes but I'm a witness when they came back and they cleaned out their life and they poured their life out before God and God came and he filled a human body again I'm a witness of them coming home he said you saw one thing I saw another you witness part I witness another part see I think men are always limited on what they see but the way see they are blinded think of this today we are blinded by Society we are blinded by theologies we're blinded by by by Medias we're blinded by churches and rituals and all these things that men are so blinded by seeking to see the truth brother man said see but there's only one way to see the truth you remember in the day days of Jesus and Peter they were they were debating on the on the on the godhead in baptism and says see some group will say well I'll take what Jesus said and the other group said well I'll take what Peter said said see but if they were contrary one to another then what are we going to do if it ain't all God then what part of the Bible is right so it can't be contrary you can't say I'll take Peter and you say well I'll take Jesus you have to take the whole thing so if there's a contradiction then we've missed it somewhere we've missed the connection he say so it's got to all coincide and come together and only the revelation of God will do it our schools will never teach it it's a revelation that you must see it see it takes a revelation to see the things of God it takes a revelation and brother martin not all will see it for Jesus said it like this he said father I thank you you've hided these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but you revealed it unto babes that would receive see it takes a revelation to see the work of God remember when Jesus asked Peter that very question he said Peter who do men say that I am he said some say that you're Elijah or one of the prophets and you're a great man you're a minister you're all these wonderful things he said but Peter but who do you say that I am he said I say you're the Christ the son of the Living God do you realize that here were there were many men that walked side by side with Peter he sat down in the restaurant and he ate with him he went out fishing and he fished with him and many men saw the same man that Peter saw but some of them called him one thing and Peter called him another see it takes a revelation to recognize who Christ is he said you are the Son of God do you realize that the majority of the world today don't believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God but here's a body of people let me ask you this this morning Peter who do you say that I am I wonder if there's somebody this morning that had the Revelation that Peter had and say he was the he was Christ he was the son of the Living God he he wasn't just a man that was born of a woman he wasn't just a man that that that came from an act between Joseph and Mary but he was a man that was placed there by the Holy Ghost he was conceived by the Holy Ghost and he was formed in the womb of his mother for the very purpose of saving Humanity he's Christ the son of the Living God see but they can't all see it but think about what they what could they not see they couldn't see the age that they were living in they couldn't see modern events that were made known by prophecy here John the Baptist was a man that was laying over in a prison cell and they they couldn't even recognize who he was but Jesus began speaking about John here here they had him locked in prison because because of his ministry and because of his stand and and because it contradicted the way that they believed and and it kind of ruffled their feathers a little bit isn't it something about human nature when when somebody when they get when somebody gets on to you it makes you all ruffled up and and they'll quit going to church well I'm not going to talk to you no more or we'll just lock him in prison if we had the power to keep his mouth shut that's what they did to John CU they didn't like that kind of preaching so they locked him up and Jesus said who did you go out in the wilderness to see was it a re shaking in the wind a man clothed in soft rment what did you expect to see when you went there he said only King's houses do they dress in soft rment did you you go to see a prophet but I say to you he was more than a prophet he was the Fulfillment of Malachi the third chapter he was the very one that God said would come and and forerun the coming of Christ it is he whom is written he said and if you will receive it this is Elijah that was for to come he was a very fulfillment brother Mark you see why they had I may as well just sit here a minute I'm already here but you see why they had so much trouble recognizing that it was Elijah because his name was John here here Malachi said here Elijah shall come the Prophet Elijah shall come and here comes a man stomping out of the Wilderness what's your name my name's John well you can't be Elijah you don't even have the right name well even even a kindergartener can recognize that you aren't him but brother Mark they had a revelation that was missing they didn't recognize that it wasn't the name Elijah but it was the spirit of Elijah you remember when Elijah went up went up on the uh on on his work Elijah the tishby and he started his work for the Lord and he walked by Elisha plowing in a field and he called him to come and follow him Elisha throw down his plower and he got and he followed with Elijah and Elijah asked him he said what would I do to thee he said whenever you leave I want a double portion of what you have and Elijah said if you're with me when I go if you see me when I go he said that I'll give you a double portion and Elisha followed him and he served him and he walked all the rest of the days of Elijah you couldn't find Elijah that was separated from Elisha he served him he poured water over his hands he served him as a servant he seen the work of God moving in his life and when Elijah went up to heaven all of a sudden the Bible says but then the mantel of Elijah fell back on Elisha but you realize that what it was it was the very Spirit of Elijah he he didn't give him his name he gave him his Spirit the spirit of Elijah fell on Elisha in so much that when Elisha went back to the to the town that they came out of and he laid the mantle over across the river and the waters parted over the river the men up on the mountain said there comes Elijah back why' they call him Elijah even though it was Elisha because he was doing the works of Elijah his Spirit was so much that men couldn't even recognize who he was this is what they had missed even Jesus being there remember this is what the the prophet spoke of remember Isaiah he said a virgin shall conceive and you should should call his name Emmanuel he here but which was God With Us it wasn't the name it was the it was God With Us he should be called Emmanuel but his name was Jesus you see why they missed but Mark here here he said see John John sent these men or or John had was sin of God and then John in this place he sent these men to where Christ was to find out if he was the Messiah you see all the unanswered question he went to find out he said how are you the Messiah but notice how he was identified as the Christ Jesus didn't say yeah go tell him I'm him Jesus said go tell John what you saw see notice what God is doing vindicating by the supernatural you go tell him what you saw he said God Go and show John these things that you heard and see tell them the blind have received their sight tell them the lame are walking tell them the lepers are cleansed and the deaf here and the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached unto them is't that wonderful here Jesus is quoting the very prophecy concerning him John says is it you are you the Messiah is this the Christ y'all go find out if it's really him and he goes and he quotes the very fulfillment of the prophecy that was prophesied about him and said you go telling the blinds receiving their sight just like the prophecy said it would tell them the deaf are hearing and the lame are walking and the poor is getting the gospel preached to them it was the vindicating of Christ was the supernatural this was always Peter's stance remember when he was standing at Jerusalem he said God proved that that that was his beloved Son by signs and wonders that he did showing that God was with him this was Peter's stance God proved it we saw signs and wonders in his ministry we're Min we're Witnesses of it but do you realize that brother bam had the same stance that Peter had he said see remember there was a a message called the resurrected Lord Jesus he actually called calls the ministers out in the meeting he said you ministering brothers and the Believers he said but especially you ministering Brothers he said has there ever been a time in the church in the last 2,000 years as the church ever had a Revival or any time in the world that the church ever had a Revival that there was signs and wonders accompany in the Revival yes sir signs of a supernatural God living in the people that gives the people of you what hope do we have unless we know there's something Supernatural there's never been a time of Revival that there wasn't something Supernatural there's never been an outpouring of the Holy Ghost that there wasn't the supernatural he said the signs of the supernatural Living God living in the people that gives the people of view what hope do we have unless we know there is something Supernatural but W is that something here that God would come to give you a view I thought my isn't it isn't it wonderful he wouldn't leave you blinded he would he wouldn't leave you everybody couldn't see it everybody couldn't understand it but he said but God would come to give the people a view a view of what brother Mark a view of of the resurrection of Jesus Christ a review of eternal life a view of the supernatural a view of the power of God that God has coming this age to give the people a view and let me tell you what the devil's doing this morning he's fighting to obstruct your view I know I may be the only one here this morning but it's the truth Satan is fighting to obstruct your view I but I'll tell you what I think we need to look at the Devil and say get out of my way I remember one time I was sitting out we went out to visit the Grand Canyon and my what a view it was brother Jared we sat there and look at that beautiful Canyon and and my I was sitting down there on a rock and my just Tak it in the view of all of God's creation and how wonderful that it was and Lord and behold Here Comes this group of foreigners from some other uh respectful country and they came they came walking and and out of all the Grand Canyon of aund mile mile hundreds of miles of this rim of this Canyon they stopped right in front of me with their camera just to taking pictures I'm sitting back here by myself there's a hundred yards either side of me you can take a photo but right in the middle of my view is where they chose to take their picture and I sat there for a moment and they just all oo and all and taking their photo after a little bit I respectfully said kind sir you make a much better door than a window you're a terrible window huh I can't see through you you're obstructing my view can is there anywhere else I mean I got to get up and I got to take my backpack and put my stuff back in my pack and got to move over two feet so I can see the canyon because you want to stop right there and take your pictures you're obstructing my view friends that's what the devil's doing today he said God would send the supernatural to give the people a view you notice why that Satan's trying to keep the supernatural out he wants to obstruct your view he wants you he wants to dilute The View that you have of what God really is he wants to obstruct The View that that you have of eternal life he wants to to to hide the view brother Mah that you have of Eternity and of a of a supernatural and a miracle working God but I think as a people we ought to look at the Devil and say you make a Better Door than a window I ain't going to put up with it I I I don't have to allow the devil to block my view I I no longer will I let distractions get in the view that block me from being able to to be able to serve God no longer will I let an obstruction block my view and keep me from being able to serve God I want the Right View I want to see it all I want to see it all I I like a good view when I when I go stay at a hotel brother Joe I want the one with the balcony that overlooks the mountains they they ask you whenever you check in well do you want want a balcony view or do you want a street view ain't nobody wants a street view I want the balcony view I want to see the ocean I want I want to see the mountain I want to see the grander of what God has created and I'm willing to pay extra for it I Want A Room With a View let me tell you friends if you want the view you have to pay the price if you want the view you have to pay brother Mark you have to throw things out and do the extra but I say it's worth the extra price it's worth the sacrifice this morning to have the view God took a bush a ground and a mountain and it became a place of Holiness because of the presence of almighty God isn't it something it became a holy place that's what God does he takes nothing and he makes something is there something he takes nothing and he makes something remember the remember the blind man that didn't have he didn't even have eyes in a socket and Jesus took that dirt put it in his eye and gave him an eye see he takes nothing and makes something is there something I see brother Mark man can try to fix it all up but I don't want what man made I want what God does I don't want man handle dirt I want God handle dirt I don't want the man a man could take that ball of dirt it wasn't the it wasn't the flesh that done it it was the god that done it a man could take it and put it in a migan eye sockets it' never form an eye but if God does it one time he'll see and pick his color I don't want what man handled I want what God handled I don't want man-made church I don't want man-made Theology and man-made religion and man-made atmosphere ear and man-made Holiness I want the truth that comes from God says you say it's a holy church and a holy people he said no it's a holy God that's it it's a holy God right you said that's right it's an Unholy church and an Unholy people amen somebody we're an Unholy church and an Unholy people but we have a holy God said it ain't no such thing as a holy church it's a holy God in the church hello somebody that makes me want to shout out over this building it ain't no such a thing as a holy people or a holy church it's a holy God in the people it's a holy God in the church friends you'll never be holy without God it's not a holy people it's the holy ghost in the people thank you Lord my that makes me feel thank thank you Lord It's the holy ghost in the people you ain't ever worthy enough anyhow it's the holy ghost in the people then then you're talking not of people anymore but you're talking about the Holy Ghost my you're talking about the Holy Ghost that's in the people we're not talking about people anymore my is't that a is that a revelation we're not talking about people anymore we're talking about the Holy Ghost that's in the people says see we're not a holy people but God's holy but notice what Peter says he says but as he which hath called you is Holy so be you holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be you holy for I am Holy isn't this a oddd scripture the very same Life of Christ to live in you to make you a holy people how would you be be a a holy people well we realize it only by The Life of Christ he says see we must we must be holy for I am Holy this is a call of God friends this isn't brother Matt this is God's call be you holy for I am Holy you realize that's the call of God on your life be a holy people a consecrated people a dedicated people people that are that are that are consecrated to serving God all right a holy people set apart from the world a holy people tell you what this me in the Amplified Bible it makes this really good says but as one who has called you is Holy then you yourselves also be holy this word conversation means in all your conduct and your manner of living not just the things you say but the way you act and the way you live the way you conduct yourself and the conversations you have he said be as the one that has called you as holy be ye holy all conduct and manner of living you say brother man how can I be holy well there ain't but one way to be holy and that's by the spirit of God a place where God could dwell brother bham called it our token he said the spirit of God it's your token it's the only access we have to God it's the only access we have to the blessings of God when you go to pray to God and you want the Lord to answer your prayer that's the only way you'll ever get God to answer your prayer is to have the token and apply it with the prayer it's our payment it's the very thing that God has given us as a body of Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ it's the answer to every question if you the healing that we need in our body it's the answer salvation it's our body brother Mark the very or it's the answer in order for us to even make a Rapture it's the only way we'll ever make a Rapture said it's our token it's the spirit of God he says so then when you pray you must have the token and present the token with your prayer it's the holy spirit it's the it's the portion that God gave you it's where God broke himself off in the in the upper room remember he poured out upon them the little licks of fire he sent his Spirit to dwell in the heart of men he say see it's your token he said so when you pray you must have the token and present it with your prayers and say now I believe he said I now believe for ourself and apply the token to the whole family just like they did whenever whenever Paul uh told the Roman Centurion believe thou and all of thy house shall be saved he said apply it to your family if you have an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him and say Lord God I claim him in the name of Jesus Christ and you stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay the token on them and say Lord God I claim them it's our token for the mark that your life is a holy life it's the very thing that God has given as a Vindication that he has accepted you as a Believer he said you take that token and you apply it to every request that you have you wonder why people go around and wonder if God even hears them and don't answer their prayer and they can't even hardly pray enough to God to even can even hear what they're saying but brother Mark but God has given us a token to apply he said live a life live a life that is worthy of the gospel live a life that is Holy live a life where where you can have the token of God upon your life and then you can take that token and use it it is there just to take up space it's made there to be used he said but we've got to use it take our token and lay it upon those that are lost and say Lord God I claim it friends let me tell you it don't matter what your need is this morning if you'll take the token that God has given you and lay it upon your knee that's where God will answer your prayer he said that's what we have to do we have to move out of all the worldly trash we have to move it out of our house and get ready where God can move we have to burn up our shorts and throw away your C tables and get rid of your cigarettes and dump your unbelief and all your church papers in the trash cam where they belong then you're getting ready and then what do you do you apply the token in prayer with a real evidence and a real faith and you apply it with confidence and when you apply the token you know you're cleaned up and then the scripture must be fulfilled for the Bible says if our hearts condemn us not then we shall have our request see when the token is applied to your life then you shall have your request see you realize friends that it's God's desire to give you my I feel the presence of the Lord this morning it's God's desire to give you the desires of your heart how many knows that God's desire is to give you the desires of your heart he said it in his word he wants you to have what you want to have but God wants to change your desire right mark his desire is to Grant your request but it takes a commitment from you it takes a life from you it takes a real commitment to be a to be a believer and to be a and to be a servant of the Lord and a real commitment he'll Grant you request he wants to but it'll take your commitment he wants to give to you but it'll take your commitment he wants to pour all the the the the blessings and the and the the joy of Heaven upon your life but it'll take your commitment I wonder how many here the call of God this morning and can heed to it I'm going to hurry and close just a few minutes how many hear the call of God and can heed to it how many raise your hand say I've hear heard the call of God let me heed to it God's calling at your heart think of this friends see you can't you can't come to God if you don't first hear we're talking about perfecting Holiness so if somebody told you something well maybe you didn't hear it the first time but you let the spirit of the Lord begin to move and Minister something to your your heart and then you hear it say see when you hear it you have to first hear before you can come that's what Jesus said he said every man therefore hath heard Heath learned of the father cometh unto me says so first he heard then he came what do you do when you come brother Mark is you pour your life out before God you empty out you become a an empty vessel you you take the things the the desires of the Flesh and your self- will and you pour them out before God and all the things that you know ain't wrong everything that condemns you and you poured out before God so you come you hear then you come then you give then you receive isn't that what happened to that little widow woman that day remember she was out there Gathering up sticks and here the Prophet Elijah came down where by where she was and the Bible says Elijah called unto her he said lady he said go and get a morsel of bread and come to me she heard she came she gave then she received even though she didn't have no food Brother David enough to even feed her own son and she she said that's the last meal we'll eat and we'll die but she heard and she came and she gave all that she had look what the look what she received her meal Barrel never ran dry in the midst of a famine when everybody else was starving and the people next door and all the neighbors over there and they didn't know where to turn here was a woman whose meal Barrel never ran dry you say brother Matt why did it not run dry because she heard and she came and she gave and she received friends it's a promise of God it don't matter you say well she was a poor woman God was trying to help it don't matter if you're rich or poor when you hear the call of God and you come to God and you pour everything out and you give to God you can't help but receive from God that's what happened with the queen of South she wasn't no poor lady she had everything she was a queen over the great land of the South and the Bible would tell us about her her great Kingdom and and how much she was and but you realize that this woman even though she was a queen she wasn't where God wanted her to be she had great wealth she was was respected she was a she was a great Queen had a had a great Kingdom but there was something missing in her life the Bible says listen glory to God the Bible says but she heard about Solomon she heard of Solomon she heard of this you realize that it wasn't just the it wasn't just Solomon or the riches of Solomon or the kingdom of Solomon but brother Mark what she heard actually steered the heart of a queen can you can you get in her position this morning and think of her sitting there and hearing reports and something began to steer in her heart but notice what it was she heard the Bible said in First Kings 1:1 it says she heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she didn't just hear about how great Solomon was and how big a kingdom he had and how big his Palace was and how much money he had but brother Mar she heard of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she heard about the God of Solomon she heard how he worshiped she heard how the temple was built she heard about how a king like Solomon brother Mark that would that would go down before his people as a great man but he had the humility to get down on his knees before a God that was greater a man that wasn't afraid to worship he was a he was a man that in his kingdom that that that was that was that was built just the way God wanted it brother Mark where the presence of the Lord could be there she heard about these things and she came the Bible says that she came because she heard this you remember how the the kingdom of Solomon was had to go through it remember how when the temple was built and then after the the temple was built Solomon built it just according to the way God wanted it built the things that God didn't want there Solomon put them out the things that God wanted there Solomon brought them in he built the altar just the way God wanted the altar he built he built the the candlesticks the way God wanted them he built the walls the way God wanted them he built the every part of the temple of God was built the exact way that God told Solomon to build it and after the Solomon got done building he be to turn and he be to bless God in the temple and said oh God we've done everything according to Thy word don't you see friends he put everything out he put everything that that didn't belong he put it out he made a place that God would be pleased to dwell he said God he turned and and begin to bless God we've done everything you've asked us to do you're the Creator you're the great God now here our request oh Lord God of Israel there's no God like thee in Heaven and Earth which keep as your word and you show Mercy unto your servants that walk before thee with all their hearts oh god of Israel now let Thy word be verified let you let Thy word be Vindicated that what I've done is pleasing unto thee brother Mark she heard about how Solomon had put everything out and created a place that would be pleasing to God and notice what God did he came into that Temple and he Vindicated it by the supernatural brother Mark the Bible said that out of the heavens came a fire of God that fell in the house of God and he filled the temple with the glory of God it became a place of worship a place that was filled with the spirit of God Solomon done all the work that he was supposed to do and then God heard his request and he granted it and he Vindicated it it was his work by Supernatural work in the temple I thought my isn't it something this is what the queen had heard about the blessings of God and the fire of God fallen in the temple and how that God was a god of healing and forgiveness and she had a desire for the Wesley to experience a supernatural God that's what brought the Queen of Sheba to Solomon she had a desire to see a supernatural God she no doubt she had her own Gods many gods that the world has but she had a desire to meet that God so she packed up she didn't go to criticize she didn't go to prove him wrong she didn't go so she can find something wrong with every service or find something wrong with every person but she went for one one reason to get in the presence of the king she heard of the famous Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she went to see for herself amen and the Bible says when she came brother Mark she didn't go empty-handed glory to God she didn't go empty-handed she filled up her camel trains with gold and spices and precious stones and she went to Solomon and brother Mark when she came to Solomon in the presence of Solomon notice what she saw the Bible says she saw Solomon's wisdom she saw the house that he built she saw the meat on his table the way his servant sat see saw the the attendants of his ministers saw their apparel what they were wearing she saw the cup bearers she saw even the ascent the way they went into and exited the temple it was a holy place she saw this Brother David the Bible says think of it even the way that even the way they went into the house of God is't it something what she saw Solomon had to built it in a way that was pleasing to God that's what we we try to do here we want to build a place that is pleasing to God that whenever somebody would come in that they would see even the way the children walk into the house of God there's something about it they don't they don't they're not coming in to disrupt service people aren't sitting around and just talking like the world has made the the churches today where they're just a big a place of talking and and drinking coffee in the sanctuary and talking to one another you said well we would never do that but but people they just make a mockery out of the sanctuary of God and eating candy and drinking sodas and and chewing bubble gum and just a it's just a big joke to even be in the house of God there ain't nothing consecrated to God but in the temple of Solomon it wasn't that way and the queen recognized it it was a place that was dedicated to God it wasn't a place there wasn't people in there having picnics for their kids yeah let me tell you what I think happened if the kids got hungry I think the masama kindly got the little children and they took them back to the nursery and sh they fed them there it was a designated place outside cuz this was a designated place for something else it wasn't a picnic ground it was the temple of God and she saw it and she recognized it and she desired to have the god that Solomon served the Bible says when she saw it there was no more spirit in her she saw you say what did she see she saw the Holiness of Solomon's house it was a holy place she saw the Holiness in there the in in his life and in the Temple and but the mark the Bible says in her spirit was no more in her isn't it something the very every doubt every question the very question that maybe you had on your mind if you come to the house of God this morning I wonder what kind of place it really is but when she came her spirit left her all the questions the unbelief the doubt all the holdbacks left that was the moment it was this very moment that all of it left and she relaxed in the presence of the Lord Lord and she said it was true the report that I heard in my own land of your acts and your wisdom it was true I heard a report how you conducted the services and how you acted and how your people were and but I believe not the words until I came and now I've seen it with my own eyes myness something Brother David in the presence of the king that her eyes opened up she recognized where she was brother B says she seen something real for the first time in her life it was something that was genuine it wasn't put on she seen something that come from God that man that man couldn't have the wisdom of himself he couldn't even have that wisdom of himself to know the secrets of hearts and reveal but he was a a prophet he couldn't even understand it and tell it it had to be god notice what she said she said blessed be the Lord God which delighted in thee and set thee on the throne of Israel and the Bible says after she saw this she took what she had and she gave it to Solomon she took the almug trees let me tell you what God does with what you giving see each one of us have something we can give to God maybe it's something that that that Alma tree was a blessing that came upon her life it's something that God had gave her in her kingdom each one of us have things in our life we could give to God we give gifts in our life we could give to God you know what she did Brother David she took the alma trees and she gave them but you notice Solomon didn't look at him and say well we don't want that kind of stuff in our we don't we we don't want your kind but the Bible says he took the gift that she gave and he used it he took it in the temple of the Lord and he built pillars in the temple of God with the Alma trees that came from the Queen of Sheba I thought here she was it came from some other place that she wasn't even an Israelite brother Mark this this Gentile woman from some other place way off but here he would take what she gave him and he built a temple or or built a column in the house of God but isn't it something that God would use what you give him he'll use the gifts that you have and she gave them and God used them but the Bible says then after he used them this is the best part but Jared the king of Solomon gave to the queen of the Sheba all of her desire whatever she asked for Solomon gave to her she came she heard she came she gave and then she received she gave everything she had isn't it something she poured her heart out this is what God's doing he's calling us brother Mah to hear the message of the hour he's calling you to come to the word of God he's calling you to pour out your life and and give up the the flesh and all these things of the Flesh and to receive the very life of God she received blessings the Bible says Solomon gave her the very desire desires of her heart and he gave her of his Royal Bounty I don't know about you but there's something in this little boy that would like to receive the Royal Bounty I don't know what all it consists of but God I want all of it that just sounds good to me I want the Royal Bounty I I want I want what the King has friends isn't it something to hear she would come to receive from an Earthly King but we come to receive from a Heavenly King she heard and she came and she gave and she received friends I think that's what we ought to do this morning as I'm closing we ought to follow the pattern of the Queen of Sheba she heard and she came she gave and she received friends it wasn't very long ago there was another woman that was in brother B's meetings by the name of hady R let me tell you what she did she heard the message of the hour and she came to it and she gave to it and then one day when it came her appointed time she received her blessing from God that's the pattern that God has called us to in this age and the Bible says that that Queen will raise up in judgment against this generation because they've received more than she has they've saw more than she ever saw she saw the wisdom of Solomon she saw the wisdom of an Earthly King but Jesus said but a greater than Solomon is here you seemen more Supernatural in this age than the Queen of Sheba ever saw he said that's why she'll raise up in judgment against this generation friends let me tell you she was drawn to an Earthly King but we've been drawn to the King of Kings we've heard we've came yes we've gave now we receive as a music players want to come may you stand to your feet this morning the ram said here's what's happening isn't this something that God just gives us so many blessings he answers our request sister Tammy told me a a testimony the other day she said she was sitting in service going through through some things driving down the road she said Lord she got to sing in that song because he lived she walked down the service she said I just pray that that that brother will sing that tonight I pray that he'll sing Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow Lord then I'll know everything's going to be okay well she didn't know I was going to lead songs neither did I but so happened brother Mark had made an AC of bad discretion so he was injured so brother Matt had to lead the songs I came out and I had all had all the songs to sing well guess what because he lives wasn't on there but the sister's sitting in the service and she hasn't this on our heart Lord can you let them sing it just so I know everything's going to be okay and I got to that next song brother Mark I gave brother Mark the list of songs after the church when they told me that I said well that wasn't on this list and in the place of the one I I started to sing it and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord just moved on me I said you know Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow he's our God he ain't never forsaken us more that all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord begin to move in the church how many was here that night and just the power of God begin to move just from the of a song why because it was God answering a request of a woman that heard came and gave see there's a time to to hear time to come time to give a time to receive he's called us to an act of Holiness he called us to a work but Mark there's something special that's happening in this world today but R said see the world don't recognize it he said they they can't accept what's being done right now that's all you hear fast and pray pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing that's about to happen pray pray pray we're not too late yet he said why do they do that because they want a Great Awakening they want a great move of God this is why people calling out pray pray pray God's going to do something they're crying out believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people but why is it he said but notice what they have done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done listen for that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you that's the same thing they did in the old days they was believing in the coming of Messiah they believed there would be a forerunner come but it would be but it was right by them and they didn't know it they didn't recognize it they believed there would be a forerunner that would forerun the Messiah but then they cut off his head and they killed the Messiah it was happening right by them because the Bible says they'll be blinded and wouldn't see it they're waiting for a Great Awakening but we're living in it how many's heard it how many's heard the call and how many has came responded to the call of God let me invite you this morning to pour everything out of your life be a holy people Paul Peter said be ye holy as your father in Heaven is Holy he that called us is Holy be ye holy clean

expectation to receive something from God I believe God is still a supernatural God how many believe that see the Bible says if we can get some to agree on any one thing two or three to agree on any one thing I've come to tonight brother Mark or today and I'm in agreement with you that the Lord will come and in a supernatural way that we'll see an outpouring of the Holy Ghost a Revival in the hearts of people that's what people need a real Revival in their life you know what a Revival is it ain't I love to shout praise the Lord you know I do I don't like dead I don't like anything dead I think anything dead ought to be buried but a Revival is throwing the trash out that's what happened brother B liked it to the big lake he said remember when you went up there and and all the wind would come he said and all the great ways would come he said but the purpose of it was to throw the trash out on the shore that's what we need that's a real Revival it ain't bringing a whole bunch of people in the church we're not we're not trying to do that we're trying to take this church and put it in the hearts of people the kingdom of God let it be established in people's hearts that's a real
