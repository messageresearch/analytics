he's the same yesterday today and forever God bless you if you got your Bibles this morning invite you Psalms chapter 4 6 one says God is our refuge and our strength and a very present help in what trouble how many believes God God has trouble harnessed and bits in his mouth brother Brown said he's got bits in his mouth you know what bits does it leads it guides tells it when when he can't which way to turn when to stop I say God's got it all in control and he's an everpresent help in a time of trouble can you say Amen let's just pray this morning won't you just pray in your own way this

outpouring of your spirit to be there as well Lord God we pl we plant these things into your bosom this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning how many are believers here this morning know it's good to preach to Believers amen that loves the word and feeds on the word and it's our bread it's our life this morning do you believe that so if you're a Believer the re you are the reason for this season amen you are the purpose of God then if you're the purpose of God brother B said that purpose can never be destroyed it can never be done away with it can never be annihilated all and brother Brown said all powers of hell would eagly be against it and wager against it but it he said but it would never Prevail it God's word will always Prevail Heavens could pass away he said Earth could pass away but God said my word can never come back void it would always accomplish it'll always stand the test of time it will prevail he said we have God's Eternal promise he said there'll be teachers there'll be isms rise they may great great programs rise they may be things that look like it would be destroyed he said but it can never be destroyed he said is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail isn't that powerful this morning he said this is powerful he said then it's not up to me aren't you thankful for that this morning he say he says it's not up to you whether it be destroyed or not it's up to God not hell not demons but God rich in Mercy everything was pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world we're just here living out in time his predestinated Plan of Redemption are you thankful for that amen this is the work of the kingsman Redeemer he shed his blood he came and paid the ultim price we're only here reaping the benefits of Calvary amen we're only here because of for knowledge and he predestinated you for such a time as this and and we're only here living out the plan of God's predestinated Plan of Redemption amen he's going to work it all out and you know he he brother B said he set all his laws Amen in motion to benefit him to bring past his will and bring back past his purpose and he's got a plan this morning you know and and this service doesn't dictate his plan right but Joel the the what we did yesterday doesn't dictate his plan and what we're going to do tomorrow doesn't waver his plan his plan was pre-plan before the foundation of the world nothing catches Our God off guard he knows every time a flea bats his eyes every sand that's on the seashore Heen he knows Everybody by name this morning he knows your problems he's got trouble with bits in his mouth amen and and he's living out in the hour that we're living in he's making it real to us all things work to the good for them that are called according to his purpose and love God I believe that now more than ever amen I believe he's an everpresent help in a time of trouble why because I've experienced him in the midst of trouble amen I've experienced brother Mark that he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the the end of the world do you believe that Isaiah 32 and2 says and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covered from the temptest rivers of water in dry places and the shadow of great rock in a weary land it said for thou are a rock in a weary land you're a shelter in a time of a storm when the devil storn everything he can at you sickness and missiles of ha you're sheltered in the time of a storm there's a hiding place how many believes that how many found that Hiding Place Abiding Place I like it he said we can walk in the presence of God and be hid from the things of the world he said listen this the r says you don't even hear them no more it's soundproof hallelujah it's soundproof the world's on the outside gasping and looking in but are looking out but you're on the inside in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God Amen I believe it this morning amen not that we don't know what's we're not uh conscious of what's going on around us and brother Bobby we don't na naturally hear things that are said in this life but down in the soul a been the real you this morning the world is soundproof to you in other words it doesn't change me as Paul would say I am what I am by the grace of God God the things around us doesn't move us Paul said I've been Shipwrecked three times throw in the prison been snake bit he said but Paul said you know what none of these things move me I'm soundproof why because the word of the king said Paul you're going to go to Rome amen snake couldn't stop him hell couldn't stop him the grave couldn't stop him friends when God said Paul was going to Rome he was headed to Rome and none of these things moved him it was pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world you know what happened he made it to Rome Show me one time in the Bible brother Noah that God ever promised a Believer amen that it didn't come to pass if you could show me one place we're serving a false god but I'm here to tell you God's good on his promises he never speaks it if he hadn't pre-planned it before the foundation and already seen you overcoming the reason why I can tell Paul that because before the foundation of the world he saw Paul in Rome and the reason why we've been notified in this hour amen the contents of the will has been read in our hour and told us the very thing this world is not your home you came from God and you're going back to God he but why because you was a part of him before the foundation of the world and he can't lose a one of us isn't that beautiful here this morning it's soundproof what a hiding place what a hiding place it was when the death angel was passing by that night in Egypt there was a bloodline that kept them safe from the plagues of Egypt for Exodus 8 tells us God severed in that day the land of Goan in other words there brother Travis there was snow flies could enter into Goan right there was no plagues God severed a day in Goan he separated it that he said that I may know that thy am the Lord thy God in the midst of the earth I thought brother Joe I'm glad I know him in the personal way this morning when all hell is going on Amen when everything's going on around us amen we lose loved ones amen we know an everpresent help in a time of trouble he don't forsake you Heen he he's not a God that's somewhere way off in the future somewhere but he condescended down to live in humanity and to let the world know I'm still their God and they're still my people and I'm going to keep my Covenant upon my people amen I'm going to be in the midst of the earth Amen in the midst of her she's going to be Flesh of My flesh bone of my bone life of my life power of my power and brother R said and notify us brother Joe she is him Hallelujah a hiding place he severed and numbers brother Wayne took this uh Thursday night and something had been on my heart too so you're going to hear it twice but God's good isn't he numbers 23 15 said he said unto baac stand here for a burnt offering while I meet the Lord you under in the Lord yet and the Lord met balam and he put a word in his mouth and said go again unto baac and say thus and when you come to him behold stood by Burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him and baac said un him what have the Lord spoken and he took up a parable and said rise up baac and hear hearken unto me me and balam got in the spirit brother Brown said and fell into a trance and instead of cursing Israel he blessed them am why is it because God set all of his Laws and Motion right abah to serve him regardless of conditions to fulfill his purpose and to fulfill his plan and if you're part of the Lamb how many's a part of the Lamb this morning thank God he doesn't examine me he examines the lamb we are part of the Lamb we're part we're buried in that sacrifice if he was forgiven that means we are forgiven if it means if he was accepted we are accepted and then we're a part of the lamb and you're the reason for this season no matter how much hell tries to stop you prevent you curse you God's going to make this trial a blessing Hallelujah he said God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent had he said shall he not do as has spoken shall not make it good behold I receive a Comm a commandment to bless and he had blessed and I cannot reverse it and a commentary says God has blessed them determined to bless them and have promised to bless them and complete the he's going to complete the blessing he's going to bring them to a land he has given them it's irreversible and then brother brw would say it like this that church there's nothing it's irresistible Force he said and God will move everything right Hallelujah God is going will move everything what prepared God and we have been notified in this hour Deliverance is mine healing is mine salvation is mine amen every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line and it cannot be reversed it's an irresistable Force brother say yet they had blessings they could go to the rock my text this morning rock in a weary land they could go to The Rock when they was thirsty they could go to The Rock when they was hungry he said they was thirsty they would drink and just Rejoice they were just carrying on awful right in the midst of a time that balam and baac was trying to bring a curse against the children of God but church we believe it we've been notified about our God in this hour this message that declared to us who our god really is he told us who we are where we came from where we going told us about our future home told us about uh Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he began to express the very thoughts of God Amen that's never been brought to us has never been tied together like it before what a message of the hour what for to get his little bride ready for rapturing time transl translation time this is a season of translation this is you're the reason for that season you are a part of the Rapture this morning amen and and this is it amen they was they was excited and rejoicing when the enemy was coming in like a flood amen yet they was rejoicing behind the Covenant that God already made for them before the devil Ever Raised his head I'm here to tell you my God's never late my God's an alltime God he's never late he may seem to us in the flesh 4 days late brother Joe but he's always on time time he's never missed he's never left us without a a way of Escape he said I'm your refuge in a time of a storm I'm an everpresent help in a time of trouble sister Eve sometimes we don't understand but if we could hear that Supernatural that still s Small Voice he says sister Eve don't worry about it I got this I prepl that's what was going on that day man when Bop and baac was coming against the armies of Israel in such a way to take them up the stor the H parts of Israel the bad place of things that they knew as brother Wayne would say they knew that they did God they would God had a law he' had to curse them but God rich in Mercy already had a brazing Serpent and a smitten rock that was already in effect and effect means the power to bring forth results and when God would look down on the iniquity of Jacob he could only see his Covenant Glory that's the rock that God's provided for you and I and they was rejoicing how many can rejoice in their Calamity right now amen sometime brother Mark it's hard to Rejoice am been on the hounds of Hell's on a trail but once you get a revelation inisha that God is ever presentent he knows all things he's got everything under control amen we forget he does it we let we we we get upset but he doesn't we frit but he doesn't he's got everything under control he knows what's going on in your family he knows what's going in on in your children's life and just when hell thinks he's getting enough that's when God says trouble that's enough that's my God this morning oh how many's fell in love with him so if you need healing you can go to the Rock if you need Deliverance you can go to the Rock numbers 23 and 21 says he has not beheld the iniquity of Jacob neither has he seen the perversion of Israel the Lord God this is what I I had in my notes when brother Wayne was preaching this the shout of the king is among them the shout is a jubilant sound a jubilee sound not a sound of defeat not a sound of of retreat but a sound of Victory the Jubilee sound is which is the presence of the Lord their King is in the midst of them Glory when they was bringing every accusation against them amen and they they had evidence that they done it amen but the power of this amen God couldn't see through the atonement the atonement was in effect he said the sound brother Brown notified us to a shout of the voice of the king down there in Israel Israel the atonement was in effect the atonement is the power to produce the results I'm glad the king is Among Us what is the shout of the king amen it was a brazing serpent it was the smitten rock that was already there amen the children of Israel they didn't have to really say anything but the the the Covenant was speaking in their behalf when they would say look upon the perverseness of Israel amen when God would look down he'd see the Covenant that he placed there amongst them it was a shout of a king in the camp it was speaking in their behalf I say he's the same God here this morning he's a shout of the king hallelujah it's the power which is the authority the right the Liberty the strength or the ability to produce the results Hallelujah and brother say like this but where balam fail to see the Brazen Serpent of smitten Rock going before Israel making the atonement it was God's calling God's election there was God people hallelujah he says God had called them to separate them put a serpent before them a atonement in a smitten Rock and balum failed to see it when balam looked upon Israel and brother Wayne brought this out so beautiful he saw the reason to curse them when man looked upon the church he had reason to curse them but when God looked upon them he saw the atonement and brother Brown said he seen you like a unicorn who will put anything in your way how Godly how righteous are the tents that's the way God saw them not the way that man saw them but the great but the way God saw them he seen them pure he seen them white as snow he seen them not guilty does it sound familiar this morning amen we've been not ified the blood speaks of speaks of Freedom it's a voice of freedom and any person that's under the blood is safely protected amen there's power in this Blood the voice of the blood can never be silenced and Satan cannot stand it the Charles he can't stand it he hates it oh don't you love him but thank God for the power of this Blood what can make me whole again thank you brother Wesley nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ this wasn't just ordinary blood this was a sovereignty of God this had nothing to do with man had nothing to do with a woman it was God who's rich in Mercy that became our kids Redeemer that would play the ultimate price amen that bulls and goats and types and and shadows would speak there's one coming there's one coming man and Satan would take out Abraham he took out all these men of old he took him out he thought he had the advantage but he' come in contact with a man of Galilee amen he couldn't stop him walking the shores of Galilee brother Joel everywhere Jesus went he conquered he went he went went to the Dam's house Heen death was sett on in amen but he conquered death when Lazarus was in the grave and the skin worms was trying to destroy his flesh amen there was Jesus said Lazarus come forth and the grave had to open up the the the skin wordss had it depart amen and Lazarus came forth just like he said you know he was tormenting the Tormentor everywhere he went Jesus begin to conquer he begin to take over could you imagine how Satan was so aggravated right and no doubt sister Eve he said maybe he called up his best persecuting attorney that he had and said I want you to go down there and I want you to find all the evidence against this Blood I want you to find everything that you can show the weakness of this blood and show it was just like any other person could you imagine getting summons to examine the evidence of the blood could could you imagine what the persecuting attorney must have said when he came back to hell and begin to talk to him and says Satan no doubt say Satan give it to me what'd you find he says this case is Untouchable what you mean he said I I sent you to find the the evidence of the weakness of the blood and no doubt he said you know Mr Satan you ain't going to like what I'm about to tell you but this blood's different this blood has power this blood can no matter how much we take his life there's power in the blood I'm here to tell you we've been working on this case for many many years and we came in contact with every evidence that we tried to point it was wrong it pointed to the power of this blood that can take you and I Sinners and change us from the ridiculous to the spime and no doubt say would say give me a give me a testimony bring a witness and no doubt he probably caught a little woman that was scarred she was beaten up with drugs she was beaten up with alcohol she gave her body to prostitution her life was marred and this life my But Here Come a prophet of God came walking by her way one day she said what could your God do for me and brother Brandon sister Vanna began the tell her said let me tell you about my the power of this Blood Heen I can't do nothing for you but let me tell you about the the power of this Blood Oh Glory to God and let me tell you amen let me tell you about about
