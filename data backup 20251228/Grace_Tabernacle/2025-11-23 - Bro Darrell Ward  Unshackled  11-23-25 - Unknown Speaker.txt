Oh, when I think of all that God's done and the kind of life he's brought me from, well, I've got so much to thank him for. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If you want to take your seats just a moment. Amen. Got a special occasion. Amen. and a new life that the Lord has given us this morning. So, we want to invite Jordan and Xavier to come. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in. [Music] [Music] She's trying to say my name right now. baby Clarabel and little joy that God has given us and it's my first grandbaby. So we uh certainly thankful that see the Xavier and Jordan and serving the Lord and starting a family and I think it's important how you start a family and that God would bring such a gift like this and what a responsibility that it is you know to I was thinking about being a a grandpa. You know they say all these things about it. You know I got to think about how God is with us. You know, God don't have any grandchildren, but they're all God's children. And he's so graciously given us the opportunity to raise them and and take care of them and raise them according to the word and until they're old enough that God can uh lead them and and guide them like he does us all. So, this family this morning wants to dedicate this baby to the Lord and make a a promise to raise her and just ask the Lord to be his hand upon her. And Amen. I think that's a wonderful thing to start a family that way. Amen. So, let's just pray together. Maybe clear. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you, Lord, for this little family. Lord, what a a joy that it is, Lord, to see a new life, Lord, that you would give us. how precious of a of a thing that it is, Lord, knowing the innocence of a little child. And Lord, we just ask you this morning, Lord, that you would keep your hand upon this family. And Lord, may the Holy Ghost overshadow them, Lord, and lead them. Lord, this little Clarabel, Lord, as she is raised and grows up in this world, Lord, knowing that outside is such an evil world and Lord, but you are so gracious, Lord, to give your children a a protection, Lord, and a strength and ability by your word to be able to withstand everything that they come in contact with. And Lord, we just ask you this morning and Lord, that you would bless this little girl. Lord, may she be raised according to your word. And God, may she testify. Lord, may her life be a testimony of the grace of God. And Lord, may she be a witness, Lord, to be able to tell of your word and the goodness that you give us. And Lord, we just ask you to keep your blessings upon her. And Lord, in this family, Lord, we pray for it now. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Isn't that a wonderful gift? Amen. God bless you if you understand. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Can't believe they did that. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord, brother. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. We love our children and and our grandchildren. That's an odd thing to say. Sarah told me at the hospital, she said they were talking about who the baby looked like and she said, "I think she looks like her grandpa." And I said, "Your dad or my dad?" She It took me a while to to catch on. Like, oh, I'm Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm I'm one of the grandpa. There's a there's another one sitting right there. And I don't think she was talking about talking about. [Music] Oh man. That's Xavier's mom and dad. And so many of you don't haven't met them. Matt, Ashley, welcome y'all here this morning. And my just an honor. Amen. Just to see God bring people together. Quite a testimony of how uh that Xavier and Jordan was brought together. And I just love how God takes uh takes hopeless cases and things that we' plum give up on, but God don't give up on nobody. Amen. So, I just I just thank God and that he could bring uh two young people up and bring them together. And you know, sometimes God sees things we don't see. You know, he sees far beyond our our understanding. And but I have to say this, I really appreciate Xavier as a in-law and and he's been real good with him and Jordan and he's already a good dad. He's a good protector and and and I thank every young man. We've got a lot of uh young men that are having families and I thank God to see God-fearing men raise families. This world needs more of them and and and they they all have to grow up into that and so we just want to be here for them and but we sure appreciate appreciate them this morning. appreciate what the Lord has for us. So, we just want to allow Brother Daryl to be able to come and have time to speak this morning. And I know the Lord's put a something special on his heart and and always been a a true blessing. Every time Brother Daryl comes, it's never uh never have we ever left here that the Lord didn't speak to the church. And so, we just want to allow him to come and just get out of the way and let the Lord use him this morning. So, maybe we'd sing key of C. Well, I sought the Lord and he answered me. He delivered me from every fear. Those who look on him are rad up. They'll never be ashamed. Never be ashamed. This poor man cried and the Lord heard me. He delivered me from my enemies. For the son of God, he surrounds his saints. He'll deliver them. He'll deliver them. So I say magnify the Lord with me. How many come this morning say I want to exalt the Lord the name of the Lord. Lord together glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. How many knows that to be true this morning? Blessed is he who hides in him. Oh, fear the Lord, all you saints. He'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. So I say magnify the Lord with me. Oh come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Bless the name of the Lord. Amen. What a privilege it is today to serve the living God. &gt;&gt; You know, there's all kinds of gods in the world today. That's the Muslims or Islamics. They have thousands of gods, but there is no God like our God. He opens the eyes of the blind. He makes the lame walk. &gt;&gt; He raises the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. He makes cancers disappear off people's bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you tell me he can't do it. &gt;&gt; I've seen him do it, friends. Amen. When my daughter was blind and they said she'd never see little, [Music] she wasn't even three years old. Only survivor of a train car accident. Two of my family killed. Severe brain injury. said she'd never swallow. Said she'd never speak again, never see, never walk again. But I saw my God do what they said was impossible. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Our kids are precious. Our grandkids are even more precious. No, I'm just God bless you. If you have your Bibles this morning, turn with us to the book of St. John and we want to read from St. John 8 verse 36 just one verse there we appreciate each one coming out and this day of dedication for the little grand grandbaby and oh it's a special time it's just wonderful we bring you greetings from my family back home my pastor brother Donnie Reagan we count it an honor to come and be with you once again and we trust that what we'd have to say this morning be a blessing to you and I was thinking know Thanksgiving coming up this week and things to be thankful for and you know I'm thankful for my family. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for my life. Thankful for my children, my grandkids, my church, my pastor, my home. I'm thankful for all those things. But there's one thing I'm more thankful for than anything. And that's what we want to look at this morning. Amen. And this week sometimes, you know, Thanksgiving on Thursday and family's getting together and it's always a busy time and a happy time, but take some time just to maybe slip out to the back and look up towards heaven and be thankful &gt;&gt; for what he's done for us. &gt;&gt; St. John 8:36, the Bible says this, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, &gt;&gt; you shall be free indeed. Amen. That's what I'm most thankful for this morning and I want to speak for it just a few minutes is on Unshackled. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we count it such an honor to gather here with your children today. And Lord, we are in our hearts most thankful. Lord, I guess I thanked you 10,000 times or more every time I see Jessica come down the steps or open a refrigerator and graduate from school. We're so thankful, Lord. Father, I pray today that whatever the need would be among these people, Lord, and I know when there's a congregation this size, there's needs. But Lord, may we realize today there's not a need in this building that's greater than you. So, Lord, we look to you this morning. May you come, Lord, and speak to your children. for in our hearts we are most grateful for all that you've done for us. Bless brother Matt, Lord, his family, his church, his ministry. Bless each one here today, Lord. And when we leave the building, may each of us be thankful in our hearts because you have unshackled us. Grant it, Lord, for we ask these things in Jesus name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Brother Bam said he said, "I remember one time I was at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio and I was looking at an eagle who had just been captured and it was one of the most pitiful sights that I ever had the privilege of seeing that this great heavenly bird that had been captured and netted by someone and thrown into a cage." And the poor fellow was so out of place that he would jump with all that was within him against these big bars and flopping his wings only to find himself to fall back on his back. And that poor eagle has beat himself against those bars until all the feathers on his wings were gone and his head was and his face was bruised and blooded. And as I watched him again proudly walk back and with all that he had, he had pour himself against those bars only to find himself backwards again. And as he laid there on the floor, his weary eyes soared the skies. And I thought, what a pitiful sight that is, not to be on the earth here. He's a heavenly bird. His whole makeup was to live in the blue, way above the haunts and the cares of the world. But to see a bird like that that was born on the earth, to soar into the skies, yet caged in such a way that he could never soar the skies again. And I thought that's the most satis I' I'D GIVE THAT MAN $100 more that he paid for the eagle if you'd let me open that door and let him out. Said to think that he was born to sell the blue skies. Then he looks up there and he couldn't do it. Somebody had put him in a cage laying there looking up WHERE HE REALLY OUGHT TO BE, &gt;&gt; WHERE HIS HEART LONGED to be. But these bars between him and that shackled by a man, placed in bondage. WHAT A PITIFUL SIGHT THAT IS. YOU JUST think about it. JUST SADDENS MY HEART to see that. BUT I TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE PITIFUL THAN that is to see men and women who were born and shaped in the image of God. BORN TO BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND TO FIND THEM CAGED BY SIN, BY HABITS, BY THE CARES OF THIS WORLD, SHACKLED BY THE DEVIL. IT'S A FAR MORE PITIFUL SHAPE THAN THAT eagle is. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, MAN WAS NOT MADE TO BE BOUND. &gt;&gt; MAN IS A FREE MAN. HE WHO THE SON HATH MADE FREE IS FREE INDEED. &gt;&gt; He doesn't HAVE TO BE BOUND THAT WAY. SHACKLED TO ADDICTION, SHACKLED TO FEARS, SHACKLED TO SICKNESS, DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAGES MEN AND DENY THEM OF THEIR PRIVILEGES. MAN WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A BOND SLAVE TO SATAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN, SOMEBODY. HE WASN'T MADE TO BE A SLAVE. HE WAS MADE TO BE A SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MADE OF GOD TO BE IN GOD'S IMAGE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE FALL OF MAN, he was born shackled to death. &gt;&gt; David said, "Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." You see, FROM THE MOMENT THAT YOU ARE CONCEIVED, you are on your path to death. And yet many people today, they say, "I don't need nobody. I I'M DOING ALL RIGHT MYSELF. I'M STRONG. I'M SMART. I'VE GOT MONEY. I I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. I CAN MAKE MY OWN WAY. BUT THEY'RE shackled to death. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN DEFEATED. AND THIS NATURAL BIRTH CAN NEVER BRING US TO LIFE. &gt;&gt; THE NATURAL BIRTH WILL ONLY BRING US TO death &gt;&gt; because you're born defeated. You're in a defeated world amongst defeated people, defeated creeds, defeated denominations. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO VICTORY SOME WAY. &gt;&gt; AND THERE CANNOT BE A VICTOR. THERE CAN'T BE A VICTORY UNLESS THERE IS A VICTOR. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen that? &gt;&gt; AND JUST LIKE THAT EAGLE &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HELPLESSLY CAGED. WE WERE HELPLESS. JUST AS HELPLESS AS WE COULD BE. &gt;&gt; I COULD NOT SAVE MYSELF. &gt;&gt; MANKIND WAS CHAINED, SHACKLED BY A fallen nature. UNLESS SOMEBODY COULD PUT FORTH THEIR HAND AND OPEN UP THAT CAGE, &gt;&gt; we are forever shackled. &gt;&gt; But I AM SO THANKFUL AS WE TAKE THIS WEEK OF THANKSGIVING. I AM SO THANKFUL THAT THERE IS ONE HALLELUJAH WHO HAS DONE THAT VERY THING. THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT CAN YOU SAY AMEN TO THAT? HE HAS UNSHACKLED US IN THAT HE CALLED YOU. WHEN HE CALLED YOU, HE UNSHACKLED YOU. &gt;&gt; He opened up the cage to let us out. &gt;&gt; Jesus unshackled &gt;&gt; the shackled. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of Barabus standing on death row in a Roman prison house. HOW DO YOU THINK O BARABUS FELT KNOWING THAT the next morning when HE HEARD THOSE ROMAN soldiers coming, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THAT CAGE, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THOSE PRISON BARS AND CRUCIFY HIM. THE MOST HORRIBLE FORM OF DEATH THERE WAS WAS CRUCIFIXION by the Romans. THEY MADE IT SO CRUEL. THEY MADE IT SO SUFFERING THAT NOBODY WANTED TO FACE EXECUTION. Crucifixion by the Romans. And how do YOU THINK HE FELT SWEATING IT OUT KNOWING THE NEXT MORNING? And in that morning, he hears the stomping of Roman soldiers coming through THE GALLERY. THOSE BIG ORANGE SHOES AS THEY MARCH TOWARDS HIS CELL. OH, I could just hear it in my mind. Detail. Oh god. This is it. You know you're going to be killed in just a few minutes. They're going to take you out. They're going to crucify you. And he opened the door. I could just see him on the floor just shaking. Oh, you see all these sins that caught up with him. Barabbus the killer. Barabus the deceiver. Barabbus the stealer. &gt;&gt; BARABBUS WHO HAD DONE ALL THIS WICKEDNESS. BARABBUS WHO WAS SO MEAN, &gt;&gt; WHO WAS SO TOUGH, &gt;&gt; shaking on the floor crying like a little boy &gt;&gt; cuz he's fixing to go to crucifixion. And I can hear them say, "Barabas, GUILTY OF MURDER, ROBBERY, THIEVERY, DECEIT, a dis. YOU HAVE BEEN SENTENCED FOR YOUR CRIMES." GOD, this is it. This is it. BY ORDER OF PONTIUS PILATE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BARABBUS, YOU are pardoned. You're free. Unshackle &gt;&gt; the prisoner. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I guarantee he didn't sit like you're all sitting this morning. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine GOING FROM FACING DEATH UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THAT'S LIFTED OFF OF YOU? &gt;&gt; IT'S ALMOST THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN THIS CAN'T BE TRUE. IT'S A TRICK. YOU WANT ME TO RUN OUT THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN SAY I THREW A SPEAR IN HIS BACK BECAUSE HE TRIED TO ESCAPE AND EVERYBODY WILL KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE THAT KILLED BARABBUS. &gt;&gt; NO TRICK, BARABUS. NO TRICKERY. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; Unshackle the prisoner. You mean I I'm not going to die. You don't have to die. What do What DO I HAVE TO DO FOR IT? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR THIS FREEDOM? NOTHING. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. &gt;&gt; It's without money sir &gt;&gt; or price. &gt;&gt; Well, how does this come? And the centurion would have turned him around and said, "Look out the window. You see that man hanging on the cross there? YOU SEE THAT SPIT IN HIS FACE? YOU SEE THAT BLOOD DRIPPING OUT OF HIS BODY? YOU SEE THOSE STRIPES ON HIS BACK? You see his heads crucified? THAT WAS YOUR CROSS. THAT WAS YOUR NAILS. THAT WAS YOUR PUNISHMENT. BUT HIS NAME IS JESUS. &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; He opened up the PRISON DOOR FOR YOU WHO WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE, BUT HE TOOK YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Barabus's name was Jesus Barabbus? Did you know that? Look it up and see. Jesus took Jesus place. Oh God, he took your place. You're pardoned. Your prison house has been opened. You're unshackled. And when Jesus pushed upon the cross, you see, they would stretch their arms out like this. And when they do, their shoulders would come out of joint. And they had a little platform for their feet that they would put like this so that they could push up because when they stretched them out like that, it would stretch the diaphragm and they couldn't breathe. So they had this platform that they would push up. And when they pushed up, it would relax the diaphragm enough for them to breathe a little bit. And so they would just go through this routine of up, breathe, breathe, breathe, down, smother, smother, smother, up, breathe, breathe, breathe over and over. But when Ro thought they'd suffered enough, they would break their legs. so they couldn't push up AND THEN THEY WOULD DIE ON the cross. had Jesus there in the cross between the TWO THIEVES. HE PUSHED UP AND HE CRIED OUT, "It's mother smother. Smother smother smother is finished." Oh god. Oh god. I wish I was outside right now. I'll show you how a white boy can dance. Think about it. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN HE PUSHED UP ON THAT CROSS AND HE CRIED, "IT'S FINISHED." EVERY PRISON DOOR THAT SATAN HAD BUSTED OPEN AND EVERY SHACKLED PRISONER COULD GO FREE. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. HE UNSHACKLED ME. HE UNSHACKLED YOU THIS MORNING. FOR THIS I AM MOST THANKFUL. I come out of the army as a 21-year-old and I was in an airborne combat unit and I came out of the army. I had all kinds of things in my life. ALL KINDS OF I'D be ashamed for you to know some OF THE THINGS I CARRIED IN MY LIFE. BUT I MET HIM IN AN OLD BUILDING DOWN IN JONESBURG, TENNESSEE. AND THAT AFTERNOON, HALLELUJAH, HE UNSHACKLED ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I think of Isaac. God told Abraham, "I'm going to give you a son." AND WHEN ABRAHAM WAS HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND SARAH WAS 75, he had the son, he had the son that God promised him they would have. And when the boy got a little older, God spoke to Abraham AND SAID, "TAKE THY SON ISAAC TO A MOUNTAIN THAT I TELL YOU, AND THERE GIVE HIM to me for a sacrifice. Think about that. TAKE YOUR ONLY SON TO A MOUNTAIN. SACRIFICE HIM TO me as a sacrifice. And at the foot of the mountain, he told those people that WAS WITH HIM, "I THE LAD WILL GO YONDER AND I AND THE LAD WILL COME AGAIN." &gt;&gt; HOW COULD A MAN SAY THAT WHEN GOD SAID, "GIVE ME YOUR SON." BECAUSE HE KNEW IF GOD GAVE HIM THAT BOY WHEN HIS BODY WAS DEAD, IF THAT BOY'S BODY WAS DEAD, HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM BACK TO HIM AGAIN. &gt;&gt; And he took him up THERE AND HE LAID HIM ON THE ALTAR AND HE TIED HIM UP. HE SHACKLED HIM WITH SOME HANDS AND HE SHACKLED HIS FEET AND NO DOUBT HE KISSED HIM ON THE FOREHEAD and said, "Son, daddy would have loved to watch you grow up. I would have loved to watch you see me become a grandpa and all these things. I would have LOVED IT, BUT I MUST OBEY MY GOD." AND HE BROUGHT THAT KNIFE BACK AND HE SAID, "GOD, you gave me this boy and now I give this boy to you." And about that time when he brought forth, he heard a voice. He heard A VOICE SAID,"ABRAHAM, STAY YOUR HAND." OH. And he heard behind him a ram bleeding bad. He looked around AND HE SAW GOD HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF A SACRIFICE. And he said, "Isaac," he be he be to unshackle him. HE SAID, "ISAAC, SON, GET UP, SON. GET UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE TODAY. WE'RE GOING BACK HOME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THANKSGIVING. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY. &gt;&gt; You see, when he when Abraham GAVE ISAAC TO GOD, GOD GAVE ISAAC BACK TO ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I remember standing at a window when my BABY WAS DYING, WASN'T even three years old. And I stood there and I said, "God, I GIVE YOU JESSICA. IF YOU TAKE HER LIFE, I'LL PREACH AS HARD AS I EVER PREACHED. I'll go out there. I'll bury you with the REST OF MY FAMILY. AND I'LL LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS I EVER LOVED YOU. I'LL PREACH AS HARD AS I EVER PREACHED. I SAID, "IF YOU LET MY BABY LIVE, I'LL DO MY BEST TO TELL THE world what you did for her." And the afternoon of the funeral, sitting in the wait room, a warm feeling come over and a voice spoke to me just as plain as I'm talking to you and said, "Your daughter shall live." &gt;&gt; Few years later after the accident, when God gave her back to me, I ran into a brother Louie Blevens who had a little Debbie cake route and he said, "Come out to the truck. I got some cakes. shall give the kids. And he's listening to a tape and brother Bam said, Moses and Amra when when when Yosephed and Amra gave Moses to God, God gave Moses back to them. And standing there, brother Matt, something spoke to my heart just as real and SAID, "BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME JESSICA, I GIVE JESSICA back to you." &gt;&gt; OH, YOU GOT A WAYWARD SON THIS MORNING. YOU GOT A WAYWARD DAUGHTER THIS MORNING. DON'T FRET ABOUT IT. JUST GIVE THEM TO GOD AND LET GOD GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. Starting up the hill as he said, "Daddy, we got the wood, we got the knife, WE GOT THE FIRE, BUT WHERE IS THE SACRIFICE?" HE SAID, "SON, &gt;&gt; God will per give provide himself &gt;&gt; a sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Oh my. I think of the maniac of Gadera. Jesus crossed the stormy sea all the way over to help one single person. He wasn't the mayor of the city. He wasn't the most influential person of the city. He was a maniac living among the tombs cutting himself with stones. You know, we still have them today. They're called cutters. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. That's right. The same thing that caused him to cut himself is what causes them to cut their self. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He lived among the tombs and he cut himself. Perhaps one time he was an upward citizen, but he got into alcohol or he got into drugs or he got into pain pills OR HE GOT INTO SOMETHING AND CRASHED OUT HIS LIFE. AND THERE YOU FIND HIM LIVING AMONG THE TOMBS AND NOBODY COULD TAME HIM. &gt;&gt; But all the way over on the other side was Jesus. And that maniac AMONG THE TOMBS DID NOT WANT TO BE THAT WAY. HE DID NOT WANT TO BE THAT WAY. AND IF THERE'S A DEEP THAT CALLS INTO THE DEEP, IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOU TELLING YOU, I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS WAY, THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER FOR ME, THAT'S THE EVIDENCE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do? He crossed the stormy sea. Not for a church full, &gt;&gt; for one &gt;&gt; man. &gt;&gt; For the sake of one man crying out for deliverance. Jesus crossed the stormy sea and unshackled him. What a thanksgiving that was. &gt;&gt; When he went home and told his wife, "Don't worry, I'm not the same man I used to be." Knows how to change them. Don't know anybody. Amen. Hallelujah. And that same Jesus will come this morning to one humble soul that's calling to him. He'll cross the sea. He'll leave the heavens to answer the prayer of one humble heart &gt;&gt; wanting &gt;&gt; deliverance. &gt;&gt; I think of the woman of his infirmities. The Bible says in Luke 13:10, "And he was teaching in one of the synagogues of the Sabbath. And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and in could no wise lift herself just bent over like this. 18 years she walked like this. Could Could you Could you hand me that up there on that shelf? I can't straighten up. 18 years. She got up that morning. 18 years in a day. Been over. But little did she know this was the day she would be unshackled. Oh, remember brother David S was in Nicaragua. We had a prime over there. There's a man came through that prayer line. He was bent over just like that right there. He was a brick layer. blew his back up, blew his back out laying brick and he's bent over like that. And when he came through that prayer line, God is my witness. I saw that man when he got to the end of the prayer line, he was standing straight up and he shouted that church to the ground &gt;&gt; cuz they just something about it. When you've been been over that long and all of a sudden you're unshackled, it makes you want to dance. It makes you want to shout. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO TELL SOMEBODY, &gt;&gt; "AMEN." She could otherwise lift herself. And when JESUS SAW HER, HE CALLED her to him AND SAID UNTO HER,"WOMAN, THOU ART loosed from thy infirmities." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I like this next part. Immediately she was made straight and glorified God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Acts two. Now about the time Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church and he killed James the brother of John with a sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. Then were the days of the unleaven bread. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in a prison and delivered him to four quaternons of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. And Peter therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for Peter. And when Herod would have brought him forth, that same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers before the door kept the prison. In other words, this man was shackled up and locked in. And behold, the angel of the Lord came unto him, AND A LIGHT SHINE IN THE PRISON, AND HE SMOKED PETER ON THE SIDE, and raised HIM UP, SAYING, "ARISE UP QUICKLY." AND WHEN HE DID, his chains fell off from his hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you so glad an angel messenger has come TO US AND UNSHACKLED US. &gt;&gt; HE'S LOOSED US FROM CREEDS. HE'S LOOSED US FROM DARKNESS. HE'S LOOSED US FROM DENOMINATIONS. HALLELUJAH. AND BROUGHT US INTO HIS PRESENCE. AMEN. AND THE angel said unto him, "Guard thyself and bind on thy sandals." And so he did. And he said unto him, "Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me." And he went out and followed him, and which not that it was true, which was done by the angel, but thought he was saw a vision. &gt;&gt; And I must be dreaming. This can't be happening. And when they were passed the first and second ward, they came into the iron gate that leadth unto the city, which open to them of his own accord. and come up to the gate &gt;&gt; and the gate opened. &gt;&gt; THE CHASE FELL OFF. THE PRISON DOOR OPENED UP. THE GUARDS KEPT SLEEPING. WALKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH OUT TO THE OUTSIDE. GOT TO THE GATE. THE GATE OPENED UP. &gt;&gt; Oh god. I just love the word. &gt;&gt; It opened up on its own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street. And forth the angel departed from him. AND WHEN PETER WAS COME TO HIMSELF, I'd say he got a little excited. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I know for SURE THAT THE LORD HAS SENT HIS ANGEL AND HAVE DELIVERED ME OUT OF THE HAND OF HEROD &gt;&gt; FROM ALL the expectation of the people of the Jews." &gt;&gt; Oh man, they were thinking, "Boy, tomorrow we're going to work Peter over. We're going to wish he'd never been born." But little did they know before the sun rising of the sun, &gt;&gt; the Lord unshackled him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying. Now, they was in the HOUSE HAVING A PRAYER MEETING for Peter, who was in prison. And Peter knocks on the door. And a maiden by the name of Roa comes TO THE DOOR. SHE KNEW PETER'S VOICE &gt;&gt; AND SHE GOT SO EXCITED THAT SHE OPENED NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS BUT RAN IN AND TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PRAYING, "PETER'S AT THE DOOR." &gt;&gt; And they had a big hallelujah time and praise God. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. And they said unto her, sir, &gt;&gt; you're mad. &gt;&gt; Ain't that the way we are? SHE CONSTANTLY AFFIRMED THAT IT WAS EVEN SO. AND they said, "It is his angel. THEY'VE DONE KILLED THE MAN. THAT'S HIS ANGEL KNOCKING ON THE DOOR." Peter is just out there. I wish somebody let me in. It's cold out here. He continued knocking. AND WHEN THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM, THEY WERE ASTONISHED. &gt;&gt; Why do we get so surprised when God answers our prayer? He said IN JEREMIAH 33:3, "CALL UNTO ME AND I WILL answer thee." &gt;&gt; Now, why do we get so surprised, brother Mark, when he answers our prayer? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ASTONISHED. BUT HE BECKONED UNTO them with a hand to hold their peace and declared to THEM HOW THE LORD HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT OF PRISON. AND HE SAID, "GO SHOW THESE THINGS unto James and to the brethren." And he departed and went to another place. Now, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers as what happened to Peter. I can just imagine. No, you tell Herod. No, no, no, no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't you go tell No, you go tell him. Amen. But you see in a prison house surrounded by those who wanted to persecute him, God unshackled him. here a few years ago. I was preaching among the Apache Indians at St. Carlos. I'll hurry just a little bit more. Just give me a little bit more time. &gt;&gt; I was preaching among the Apache Indians and this Indian came up. He's about 69 year old. Had a bandana around his head, hair, just a typical looking Apache Indian. This left arm was artificial and this right leg was artificial. and he walked up to me. When he got close to me, I could smell the alcohol on his breath. And I said, "Buddy, do you need something from the Lord?" He said, "I don't want to hate no more." Said, "I'm tired of being bitter." &gt;&gt; And I looked at him and thought, "Poor old fella. They took his land away from him, put him on a reservation, probably drafted him into the army, probably lost that arm and leg in Vietnam. He laid his I'll never forget this. He laid his head over on my shoulder, a 69year-old Apache Indian and cried like a baby. Said, "Lead me to that Jesus you're preaching about." &gt;&gt; And I prayed for that man. And about a month later, I called brother Kevin down there and we was talking. I said, "How's my buddy doing?" He said, "Well, brother Daryl said he did real good." Said, "He come to church about two weeks and he quit coming." I said, "Quick coming? Why did he quit coming?" He said he took sick and died. I said died. He said yeah. He said you know brother D said I went down there to the to his house to pay the respects to the family and said you know brother Kevin said he died so peaceful after that meeting that you had up there. He died so peaceful. And I said Kevin what what happened to his arm and leg? Do you know what happened to it? He said he lost it in Vietnam. But here's a man who had been bitter ALL HIS LIFE. SHACKLED BY BITTERNESS. SHACKLED by hatred, HATED THE WHITE MAN, HATED ANYTHING, HATED THE GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; But in the last few weeks of his life, &gt;&gt; Jesus unshackled him. Let me tell you something, friend. You never know when it's going to happen to you. &gt;&gt; You need to be ready. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm young. Yeah. So is my sister-in-law. She was eight when she got killed. You never know. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you ain't ready, make sure you're ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same God that unshackled these that we looked at in the Bible that unshackled that Apache, I want you to know that he's in this building this morning. &gt;&gt; The trouble with so many people that they look for God to be a million miles away somewhere when God is right here in your midst right now. Think of it. The one who loves you, the one you serve is here. He spoke these words. Wherever two or THREE ARE GATHERED IN MY NAME, I WILL BE IN THEIR MIDST. &gt;&gt; You said, "Bro, brother D, I I'm the least one. I'm the least one of all the people. I'm just the souls of his feet." BUT REMEMBER, HE'S TRIUMPHED WITH YOU. AMEN. HE'S TRIUMPHED WITH YOU OVER EVERY BIT OF IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVEN IF YOU'RE THE SOS OF HIS FEET, EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY DEVIL, EVERY POWER, EVEN DEATH ITSELF is under your feet. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. IF I COULD JUST GET THE CHURCH TO SEE THAT, WE WOULD HAVE A TRIUMPH CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That all evil is under him. And we are in him. So, you're dealing with a defeated enemy. Sickness is defeated. Death is defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything is defeated. People come up for prayer say, "Well, the devil told me this and the devil told me that and the devil said." AND I THINK, "WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO HIM? YOU KNOW HE'S A LIAR." &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE'S THE FATHER OF LIES. &gt;&gt; But you see, the good news is this morning is that Christ died in the sinner's place. Christ took the sick man's place. Christ took the sinner's place. He took the worried man's place. He took the maniac's place. He took the addicted man's place. &gt;&gt; Christ took every place. and freed us from every affliction, every sin that the devil has put us in his PRISON HOUSE BY. HE has unshackled us. &gt;&gt; He come to pardon us freely. Everything goes free. &gt;&gt; For whom the son made free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Jesus died to heal us. Let me just a few. I'll hurry. Every one of you in this building this morning is healed. Every one of you is healed right now. Jesus has already healed you. &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it, believe it, and confess it. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, WE WERE PAST THIS. BY HIS STRIPES, WE WERE HEALED. &gt;&gt; When he DIED AT CALVARY, THAT'S WHEN HE OVERCOME ALL SICKNESS, ALL SIN, AND ALL. AT CALVARY, HE DONE IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Just like a table THAT'S GOING TO BE SET FOR THANKSGIVING. AND SOME OF YOU, ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS SHOW UP AT THE HOUSE AND SIT OUT AND EAT. EVERYTHING'S THE NAPKIN, THE FORKS, THE DRINK, the plate, the chicken, THE TURKEY. EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is sit down and eat &gt;&gt; cuz it's already been paid for. It's already been provided for. &gt;&gt; Here. Not long ago, I was in a restaurant and I I the the waitress come by and said, "Is there anything else?" I said, "Just the bill." She said, "Well," said someone saw you in here and paid for your food. She said, "So if there's nothing else, you're free to go." And I said, "Well, let me leave a tip." She said, "No, no, tip. Everything's took care of. So if there's nothing else, YOU'RE FREE. JUST GO. You can go." Now, I could have argued. I could have looked around and said, "Ma'am, there ain't nobody in this restaurant I know. Are you sure you're talking about me? I could have argued. I could have debated. I could have even tried to pay for it myself." Or I could ACCEPT THE FACT THAT someone &gt;&gt; provided a meal FOR ME AND WALK OUT THAT DOOR WITH A BELLY full of steak. So what do you think I did? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. I went right out that door because someone provided a meal &gt;&gt; for me here. year. A few years ago, I was preaching in Manny, Louisiana. And every every year, I would preach the second week of February. So, I'd get my ticket in November to fly down there and I get the seat that I wanted to sit on. So, I went down and preached to come up to Alexandria, Louisiana, and fly home. This man come sit down beside me. He said, "Hello." I said, "Howdy." He said, "Howdy. Where you from?" I said, "Tennessee." He said, "Tennessee?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, what brought you down here?" I said, "I'm a preacher." "Oh, you're a preacher?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, since you're a preacher, let me ask you a question." I said, "Well, buddy, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but if I can help you, I'd be glad to do it." He said, "My my daughter is getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport." Said, "I was looking on the internet." Said, "I come across something so unusual. I want to ask you about it." I said, "Well, if I can help you, I'd be glad to do it." He said, "Have you ever heard of a man by the name of William Brandon?" I said, "Yes, sir. His grandkids go to my church." He did not stop talking all the way to Atlanta, Georgia. And when we got off the airplane and shook hands and said, "God bless you." He went one way, I was walking down concourse D in Atlanta airport. And I got to thinking three months before that man ever knew he had a question, God had the answer set beside him. &gt;&gt; And everything that you have need of was already provided before you came through those doors this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to accept it, believe it, and in your heart confess it. He's the high priest of your confession. &gt;&gt; When he died for the sins of the world there at Calvary, he healed you. He healed every one of you. And you're already healed. You're already forgiven of your sins if you'll just accept it. &gt;&gt; When the people realize that you're not, not you will be, BUT YOU ARE PRESENT TENSE, RIGHT? NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMEDAY, SOME HAPPY DAY. I WON'T NEED IT THEN. I NEED IT NOW. &gt;&gt; PUSH IT OFF IN THE MILLENNIUM SOMEWHERE. THE BLESSINGS OUT IN THE millennium somewhere. WE WON'T NEED DIVINE healing in the millennium. IT'S WE NEED IT NOW. &gt;&gt; We won't be sons of God. BUT YOU'RE NOW SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, JOINT HES WITH JESUS CHRIST. EVERYTHING JESUS DIED FOR AT CALVARY IS IN YOUR POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; You already own it. It's like looking for your keys and they're in your pocket or looking for your glasses and they're on your head. &gt;&gt; Well, some of you ain't old enough, but you will be. But you say Satan don't like that. If the people only realize if they'd be WILLING TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD, it's unlimited. What could happen? Think about this. THERE'S OVER 7,000 promises in the Bible, &gt;&gt; and every one of them belongs to you. They are in your possession. &gt;&gt; You see, the trouble of Christians today is they don't realize what's provided for them. &gt;&gt; They don't realize the glories and the powers that's been provided. Coming into Jesus Christ is like walking into an arcade. &gt;&gt; Like a great department store. &gt;&gt; Somebody gave you a department store and you walk in to see what you have. Can you imagine if Walmart called you up and said, "We just found out that you're an heir to Sam Walton." So, Walmart belongs to you. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know that's right. Can you imagine walking into Walmart and you own it? Honey, if I own Walmart, I wouldn't get the Great Value chips. &gt;&gt; I'd get the real Doritos. Can I get an amen? Think about that. Well, how great that would be. BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU THIS MORNING IS GREATER THAN SAM WALTON. [Applause] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN, WALK AROUND AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU BELONG. FIND OUT WHAT HE HAS UNSHACKLED US AND SET US FREE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me hurry. Amen. Unshackled. Unshackled. You know, sometimes people give their heart to the Lord and they're doing so good and then they kind of stumped their toe, mess up, maybe fall back into something they've done before and then they feel so guilty and they feel like there's no hope for them. But I want you to understand if you have stumped your toe this morning, that does not take away what Jesus done for you. You just get up, knock the dust off, and go again. Huh? &gt;&gt; It's just like that eagle was in the pee and that's all. You caged down here in sin, but you DON'T WANT TO BE THERE, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU TRIPPED UP. SOMETHING TRIED TO TIE YOU BACK UP. &gt;&gt; BUT you're free this morning. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you're looking up. That's the reason something in you is longing for something better than what you've got. It's a deep calling unto the deep. You see, it reminds me of a story one time of this farmer. This crow was eating all his corn. So he coughed this crow and he tied it up and no corn he the crow ate all the corn around him till there was no more corn to eat. BUT HE WAS TIED UP. HE COULDN'T FLY AWAY AND HE JUST ABOUT STARVED TO DEATH. HE TIED THE CROW BY ITS FOOT. AND SO THE OTHERS HE JUST LEFT HIM THERE TIED UP, SHACKLED, COULDN'T FLY AWAY. AND THE OTHER CROWS WOULD FLY OVER AND THEY'D SAY, "COCK, COME ON, JOHNNY. IT'S GETTING COLD. WINTER'S COMING. WE'VE GOT TO FLY AWAY." BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT. No matter how much he wanted to fly, he was tied. So one day a certain fellow come BY AND SEEN THIS OLD CROW TIED UP AND HE WENT OVER AND CAUGHT HIM AND UNTIED HIM. SAID, "GO ON, BOY. You're free. You're free." But he just kept walking around and here COME THE CROWS OVER. COME ON, JOHNNY. COME ON. WE GOT TO GO. He was as free as the rest of them. But he wouldn't go. He was so used to being tied. &gt;&gt; He thought he was still tied. &gt;&gt; But in reality, he was unshackled. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Think about that. And you might have had an affliction FOR SO LONG. YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A BESETTING SIN FOR SO LONG THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE STILL TIED. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; You may think THE DEVIL'S GOT YOU TIED DOWN, BUT HE'S LYING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; One time a man COME TO THE EARTH NAMED JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, AND HE UNTIED US. &gt;&gt; SATAN'S LYING to us. &gt;&gt; You don't have to STAY DOWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY BOUND. YOU'RE FREE. HE DIED IN YOUR PLACE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SINS. JUST FLOP YOUR WINGS. JUST FLY WITH THE REST OF THEM. &gt;&gt; Don't stay in that pit of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me close with this. I was driving down to Kentucky here a while back to preach. There's a long stretch of flat road. And as I was driving down the road, I looked off to my left and there was a beautiful bald eagle and he lit up out of a tree and I was looking because he was out there in front of me. There's a roadkill on the road. And how long it' been there, I don't know, but it was definitely a roadkill. And the eagle come out of the tree and he flew down and grabbed this roadkill up off the road. Well, I was trying to find my phone because I wanted to video that and I was trying to drive and find the phone. And it kept slowing down and slowing down and I was watching him and he lifted up off the ground and he was trying to fly with this roadkill. I think it was a raccoon. I wasn't sure. But anyway, he was trying to fly with this roadkill. But the kill was heavier than he had the ability to carry. And he was flopping his wings, but he wasn't getting no elevation. And I was getting closer and closer and closer. And finally, he realized, I've got to let it go. And when he dropped the roadkill, he flapped him wings and he flew off over my car like that and went away. And I thought, you know, we're God's eagles. Sometimes things get into our lives that we try to fly with. &gt;&gt; We'll pick up fear or we'll pick up worry or we'll pick up a besetting sin or we'll you &gt;&gt; and YOU TRY TO FLY WITH IT. BUT IT KEEPS YOU FROM GAINING ELEVATION. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you just have to let it go. &gt;&gt; I was in a hotel room and I was thinking of sermons for young people. Had the young people's meetings coming up and I thought, you know, at that time Frozen, that Disney movie Frozen was out. I've never seen it, but Frozen movie was out, you know, and a lot of people sung songs about Let It Go and all that and all that that went with that movie. And I thought, well, maybe that'd be something. No doubt some of these young people saw that and that's maybe that would be a good thought. So, I just wrote on a piece of paper, let it go. And I go off to preach. And when I came back to the hotel room, my notepad was laying there, but there was some words wrote underneath it that I didn't write. It wasn't even my writing. And I thought, "What in the world?" And I got closer to it. And I picked it up. You know what it said? It was from the housekeeper. It said, "Thank you today for that. I needed to hear it. Let it go. Let it go. Oh eagles of God, those things that bound you, those things that hold you down, those loads that you try to carry, those things that are weighing you down, just let it go. &gt;&gt; You're already free. Let that grudge go. Let that anger go. Let that fear go. Let that oppression go. Let it go. Let that sickness, you don't you don't have to carry that anymore. You're free. for whom the sonath made free as free indeed. &gt;&gt; You're a free son. You're a free daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let it go. &gt;&gt; You know, we're the only people that unpack to go on a trip. &gt;&gt; We need to unpack because we're going to leave here one morning between 6:00 and 9 in a moment, and a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads. If I kept you long, I'm sorry, but just try to bring something to you. Amen. Heavenly Father, how we love you today. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. It was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransom me. And like a flood, [Music] his mercy reigns. Unending love. Amazing grace. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransom me. And like a flood his mercy reigns unending love. Amazing grace. Thank you Lord. Thank you for unshackling us Lord. Lord, in this season of thanksgiving, Lord, I am thankful for so many things. But Lord God, I am so thankful that you took the chains off of me and said I could go free. Lord, I pray if there's someone here today, Lord, you know, in my heart, I I hadn't even planned on preaching this message this morning, but early this morning, it came upon my heart, Lord. And I pray, Father God, if there's someone here that don't know you, maybe Lord, Satan's lied to them and tell them there's no hope for you, you'll never be anything. But Lord, may they not believe that lying devil this morning, but they that believe your word for your word, oh God, said we could go free. Lord, the same God that freed that man in Nicaragua is the same God that freed that woman in the Bible. The same God that gave blind Barameus his eyesight back is the same God who gave my daughter her eyesight back. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. God, I pray this morning, Lord, may the people, dear God, take this simple thought, Lord, and may they say, "I'm just going to let it go. I'm not going to hold that grudge. I'm not going to I'm not going to hold that no more. Anything that would hinder me from drawing closer to God, I'm going to let it go this morning." If there would be one here that would raise your hand and say, "Brother Daryl, would you just remember me in prayer? I've been shackled for years. I've been I've let the devil lie to me. Tell me there's no hope for me, but I see this morning he has unshackled me. I'm free. I just need to accept it this morning. Would you just slip up your hand and say, "Would you remember me in prayer?" God bless that hand. That hand, that hand. God bless that hand. That hand there. God bless your hand. Your hand. Yes. God bless you back there. There. There. Oh my. All over the building. There. There. God bless you there. Yes. God bless you. God bless you, sis. God bless you. Amen. Anyone else? Anyone else? You say, "Bro, brother, how how long does it take Jesus to forgive me? As long as it takes you to ask, as long as it takes you to ask, my sins are gone. I've been set free." Anyone else would just like to raise your hand this morning? Say, "Would you remember me?" Or perhaps you you've accepted that, but you've let Satan tie you down with some kind of ideal or some kind of habit. that there are things on the internet that you shouldn't be looking at. Maybe they've got you bound up in your life and you feel so guilty that you can't even raise your hand in church, but he come to set you free this morning. You don't have to carry that no more. I say let it go. Just lay it at his feet. Like a few years ago when I was in Chief Alaska, this young girl came up addicted to alcohol. She said, "I've got a little boy. I don't know who the daddy was cuz I was con he was conceived when I was drunk." said, "I've been through the ninestep program three different times. I cannot stop drinking." And I said, "Sis," she said, "Brother, I've tried everything." I said, "Have you tried Jesus? You just lay that alcohol down and pick up his freedom." And when I began to pray for that girl, I'll never forget it. She screamed out to the top of her lungs, "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." But I was just up there just a couple of months ago, and she came up to me said, "Brother Darl, I'm still sober." Oh my. That's the God we serve today. And if you're here, you just slip up your head. Say, "Would you remember me in prayer, brother D? I've got this I've got this thing that ties me down, but I want to let it go today in the name of Jesus." Yes. God bless those standing. God bless you. God bless you. Yes. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just pray for our sisters just a moment and we'll pray. Amen. [Music] Set free. [Music] I just pray [Music] my daughter [Music] in the name of Jesus. Father [Music] Jesus Christ. [Music] Hallelujah. Now, let's just stand to our feet, can't we, everyone? Now, let's just stand to our feet if you're able. And here's what I want us to do. Let's just lay hands on one another and pray for one another. We're a body of believers today. It might have been your brother. It might have been your sister, your husband, your wife that raised their hand that has a need this morning. Oh my. On this Thanksgiving week, let us come, oh my, by Thursday with a great shout of thanksgiving because those things that have hindered us has said we've been set free today. Amen. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we don't see all things, but we do see Jesus. And Lord, I know God, this little broke up mess. Lord, I I ain't no kind of a preacher, Lord. I know I'm not. But, Father, you know my heart today. Lord, it was on my heart to bring this word to the people. And God, may we realize today, but what you have already done for us. We who was bound is tied up where it seemed like there was no way out, but you have unshackled us today. And you said we shall go free. And Lord, you see the hands that was raised, my brothers, MY SISTER THAT RAISED THEIR HANDS TODAY. I ask you, Father God, in the name of Jesus, may you move, God, from one to the other to the other. Flow through us, Holy Spirit. Oh God, MAY WE HEAR THE CHAINS fall off. My chains are gone. I'm free today. I'm free today. The blood of THE LAMB OF GOD HAS made me free. WHAT A THANKSGIVING. WHAT A DAY. WHAT AN HOUR TO BE LIVING IN WHEN THE WORLD is bound. Oh God, THIS NATION IS BOUND. OH GOD, BY THEIR BY THEIR IDEALS, LORD, and their political views, but oh GOD, YOU HAVE LIBERATED US, LORD. You have liberated US BY THE POWER OF the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And we accept it today in the name of Jesus Christ. SATAN, YOU'RE A LIAR. COME OUT OF THE people in the name of Jesus Christ. I receive it today. I receive MY FORGIVENESS. I RECEIVE MY FREEDOM. I receive my deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ. in the name of Jesus Christ. Or if you believe it today, if you believe it today, lift your hand up to him and say, "I receive it today." In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace. My sins are gone. I've been set free. [Music] My God, my Savior has ransomed me. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for saving me. Great unending love. Oh, let's sing it again. As brother Matt comes with all the hearts. Do you believe it now? Are gone. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending blood. Amazing grace. Amen. You know, I just reminded of the prophet tells the story of being in that museum and there was a a black man standing there looking into a display window and the man jumped back and started crying, started to pray. And the prophet went over to him and said, "Sir, I I saw you there and I saw you jump back and start to pray and said, I I I don't want to be nosy, but could you tell me what excited you so much?" And he said, "Look yonder." He said, "I looked there was a dress." and said it was just a dress. He said, "But look on the corner of that dress. You see the corner of that dress? It's a blood stain." Said, "That's the blood of Abraham Lincoln." He said, "I have scars on my side from a slave belt, but the blood of Abraham Lincoln took the slave belt off of me." And the prophet said, "I put my arm around him and I said, "Brother, that's a wonderful story, &gt;&gt; but I tell you one greater than that. We wore the slave belt of Satan. If he told me to drink, I drank. If he told me to lie, I lied. Come on, somebody. If he told me to do things I shouldn't do, I done it cuz I was his slave. BUT ONE DAY, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST TOOK THAT SLAVE FELL OFF OF ME. AND TODAY, I AM FREE. FREE. FREE. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Happy Thanksgiving. Mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace. Oh, the Lord has promised good to me. His word my faith secures. [Music] He will my shield and portion me. As long as life endures, my chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my savior, he has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace. I say like a flood his mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace. How many's been set free this morning? Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Well, I'm free. [Music] Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer bound, no more chains holding me. My soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free. I say I'm free. Praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer bound, no more flesh holding me. My soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free. Amen. If you ain't free this morning, you come to a place to get it. For the Bible said, "Cast your burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee." You know what I find out wonderful? I thank God that his word is not limited by human circumstances, but God's word is unlimited. And if he said, "Cast your burden on me," it don't matter how big the burden is or how big the pressure is. We got we got a place that we can take it this morning and we can come out on the other side. Say, "I am free." Praise the Lord. The devil don't win the battles. no longer bound. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, my soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free. Oh, I say I'm free. No longer bound. No change holding me. My soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free. Amen. How many enjoyed that message this morning? Amen. What a reminder, testimony after testimony that no matter what the shackle is, he told us of some that had their hands shackled, some their heart was shackled, some their spirit was shackled, some their their flesh, their body, a sickness, no matter what kind of shackle it was. But there's one thing in common that Jesus Christ set you free from every one of them. I believe that this morning. I believe there ain't but one place that you can go. Amen. And we can try a lot of things to try to be freed and things that bind us in our life. And there's a lot of lot of ways to try to get rid of it, but you'll find this to be the truth. It'll always come back until Jesus Christ takes that place in your life. It'll constantly come back. And the Bible says that he said even after a spirit has gone out of a man, he'll wander around in the wilderness and he'll come back to that place and find him that it's uninhabited. Even though a spirit has left you, and you could have a spirit prayed off of you and completely gone out of your life, but it'll come back and find that house uninhabited. And he'll come back into the house, but bring with him seven of his friends, seven other spirits worse than that second state of a man is worse than the first state of a man. Isn't that an odd thing that even after a man is delivered of something, he winds up worse than he was before he was delivered because he never had the house inhabited. So, don't just try to get rid of things in your life or take things out of your life or or cast things off of your life, but try to fill your life and add things to your life and and bring something in your life that is satisfying a hungry soul this morning. Amen. Jesus Christ is the only thing that can do that. And I believe what brother Daryl preached this morning. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. It don't matter what the devil tells you. I know he tries to put us down. And remember, we're not having a a service on Wednesday night. We're going to come back Sunday uh just uh having a a wonderful time of Thanksgiving uh with the families. I know many will be gone in different places for Thanksgiving. So uh just go and be a uh be a testimony and have a good time with your family and just have this week an opportunity to be a a witness and just rejoicing in the things that God has done for us. Amen. How many is a thankful Christian this morning? Amen. And we got we got so many things to thank him for. And I I'll tell you what we do. And whenever that old depression and all those things come around, it's just something about it. Whenever there's a joy that comes to the church that right behind it, there's a devil to try to rob you from it. Just a little bit of joy, a little bit revival, and Satan's always trying to take it. But you just turn around and tell the devil this morning that you're going to go on anyway. I'm going to go on and serve the Lord, and I'm going to go on and be a Christian, and I'm going to go on and have my revival, and and you're not going to take it from me because I'm free this morning. And God sent a word all the way from Tennessee to remind you that you've been set free by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. So, we're not going to walk around with our heads down. I'm going to walk around with my head held high. Amen. Like that that that story of the slave. Remember, they came in and a guy was trying to to purchase him and and here he was in slavery and all bound up, but he was over there rejoicing and singing. And he said, "I I want to get I want that guy." And he said, "That guy can't go nowhere. He's not for sale." And he said, "Well, why not?" And he said, well, he he said, he seems to be the happiest one. He's out here like that. What would So he went and asked him, why why in the world do you act that way here? You're bound up. You're a slave. You're working. You can't even have no freedom, but still you act like all this and joy in your heart. He said, because over in his country where he come from, where he was taken, that man's father is a king. And he knows that in his veins flows the blood of a king. No matter where you put him, no matter how many chains you put on him, no matter how many times he he would he would be bound, he knows and that where he come from his lineage, that he's the father or he's the son of a king. And I thought, you know what? That's the way it is with the believers this morning. It don't matter what Satan tries to bind you with and what chain you're under. Why is it the devil would look at you, that old devil, that come over and try to purchase and try to take you and and say, "But you know, there's something about him that's free anyhow because I know that I'm a child of a king this morning. He's the king of kings and I'm his son." How many can raise your hand this morning and say, "I'm a child of a kings." God bless you as you go and may you have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood now flows in my veins and thy who was wretched and poor now can see. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the king. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood now now flows in my veins. And I who was wretched and poor now can sing. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the King. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh. I'm a child of the King. His royal blood now flows in my veins. And I who was wretched and poor now can sing. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the King. Well, I'm going on with Jesus. just the same. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Baby, you might talk about me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on with Jesus just the same. We're going on with Jesus just the same. I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Will you false accuse me? scandalize my name, but I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, some people may laugh, talk about me when I shout, but there's one thing I know. I know what I'm shouting about. Well, Satan tries to stop me. Put stumb blocks in my way. I stand up for my Lord and this is what I say. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might talk about me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on with Jesus just the same. The devil ways a straight way. It has no crooks and miss. Got to go on with Jesus. I know he's my best friend. When the enemy is all around me and sorrow fills my eyes, I fall down on my bending knees. I rise up with a smile. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might accuse me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Are you going on? Are you going on? Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might false accuse me, scandalize my name, but I'm going [Music]
