Lord You've established us in your word and Lord I ask Lord this morning that you would come and you would anoint this Lord knowing that we may not know everything in the Bible we may not get

Lord let that Spirit of lukewarmness fall from every man and Lord let us be on fire for God when we leave this place Lord I ask you now and we'll give you the glory for everything that's done and said in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning how many says amen Amen Let the church say amen amen it's sure good to be in the house of the Lord this morning let's just turn to the word of God and we're going to read from John the 11th chapter and we'll we'll read out the 11th verse and I'll give you uh just a moment to get there and John 11 and 11 my just uh just been rejoicing all week and just to be able to to to read and and to study and uh think of the time that we live in and what a great age that we live in and uh brother Jared to be around the Believers that we have and what a a fellowship uh group if you want to call it that it's the body of Christ and and what a wonderful body of Fellowship that we have and uh so thankful for everything that God does amen amen we just want to read from John the 11th chapter we're going to read out the 11th verse and Jesus is speaking to the disciples and in the middle of the verse he the Bible says he said unto them our friend Lazarus Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may wake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep well he should do well but how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought he spoke of him taking a rest and sleep and said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said Thomas which is called dimus unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he was laying in a grave for 4 days already now Bethany was nine to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews had come to Martha and to Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she had heard that Jesus was was coming she went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had us been here my brother would have not died but I know that even now whatsoever Thou shalt ask of God God would give it to thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day but Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats I want to speak on this subject of a witness of the Resurrection a witness of the Resurrection in the message of the Easter seal I just thought this was wonderful I'd like to read this this morning as we get started butam said I'm wondering today is what's happening are we really getting people to God or are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ where there is a quickening power see it's good to go to church sure if that's as far as we go it's not far enough but when you come to church that's good but go on into Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that General Resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead for if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will also quicken in other words it'll bring life to these mortal bodies what a promise that is unto us see the very essence of a res that Jesus is raised from the dead I thought what a a thought this morning on a witness of a resurrection how many knows what a witness is see a witness is one who sees something or experiences something and a matter of fact if you went if if uh if we were in a courtroom this morning uh and and you were you were trying a case and what you would do is you'd bring Witnesses before the court and and and those Witnesses the purpose of a witness is to vindicate something that had happened so I I I would want to plead my case and I'm talking to the jury and and and I want him to see my side of things and Brother David so what I would do is I would bring a witness that was an eyewitness i' bring a witness that heard something or that saw something or or that had an experience that would help uh uh cost to jury to be able it would help their eyes see uh they weren't there when it took place but a witness would be something would help their eyes to be able to open up to what really happened that they might make a rightful judgment so in other words a witness is somebody that saw something but uh but really A Witness is a Vindication that something actually happened and I think I think about that this morning of how that throughout the Bible that there 4,000 years of recorded history that lays in this Bible and and Brother David in this scriptures of all these uh 4,000 years there are you you find out that every major event that ever took place in the Bible every major thing from the time of creation that God ever done there has always been a witness brother said he said God has never at any time left himself without a witness somebody is going to witness God I thought you know isn't it something when you look through the script scriptures you'll find out uh you go all the way back to the days of Noah and in a in a time when the world was so such a terrible place the Bible said that men's thoughts were on evil continually it was a it was such a wicked time and a wicked world and a time that was so wicked that God would bring judgment upon the world but I thought even in that time of judgment in the time of wickedness but here was a man named Noah the Bible said that was righteous before God he was a man that walked upright before God so even in the time of wickedness and even in the time of of people that had their mind on evil but still yet there was a witness that that that that still believed God and I thought here was Mo you say well what did Noah witness I'll tell you what he witnessed he witnessed the death of the earth he watched the as the Earth was buried in a water burial and how the life had gone out from it I thought isn't it something that it was Noah was the man that stood there on the side of the ark that day and he and he let loose a dove to go out and he would find that life had resurrected on the earth they were searching ing for signs of Life see he was a witness for God and you know he wasn't the only witness I if I had time this morning I'd go through all of them but but he was but there was another man by the name of Abraham and Abraham was a man that left his whole family to be a witness for God and maybe sometimes he you know his family may have wondered Abraham where you going and why are you wandering off out there in the wilderness and it looked like he was leaving the homestead and he was he was leaving the way he was raised but you realize that Abraham wasn't running from something he was running to something he he was following what God had put on his heart to do and although people may have wondered what he was up to but Abraham he was a witness of God and he was the one that sat there whenever judgment struck the very city of Sodom it was Abraham that set off on the Wayside that witnessed the Judgment of God as it fell upon on that Mighty City see he was a witness of God in the days of Ahab there was a in in Jezebel and how that this Ahab which was a a great king of Israel and you know the Bible would tell us how he done many wicked things and evil things in the sight of the Lord and how that how that his wife had brought idolatry into the the Kingdom of Israel and and in this time that God had brought this Great Famine or or great drought upon the region and and and here these these great prophets of baale would gather together and talk about how great their God was and how that if they would worship this God Bale that they maybe he would bring them some rain and bring life back to them but in the time when it looked like that all of Israel had turned their back on God and it looked like that every prophet and every preacher and and the king and the Queen and all of them had turned their back on God but there stood a man by the name of Elijah that was still a witness of God and the Bible says that Elijah went up on a mountain and on that mountain brother Wesley let me tell you what happened they went to build an altar and they were calling for their God and they were saying that if he would come he would bring water but but Elijah knowing that their God had no power he said I'll tell you what we'll do we'll just put a challenge and we'll find out who God is and who God ain't see he was a witness for God and he stood there without any Ro without any water he stood there without any fire he stood there without seemingly there to be any God up on the mountain and he testified of how great God was in the time of a drought he testified of God in the time of of people turning their back on God he testified of God and he said I'll tell you what we'll do we'll just feel the altar full of water and we'll let the god that anth by fire be the god of Heaven and the Bible said he called upon the name of the Lord and the Lord answered his prayer why because he was a witness of God God has always had a witness it was that way in the days of job whenever everything in job's life fell apart and he lost his family and and his household he lost his Barns and his business and all and and the workers and the and everything that he had but you realize that when all of job everything of job had fell away that even his own wife would come to him and she' say job why don't you just curse God and die but job would not go away from his witness of Jehovah God his testimony remained the same even in this lowly place that he got in you think about how low low down that job got that he would even talk to God he would say what happens to a man when he dies what does he just fade away or does he cease to exist or does he go back to the dust to the ground and only a fading memory of him remains he had these questions because he had lost so many loved ones but notice what job had he caught a re a revelation of the resurrection and even in this low time in this place where he felt like giving up in this place where a man couldn't be any lower than job was he said for I know that my redeemer liveth and he that that he shall stand in the latter day upon the Earth and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I will see God I shall see him for myself and my eyes Shall Behold Him He was a witness for God oh I to think even in the worst place of his life with that Revelation he still testified of God see friends it don't matter how bad it gets it don't matter what kind of state we get into it don't matter what kind of condition we may find oursel in in the lowest place the revelation of a resurrection is what's going to bring you through it it don't matter if you lose everybody it don't matter if you lose everything it's the revelation of the Resurrection that'll bring you through to another day you say brother Matt well that was good for Noah and that was good for Elijah and that was good for job but what about me hello somebody what about right now what about us What About Us in 20124 what what about me and the things I'm going through right now but man said well we know that in any age all through every age he said God has always had his witness on the earth he's never been without without a witness are you ready for it he said and he never will be without a witness that means right now today that God still has a witness upon the Earth in the middle of this year when it seems like everybody has turned their back on God when it seems like the world is going another way but God even today still has a witness upon the Earth you say I've never witnessed God in that way I've never witnessed the supernatural I've never seen the the pillar of fire I've never seen God move in a in in in Miracles I've never seen healing i' I've never seen the power of God in any way I've been to church for for all my life but I've never seen God moveing that way I've never seen a sign of his resurrection I've never experienced that kind of a God but did you ever think of this friends that maybe that your approach to God has been wrong all along maybe it's your approach to God that keeps you from seeing the things of God you realize that your approach to God and your approach approach to the word is what brings the power of the Resurrection your approach to God is what brings healing your approach to God is what brings salvation you realize that I believe that God is a just God how many say amen I don't believe God is unjust I don't go I don't think God goes and picks some people over another out of unjustness but God is a just God he's a righteous God and I believe that if God will do something for one man he'll do the same thing for another man if that man will approach God the same way that the other man did if he'll meet him on the same grounds he'll do for you just like he done for another so if God healed one man he'll heal another man if he saved one man on those grounds he'll save another man on those grounds you say but what you got to do is you got to meet God on those grounds you say well well where can you meet him let me tell you what Moses did he was walking along one day and he looked up on a mountain and he saw a bush that was burning with a fire but it was not consumed and the Bible said that Moses went up there before God and God began to speak to him he said Moses take off your shoes for the ground that you're standing upon is a Holy Ground well let me tell you friends the ground Moses was was on it wasn't some Holy Dirt but it was the sacred Sands of the presence of almighty God and as Moses stood before the presence of God God said take off your shoes for you're standing on Holy Ground and the prophet of God said when you ever walk on them sacred Sands he said you'll come away a different person to walk on Holy Ground in the presence of God oh don't you realize if you ever walk on those grounds you'll be established in the word of God if you can ever walk on those grounds in the presence of God there ain't nobody will ever talk you out of it any longer if you never walk on those grounds there ain't nobody can explain it away from you he said because you were on those sacred grounds with God alone you know what happened you know God dealt with you you know God talked to you you know you had a conference with God you know God established you you know he saved you you know he filled you with the Holy Ghost and there ain't no man can take it away from you cuz you've been on a sacred ground with God and God alone and your whole life has changed you become a new creature in Christ and then there ain't enough glory to God hallelujah it makes me feel like preaching he said then there ain't enough devils in hell that can take it away from you you become a new creature a new creation inoculated with the power of almighty God something happened to you let me tell you you say well where is this place that I can meet God where is this place that I could call Holy Ground friends let me tell you something it can be anywhere it can be on a church bench it can be at an altar it can be in a car driving down the road it can be out in the woods out on a deer stand it might be over in the wilderness it might be on a riverbank somewhere but let me tell you those holy grounds can be anywhere it reminds me of a story brother Bown told one time of about that FBI Captain you remember you remember his name was Al alar he and he said you know he had came to me and and he wanted me to meet him so I went down to the office to meet him down there and here he was a of course being a captain he said I went down in in in in the below the the place there was a shooting gallery he said I went down to the shooting gallery said well what' you call me here for he said well you know he said I heard you I heard you preach and you know I've been always I've been a a Christian and and you know I I heard you used to be a Baptist and I'm a Baptist and and you know you know there but I but there's some places that I haven't been able to get with God I heard you preaching about this Holy Ghost and I know that I've never met him I know that I've never had that kind of experience and said I just you know I thought that that maybe that that Holy Ghost That Life of Christ would come and and he could come and meet me and he would dwell in me the way that you preach about him he said so you know he said my thoughts were he said I thought maybe I'll go rent me a hotel suite somewhere I mean you know I he had a little bit of money and maybe I can go rent the at a fine hotel and get me a suite somewhere and we'll I'll dress up in a nice suit and and then we'll maybe you can come up there and you can invite the Lord to come and I'll have a meeting with him over there in the hotel that I can have the Holy Ghost B said I told him I said sir it ain't going to take no hotel suite for you to meet him he said well where would he meet me at he said he'll meet you right here he said you mean the Son of God would come down here in a shooting gallery to meet me he said he'll meet you anywhere he said this one I'm talking about he met a man one time in the belly of a well he met met another man in a fiery furnace he met a little woman one time at a Samaritan well he met zakus when he was up in a tree he met Peter over by a riverbank he'll meet you anywhere let me tell you friends if you want to have a meeting with Jesus those holy grounds or wherever you'll meet God he met me on a road on the side of a road in a car in the middle of Arizona he met Josh Lawson sitting at her kitchen table and he'll meet you here this morning but man said he'll meet you on any ground that you'll meet him on hello somebody he said cuz God wants to meet you he wants to talk it over with you and he'll come wherever you are you say well I'm not worthy to meet him I say Amen I'm not good enough to meet him amen I I'm not righteous enough to meet God Amen and none of us are and we never will be there ain't nothing you could put on to make you worthy I thought isn't it something that's in order to meet God we're we're all unworthy to meet him but what brought our unworthiness can I take a minute what brought our unworthiness it wasn't something that you done but it was something that happened in the in the garden the fall that took place in the garden and how that they had fell away from the grace of God and he that they had that that they had they had uh broken the Covenant that God had made with man and because of it it brought this great fall but notice what happened as soon the as the first man fell the Bible says but then God went down to meet him isn't there something after man fell the first thing you see after the fall was God going into the garden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou isn't it something the first man that sinned I don't know about y'all but that does something to me this morning the first man that ever sinned it brought God down to a place searching for a meeting place with that man even though the man was unrighteous hello even though he was unworthy even though he had fell into sin even though he had turned turned his back on God but the first time a man fell it brought God on the scene searching for a meeting place with God and notice what God did the first time that he came to meet a man after he fell the Bible says that God slew a lamb and he made a covering for him he wasn't righteous but God covered him in order that he could meet him he made a covering for him that he would be able to stand in the presence of God I thought my isn't it something all the way through the Old Testament you see this same thing taking place how was men and families that they would go and they would make they would take sacrifices and and they would take them before the Lord and sacrifice an animal to make a covering for for for their sin that they would be able to stand in the presence of God and in the Old Testament you'll see that the worshipper he would always come to God with a blood covering of a sacrifice that he made see brother said that's why God only meets people under the shedding of the blood that's the only place he ever will all of Israel worshiped under the blood in the New Testament we find out it's the same way it's under the blood of a sacrifice but no longer was it of an animal but it was a human sacrifice he said see so God he'll never meet you under any Creed or under education or he'll never meet you under any denomination or some name he'll meet you under the blood and that is the only place so see now we have two things one the physical location don't matter and two that it just had to be under the blood you say well where does the blood cover where does where all does the blood cover cover what physical place will God go where where do this covering go to and I think about I think about the the vision that brother brandham had when he went that one day and went into that old restaurant and there was a you know the place in the front they they they were they had a little bar up there in the front of it he said I walked in and I got to look at all them people and thinking about the the sin that they had and what a just a mess of a condition they were all in he said I thought you I looked up there and there was an old lady sitting up in the front and or a young lady she was about 65 years old but there was a but she was sitting up there in the front said oh you know up there smoking a cigarette and drinking and and had on filthy looking clothes and all this and I thought my Lord why wouldn't you just wipe this place off the Earth if that if that would offend me how much it must offend a holy God he said I I thought about it I stepped outside and all of a sudden I went into a vision and then that Vision I looked and I saw the Earth and around the Earth Earth there was this red covering it was like a you know this I'm just saying it my own words but like this shield around the earth he said and I watched as as these these sins that that every time there was a sin that was committed it would hit that bumper he said I watched I looked up there and it was just dented like a like a bumper of a car where so many sins has HIIT it and he said I thought I said Lord is that the sins of the world and he said no that is your sins how many that had had take place to where was so dented up but every time my sin would go forth that that bumper would catch it and he thought I looked at that and how that it was it was that way and I thought Lord how could you stand stand to look upon it and he said as I thought about it he said I looked and laying there there was a book that was open and it had my name on the top of the book and there were all kinds of dark streaks in it and I said Lord why don't you forgive me he said and I looked and Jesus was standing there and he said he dipped his finger in the in his side and he took blood from his side in this vision and he wrote on the book of my sins he wrote pardoned he said oh my how it made me feel good he said he wrote pardon and then he took the book and he threw it over behind him he said oh God how good that makes me feel that you would write pardon on my sins he said then the Lord looked at me he said I forgive you of your sins but now you want to blow her up he said I turned around and I went to where the woman was and I said lady I got something I want to tell you is this seat open and he got to witnessing to her and she told him she said you know she said I was raised in a Christian home my daddy was a Baptist preacher and I and I and he told me not to get married there was a boy he liked to drink he was an alcoholic and I got married and had a couple kids and and they and they they were raised in a Christian home and I I just went down the wrong path and I never thought I'd end up like this it must be over for me he said I sat there for a moment I said ma'am it ain't over for you he said but as long as you've got life you've got hope because the blood of the Lord Jesus has this world encircled glory to God and God can't even see your sins it don't matter where the meeting place is the blood of the Lord Jesus will cover it there ain't a place you can go on this Earth and meet God that the blood of the Lord Jesus won't cover it here she was sitting on a bar stool he said but someday when your life passes out beyond that Circle of the blood then you'll judge yourself but as long as you're in this earth there's still hope for you for the blood of Jesus Christ it circles the world he said and right on the floor of that little place that woman knelt down and she gave her heart to God and that woman that was dead she became alive right before my eyes and she went back home rejoicing and now she's living and she'll live forever more she has eternal life she was passed from Death under life because she accepted a blood covering friends that's what saved us many times I saw people that that that would sit down on the side of a road in India that knelt down and gave their heart to God I was sitting outside of a meeting one time when a young man walked out he said I missed my appointment with God when everybody came up to the Altar and I should have gave my heart to the God and and and I and I guess I've gone too far I said friend that altar ain't the place to meet God this altar is a place to meet God it don't matter where we're standing and the same God that'll meet you in front of the church is the same God that'll meet you right here and standing at his car he bowed his head and he gave his heart to Jesus Christ to recognize a blood covering is the meeting place of God he said he'll meet you under the blood no matter where it is as long as it's under the blood of Jesus Christ if you think about this this morning God is only obligated to send his word the way that he promised to send it Brother David then we're then we're obligated to either accept it or to reject it but do you realize that when people are searching for God they never realize how God is going to come you ever notice people are looking for God to speak but they don't know how God would speak but we see as Believers that God speaks to us by his word he uses ministers and the five-fold ministry and he uses his word to speaks to us it's not that God's going to come and speak out of some Cloud somewhere everybody's looking for some great vision or for something for some angel or something to appear to them and talk to them but God speaks to us by his word see see not that God wouldn't send an angel to speak to you but but we know God speaks by his word see see so when God sends his word whether you accept it or reject it will determine whether you accept God or reject God so when God would speak to you by his word brother says see when God sends a gift to the earth and the people reject it that generation goes into Blackness and darkness for rejecting God and God judges that Generation by the way that they judge his gifts that's what Jesus said remember he said the queen of the South will rise up in judgment against you because she traveled for many miles to find the wisdom of Solomon and a greater than Solomon is here the men of Nineveh will rise up in judgment against you because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and a greater than Jonah is here so see there was a gift that was upon the Earth and and here Jesus was speaking to them because they were rejecting the gift that God sent he was the greatest gift that God had ever sent he was he was trying to tell them that they had rejected the message that God had sent to them you think about it there was many that had done this same thing in Sodom notice what happened they rejected the message that God sent and it brought destruction to Sodom in the days of Noah they rejected the message of Noah it brought a flood upon the Earth and here when Jesus came they rejected the message that Jesus had and Jesus began to refer back and he would of how that there was some groups of people there were there were places that Generations that had accepted God and he gave illustrations of it he said in any generation that will receive receive God's gift or God's message listen to this friends it's so good any generation that will receive God's message that generation always prospered and become a great generation because it's the attitude that you take towards any Divine gift of God that brings forth the results that you get from it so when God sends a gift how you receive the gift of God is is how you'll get a result from that gift so when we're looking for God to do something see it's our approach to God you remember when Hezekiah he was l there on his deathbed looking at sick unto death the Bible said Isaiah the prophet came unto him and told him to get your house in order because Thou shalt surely die do you realize Hezekiah being a man he could have turned back to Isaiah and said I don't have to believe you because after all I've got other pastors and preachers that tell me that your words aren't true but he didn't do that the Bible said Hezekiah he heard the words of Isaiah and he turned his face to the wall and he cried out the Lord and he cried for mercy and he asked God he said Lord I've stood before you all my days I've done my best to serve you I pray you'd forgive me for my failures I pray you'd help me oh Lord Hear My Cry and God stopped his Prophet before he ever got too far he said turn back around and go tell Hezekiah he has 15 more years to live see it was his approach to God that brought him from Death under life see it's your approach to God regardless of the circumstance it's your approach to God that brings him presence regardless of the condition it's our approach to God that allows us to see the Miracles that God does I think about this this morning here we found Mary and Martha that had lost their brother Lazarus Lazarus as he was the Bible said they was friends of Jesus he had gone off and even when he heard he was sick he went on a two- days journey continued to tearry him after a little while the they came to him he told the disciples he said you know he said we've got to go back I've got a work to do we've got to go back and see Lazarus you know the disciples they well Lord you know if we go there that they you they were pretty upset at us last last time we were there you know I don't know if it's a good idea that we go into that country you know they they're pretty torn up the you know the Miracles and things that was performed and but Jesus when he when he told him he said but there's something there that I must go back the Bible says as they made this journey and he got down to where they were and he went to talking to Martha I love how that Martha approaches Jesus because when he speaks to her and he begins you know the first things out of her mouth she said Lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died look at the confidence that she had in him but nevertheless anything that you had asked the Father for I know he would do it I thought you know even when she made that statement I don't even think that she was referring to him raising him from the dead because when he said unto her well then he'll Rise Again her response to that was well I know in the resurrection he'll rise but she said you know God maybe she was looking for a comforter maybe she was looking for God to give him a reason of why that it had to happen that way maybe she was looking for an answer you know why that we had lost our loved one like this and maybe maybe she was searching for you know why why didn't you come whenever he was sick and but brother brother Wesley I thought of how that whenever Jesus would speak to her even in this time that here you realized that Martha as she had asked him to come that she had so many reasons that she could have complained to him she could have been so mad and she could have she could have said well why didn't you come whenever whenever we sent the messengers your way to come why wouldn't you come you knew he was sick and he needed you and he was your friend and after all we left our church to follow you and now we have nobody to turn to and when we needed you you wouldn't even come look at how she could have approached him she could have said you you know we when weever you turned your back on us and and we're we're your friends and we believed in you and we followed you and now we're excommunicated from everybody else we've been kicked out of the society because we had confidence and we followed you but right when we needed you the most you wouldn't even answer our prayer you wouldn't hear us you wouldn't speak to us you wouldn't come to us you just turned us down we got to rebuke you would have thought she had a right to say those things as her brother lay dead they left their Church to follow him they gave up their life to follow him but when they needed him the most he wasn't there what she could have said to him David but you realize that brother said every person that comes to God he said they got to be tried first and your faith has got to be tried so if she would have come with that sort of an attitude then the miracle would have never been performed said but no doubt this woman had caught a revelation said I think she had heard the story of the sh that woman I think she had heard the story of how that Elisha had gone down to that woman's house and remember how she had prayed for a son and she had gave Elisha a place to sleep and when she wanted a son that he get that he told her the Lord had blessed her with a child and after a few years that that child out in the field that he had that he had got in the Sun and he had died and he was laying on his deathbed and she called upon Elisha and said the promised son that you given me has died but she approached him the right way and he went and he gave the boy back his life but around said I think she had read about the shunamite woman and how she approached Elisha he said so she approached Jesus the same way my what a thought this morning that Martha that in her see because she had read of a witness of what that shunamite woman had done and she thought here I am in this same situation and here here my brother has died and and I but you know there was a woman in the Bible that called upon him and maybe her faith be to build because because of a witness that she had read and all of a sudden she said she approached him the same way she said if God was in a is Prophet than God must be in his son and she called upon him and as she called upon him she said listen but remember said she said the right word she said Lord that was his right title if thou would have been here my brother would not have died he said see she started off the whole conversation correctly in the middle of all this trouble she said Lord in the middle of all the trial she said Lord he said and it made favor before God she recognized him no matter what he had done whether he come or whether he didn't come it didn't have one thing to do with it she said Lord she gave him his right title he said if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but whatever you ask God will give it to you even in her grief and her sorrow she called him Lord no matter what condition that she was in she called him Lord friends don't you realize it don't matter what state we're in this morning it's our approach to God that brings a miracle it's our approach to God that brings the sign of his resurrection it's our approach to God that brings the Supernatural how we approach God the only reason she experienced a resurrection is because of her approach to him and notice what happened because of her approach Oh Glory to God the Bible said because she approached him this way they sent Runners down to Mary's can I just preach a minute we're we're we're here anyhow but she sent Runners down to Mary's house and the Bible said they went following after Mary the whole audience of people said well baby she's going down to the tomb to grieve cuz Mary heard that Jesus was down at the tomb of Lazarus and she came down and they gather around this great tomb and many of the the crowd had gathered around and the Bible said they were weeping and they were in sorrow and their hearts were broken because of the death of their loved one can you imagine the condition they were in and how that that that many of them were looking there such a mixed audience stood there that day but Jesus he put all of it out and the Bible said he looked at that tomb and he spoke out with a loud voice he said Lazarus come forth and when he said those words the dead came forth bound handed foot I thought my whenever Jesus spoke here come that old mummified looking body the Bible said he was still wrapped in grave clothes and a napkin upon his face and when he come walking out of that grave Jesus said loose him and let him free well let me tell you what happened friends because she approached God she was a witness of the resurrection and let me tell you what happened the devil couldn't take I wish I had a voice to preach this morning the devil couldn't handle it no more whenever she when she whenever she seen a resurrection the Bible said then the council of Pharisees got together and said do you know what just happened that Jesus went down there and he raised a man from the grave many of them witnessed it happened and they said if we don't do something about this we're going to lose our churches if we don't do something about it we're going to lose our nation we'll lose confidence of people they're all going to follow him and none of them are going to follow us and the Bible said but one of them raised up by the name of Caiaphas he said consider it is expedient for us that if if one man should die for the people that the whole nation would not perish and the Bible said from that day forward they took counsel together to put him to death I thought isn't it something that at one Resurrection is all it took to push Satan over the edge one Resurrection is all it took and War was declared on him for the miracle of the Resurrection you say h well what would happen today if people would witness such a power what would happen today if they would experience Christ in that way let me tell you what would happen if this world would turn to Jesus Christ and they would experience him in the power of his resurrection the synagogues would empty the denominations would empty and people would follow Jesus Christ again Satan knew who he was I often wonder if that ain't why whenever he called him upon the mountain in the wilderness that he didn't tempt him and say to him if thou were the Son of God let these Stones be made into bread but now he didn't he wasn't up there just trying to see what power that he had now he had done witnessed it for himself he saw him heal the sick hello somebody he saw him give a blinded eyes and and open them he saw him make the lame walk he saw him turn water into wine and now he saw him take something was dead and give it life again and Satan made a declaration brother Jared when he saw that one Resurrection it stirred up something and Satan said we can't have this it'll cause everybody to turn to him so he made a declaration I'll tell you what we'll do from this day forward we'll do what we have to do to kill that man off this earth now his power has been displayed and Satan made himself a military strategy it was called operation kill the Son of God and they went together around had little house meetings and and meet group meetings and they come in the counsil together and try to plot up ways that they were going to kill the Son of God but let me tell you friends if Satan had a military strategy so did God God had one it was called operation resurrection and it didn't matter what Satan done Jesus said you can destroy this Temple but in 3 days I'll raise it up again let me tell you what our chief Captain done Brother David he didn't hide in a bunker to fight the devil he went down to the front line and Jesus Christ declared war on the devil and he and he went down into the depths of hell and he infiltrated the gates of hell and he set those that were captive by death and he set them free the souls that were in prison he set free what a plan that God had brother bam said when they crucified him at Calvary the world thought they had him death thought they had him hell thought it had him the devil thought it had him but every but he broke every seal and not only did he climb through Calvary but beyond every moon and the star and he sets on the right hand of the Majesty tonight and His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me he climbed through Calvary he didn't stop on Calvary but above every moon and star that sit on the right hand of the m majesty and we are beneficiaries tonight of that Resurrection we're benefiting from this Resurrection let me tell you how Paul spoke this Paul preached this in Colossians the 2 chapter did I got just a minute to finish up Paul said we were buried with him in baptism somebody say amen he said wherein you're also risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead operation Resurrection is still in effect amen you were risen with him through the operation of God who ha raised him from the dead we were dead in sin because of our first man had fallen our representative Adam had fallen and it caused death to set in on the human race it didn't have nothing to do with you you didn't cause it sickness and death we deserve death because of our birth the way we come into this Earth we deserve death because of the way we were even born but Paul said but you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven all your Tres passes blotting out the ordinances all your blotting out the ordinance listen your trespasses that were recorded think about it the Bible says they were placed in a handwriting as a bond against you a binding legal document Brother David that were written against you this is what brother man was looking at when he saw his name written on on on on that book of all his sins it was a a document that was that was that was signed that was filled with your sins because of your old nature because of your first birth here there was a bond that was handwritten that was against you but when Jesus forgave us Paul said but he blotted out the handwriting of the ordinances that was against us what was contrary to us and he took it out of the way my isn't that a wonderful word the thing that stood between you and God listen friends let me speak to you just a minute Paul said the thing that stood between you and God Jesus took it out of the way let me ask you what is it that separates from you from God Paul said Jesus took it out of the way what is it in your life that keeps you from going on with God what is it that keeps you from being filled with the Holy Ghost what is it that keeps you from being so committed to God and allowing God to use you but Paul said but Jesus took it out of the way it don't matter what it is he took it out of the way he made a path in order for you to be able to to approach God the very thing that stood between you he took it from you and listen what he said and he nailed it to his cross are y'all hearing that this morning he took that was what was written against you I wish I had me a nail this morning he took that what was written against you can you imagine all the sins this ain't a big enough book for me let me find a bigger book he took all the sins that was written against you written in real small letters brother Logan and and all those things that was written against you all your life I could just see Satan recording everything that you ever done every day and every night he followed you into every dark alley he followed you into every pool hall he went into every drug house he went into every bar he went into every place you've ever been and he wrote it down he followed you it was a handwritten bill that was against every part of your life but Paul said but Jesus Took the book and he went down when he hung on the cross and he nailed it on the cross of Calvary and he took it out of the way that that wouldn't nothing that would stand between you and God and he threw it over behind him that it couldn't stand between you and him I thank God that there ain't nothing stands between you and God hallelujah he took it out of the way and he nailed it to his cross that there wouldn't be nothing standing your way oh friends let me tell you the devil's a liar this morning that think you can't get a alone with God to say you can't have a meeting with God to say you can't move forward with God to say you can't be filled with Holy Ghost he's a liar this morning and God took it out of the way that you could stand with him nailed it to his cross and Paul said he spoiled the principalities and powers and he made a show of them openly triumphing in them in it he didn't beat him privately it wasn't some little secret affair done in the back room isn't that good he didn't go in the back room make a deal with the Devil look if you'll leave these people alone well then I it wasn't like that the Bible said he may have show of him openly that everybody in the world would be able to to be able to witness what God had done he said he beat him publicly so everybody could see it that every one of us would be able to witness the resurrection that Jesus had it was an open show let me tell you friends one day that same Jesus that went down that in on the cross of Calvary that same one that came up out of the Grave Brother David one day he'll come riding out of Glory just as sure as I'm standing here as real as we're standing here this morning I'm going to tell you he'll come riding now it'll be like it was that day on the Mount of Olives whenever Jesus came riding into town and the Bible said there was such a worship that went forth but it'll be much greater than that and he won't be riding on no mule he'll be riding on a white horse he'll be he'll be covered robed in the righteousness of the saints of God and his vesture dipped in blood written on him will be called the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and behind him will be the armies of the Living God brother said there'll be two groups that are witnessed that event one will be crying and weeping and wailing but the other group will be rejoicing and shouting and singing and every one of us will be a witness in one group or the other so you make your decision this morning of which group you will be with they'll all see that great event I say this Lord let me be a witness of the power of the Resurrection I want to have a front row seat I want to see the Saints when they come up out of the grave glory to God I feel like preaching Lord let me be a let me have a front row seat to the Sons and Daughters of God as they come up out of the grave and have a reunion with their loved ones Let Me Be A Witness of that I want to see him with his crown king of kings and Lord of lords I want to see him when the Nations bow down to him Lord let me be there on that day to witness that let me be on the right side of it Lord to witness the crowning of a king to witness the resurrection you realize that's what they were waiting on I'm going to close with this on the day of Pentecost brother Wesley many of them they had they wern't there when he come out of a tomb they hadn't seen him in his glorified body they they didn't see him when he ascended there were many that gathered out there the Bible said there was 3,000 that was believe it was 3,000 the the souls that were saved that day many of them they weren't there they' never seen the resurrection but you think about those that gathered in the upper room but They Carried and they waited that they would be able to witness it nevertheless see they had a promise from God that this Spirit would come that the spirit would be poured back upon the Earth and on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was poured into those people that same man Jesus the very Spirit of the man Jesus that walked upon the Earth was poured out on that congregation brother wesy they were so filled with the spirit of God that the Bible says that the people outside thought they were abund bunch of drunk men do you realize that people have gone to churches their whole life and never had that kind of experience with God cuz people are so carnal mind minded and so worldly minded they come to church and church is such a carnal place let me tell you friends I don't care if you come to church I want you to get into Christ it a it ain't about filling up a church building it's about getting into Christ I want to see people that get so that get so wrapped up in the spirit of God that you can come to the house of God and it ain't just a place to go to hear some word and have all this world on our mind but then we could enter into the presence of God you say how will we do it we have to approach God the right way we have to cast off the world and the thoughts and the things of the Flesh and approach God the right way and say God would you beat me here this morning and God is just to do that can we meet him can we approach him the right way can we call upon the name of the Lord can we cry out to God is there a sincere Soul still left today that'll call upon the name of the Lord and say Lord I want to witness the res Direction the Bible said when it fell upon them they went out like a bunch of drunk men people made fun of them because the way they were acting but Peter jumped up he said oh you men of Jerusalem these men ain't as drunk as you suppose he said but this is that that the prophet Joel spoke of that the that the that the spirit of God would fall upon All Flesh there a fulfillment of the prophecy of God and brother B said when that Spirit falls on a Congregation of people it will the same results will always take place you see what's missing in the churches today it's the spirit of God falling upon the congregation of people you say brother Matt what's it take to be that to have that kind of a witness it takes a people that will approach God the right way it takes a people that will go to church and Brother David their Church isn't just a place to go or a place to fellowship or a place to be seen or a place to have a membership but they go to church to have an experience with God they go to church to have communion when you walk in the doors of the assembly it's a place that you come come to have fellowship with God it's a place you come you may be going through things with your wife Oh Glory here I go you may have been fighting outside on your way here but when you come in the house of God you can let all that go and say Lord I come to have fellowship with you this morning Lord I pray you let all those things go by all the trouble at work and all the problems that I've had this week God I pray You' Let It Fade Away and let me enter into the presence of God and when people approach God that way way the spirit of the Lord will fall it'll fall upon every heart he said the same results will take place by their fruits the church has known the world is wondering what's going on he said they'll never understand it because they don't know God but it's just the holy spirit being a witness of Christ testifying of the Resurrection he said we're so glad to know that he lives and Reigns today and he has not left his church without a witness of his resurrection as the music players come this morning let me ask you this who would be a witness how many could say Lord that's my desire to be a witness of the Resurrection I wasn't there the day in my physical body to see him come out of a tomb but I want to be a witness of the Resurrection say how can you be a witness of today let your life be a testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ be so filled with the spirit of God you realize that's the only witness that God has is the spirit of God living in you that's what testifies to this world it's the Life of Christ Living in a man's heart and how that he would go and testify and they'll see that same Jesus that walked upon the Earth they'll see him walking in you isn't it something not in a pair of sandals with the robe on but to think that Jesus would walk around this Earth Brother David Paul and walk around with a gray suit on this morning with a pair of size tins dress shoes on Jesus walking around in human flesh again I want to be a witness of the Resurrection Lord let me be a true witness how is he walking around today some little sister with her long hair on and you know feels like that she's done played her rle and ain't got no part in the church no more but she still lives her life before the Lord and little old shoes that she's had for a long time and maybe ain't had a new dress in a while maybe it bothers her but she's been a witness of the Resurrection it don't matter who we are where we came from what our background is I say Lord
