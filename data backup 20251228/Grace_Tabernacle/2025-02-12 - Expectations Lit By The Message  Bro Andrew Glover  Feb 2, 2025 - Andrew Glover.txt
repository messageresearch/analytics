among us today Lord the many testimonies and trophies of your grace that stand here today oh God lord knowing that we're not here by accident we're here on purpose Lord father father you've called us all from different walks of life Lord father we can all acknowledge this morning that the group of people standing here in this building this morning many of us would not even know each other without this great end time word that you've sent to gather us together now Lord as we Endeavor this morning to take a few moments in your word we're asking your anointing to come Among Us in a supernatural way Lord may you take these thoughts that you've placed in our heart oh God and Lord may you help me to get myself out of the way and Lord may your anointing that destroys the Yoke of the enemy may it

fire forgive us of our failures our shortcoming Lord our sins oh God hide us behind the cross of Calvary transform Our Lives by Your Word this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says amen and amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles while you're standing we want to go to the Book of Psalms the 62nd chapter amen also good to see our friends here from Louisiana God bless you all this morning amen Psalms chapter 62 and then we're going to look in Proverbs and also of the book of Jeremiah amen you love the Lord this morning amen Psalm 62 and verse number five the Bible here says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my re my refuge is in him how many knows that in the Bible a rock represents a revelation so we could very easily say this morning the revelation of my strength is in God now in Proverbs chapter 24 Proverbs 24 we want to look there in verse number 13 Proverbs 24 in verse number 13 my son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy Soul when thou Hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not shall not be cut off I love that there shall be a reward there shall be knowledge and wisdom unto the soul and the expectation shall not be cut off now one other place I want to look is in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 20 uh we know this verse here by heart to probably one of the most familiar verses that the Prophet Jeremiah is known for in Jeremiah chapter 20 and verse 9 he says this then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in my heart how many can testify his word is in your heart but his word was in Mine Heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay amen we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning I I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments today if I could if I would title this today I want to talk to you on this expectations amen lit by the message amen expectations have been lit by the message now I want to maybe just open this morning by making a very uh maybe too very bold and assertive declarations to you that I personally believe from my heart I want to say this this message by this Elijah came for a purpose to put you into an atmosphere of expectation to grip you to move you to elect you to capture you to apprehend you to select you to remind you that you are elected and chosen Amen to be a participant in the resurrection also I want to say this the message came Amen to set you in expectation for what God has promised in his word now the prophet of God would say this he said I tell you what the church needs today is an old time Holy Ghost fire kindled under her he said fire will move the church and nothing else another place speaking of fire he said seeing the Revival fires begin to them he said let us throw on wood of the word that it might Kindle a new fire that our hearts would be full of zeal I I wonder today how many could say Lord that's my desire amen that there would be some wood of your word thrown on the fire in my heart that it would it would be full of zeal again he says what we need is lives lit what we need amen is lives lit a flame with the power and the resurrection of Christ shining forth in the same kind of light that he gave I believe it now you all know this morning that in the Book of Matthew the third chapter we find that John baptized amen with water but Jesus said amen he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so you'll not just be baptized amen with water amen but there was a promise that we would be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire in proverb or rather Hebrews 12 Paul would say he says now our God Amen is a consuming fire so there is a direct connection and association between God Amen and fire in Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 14 Jesus says amen that ye are the light of the world how many believes that you are a city that is set on a heel and cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house amen so let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so there is a fire amen that is coming into the believer there is a fire amen that is coming into the church and the reason for this fire amen is to reveal the works of God Amen that our father in Heaven might be glorified now I'm just laying the foundation here brother BR asked a question dear brother Brandon do you believe that the signs should follow all who have the Holy Spirit he said well Jesus said so Mark 16 another part of the question if so then what about the people who believe the message with all that is in them yet they have not these signs are they unbelievers or do they need the Holy Spirit if so please instruct us today on how to receive the Holy Ghost for we believe that you are God's mouthpiece for our day here's his answer you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens you say you believe every Speck of it when the word is laying in there waiting for the Holy Spirit to put it to work but it takes the lighting of the candle amen the Holy Spirit puts the word to work but it takes the lighting of the candle now here's the candle with the wick in it with all the Tallow everything it has Amen to have in that candle but until the fire comes on it it will not shine any light he said no matter how perfect the candle is how perfect it'll burn everything amen it's got to be Litt and then it burns see and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is love and joy and peace and longsuffering goodness amen the fruits that bears it out until that Holy Spirit with a fiery experience comes down amen and lights that candle then you haven't receive the Holy Ghost amen you say well I got the Holy Ghost but I ain't got no fire amen that is in possible because the Lord said that he would baptize the church with Holy Ghost and with fire see you've got to have an experience Amen to have the Holy Ghost I want to say this morning amen that we are not the grandchildren of God Amen we are the children of God Amen not by a handshake not by a Creed amen we are the children of God by a Holy Ghost and Fire experience amen that has led more than just our feet to dance it has led more more than just our tongues to speak it is lit more than our hands to clap but the word has been revealed in this generation and it has lit our soul amen with the knowledge and the authority of the word of God I love what John said he said behold what Manner amen of love hath the father bestowed upon us amen that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not amen because it knew him not see the world didn't know him so if you're expecting the world to know you amen the world is not going to know you amen because they did not know him see the only way then you can be a son a daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life there's only one form that was God see there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always amen the gene of your life spiritual life tonight amen was in God the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life amen that was in God as a Son of God now amen you are expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age listen you are the expressing amen God's life in you because you are a son a daughter of God he said you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God Amen to this nation and this people another place he said we have become amen from Mortal beings from time beings Amen to Eternal beings when when the word of God lit our souls when the word of God lit our soul amen we become the Sons and Daughters of God Amen with the attributes the gene of God in us Amen to be Sons and Daughters of the father amen God in heaven crying AB Our Father listen friends we are not here amen as church members expressing Church ideas we have come from the mind of God into this age to manifest the life of God listen the denominations cannot do it amen Creeds cannot do it amen it's going to take the Holy Ghost and the fire of God to burn out all the unbelief amen so God can find access in a soul Amen to manifest himself in the way he desires to do it now when you start talking about this word of God lighting the soul amen I looked up this word lit amen it means provided with light amen or lighting it means to be illuminated it means having been ignited amen you've been set on fire and you're burning somebody say well I'm lit and you can't stay awake in church I beg to differ with you amen if you have been lit you have been set on fire amen you have been ignited and you're burning you say well brother Andrew I'm not burning CZ I've been through some bad days listen if you ever get set on fire amen with the Holy Ghost stand fire amen bad days can't put the fire out amen sickness can't put the fire out come on Church open up your eyes and look around we got Elders sitting here this morning that's been serving God for 20 years and 30 years amen yes the winds have blown amen yes the rains have fallen but the fire is still burning amen because it's not a church fire it's not a Church's idea it's the Holy Ghost and Fire listen I know there's an unquenchable fire Amen in the pits of hell but I want to say this I believe if there is a negative unquenchable fire amen there's a positive unquenchable fire and I want to tell that devil this morning amen throw whatever you want to against this bride she's going to burn on her good days she's going to burn on her bad days she's going to burn when she's sick she's going to burn when she's well she's going to burn when she good she's going to burn when she's bad because the word of God has lit our souls hallelujah we're more than just on fire with a good idea or a good church program amen we have been ignited by the Holy Ghost I love John 14:12 he that believeth brother said while he is in me he said no wonder people say the days of Miracles is passed no wonder they say these things amen he that believeth in me some somebody say in me not on me amen he that believeth in me not on me see but believe in me the works I do shall he do also there's a powerful Revelation laying there church amen you're not just believing in amen I wish I was a preacher right now to explain this amen you're not just believing in something amen you're actually in what you're believing is that okay you're not just actually believing in like somebody say well I believe in what that church is doing amen well they can believe in it and not be a part of it oh Church of the Living God let me say well I believe in that message amen there's a lot of people that believe in it but they're not a part of it amen the devils and Hell believe in this message amen but they're not a part of it amen because they did not come from the genes of God well glory to God but there's a people here this morning who don't just believe on this message and they don't just believe in this message they are in this message they are a part of this message by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire this message has set their souls on fire we're not just believing in something we're actually in it believing we're actually in it believing see the works that I do shall he do also he said why it's his life it's his Dynamics in his mechanics that's in you that fires off and makes it Go and Do The Works that it's promised to do or my life in him has quickened me by his Spirit to make his word which is the mechanics amen work by his Dynamics listen friends Paul was not wrong when he said the eyes of your understanding would be an enlightened that you may know what is the hope of your calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints look at this word enlightened it means to cause something Amen to exist a amen and thus come to light and become clear to all Paul goes on to say in Ephesians 3:8 unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hasth been hid in God listen it was hid in God listen this mystery that you are beling amen was hid in the same place you were oh God I feel like shouting this mystery that you are believing amen was not hid in a church it was not hid in a school it was hid in God the same place you was if you ever was a part of God you always was in God listen when you was doping and drinking and running you was a part of God when you were running from God there was a seed in your soul that was a part of the Eternal attributes of of God hallelujah amen y'all forgive me it just hit me amen we've been in God and it's not something we earned it's something that God reveals Paul goes on to say to Timothy amen but is now let me just read it be th 2 Timothy 1:8 be not thou for ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel amen according to the power of God who ha saved us and called us with a holy calling amen not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus amen before the world began listen this was done Church before the world began but now is made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who ha apolish death and hath brought life and immortality Amen to life through the gospel Paul is saying what I am preaching to you is the unsearchable riches of Christ it has been hid it has been declared now listen it has not been made known until it become ignited in your flesh that's why the prophet could say there is a great big difference Amen in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming he said the appearing of the Lord is now amen when he is appearing in his people his spirit is working among them proving that him with them amen what is this appearing doing amen getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord amen to catch away his bride can I say this amen the message of the hour is the appearing of the Lord for the preparing of the going of the church God send us the message of the hour Amen to Enlighten our eyes of understanding let me say it as plain as I know how amen the message of the hour it must be received as the Divine message or the Divine fire of God Amen to light your soul with an unquenchable fire amen of not an emotion amen not a sensation but a revelation that'll burn when you feel it it'll burn when you don't oh Church a living God I wish I could preach right here for a second some of you all need to realize amen you say well I wish I could get a revelation amen if you could ever get the Revelation that you all always was a Son of God you always was a daughter of God listen that'll keep you amen from living in The Valleys on Monday amen and living at the altar you say we don't need an altar yes we need an altar amen but it's time to G realize that there's life beyond the altar come on church somewhere or another you got to settle the fact either I'm a Son of God or not amen I'm a Son of God or not and quit letting the weather dictate whether you're a child of God quit letting a bad phone call Dictate whether you're a child of God quit letting the bad date dictate whether you belong to God or not it's time to come to the unsearchable riches of Christ and say devil you can push me and you can do everything you want to to me but I know in whom I have believed I know where I come from I come from God and I'm going back to God and there ain't nothing the devil can do in time Amen to reverse what God established in eternity Hallelujah for this cause also we thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us amen you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe how many knows amen that there is actually different degrees of reception all right when you receive something you can receive it at different different level s of reception let me ask you this what level are you receiving this message at are you receiving it amen as just a better idea are you receiving it as just a few good points or amen a few good stories let me say this to receive the full benefit of the message you've got to receive it at the same level that it was sent to you in let me say this God did not send this message amen by a lukor prophet Propet he did not send this message amen by a casual church member who decided to become a preacher and to preach the Revelation no he selected this man he called this man he chose this man and he made him as a child in the former the pillar of fire and set his soul on fire with a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why he could preach it when he lost his wife that's why he could preach it when he lost his baby that's why he could preach it when the doors were closed to his face because he was not a lukor lay out of SE casual preacher he was a Son of God who had been lit by the fire of God well let me say this amen God ain't going to send a powerful fiery message Amen to a bunch of lukewarm people he's going to expect the same fire amen that burned in the messenger Amen to burn in the Believers it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them amen but how many will pay heed to them listen that we do do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth amen will find the spirit of God enlightening him if you want to know about your origin hear this message if you want to know about your future hear this message if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you that is a work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it then you won't get the Revelation if you're going to get the Revelation you've got to open your heart to receive it and your ear to hear it I love what the prophet says he said God in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time every even from the beginning God was the messenger at the beginning Amen to tell Adam and Eve you shall eat this but you shall not do this see that was the message amen I just want to say this amen it's time to quit being afraid Amen to say what we really believe we believe the message brother said when a man stepped across the message of the hour it brought death and chaos to the whole human race he said now that's how much the message means and remember that it wasn't just a complete blank denial of what God said that he believed it was taking what God Said and whitewashing it over or just misconstruing it a little bit just adding a little bit or taking a little bit away from it let me say this we believe amen that the first church or the original church was established on the day of Pentecost how many believes that brother B said Peter he preached the inauguration sermon at the bot service when the church was born he said the Christian church was born on the day of Pentecost amen let that Revelation settle in your heart that the Christian church amen was born on the day of Pentecost if God is infinite and cannot change then his church must remain as it was in the beginning see The Church Must ever remain the same as it was now watch what he says but man has tinkered with it amen God established it Morgan but man has tinkered with it see they put their own interpretations in it don't you never try to interpret the word of God you say just what it says don't care how it is just line up with it that's all amen don't change the word the Bible said the scripture is not any private interpretation can I just say what he said we have no right to say these things we just got to read it and say exactly like it says and believe at the same way I don't care how ridiculous it seems you believe it anyhow amen I just wanted to I just wanted to know how many's ever heard the word tinker I just wanted to know what does the word tinker mean well here's what it means it means attempt to repair or improve something in a casual or lukewarm way when you Tinker with something you are attempting to repair it or improve it in a casual or a lukor way and it is often to no useful effect it is to attempt to mend something amen by tinkering amen so it's like this you got the fiery message amen but you're trying to you're trying to repair it or you're trying to maneuver it you're trying to you're trying to uh change it amen in a lukor way can I say this to you this message is too hot for lukewarmness this message is too hot for tinkering listen amen I pray to God Amen that we realize this message is the pillar of fire I pray to God that we realize this message listen somebody say well I got some doubts can I tell you something the message is hotter than your doubts brother B said you bring your doubts like a snowball and lay him on the other of God's word and they'll melt away you know why because this message is not ickles amen this message is another a bunch of lukew Amen hybridized nonsense it's the fire of God and it's burning when God sends his message to an age amen that age receives that message and that messenger and that message becomes the leadership of the age remember said see the elect of the age amen follow the leadership of that age notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both the true and the false he said this message then is broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying amen by way of this message those who are hearing are not getting their own private interpretation or Revelation nor is it a group am been getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God you said brother Andrew you're pretty strong on that point of listenting to them tapes you are exactly right amen because them tapes amen have rapturing faith weighing upon them listen I tell you this YouTube don't have it amen and podcast don't have it and CNN don't have it and Fox News don't have it but we have received a fiery message it has the ability to transform you that's why I say listen to it in your cars play it in your home play it on your job play it in your school come on church amen it's time to start listening to the message of the hour you say preacher I don't know how to amen it's real simple just turn on a tape amen well I'm just going to preach for a second if that's okay amen somebody say well our kids are too young to understand that message they're not too young to build computers and they're not too young to hack computers and they're not too young to fix the antivirus when you mess it up so therefore I say they're not too young Amen to hear what the messenger has said to this age I'll say this I believe it's followers of the message of the hour the time has come for us as Believers to remember what We are following Brother Jared what are we following are we just following a bunch of preachers are we just following a bunch of meetings are we following a bunch of services on YouTube are we just following youth C I feel like preaching are we just following conventions I say no sir we are following the pillar of fire I say we are following God's Vindicated message in the age that we're living in that's why Peter said I write unto you both of which I stir up your pure Minds by the way every minut that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets Jesus tells him in Revelation 25 he says remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent he said God tells him to remember so the origin of the first age was Pentecost he said they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and The Wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality listen somebody can tell you where you fell and you can go back in your mind and say I remember where I fell amen but it's one thing to go in mind it's another thing to go in reality can I say this you will never whip the devil going in your mind to where you fail you will never whip the devil going in your mind to where you quit praying and you quit fasting and you quit going to church and you quit listening to tapes and you quit reading your Bible you will never whip the devil in mind as long as you go there in mind but come on prodical son when you remember you got a father and he is a loving father you don't just have to remember in your mind that you have a father you can get up with your clothes torn you can get up with the smell of the Hogs upon you and you can go back to your father's house go back in mind and then in reality brother said what is the way back the way back is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by the way of repentance then the luk warmer backslider will have to repent that much more repent he said bring forth fruit meat for repentance prove it by your life if thou do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand amen certainly a church in that condition cannot give light to the world because it's a light has turned to Darkness said God will take them away he will take the faith messenger the faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves listen and they will go on talking about Christianity but they will be barefit of it they will be rather deprived of it so they'll go on talking about a God that can save they'll go on talking about a God that can heal they'll go on talking about a God that can do Miracles but because they have rejected amen the leadership of God they will be bar they will be they will be deprived now let me say this if we know what We are following then we know what we're not following right is that okay Paul or Peter rather says for we have not followed somebody say followed we have not followed cunningly devis fables which we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were our Witnesses of his majesty I want you to look at this word followed it means to follow out or to follow up it means to tread in one's steps it means to follow one's Authority Amen to compl Li with and yield to I'll just say this I I pray it's okay to preach brother Matt amen I thank God for every preacher amen that had a personal experience with brother Brandon but let me say this I am not under obligation Amen to follow a man's personal experience with a prophet when I have what he said on tape a few years ago I had the privilege Amen to sit with brother bisco and I talked to him and I said brother Ed I said what I appreciate amen is you never took your experience and relationship with brother Brandon Amen to build a kingdom for yourself or to pull people to you but you used it to tear down the unbelief that the devil was trying to put in the hearts of the people about the message of the hour listen friends I want to say what a prophet said he said I am thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I am thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up it is the word of God I am thoroughly convinced absolutely convinced that it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I am thoroughly convinced that he's here right now I am thoroughly convinced that he will answer our prayer if we'll be concerned and open up our lives to it listen friends I am not standing here under a question mark about the authority of this message I am thoroughly convinced that the God that was is the god that is and he's right here in this building this morning come on Grace Tabernacle some of you all have come in as 11 power workers but can I tell you this you ain't got to take a second-handed robe and take a backseat to the fire of God there is still room around the fire of God hallelujah hallelujah amen brother Elmer God bless you amen just dedicating that baby this morning amen all these years down the road amen but sister Martha Joy has got the same chance after the fire of God Amen as anybody else had you know why because of God is no respect your persons this is not a fairy tale this is not a family tradition it is the fire of God there's room at the table for the youngest of our children there's room at the table for the oldest of our elders listen there's a spot brother Jared around the fire this morning you ain't got to go paint a fire well brother Ram said this and brother bam looked at me this way and amen thank God for all that amen but what about the fire amen a man will freeze to Death Around a painted fire I say Church Living God we ought to make it our priority Amen to build a hot heavy fire in the house of God every time we get together it's a word of God it's not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God and the devil is trying to numb you said what he's done is a man that walks away and says he don't believe is an unbeliever he's Beyond hopes he is numbed by the power of Satan so there is no hopes for him somebody say well you're saying if somebody walks away and said they don't believe brother brandom it's ain't about believing in brother Brandon it ain't about believing in a church it's about believing in Jesus Christ who has been revealed by the message of yes sir the hour I love what a prophet said he said tonight maybe a cancer has conquered you maybe something else has taken a hold of you amen some disease amen can I say this a prophet broke the the power of numbness listen how many's ever been numb three of you how many's ever been numb Brother David you know what it is to be numb amen you hit your knee on something or you hit your elbow and all of a sudden it goes numb you know what happens when it's numb you can't feel it come on church it's still there but you can't feel it you know what happens sometimes we get numb in the house of God we let situations happen we let this problem happen and we come to church and we say well God can I preach well God wasn't there and the Holy Ghost must have forsaken the church and we don't know what's

you say you got you got you got you got Bible scripture for that I do brother bossworth was laying there Dy they closed the curtains come on they closed the curtains and they started singing some old sad songs daddy Bosworth rolled over brother Matt and looked at him and said hey who's dying in here me or you on he said open up them curtains and sing some Lively gospel songs well Glory Glory Glory roll up them curtains and sing some Lively gospel songs I'm not going to a grave I'm going to a resurrection well can I just say this quit singing sad pitiful poor wowy wowy woo songs over your life and over your family it's time to open up the curtains Mark it's time to open up the windows and let the light of the presence of the Son of God shine in your home again our homes don't belong to Lea I said our homes don't belong to leosa our joy don't belong to leosia we have not come here Amen to be under the icicles of Le see we have been lit by the word of God we ought to let the fire of God burn in our homes you say brother you're getting way out there am I really I say Let the Fire of God burn away with the Gloom of Satan the message of the hour has come to light an expectation in our hearts that what we read in this word can be fulfilled in our lives can I say this you don't have to read anymore and say I wish brother Brian you can read it and say it is and it shall be see you say what is that word expectation I I just love the definition of it brother Kyle it's a strong belief Glory it's a strong belief that something will happen or be the case in the future it is a belief that someone will achieve something it is not a week I hope it happens maybe it'll happen maybe it'll come to pass my Bible says that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now how many is a part of Grace Tabernacle let me see your hand you're a part of the church can I tell you something amen people should not have to come in the church to see what we believe they should be able to see the influence of the word of God on your life out in the city they should be able to see the influence on come on out in the schools or on the job said oh I would to God that you could come under the influence that I live under and my church lives under for we believe that God Is A Healer we believe that God is a savior and we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit can I say something that's more than a quote that is a strong belief in my heart that God Is A Healer that God is a Soul Saver that God is a holy ghost fer see what is happening is sometimes we only get in the element of expectation around the time of a special meeting or come time for Youth Camp or come time for a convention and it's time to get all fired up you know it's time can't wait glory to God am remember can I say this that expectation ought to be here on Wednesday [Applause] night so some ask one time they said but Andrew they said how in the world Amen have you kept on pressing since you were 16 traveling preaching because I have my own Revival somebody say well I remember somebody told me talk well it's just Wednesday night you ain't got to do too much well I'm sorry I'm not the guy that says it's just a Wednesday night service and I'll just put a little bit of time in it or just bring some little half-hearted idea that I come up with on the way to church cuz I was too lazy to study listen Wednesday I could be the night that somebody's destination could be changed forever come on Church you say well it's just Wednesday night they asked me to sing a special well you know what I say I say if you're ashamed Amen to let your voice out on a Wednesday night you ought to be singing in the first place it don't matter if it's Wednesday or Sunday or Friday Night of the meeting or Saturday night of the first night we ought to let the fire of God burn in the church let it burn in our Sunday school rooms let it burn in our churches well it's just like a guy got up and said one time said well I can't believe I'm preaching the first night of the meeting I thought dear God I'd hate to see what you'd bring on the Friday night it ain't a talent show it's the house of God I don't care if there's five or 500 I don't care if there 20 or 2,000 I'm going to preach this message like it's the last sermon I'll ever preach you know why cuz I have a strong belief that God is able to change things I have a strong belief Destiny God can change things I have a strong belie I have a strong belief on the Wednesday nights that the Holy Ghost can change that destination of a young girl I have a strong belief that God is able to take a cancer out on the Wednesday night you know why because my soul has been set on fire by the message of the hour it's more than a sermon it's more than an idea it's an expectation of my heart and I refuse to back up to the devil and let him dictate my expectations I'm sorry I'm a Simeon I'm a Simeon brother Mark I don't care how old it is I don't care how old I look I still believe I'm not going to die until I have seen the Lord's Christ you know why brother said he believe that because the Holy Ghost was upon Him brother him said in that great evil day Hallelujah glory to God somebody give him some praise somebody give him some praise somebody give him some worship he's God and His word is true Hallelujah and he's right here this [Applause] morning in that great day of formality and indifference Simeon believed the Holy Ghost so what could happen it could still rest on a man and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple Hallelujah said Simeon didn't reason he believed it he said what happened the Holy Spirit found a man to believe the message it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer and when you accept it in its fullness and God knows you'll do it he gives you the abstract to it then the very promise that's made is in your possession and the holy spirit is there to Quicken that to you see Simeon what he was was he was a beautiful picture of expectation in faith said wherever you go whatever you do what you expect brings your faith see Faith knows no defeat somebody say no defeat no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes it positive see but faith has has got to have a foundation can I say this then the foundation of your faith must be a spiritual Revelation then when the foundation of our faith is on a spiritual Revelation brother Mark we can expect the impossible testing one two is still working we can expect the impossible I feel like saying that again but Bobby we can expect the impossible you say what makes a strong church is a bunch of Believers that expect the impossible you say what brings Miracles is people who expect the impossible come on church I don't expect the possible I expect the impossible well I might as well preach I'm this close to it and God forbid we ever reduce amen the standard of a good meeting down to somebody shouting or dancing in the spirit listen let the music get going good and that's possible well can I preach brother Matt I'm hold I'm home can I preach amen that's where oh God Amen that's possible just get a good hot guitar and a set of drums going unless somebody get Good Feeling Good In the Flesh and they can shout dance but are you making fun of that no I believe in it but I'm talking about this message took us beyond the Pentecostal probability come on Church we're not practic l in Pentecost this ain't Pentecostal probability well the Holy Ghost is going to move GL to God somebody going to get some we know the Holy Ghost is here we know the word has been revealed now it's time to expect the impossible can I tell you something it's time to stop reading that Mr limbs will be restored and start expecting it I felt the devil push against that we respect the impossible look what the Bible said for with God Amen nothing shall be impossible said look here in Mark 9:23 Jesus said if thou can't believe if thou can't what believe if thou can't what if thou can't what all things are possible to him that believeth you say all things are possible With God all things are possible to you let the devil oh God let that devil know all things are possible to me because I am a [Applause] believer you said brother are you really saying that I am because God's power to perform the impossible is not coming God's power to perform it is here he said you just take the right man laugh attitude towards any Divine promise and watch it materialize no matter how impossible it looks if God said so he makes it possible another place in order to do the impossible you've got to call on God for power of God to perform the impossible can I read this is that okay everybody okay how many Messiah servants do we have Messiah servants do we have any here if we be the messiah's servants we have to have the messiah's power oh the devil hates that because if you are messiah's servant you have the same power the Messiah had you see when a man or a person has come really in contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that God is there's nothing being no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God let me say this there are different expectations intellectual and spiritual but intellectual expectations will not produce spiritual manifestations brother said people are expecting the kingdom of God to be different than what it really is they're expecting it to come in splendor they're expecting it to be alive in the Vatican City or some great cathedral but because he brings it amongst a bunch of poor illiterate humble hearted people it blinds the eyes of the wise and prudent can I say this God's original plan was for him to lead man said God can only lead a man as he will let him lead see God can only work with anyone that'll let him work with him now let me say this brother said like this very very very beautiful very straightforward he said God was to be the leader of the people he said now God I'm having to skip over a beautiful study but maybe some other time God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but what they done speaking of Israel they got ahead of him because Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the heart of the people to get ahead of God the word he said now you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside all right and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it the minute you lay the influence of the Holy Ghost aside the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it can I say this very plainly Church the spirit of God makes the [Applause] difference the spirit of God makes a difference you say what is the difference in that young choir this morning and the Baptist Church down the road the spirit of God you say What's the difference in this church and a denominational Church the spirit of God you say What's the difference in Matt Morris and another Pastor the spirit of God you say What's the difference in our deacons and the deacons in a Baptist Church the spirit of God come on church I say we ought to welcome the spirit of God we all embrace the spirit of God you say preacher I don't believe in the spirit of God well I feel sorry for you because the problemet of God said you better be careful because there is a sin against the spirit in Isaiah 63:10 the Bible says they rebelled and they vexed his holy spirit the minute you Rebel and Vex the Holy Spirit he said therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them my goodness the minute they rebelled and the minute they Vex the Holy Spirit God turned and become come their enemy the minute they begin to say that part of the message don't apply to us the minute they begin to say that's just is this okay that's just brother brandom's opinion the minute they begin to say y'all know what it don't really matter no more how a boy dresses and a girl they rebelled and Vex the Holy Spirit look what Matthew 12:31 says we're for I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto man but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven unto Men Let me just stop here and say something if it's okay the rain falls on the just as well as the unjust and just because somebody is not meeting your standards you better be careful what you say is that okay you better be careful look here but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto man look at this word blasphemy it is slander or it is ous and reproachful speech which is injurious to Divine Majesty did I read that right impious and reproachful speech injurious to Divine Majesty that's why Paul said in Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace come on Mom and Daddy you better be careful what you're saying when church is over oh my you better be careful them little conversations when you're sitting around the dinner table having the pastor for lunch you better be careful because them babies are going to turn into teenagers and they're going to need some guidance and you done tore every preacher around the country down they ain't going to trust none of them I say this God shut our mouth and let only good things come out of our mouths I say quiet in our mouths to come on Church you say preacher I might as well preach I'm feeling good we got some critical we become professional critic criticize this criticize that criticize this you know what I say I say thr that old ungodly critical devil in the pit of Hell where he come [Applause] from well I didn't like her and I didn't like her song well let me just say this feeling too good right now they could be in a bar room singing and they could be in a barroom dancing but they're in the house of God you know what I say I say God shut their mouths to all the nonsense shut our mouths and let us say good things you know what I say I say we ought to get behind our young people we ought to support them we ought to encourage them we ought to pull for them it didn't like that did you we ought to forget their mistakes and remember we made mistakes but God never forsook us and we pray the same God that kept us will kept our young people yes sir amen grieve not the holy spirit of God Amen whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption 1 Thessalonians 5:19 Paul says this he says quench not the spirit right now I got to thinking of the day that's one of Pentecostal favorite verses right there brother Matt let that music get going hot and heavy and people shouting and dancing and running all over the place glory to God quench not the Spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah quench not the spirit glory to God you might as well not sit on the Holy Ghost quench not The Spirit Well I went to Pentecostal school and we we seen a lot of spirit what what was called Spirit shouting dancing and Chapel Services and I sitting there one day and brother Carter I went to school with them kids so they wore their skirts to Chapel yeah and they went back up to the school and put their pants on so we was having one of them Chapel Services one morning the guy got up here hallelujah glory to God the Holy Ghost is here come on up here y some of y'all brother Vernon probably seen that glory to God come on up here the Holy Ghost here hallelujah glory to God so they all go up there well there's just that one brother Randall there's just that one odd duck sitting there you know that ain't moving and that's me yours truly you know they get up there oh glory to God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is here Qui not the spirit amen hallelujah you're going to quench the spirit glory to God you better not resist it Amen brother so service was over and we went back up to school and there was a girl up there she speaking in tongues shouting dancing went back up there and put her pants on put her makeup on cussed a little bit so that guy walked by me he got real close to me said quench not the spirit young man remember that all the days of your life I said well she just did he went I said she just did he said how can you say that I said because the Bible says it's a sin for a woman to wear a garment that pertains to a man come on church we might as well get this Pentecostal idea out of our mouths and our ideas amen that's sitting on the music is quenching the spirit that word quench means a fire or things on fire to be quenched to go out to suppress or to stifle do you know what quenching is it's when you begin to stifle the Divine influence of the Holy Ghost can I say this the Holy Ghost leads a person to believe this word sir I'm going to close on this so whatever the word says is the Divine influence of the church brother B said now who leads you that's the question now it who leads you can you put that picture up for me who leads you the pillar of fire returning back that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see the pillar of fire revealing the same word staying word by word with the Bible brother Ram says God's either going to lead the church the Holy Ghost is going to lead it or man's going to lead it and if you choose man go ahead God pulls his church right out the pillar of fire moves on and the church moves with it can I tell you what a prophet said it's got to be something it's moving right now friend it's it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord he says this the Holy Spirit can I have a few minutes here I'm closing on this the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body and another place and in the ministry the Lord has given me most of those men were theologians great teachers mine is not see mine is more of a prophetic message foreal the last age is a prophetic message amen look here Amen in the in the identified Christ of all ages amen Malachi 4 all of it's supposed to return right back again him again come down and identify himself in a prophetic message to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith Apostolic Pentecostal Faith with the fathers another place not Son of God no more son of man see come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying what is the church how do you get in it when you're in there everything that Jesus Christ was you are oh God even to be a son and daughter of God he become you that you might become him the thing of it is you are scared to use it or either you're not cooperating with his word if you don't come fully into that word it'll never work I feel it he's here I'm positive he's here I know he's here quickening power is right here can you believe it can you believe it sir can you believe that's more than a man sir can you believe that's original headship restored to the church can you believe that's the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses that was with Paul that was with our Prophet is right here with this church then let me say what a prophet said if you can believe it oh God if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours well glory to God if you can believe it if you can believe the pillar of fire whatever he will lead your soul to believe is yours what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this we have been LED Amen to believe what we believe somebody say led to believe you know what that means that means you've been influenced to a certain belief because of something seen something heard or something read you know what led to believe usually is it's usually because of a conversation somebody says I talked to somebody and as I talked to him I was led to believe I was led to believe come on Church you ever have a conversation with somebody and they say certain things and the reason they're saying that is they're trying to lead you to believe something and some of them times we y'all know what I'm talking about we we've heard them conversations but can I tell you this brother brandom had a Vindicated conversation with a supernatural being and here's what he said he said there's only one thing I can say a supernatural being what his name is sister I do not know but talking to me God who knows is standing here before me and the Bible lay it here knows it's a truth that supernatural being told me he said if I get the people to believe me then not even cancer not even even cancer could stand before the prayer brother said now how did he know how did I know she was a Christian CA I feel her spirit just now like a heartbeat coming in brother B goes I know the spirit of God that's upon me I told the devil I was going to read this that's anointing me now recognizes that's my sister I've never seen her yet I know she is see it's just like something coming like this it's going together her spirit is blending with the spirit that has anointed me her spirit brother Travis is blending with the spirit that's anointed me how many have seen the picture of the Angel of the Lord see remember I tell you

believed a conversation come on had I not believed a conversation sister Eve that a prophet had with a pillar of fire I wouldn't know what to do in that situation brother Morgan but because I believe what the supernatural being told a prophet if you get the people to believe you not even cancer will stand in your way I said sis this is not cancer it's a devil but our God is greater than that devil and I just laid my hands over on her and prayed and I said in the name of Jesus I rebuke these demons I cast them away from her she went back to her dorm was not even thinking about it went to bed
