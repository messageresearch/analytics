God I just think he's he's wonderful amen and I just appreciate all the Lord has done for us amen amen we just want to invite you to the scripture and we're going to read in the Book of Joshua the second chapter and I'm going to start out in the first verse Joshua 2 and and one I wish everybody had the spirit that little be has Amen brother we just go you go all over this building and just rub off on everybody you just go right ahead God bless you buddy amen Joshua the 2 chapter and we're going to read in the first verse the Bible says and Joshua the son of nun sent out of shadam two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and they came into a harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in here tonight of the children of Israel to search out of the country and the king of Jericho said unto Rahab bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thy house for they come to search out our country and the woman took the two men and she hid them and she said this there came in unto me but I don't know where they went and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out and and where they went I do not know so pursue after them quickly and you shall overtake them but she brought she had brought them up to the roof of the house and she hid them with the stalks of flax and when she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them all the way to Jordan unto the Fords and as soon as they which pursued after them had gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for We Have Heard the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when he came when you come out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan sihon and OG whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath and we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated I know um man just God is just something isn't he I just just love the uh to read the word and my you can just read through one chapter or portion of scripture and you get so much inspiration and uh can go in so many different directions but I just think God is wonderful and I get to think about all the things that God does and how wonderful it is and seeing these young people come to church on fire for God and I I sitting in my back office and or in the in the office there and and brother Mark was singing and and I all I could hear was brother Amos I could hear brother Mark and brother Amos and my just hear that young man out here on fire for the Lord maybe others were making noise I don't know there's a pretty thick wall with insulation but I can hear him over the insulation and I thought you know what some people may look at that and they want to put it out you know he just putting on a show or making some noise or something like that but friends I got news for you it's just a fire that's burning in his heart and I'm glad he's he he he has a place that he can express what God matter of fact it ought to be on every one of our heart brother Wes said there ought to be a fire that's burning in us I I was preaching that Wednesday night I I got so excited about that after I left church and I got home and I went and repr preached it I sat down in my office and I spent a few more hours and reading on that thinking Lord is it was it me is there something really in there and my it just it just it just burned a fire in my heart thinking about what happens when a person rededicates their life to God and how that he can he can light a fire in you and I I spent about three or four hours on Wednesday night going back through that and and just studying on it and and seeing what God does and how many was here Wednesday night I know there was a handful that uh that was sick and wasn't able to be here but my isn't it isn't it something that by the rededication of a temple came the supernatural I I I I fed on that all all week of thinking how that uh what it was that God would bring a supernatural flame I me you remember that here here here they were under duress and here they had lost the ability to worship they had lost their Temple they had no rights to it and a group of Freedom Fighters got up that's what we need this morning we need a group of Freedom Fighters that'll rise up in the house of God and reestablish the worship in the temple I I think it takes some men and some women that are on fire for God that said I'm not willing to give it to the devil I I'm not willing to turn over to just some old denominational formalism or something like that in the house of God but there's it was some Freedom Fighters and you know what Freedom Fighters had to fight they had to they had to pile through things they have to walk through people's feelings and they had to walk through people's opinions and they have to walk through criticism brother Mah but it didn't matter they were fighting for the temple of God and they wanted the worship to be restored and they wanted the people to have their right ful place with God and now they went in there brother Mark and and they took the temple back over and when they went in there they found a little bit of oil that was left and a old sealed oil bottle and they put it in a and they put it in that little Candlestick or that great Candlestick the manora and they lit it and it should have only burned for a day and instead miraculously it burned for eight days and eight nights I thought isn't it something the rededication of the temple brought the supernatural it brought a miracle in Israel and it'll do it for you this morning you a man that'll dedicate his life to the Lord it'll bring the supernatural it'll bring a miracle in your life it'll light a fire in you that no man can put out I thought isn't it something I got to think it on that when I got home it was just something that it burned for eight days anybody catch that it burned for how many knows what the Eighth Day means it burned for eight days brother R said the eighth day was the Holy convocation you know we we we live in a period of time and and brother Mark whenever God created the world he created for Six Days on the seventh day he rested but still yet it was a period of time he said see we go through this age we go through all of time even into the Millennium but the Millennium is based on time it's a thousand years he said but after that then the Bride of Jesus Christ will enter into the holy convocation with God he said in other words the eighth day is going back into eternity see there's only seven days in a week so when you get to the Eighth Day the eighth day is the first day all over again so see what it is it's a symbol of Eternity I thought my isn't it something that the fire of God brother Mark that it didn't just burn in time it didn't just burn to get you through a few days it didn't just burn to to get you to the next stage but this fire of God it'll take you right out of time and right into eternity my that's what fire we need this morning I thought isn't that something that that that's the very thing that Moses saw burning on the altar whenever God lit the fire and he came down and God said this fire that is burning upon the altar it shall never go out brother B there said there's something within us it's a fire that's burning it's a light that's been lit by God how many say Amen to that if you feel tired just stand up this morning we're going to preach right through it he said there's a fire in us that's burning and it's lit it's been lit by God and there ain't no Breeze can blow it out there ain't no code spell in the church can blow it out there ain't no indifference among people that can blow it out there ain't no persecution in the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit it's a fire of God Brother David Paul it's the same fire that fell on the day of Pentecost it's a fire of God but mam said we can't live by any other fire that's the fire we have to have the whole world is living by a painted fire they're painting churches of Christianity of what formalism is and what it is a day gone by and my look how they worship back in the book of Acts and my look how they healed the sick back in the book of Acts look how they went to church back in the book of Acts he said we can't live by a painted fire you can't get warmed by it he said he said well they can say it's a great big fire but a painted fire will never make you warm what we need in the church today is the same fire that burned on the day of Pentecost we need the bap ISM of the Holy Ghost you can't get warn by some historical Doctrine but we have got to have the Holy Ghost right now The Same Spirit the same Pentecostal fire that burned in the first day is the same Pentecostal fire that we have today burning in our hearts and the Believers said amen it's the same fire of God that's burning in our hearts friends I pray that fire is burning in your heart this morning I pray that there's a torch I pray there's something burning in your heart that you can't wait to get to the house of God and if it ain't there friends I invite you to the altar this morning to rededicate your life to God cuz you need something that's lit in your heart that'll cause you to put God first in your life be a believer be a holy ghost filed Christian be a real man of God and a daughter of God let the fire of God be rekindled in your life my I don't think they were a bunch of cowards they were men and women of God and that's what God calls us to be today so we can't we can't live by a painted fire May maybe we ought to say that this morning Lord don't let me just sit through the service let me get in can somebody say that out loud Lord don't let me just sit through the service Lord let me draw strength from the word of God somebody won't you speak what you need this morning Lord Lord let me have a humble Spirit Lord Lord would you heal my body Lord I I pray you You' help my husband Lord I pray you'd help my wife Lord I pray you won't you begin to speak if somebody go Ahad and say it's been too quiet around here lately anyway so may go ahead and speak out loud what you have need of Lord I want you to touch my body and Lord help my finances I know somebody has some needs go ahead and say it use your mouth and confess it Lord help me this morning somebody speak it this morning tell the Lord what you have need of this ain't no mortgage a house of God you got a right to claim you got a a right to ask God for what you have need of you got a right to to call out to God for your needs amen God knows what we have need of I'm going to start my service this morning several Services brother Wesley we've been speaking on the bride's position teaching on the history of the Gentile bride in the top and went through the background of of her purpose and her placing subjection and the stories of Ruth and Joseph and we've spent many services on this subject and I don't know about you but it just gives me a confidence of seeing myself in the scripture is anybody is anybody else that way but me anybody anybody feel that way am I the only one that feels that way it does it gives me confidence to see myself in the scripture amen I it's just wonderful my eyes are a little fake this morning so if you agree with me say amen I can't see the heads nodding real well it's better for you just say Amen it it sure helps an old preacher out I ain't much of a Preacher anyway but when people pull God can speak amen I I didn't come here to be the to be the pastor or be some great guy or or to be able to bring my own ideology I don't have nothing to give you only God can give it to you and if you want it from God then pull it out of God Amen God will give you what you have need of this morning amen I believe that does anybody still believe that amen we're a bride Church we're not a denomination we're a bride church we we come to church for a reason we come to church to get something from God Amen I want to hear from the Lord say see we could we we've been speaking on this and just seeing how the bride came and this morning the the different position or the bride's position this morning I'd like to take this subject that the bride's position is a position of Faith how many knows that that the people of God are a people of faith I said how many knows that the people of God thank you are a people of Faith it's actually it's actually a Commandment that Jesus just made did you know that it wasn't it was a commandment it wasn't just a a request but remember whenever the disciples they left out of Jerusalem and they came by an old fig tree one day brother Mark that had been withered and there wasn't nothing left on it it was withered down to the roots and Peter looked at the Fig Tree and he said Lord he said he he began to recall what had happened a few days before he said you know a few days ago we walked by this tree and it had leaves on it but it wasn't bearing fruit and you looked at the tree that wasn't bearing fruit and you said cursed be this tree that it never bear fruit again he said isn't it a a something that we come by and now just a few days later what used to be green and the leaves were growing and here it is and it don't even have no life on it at all it's wither down to the roots how many remembers what Jesus's response was he answered them and he said have faith in God this is a commandment of Jesus Christ have faith in God he said and whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatever he says so here Jesus brother Wesley he gives us a principle to live by we're going to we're going to speak on this this morning that the position of a Believer or the position of the Bride is a position of Faith he gives us this principle he says therefore he said whatever things you desire When you pray believe and you shall receive how many say that with me pray believe and receive this is a this is a very principle that Jesus laid out for the for the for the believer you pray you believe and receive and I thought my isn't it something that today there's a lot of people that pray and believe and don't receive even though he gave this as a principle pray and believe and receive and oh Kyle and Beck it's sure good to see you my they had a wonderful trip and got married had a beautiful wedding and man it's just let me see them Rings they got still praise the lord they're still wearing them that's a good sign man I want y'all give them a hand this morning what a what a beautiful wedding that they had amen sure good to see you back buddy and glad they made it back I was hoping they didn't move off to another another state they got married and went to Alabama and never came home but praise the lord they're back my goodness so so here's the principle he gives us pray believe receive but you notice many pray brother Mark they believe but they don't receive but the reason is is because Jesus actually interjected something in the next verse that most people don't read he says but when you stand praying forgive if you have an odd against any for the Father in Heaven can't forgive you if you don't forgive others see see here he lays this in here brother Mark there's a I think there's a lot of good Christians that have a lot of faith that miss out on a lot of blessings because they can't forgive one another is't that something they go that here God has called us to this place of Faith but but it don't seem like it's happening don't don't seem like nothing's moving in your life but it's because of things that have been built up and bitterness and and and feelings against other brothers and sisters and and and I know how it is whenever something happens to you I know what I'm just going to preach I'm a pastor so you know sometimes you say well you don't know what they said about me and you don't you don't know what they did to me and you don't M matter of fact it ain't even that way today it's you don't know what they said about my friend they don't have to do it to you for you to be mad at them they got to do it to somebody you know and you don't know what they did to my sister and my they and after all they they they stole my boyfriend and they they stole my girlfriend and they they they kind of they they talked about me on social they got all these reasons why it's okay to Harbor bitterness and not not forgive one another but you know when I read the Bible brother Mark I can't find that anywhere where Jesus said when you stand forgive unless they stole your boyfriend forgive unless they talk to you talk bad about you online forgive unless they walked by you and didn't shake your hand forgive unless they unless they they don't talk to you no more forgive unless they stole your your lunch money forgive unless they gave you a swirly or something forgive it had nothing to do with it brother there was no there was nothing in there that was an excuse to not forgive he said when you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anybody forgive them for how can your father in Heaven forgive you if you can't forgive those forgive your brothers of their trespass it don't matter what they did it don't matter what they said now you walk into a church you wonder why it's so cold in a church and so stiff and starchy in a church it's because people can't walk in a church by somebody that they don't have something against them and they'll turn around and walk away from each other and brush shoulders when they walk by my friend if you ever got that feeling you are to stop yourself in your filthy tracks and turn around and say God forgive me that I might forgive my brother and you ought to put your arm around her or your sister and say brother forgive me that I've held something against you my may may God do something special for you this morning you forgive one another you love one another you go the extra mile to do something special for one another if it's somebody you don't like then do something extra for them so you can get that Spirit off of you and allow God to come and move in the house of God again don't let bitterness and starchiness and all these things come in in the church it drags the people of God down there ain't no fire burning in me because you've allowed things to come into your life he said forgive that you may be forgiven I was talking to a brother Friday and you know about about things that people was doing and all this I said you know I said brother I'm just not good with grudges it's I'm just not good with it I that's that's part of my nature you know I can get real mad at you but it don't take very long I can't hold it I I just don't like grudges I don't like the way it makes me feel I I don't like holding things against people I I want people to be free and I want to be free and so you know I I go out I let them go for inst don't you realize that a grudge is a cancer it's a cancer it's something that grows and it may start as a small thing but I'm I'm I'm here this morning they ain't got nothing to do my message but but but but it may start out as a small thing but it grows through your life and it takes over every part of your life and it ain't just in your spiritual life it affects your natural life because you get it so spiritually so mi mixed up and all these things going and then you can't even work right and you can't you can't even do your job right and you can't even you can't even have a good relationship at home because you got all this built up on the inside so let it go just be free this morning Let It Go forgive your brothers and your sisters and that isn't that what Jesus said that was our example don't you realize there ain't a soul on Earth that ever went through what he went went through he was hung on a cross stripped of his clothes humiliated in front of the public they were sitting there making fun of him and mocking him and spitting on and you're worried about somebody talking about you on the internet he looked out at them and he said father forgive them for they know not what they do that's our pattern this morning that's what we go after ain't none of us been done that wrong you know sometimes your brothers and sisters sometimes they speak out of character sometimes they act out of character but we don't kick them to the curb you put your arm around them and you love them anyway you forgive one another that was free our position is a position of Faith this is what God called us to brother Brown said preaching usually catches The Sinner it brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places that man positionally what he is we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are he says so how can you be in a position to rightly have faith if we don't take time to teach the word how can you be in a position to rightly have faith if it isn't taught brother Mark here what the prophet is telling us if it isn't taught then there would be a lack of faith and how many knows what happens when when there's a lack of faith Paul says without faith it is impossible to please God so if you don't get in your position then you can't rightly have faith and if you can't rightly have faith then it's impossible to please God you see how important it is to know what your position is our position as the Bride of Jesus Christ it matters it's of the greatest importance brother Wesley because without it we can't even please God without it pleasing God's an impossibility it's not even an option in your life that you would ever please God if you don't get into your position or know your position as the Bride of Jesus Christ matter of fact Paul he would say it like this he said see whatever is not faith is sin faith is one thing and everything outside of faith is sin he's called us to a position of Faith you realize that this world today brother Mark they don't live by faith that's why we don't pattern after the world they don't live like we live when it comes to Faith we we don't just value every opinion there's many opinions in the world today but but we don't value every opinion I thought you know if I wanted to build a rocket this morning yall are wonderful people and there's some very intelligent men and women in the church but but I don't think any of us know how to build a rocket right yet so but if I wanted to build a rocket I'd find a good rocket scientist and I would and I would I would I would ask him I I would ask him how you know you know I'm planning on building a rocket and maybe a good rocket scientist he he he'd asked you the right questions cuz he knew how to build a rocket and he'd say he'd say well what's the mission parameter cuz there ain't no silly start building a rocket if you don't know what it's what it's going to be used for and and then he would tell you what a propulsion system you'd have to have a certain type of propulsion system you'd have to have a fuel you'd have to be able to Harbor the the momentum and and be able to keep it into a place that you can use it at one time and and so you know you'd have to have thrusters and they' have to be positionally placed on the rocket so a good rocket scientist he'd have the answers on how to build a rocket but you know if that rocket scientist isn't isn't a Believer he could be the smartest guy in the world but but but but I wouldn't ask ask his opinion on faith because his opinion would hold no value so that means I wouldn't ask the rocket scientist about spiritual matters and I I wouldn't ask him about my everyday walk with God and and a Christian Life and and how I can get closer to God and how I can move farther in my faith he may be a real brilliant man he may have a lot of wise answers but when it comes to Faith he don't he he adds no value to to understanding what faith is and I thought it's the same way with with churches in in the world today you really you realize that you just can't pattern your church and the and the way you go to church and the way you serve God you can't pattern them after other churches and other denominations and their and their own ideology especially when it contradicts with the Bible so so in other words you can't take a church that don't believe in Divine Healing and ask them how to conduct a prayer line see you can you can get online they give you all kinds of advice there's there's all kinds of blogs out there well if I went to church this is the way it ought to be and I think this is how we ought to conduct it and I think this is how the pastor ought to do it and and for me and my family this is how we'll do it but friends don't you realize that these people that put these things out there they don't believe like you believe so they give all these parameters of how we go to church and when we go to church and and how to conduct ourselves and how the pastor ought to be but friends we you you you don't ask him them them things because we don't pattern after the world we don't pattern after things that that they don't believe like we believe that's why they had that kind of stand they don't believe like we believe that's why they Blog the things they blog we they don't believe like we believe that's why they post the things they post because they're not Believers like you are they're not a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ but ask for the bride she has to have she has to pattern after something else you realize that that this world today they they they live by such fear they they work out of fear somebody say Amen it's the gospel truth they live out of fear they work out of fear they operate out of fear they teach out of fear I hope I can survive I hope we can make it through another day why we don't have enough food to to to to to get through tomorrow and my I don't know if God will ever heal me isn't it something the fear that is on people today my I don't even know if I'll have enough meal as many times as God's fed you and your family how how can world could we go through a day and be afraid that God can't take care of us tomorrow I don't know if I can be healed as many times have you've seen people healed I don't know if God can heal me through this I I don't know if God's going to come through for me I don't know if he's going to help me through this trial I don't know if he'll help me through this battle he might just leave me in this Valley I don't know if I'll ever see another Mountaintop again don't you realize we have a father that owns a cattle on a thousand hills he takes care of his children he feeds them he strengthens them he you said brother Matt you don't know I may not know a lot of things I never claimed to be a smart guy but I know the Bible I know this I know there was a woman in the Bible one time in the middle of a famine when everybody else around her was starving that she had food in her meal Barrel brother the mark it looked like the whole world was starving and the government gave out the answer and here here's how you ration your food and there were people that died from starvation but here's a woman that her meal Barrel never ran dry she ate the entire famine she never missed a meal and her family never missed a meal let me tell you why cuz she wasn't patterned after the world she followed the pattern of a prophet of God and when he came into the house where she lived he said you put God first and God will supply all your needs you put God first and he'll take care of your sickness he'll take care of your finances he'll take care of your family trouble he'll take care of the problems in your home and the problems at your job she follow the pattern of a prophet of God we live by a different pattern than the world lives by this is our god brother Mark he takes care of his children he's the same God that fed Elijah by a bunch of ravens when Elijah didn't have the ability to work he didn't have the ability he didn't have the ability to even feed himself he laid down and was willing to give up and die but God wasn't done with him and God wouldn't let him die and he fed him out in the wilderness he's the same God that went down on the river bank and fed 5,000 with two fish and five loaves of bread and he went down another time he fed another 4,000 when they were hungry let me tell you God feeds his children he went to the Wilderness and and the children of Israel two million of went across the desert and for 40 years he he rained Mana out of heaven and every morning they had a meal to eat that's our god he's a provider Bible say he's the same yesterday today and forever if he ever fed the hungry he can still feed the hungry if he ever healed the sick he can still heal the sick he said I am the Lord thy God and I change not and I encourage you not to change we serve a living God we're follow after the pattern that God set forth this is what David said he said the Lord knoweth the days of the righteous and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied that's our pattern the Wicked Will perish the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of the Lambs be consumed into smoke they'll be consumed away the wicked borrow and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and gives for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off for the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Del lith his way and though he fall did you catch that though who fall the good man sometimes good men fall sometimes good women fall though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down that's my God though he fall he shall not be cast down for the Lord will uphold him with his hand David said I have been young glory to God he said I've been young and now I'm old he said but there's one thing I've never seen I've never seen the righteous forsaken and I've never seen God's children begging bread he is ever merciful and he lendeth and his seed is blessed so depart from Evil and do good and dwell forever more I've been young and I'm old now but I've never seen the righteous forsaken my Lord that makes me feel like having church this morning I may just have church by myself brother somebody put a wall across here and let me let me have church like I really feel I've never seen the righteous forsaken and I've never seen God's children begging bread God's still a provider friends let me tell you I know what it's like don't think brother Matt you don't know what you're going through and don't don't know what it's like and you know to go through trials and hardships and friend you're it ain't been that long ago my my life ain't always been a better roses it ain't always been that way I can tell you can I just preach a minute I I just feel like preaching I I remember when I was growing up we we I grew up in a family that didn't have nothing the only cars we had was that that was any count was handed down by somebody else when they got done with it I remember what it was like not to have anything I remember going to a to a little gas station down there that that the guy was nice enough to my mom that he let us use Wick vouchers for real food how you like that when you go and get a pack of &ms with a wick voucher he was nice enough to somehow I don't know how he did it but but he had let us do it we didn't have nothing we didn't we we didn't have nothing and growing up I remember r with my mom one day we're sitting over to the the quilt shop in hawky and a guy pulls up and told us he had to take our van so Mom says get in the van and we all jumped in we ran over to my uncle's house so maybe he'd give them some money so they wouldn't steal our van I thought why this guy's trying to steal our van I was a little boy he got in there and said well you got to make payments on it or you lose it so they tried to get get rid of him they he wouldn't get rid of and I remember my mom telling me to get in the van and get your toys and get your stuff and get out of it as a little boy I had to get in there and had to get my stuff and get out of it and watch some man drive off with a van that that that that I thought was ours I know what it's like to grow up I know what it's like to not have nothing I know what it's like to suffer I remember when me and my when me and my wife first got married we Liv with my mom my mom was a single mom the last few years of my my childhood or or the late childhood there and starting college and in first few years of college we live with my mom she was and and trying to take care of us by herself she started an inhome daycare trying to uh make a little bit of money that we could even that we could even survive to try to support her kids cuz they wanted to go to college and and try and do everything we can just to get through another day it was a tough time and when I got married me and my wife moved in my bedroom where my mom was we paid a little bit to help her on the rent and I remember my wife calling me one day when I was over at the school and and she called me she said hey there's a couple of guys here in they're coming to get our bedroom suit we didn't even have nothing I drove a S10 truck that had a previous damaged title you had to open up the hood on the truck to turn the heat on a little valve on the heater core and it got in the winter time You' turn the heater core valve and that's where the heat would come from there was no thermostat so whenever it got cold or it got too hot you cracked the window that's how you cooled it back off that's how it was whenever we got married she had a beat up old car we took a little clothes line or a clothes hanger and got in the gear shifter of the car and make the gear shifter work that we can get back and forth we bought a heater at Walmart that plugged up into into her little car in the in the little the lighter outlet that that blowed a little bit of heat so we could sit there when Jordan was a little girl Jordan was piled up in the backseat of that car at the Christmas parade on that little bitty heater to stay warm cuz I couldn't couldn't even afford to have a heater in my car I wasn't born with everything I wasn't born I I understand what it's like they come in they took our our bed that day my wife said they're they're coming in to get our bedroom suit the only thing that we ever that we even had everything else somebody gave to us on our wedding day as a gift I was paying payments on it and I couldn't afford the payment on it no more and they came in I came home that night the only thing we had left was a an airup mattress in our bedroom had no dresser and no bed and all that stuff was gone had a little airup mattress and I said babe don't worry about it we're gonna make it anyway we just have to press through I know what it's like to to have tough days I know what it's like to go I haven't forgotten know what it's like to go through things every one of us have challenges we face it don't matter how much you have you have challenges and you have trials there they're different trials different levels we all we all go through things but God is still a provider God is still more than able he don't quit on his children he'll bring you through if I can say something encouraging to you this morning God he hadn't forgotten you he don't forsake you he'll he'll bring you through Mark I got thinking about how I was in India one time and I got done with one of them meetings and them little people they they don't have nothing they're just poor my you don't even know what poor is friends I I mean that you don't know what poor is in the United States of America it's so it's the poverty stricken when you walk down the road thousands of people I I have a photo and it's sad to even to even have but I have a photo of looking down the street and as far as you could see it was caught side by side of people sleeping on the road not a box here and there under a bridge somewhere thousands and tens of thousands of people that don't even have a home to live in the ones that have homes are tarps with thatch roofs the middle class have a tarp around the a couple of sticks with a thatch roof and they're the kids that have homes with their dirt floors to live in they're poor they don't have nothing it's a poor people I remember going into one of them meetings the Lord's moving and take care of them and somehow they're always fed and even when they don't have much and I remember a little girl she was about eight or nine years old and she' come up with her hand held out and I kind of gave her a little hug and she held her hand out and I thought she maybe wrote something so I stuck my hand out and she dropped some coins in my hand I said well I can't take your coins you take them back I I don't want them here a little girl she didn't even have shoes on her feet and try to give me coins I thought my you no I can't take that you you take that back you you go give that to Mama you don't don't don't give that to me and the pastor he was sitting there walking with me he said brother please take that I said I can't take that from her she don't she don't have nothing my he said no brother I'm begging you please take that don't don't don't don't Rob her please take that he said that that little girl she's been taught he said please accept it he said I've taught these children to give he said I've taught them the these aren't these aren't just ordinary people he said they're children of God and and God's always provided for us and I've taught them to live by faith and always give to God and always always and don't and don't worry about tomorrow God God Holds Tomorrow he said I've taught him to give would you please take it and so here grudgingly brother Dave Paul I I took the money from her little bit of money and I added it up it was about 9 cents in American dollars he said those kids have been saving that up all year that they could give you a little bit of offering and I found out that that wasn't even the offering from the little girl it was the offering from the Sunday school class it's what 30 or 40 kids in a Sunday school class had saved up because they wanted to help support a meeting we're talking about nine or 10 cents I thought my it's people that have a heart even when they had nothing to give brother Mark even when they were poor he said but I've taught them to have faith in God I've taught them to give I've taught them the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I thought my isn't it something I remember when I when I left I said brother okay I'll take it and I I done purposed in my heart everything I had left before I left I was going to give to that Sunday school and I I I stayed in a cheaper Hotel I ate less food I did everything I could that when I left I took several hundred over there to that church and I this is for the purpose of the Sunday School only it'll not be used for this church I'm ordering y'all God is my witness it is be used for those kids they bought them new Bibles they bought them new shoes everything I could because it just to see the the principle of faith that was instilled in a little poor people that didn't have nothing this is this is what God has taught the church to operate under brother Mark I think you see we're not children of fear you think about fear and why it's so powerful I may have got off my thought y'all forgive me but the elements that makes fear powerful is that fear don't have to actually be a threat you realize fear can be completely fabricated if I took a box and and I handed it to little Jonah here said hey don't open that box it's got a brown recluse in it about that big round how many thinks Jonah would open it up he ain't going to open the box it's got a brown recluse it's got a big rattlesnake in it don't open it but there don't have to be a rattlesnake in the Box Jonah would probably open it but most of us wouldn't open it he he's going to investigate it he he he put it in a jar but but we wouldn't open it but it don't have to be a real fear you could you could think something was in it and you could avoid it you you hear a scary noise in the room and you think somebody's in there and you don't go in you call everybody there there's somebody in the room but there don't have to be really anybody in there it could be a fabricated lie but fear is such a powerful emotion that it can be based entirely on speculation don't have to have any grounds to it at all matter of fact by the dictionary it says fear is an emotion caused by the belief that something is dangerous it don't it ain't caused by something being dangerous it's caused by the belie that something is dangerous so there don't have to actually be any danger it's just based on speculation and people they operate out of this they live out of it I'm not talking about the fear that God told us to have the the fear or having reverence to God but this fear or this Terror or fright or or horror or Panic alarm all these nervousness and and all these things that come along with it and and anxiety and worry and and uneasiness and apprehension and angst all these are are synonyms to fear that comes by by the belief that something could be dangerous friends you realize but this kind of fear it don't come from God this fear actually come I can tell you where it come from if you want to read it in your Bible I won't go read it all this morning but but but this fear came after the fall in the garden Genesis the third chapter it's the first time you ever see the word mentioned in the bible here Adam and Eve had gone through they had communion with the Lord they walk with God day and night but after the fall when God came down and he began to call Adam's name he said Adam Where Art Thou the Bible says Adam said said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid he said why were you afraid why did you hide he said I was naked and I was afraid isn't it something that it was after the fall in the garden that fear came in after the fall in the garden all of a sudden that a man of God that was a man of Courage because because of the Fall he he was anointed with a spirit of fear and that spirit of fear caused him to act out of character it caused him to act in ways in a certain way it caused him to conduct himself in a certain way never had any time that God had ever walked down in the garden did he find find Adam hiding and not coming to have communion with him but because of the fear that had struck his heart now no longer did he have a desire to have communion with God but or he had a desire but the fear was greater than the desire it was keeping him from from his real desire so he hid from it it came from the fall in the garden that's why Paul would tell us he said God did not give us the spirit of fear how many ever wonders what Timothy was feeling like whenever Paul wrote him that letter remember it came in second Timothy he he he how many wers what Timothy was going through Timothy was a man you think about Timothy's life Timothy was a man that had that that walked with Paul he was the one that Paul had raised up in the ministry he called Paul his father father in the gospel Paul had trained him he had took him and and helped him start here Timothy would be a pastor in this in the community that he lived in Ephesus and and so here as a minister and Paul was his father figure and now the very man that that was his leader was captured and put in prison and was for his second time and was waiting on his own death even in the letter that Paul wrote Paul said they will soon take my my life I will no longer be with you they'll soon take my life but when he writes this to Timothy brother Mark I thought here no doubt Timothy was in a state of fear Paul didn't know what Timothy was going through but by discernment this is what he writes to Timothy he said when I think of you he said I call to my own remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee he said and I put you in remembrance to steer up the gift of God which is in thee that I that came when I put my hands on you I'm reminding you Timothy that there's an unfeigned faith when I think about you I remember the faith that you had that came from God so I'm reminding you to remember the gift that God gave you and steer it up in you don't don't don't be don't be taken down by by whatever this feeling is or whatever this fear may be he said he said see I remind you he said for God has not given us the spirit of fear but he gave us the power the spirit or the power and love and of a sound mind I thought my isn't it something here was a man that in his flesh was locked up in a prison here his flesh he was bound here his flesh he was waiting on his own own death but brother Mark because he was son of a Son of God he wasn't afraid he said he said God didn't give us the spirit of fear he said therefore listen to the words of encouragement coming from a man that was about to lose his life a man that ought have been afraid a man that ought to give in here he was sitting there chained up in an old prison cell he said but don't be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord or me his prisoner he said be a partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God you may go through trials but take the trials and be and don't be ashamed you may go through TR or trouble but take the trouble and don't be ashamed he said it's God that has saved us he's called us with a holy calling according to our work not according to our works but according to his own purpose and his grace which he has given us in Jesus Christ before the world began and he made manifest appearing to our savior he said who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel of Jesus Christ here was a man on death row but brother Tom he wasn't afraid of it because he said Christ came and he brought a revelation to my heart that he has abolished death and he's brought life and immortality through the light of the Gospel this that same life that Paul saw when he was walking on the road to Damascus but the mark he said that Li has brought to me the very revelation of life and immortality so that's why a man on death row could say God has not given us the spirit of fear but he gave us the spirit of Faith he said you're appointing to be a preacher an apostle or I a preacher an apostle a teacher to the Gentiles he said I I will o separ these things nevertheless I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed I know whom I have believed I am persuaded that he is able to keep those keep that which I have committed unto him against the day in other words it don't matter what the trial is today God is able to keep us against the day he's able to keep you against the trial he's able to keep you against the the the sickness he's able to keep you against the problems that we face today he said I am committed that God is able to keep us against that today so hold fast to the form of sound words what you have heard of me in faith and in love which is in Christ Jesus what a what an order hold fast fast the faith that God has given you don't have the spirit of fear here a man all he had in his possession was an ink pen and a piece of paper had nothing else a little bit of parchment he could write on waiting to beheaded and a few days later he was beheaded matter of fact there's historians that tell us that by the time Timothy ever read this letter Paul was already dead here he was reading a letter saying don't have the spirit of fear but have the faith let the faith the gift that God has given you Stir It Up don't walk around don't don't live in this life that way don't have the spirit of fear IM it something see if fear is a spirit brother Mark what kind of spirit is it Anyway anybody want to answer that what kind of spirit is it brother bam said when he went came to a healing line in the message the in Veil people were coming to be healed he said you are now healed if that shadow would leave you he said but as a servant of God I'll pray he the people were standing there he said you're already healed if you can get that shadow to leave you what shadow was it that was overshadowing them and keeping them from their healing he said what shadow is it he said I'll pray and ask God to cast that demon of fear that's afraid to take God at his word afraid that you can't get along afraid afraid that you just can't make it afraid that you just can't believe God afraid that God just won't bring you through afraid that God won't keep you afraid that you can't make it to another day he said as a servant of God I'll pray and ask God to take that Spirit or that demon of fear take it from you he said there and I believe God will heal every one of you and you'll get up from here tonight and you'll walk out and be well see we have a different pattern than the world has but wesy our pattern we're led by a different Spirit the Bible says I got just a few minutes I'm not going to hold you long I know what time it is he the Bible says the that that we're led by a different Spirit brother Mark the sons of God are led by the spirit of God see Paul said don't be led by the spirit of fear the Bible says we're to be led by the spirit of God and the spirit of God it always leads you where back to the word of God so whenever you get a little bit off you don't have to worry about Spirit of God's going to come by he's going to lead you back to the word so you that's what Jesus said he said follow me brother B said that's the only remedy we God's ever gave to anybody was to follow Jesus Christ it's to follow the word he said we must follow him it's the only way to have eternal life we follow him it's the only way to Healing it's the only way the only way for your for your trouble to be over it's the only way to get out of the valley it's the only way to be able to overcome he said follow him it's the only way that we'll be able to to get anything from God and we must follow Jesus Christ and and brother B says so the leadership of God is to follow the vindicative word of the hour by the Holy Ghost In other words brother Wesley it's the very spirit of God that comes into the Believers to lead you out of a state of fear it's the spirit of God God that leads you out of your condition it leads you out of the the mindset of the world and the ideology of the world and the Theology of the world it's the spirit of God that leads us so friends it don't matter what kind of condition that you ever get in it may not be today it may not have been yesterday it might come to you tomorrow but I want to remind you as a gospel preacher it don't matter what's surrounding you it don't matter what condition you're in it don't matter how bad it is or how bad it seems if if you're surrounded by doubt or surrounded by fear or surrounded by unbelief it's God that will send his word in order to bring you out it's the word of God that'll bring you out every time sir we can get a lot of opinions from a lot of people how to help us out of our situation but the word of God will lead you out every time it don't matter how deep you get into it the word of God will lead you out you go to a man of God say brother bring me the word of God on the subject cuz I need something to lead me out of this the word of God will lead you out every time he won't leave you stuck in some place it's the word of God will lead you out I thought my a't it something about God let me tell you what he does the spirit of God will take the word of God and he'll walk right down into your living room sister Denisha and he'll look right at the problems that's going on in your house and he'll turn around and take you by the hand and he'll lead you out of the house that's what he done when he went into gyus his daughter here she was laying on her deathbed but Jesus walked right into the condition they were in and he took her by the hand he said arise and be well yes sir he comes in right where we live that's what we need we need a we need the preaching that comes in where we live I I I know I I sure love preaching that makes you feel good too but sometimes we just need preaching that goes right down where you live and correct the way we live and take the things of the world and take them off of us friends we can't make make a Rapture all tied down to the world we got to be set free he'll come down into the condition and bring you out think about this is this is where Rahab was this is here on the outside you look at this girl she was a she was a harlot an ill- famed woman and here in this you you think of this that that that here here she was in this life I don't know what happened in her childhood and all the things that transpired in her life to cause her to be in the condition that she was in but God saw the condition she was in and here I thought isn't it something that out of all of Jericho and all the homes and all the houses that these two men could go to they went to the rahab's house and here as they were they were in there I thought here here they come Joshua had given them an order here they're coming the the army of Israel is on the outside of Jericho knocking on the door they they knew they were coming they they knew they had no defense against it and so here they were they were waiting on this and know these two spies they enter in brother Mark and they make their way down to this house and so as they they get in they go in there and and all of a sudden they realize that that what's about to happen you realize there was a great fear in the land of Jericho but notice I want you to see something that it wasn't just Jericho that was afraid whenever Rahab speaks to these men listen what she says she says for We Have Heard how the Lord dried up the water and Y brought y'all out of Egypt and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt it wasn't just the rest of Jericho but Rahab was right in the mix we heard about it and our hearts didn't melt she was afraid but Mark the the the nation was afraid they were they were living in the same state she was she was living in the same state of fear that they were living in but there was one difference between Rahab and all the rest of the people in Jericho is that brother Mark how many knows what that difference was Rahab was predestinated by God so even though they were all living under the same spirit that Rahab was living under but she was predestinated by God she belonged to God before the foundation of the world don't think things caught God off guard Paul said we were predestinated Why by God's forn knowledge God knew who we were he knew everything we'd ever go through he know the very thoughts that you would think God is an eternal God he said God knows this and and and and Rahab was predestinated by God matter of fact the Bible says that she perished not with them who believe not but she believed brother said she believed the message of the hour think about Rahab here she come brother Mark she believed the message of the hour she was in a she was in a condition she was walled in in a city she was living in a in a harlot's house she was living a harlot's life she was she was living in a state of fear it was a terrible condition he said but she believed the message of the hour my I thought my here here here come these two Preachers by our house and they begin to talk to her about about the the the the the army of of Israel and how they were out on the outside and and he said but by faith she believed the message of God in her condition and she was saved man isn't that something he said she didn't have to go get right somewhere in order to start believing but in her condition she believed and my friends don't you see don't you hear it this morning in the middle of your sickness she believed in the middle of your trial she believed in the middle of being down she believed in the middle of your sin in the middle of the problems and tri but Mark she believed in her condition and she was saved God knew her condition but man said that great Harlot Rahab listen she become a Believer he said I look through her history think about this woman you know how many knows what Rahab was Rahab became a proelite of Israel how me that's a good thing by the way I know that people misunderstand that word a lot today but but a proelite means that you change somebody from one belief to another now I know Jesus said that that the the Jews had made people because they were proales they were two-fold Childs of Hell let me quickly explain that the reason he said that was because they were taking them out of one thing that was wrong and bringing them into their own denomination of Judaism instead of bringing them into Christ he said see so you've made them a proelite into your belief and now they're a two-fold child of hell cuz they was wrong before and they're wrong now but a true proelite is to bring them into truth to bring people to Christ that's what we ought to be doing we ought to be bringing people out of the belief of the world and out of the ideology of the world and bringing them to of Christ that's what we ought to do butam says see because of her belief in God she was an Israelite she was brought into the Israelite Faith she was a proelite of Israel she courted a general in the army of the Israelite Army and watch what God did for that woman she moved to Bethlehem and here when she moved to Bethlehem they had a son look this little Rahab woman that that was in this condition that was walled in in a spirit of fear that had no way out she moved to Bethlehem she had a son by the name of Boaz Boaz married Ruth and then they had a they had a son by the name of Jesse and Jesse had a son by the name of David and out of the lineage lineage of David here he said here come Jesus he said why is it here from this woman that was in this condition down through her lineage come a man that we call Jesus Christ my da make every believer shall he said why because Faith cometh by hearing of the word of God it cometh by hearing of God that God is a god of Heaven and Earth and believing on him and that's what Rahab done it didn't matter what she was before it didn't matter what condition she was in it didn't matter that she couldn't get out of it and she had no way out of it What mattered was is she heard the preaching of the word of God from a couple of spies that came into the land and she believed the word that they told her and God brought her out he said what what made her a real believer let me tell you what made her a real believer he said Rahab become a Believer what made her a real believer he brother man said see Rahab she was a type of the believer today she's a real believer that's your type Rahab was a type of the believer today she's your type every one of us come out of something we come out of some condition or another but she's the type of the real believer you say well what made her a real believer because when she heard of the things of God she believed it isn't that something God corrected her wrong and she accepted the correction she heard of the supernatural she believed it she heard the miraculous she believed it he said look look at Rahab have mercy on me spare me I don't want to die with these unbelievers I don't want to die as an animal but let me die in the arms of Jehovah God I believe you're God God he's both God Of Heaven and Earth he does visible things he makes things real think about Rahab what she testifies of brother wesy here no wonder she was the type of the True Believer she was testifying of things she had never saw amen somebody she never saw it she never seen Joshua she just heard of Joshua she didn't know what he looked like she didn't know how strong he really was she didn't know how power how a mighty man of God that he was she'd never seen him she never met Joshua but she believed she never never seen the Red Sea open but she believed it she never seen the army take over another Nation but she believed it she she never seen God she heard of God she never seen the works of God she just heard of it others had seen it but brother bam said but what was the difference with her is she believed by hearing it isn't that what the Bible says faith cometh by hearing the word it wasn't that she seen some great Miracles or seen some great move of God brother Dave Paul she believed it because she heard the word and let me tell you friends when that Faith came to that little harlot's house I wish I had an hour to preach on faith coming to the harlot's house now when Faith came into her house it changed everything it didn't just save her brother B it saved her entire family When Faith entered her house it saved her family butam said see why he said because if you've got enough Faith to save yourself then you can have enough faith for your family to be saved too my isn't that something if you have enough Faith to save yourself then you can have enough Faith to save your family he said thou and thy house isn't that isn't that isn't that what he told the the the Centurion when he came he said thy and thy house shall be saved then he told them those men those spies as they're preaching to her what do we got to do to be saved she said said well as they let her down on the Scarlet thread out the window they went men had run off into the Wilderness looking for him she let them stay there and then they escaped in the middle of the night they said you take this token this thre bread and you hang it out your window and when we come in this army's coming we're going to make a vow to you that your family will be saved don't you realize what's happening look at what she was living in here are these men of God preachers that's the way the prophet typed on they were the preachers in the end time it was an imminent judgment she lived in the age of judgment coming on Jericho and these preachers were standing in just like preachers today standing in the pull pit saying judgment is imminent the Judgment of God is coming Upon This land but if you'll let this scarlet cord hang out your window God will honor it the army of Israel when they come in there won't be a single soldier that'll ever touch your house there won't be a single Rock that'll ever fall off your house there there won't no judgment come to thy house if you'll display this token establish your house and let the token be on display my isn't it something here here they came and she took this Scarlet thread brother Mark she hung it out the window those preachers when they came here they were telling her if you want them to be saved get them in here behind the token if you want your family to be saved get them in the house see it's up to the preacher brother Mark to testify The Works of God and it's up the preacher to to testify the the Holy Ghost is on its way and and God's the Judgment of God's on its way and they can tell testimonies and they they can do all that but it's up to you to believe it she had to she had to do it she had to she had some action she had to take the thread and hang it out of her window cuz she heard the preaching of the word of God hear these men listen what they were saying my can you type this today I'm going to close can you type this today we are acquainted with Joshua's Army this is what these preachers were telling her we're acquainted with Joshua's Army we're acquainted with the great Army of Israel that's never lost a battle they're going to come and they're taking this city your right to fear there's right to be tear in this land they're taking the city and ain't one thing going to stop them they've never lost a man in battle they're men they're real men of God they they don't even get a scratch on them when they come to battle the enemy just falls down down before them they're going to take this city we're coming we're acquainted with Joshua we're acquainted with the army of Israel we're acquainted with a pillar of fire we seen it with our own eyes we saw the the Red Sea when it parted we we know people that was there in Egypt when they came out matter of fact my grandma was one of those that came out of Egypt when they were down there locked up in that old system and had no way out many people could tell you that same testimony today but we're acquainted with the message when it came and it brought them out we're acquainted with a prophet when he walked down into the land of Egypt and he said come out of her my people pack your things and get ready we ain't going to stay in this we're going up to a higher Place God God has called us to a higher ground now take the token and display it my is't it something the token brother said listen it's the Holy Ghost today it ain't something of day going by it's the Holy Ghost today that's what we come to preach it's the very it's the same holy ghost that there ever was here a prophet of God would come into a land right in the middle of the time of judgment you said brother M what are we doing today why are we in church today why are we here on a Sunday morning in the in the end of October in 2023 still preaching the same gospel brother Jared it's because I can stand before a group of people and say I'm acquainted with Joshua I'm acquainted with the Holy Ghost I'm acquainted with the move of God I'm acquainted with the power of God I'm acquainted with the Miracles I've seen people I've seen God do the miraculous I I've saw the supernatural I I'm not ashamed of it like Paul said I can stand here and say I'm not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not ashamed of what I'm acquainted with I'm acquainted with the message of the hour I'm acquainted with a prophet of God I'm acquainted with a supernatural get behind the token that God has given us in the hour it's the only thing that'll ever save you you know what she did brother Mark that's our commission that's our commission there there's a there's a lot of claims of people being Christians today but we have a commission to bring people behind the token get behind the token friends let me ask you this whenever Rahab what do you think Rahab done whenever she was standing in that house and that token was hanging down her window I promise you she went to everybody in her household and said you got to come in the house well the army of Jericho's coming or or of Israel's coming my it's everybody's Running Scared well let them run scared but come in my house Raab we can't come in your house you're too close to the fight your house is right on the wall I'm going to go hide in the middle of the city somewhere she said come in my house there's a token that's displayed God gave us a way out there's something that we can get behind that'll bring us out of this judgment there's something we can get behind that'll bring us through the death that is coming Upon This Land come in my house you see the whole world has a form of godliness they go to church they join churches they try to make a long showing and they go to church and and and but they go out and they live differently there's no fire in their soul at all there's nothing they're not interested in anybody else everybody can go die if they want to we feel like we're saved let the rest of them go but that ain't real Christianity Christianity is to go after the Lost go get your brethren and do something about it can we stand and fold our our hands and claim that we're saved when when men and women are dying on every hand the streets are full of women going to churches with shorts and painted faces and walk up down the street cigarettes in their hands and paint all over their face and it look like a bunch of foxes or Wolves or something and men walking up and down and doing these things and joining churches and things like that and they call it Christianity and you'll hold your peace said how that's not what we need tonight we need men and women of God that'll stand upon the word of God we need those that aren't ashamed to be acquainted with the word of God we need those that aren't ashamed to be acquainted with the message of the hour he said see what we need tonight is a sign that a man or a woman is saved he said what is the sign is that they go after other Souls as quick as they can they testify of what God's done in their life they go they have a desire to win souls see your sign is what displays who you are well you think about it well you're displaying it the Bible says you're a temple of God the only God the world sees is you you if you look like the whole rest of the world well what are they seeing so let your light shine before men you're a candle on a hill not to be hid your sign ought to be on display listen what Paul says don't be ashamed don't be ashamed to display the token don't be ashamed you know what you know what Rahab done she took that sign that Harlot sign out of her window and she replaced it with a Scarlet thread she replaced it with a token she took that old life out of her window she replaced it with something else you know what the sign is you remember remember the story that I believe brother bil Graham had told the story about the about the man that that had went down and and or the little boy went or walked by a bar one time and he walked into the bartender in there and he said you know sir he said your sign's down outside and so the bartender went out there and he looked up and had that old nice sign up there hanging he said well he said no my sign's still up there buddy he said everything's fine and the little boy looked over and there was a drunk laying in the gutter he said no I'm talking about your real sign he said that guy right there he he said your sign's down just kind of joking around he said see but that is't that the way it is Bram said that's the way it is a man under the influence of what you're selling on the inside is the best sign that you have a man under the influence of what you're selling is the best sign you have he said so when we see a man under the influence of the Holy Spirit until his life is burning with an oldfashioned Pentecost to fire that's the best sign God ever had that a man is saved it's the best sign how how will that come about it won't come by joining a church it won't come by anything but accepting his pardon through Jesus Christ your innocent substitute there ain't one place you can get it it's Jesus Christ and him alone no church can give it to you no preacher can give it to you no Prophet can give it to you the only way you'll get it is accepting your pardon through Jesus Christ but Mark here's what Rahab she heard the message of the hour and she believed it she took that old sign down she hung her token down said see that token that same token that we're holding on to today if the music players would come that same thing we're hanging on to today there's a Scarlet thread brother brother Morgan it's what we got on display sometimes we make mistakes and sometimes we fall you know why because we're men and women sometimes we get out of line and sometimes we get out of character sometimes we get crossed with one another because we're men and women but because we're Believers we overcome those things we come together we put our arm around one another we encourage one another when you're in trouble guess who's going to be there the th those those Believers that you put your arm around they can be mad at you today but when you get in trouble Watch What Happens they'll forget about being mad and they'll be there and you'll be there for them cuz we're Believers Sons and Daughters of God we got something on display brother the David displaying the token in our life a Scarlet thread isn't it something that a little thread he said you know something about that Scarlet thread he said that's that Scarlet thread it weaves all the way through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation it ties the whole scripture together that Scarlet thread right through the cross of Calvary weaves all the way to the very beginning that way nobody would miss it it's the token that we have on display said you know when this is what God done just like he did with Rahab he saw you and he knowed you wanted to be saved he saw you in your condition listen little Rahab he knowed you wanted to be saved and the only thing he could do was to go down his he had a son born and a body of flesh made like those men he said that was the antidote for God himself to become sin that he might pay the price cuz it wouldn't it would take the highest thing there is to lift man out of their condition it took the highest power the greatest power the greatest thing there ever was for the mark it took him it took the one that was above every Angel he was above every Archangel he was the highest that there ever was and he came down and became the lowest isn't it something you know how low Jesus went he went all the way down brother Mark to the lowest city on earth which was the city of Jericho it's 850 ft below sea level Jesus walked down into Jericho the lowest city on planet Earth and he went below the lowest man up there by the name of zachus to even zachus had to look down on him that's how low Jesus went the greatest man that there ever was became the lowest of the low that he could bring us out said he came the richest became the poorest even one stormy night he said the bird has a nest the foxes have a den he said I don't even have a place to lay my head the highest of the heavens became the lowest of all lows even animals had privilege above him as far as the Comforts of this life he became the lowest of the low said but that wasn't the end of it as low as he lived it wasn't the end of it but the Jared he even went lower than that he went down on calvary's Cross he allowed him to take his life and he suffered the the death of the Cross when he did he went down into hell in the lowest parts of Hell to set captives free it didn't matter how low you are it don't matter how low you've been there ain't nobody that is too low for Jesus Jesus to go he went to the lowest Prophet said you know where what he did I love this he said he went down he said here's what he did he took a hold he took a hold of a string he took a thread and he went all the way down to the lowest parts of Hell to where there wasn't nothing else that person in their lowest condition could get a hold of it said then he then he then he resurrected and when he resurrected he brought that string that was that was all the way down in the bottom he left a knot on it down there in the bottom and he took that string through his resurrection and he ascended into glory on the throne of God he said and from all the way the Bottomless Pits of Hell into the Throne of God he has that string that's attached all the way down he said it's the very threat of God it's that same Scarlet core he made a high way that men and women could be saved he said but one day soon don't you worry God is going to pull on that cord and everything that's attached to it is going to go be with him in glory there ain't not one that'll be lost from the lowest pits of hell it don't matter how deep she was in the middle of Jericho it don't matter how big of of deep of a pit that you're in from the lowest pits of hell and one day he'll pull it and every one of us will come out of it you say but matter what I do you get a hold of the cord that God's laid down it's the lifeline that God has sent down to humanity maybe you just stand to your feet today it's a Lifeline that God has given us I wonder if somebody lift their hand and take a hold of it this morning the fountain that's filled with blood he said he came down the very one that was at the beginning of time one day he'll stand at the Ancient of Days and he'll pull that great gospel cord and all that's on that highway from the beginning of time to the end time they'll be lifted up he'll draw them out of existence and right into eternity again that's our God it's our token don't be ashamed of it this morning then I don't know about y'all but I feel the pull of it glory to God I feel the pull of it I I I'm not just saying that I feel the pull of it there there's a tug going on in the hour that we live in take a hold of the lifeline he's pulling at your heart what's dealing with your heart right now that's the pull of the cord what's what's dealing with you why why what what's causing you to want to serve God it's the pull of the cord brother Mark right in the imminent judgment is the very thing that'll bring you out oh my let me tell you what Joshua did watch this Holy Ghost Army when he came into Jericho here in this time of judgment brother Mark the wall Begin to Fall here rahab's house was on the wall and not a single Stone fell off her house shook the city down to nothing where there wasn't a stone standing but every stone stood on rahab's house oh my you say how how what what gave her such strength she had a better Mason she had a better Stone Mason than the rest of them it was a hill M if you could see what was really going on I wish we could get a picture of what God does for his children brother wesy and that that Army begin to March around around there and great noise and a rumble and the walls Begin to Fall people are shaking in fear and and dying and falling on every hand but here the angels of the Lord was standing over there around rahab's house I thought my I could just see them standing there with their hands over on the wall don't let one of them move boys hold on let the walls fall this house shall stand let the world fall but this house shall stand it's the angels of God that held her up when Joshua came in the top of the Holy Ghost the Judgment of God come upon this land he turned to the commanders to those preachers he said go get those go get all those that belong to you go get all those that you saved all those that you told to display the token go round them up go to rahab's house and call them out and make sure nobody touches them oh M can you imagine what it was like in the middle of a greatest judgment that ever struck and all a sudden there's a knock on the door I imagine they were in there just having a little prayer meeting Lord we don't we don't know how to pray real but we're kind of new at this we don't even know how to pray we've had seven good days of practice when we heard that Army marching around and all of a sudden the knock came to the door can you imagine the man opened the door here they open it up maybe maybe one of the men of the house opened it you know after all he's don't want to let nobody in there it's going to harm him May one of the men of the house he opens the door and here's stands a soldier in Joshua's Army he said I'm looking for Rahab you standing over there in the corner that's me Rahab come on get your house get your family bring them with you he see her go Gathering them around come on this is this is the man this is the preacher that came and preached the message to me that turned my life around he's the one that told me to hang the court out my window and I believed it ah even if they had a little doubt in their heart it left them brother West they followed listen they followed Rahab out of her house Rahab the leader of the jeroan that gave their heart to the Lord Rahab the one that everybody looked down on the lowest of the low but they followed her out of the house her life changed she went on little Mark isn't it something that's what God's doing with us one day you'll get a knock on the door that's the gospel truth one day you'll get a knock on the door and there shall be an angel of the Lord say it's time to go maybe be one of your loved ones that's already going by I heard the prophet say it two different ways one way he said that something will happen to you and you this body will start changing and and mortality will begin to fade into that Immortal body and you'll turn around look and you'll see your loved one standing around in your house other ways he said you know what he said you'll sit there one day and one of your loved ones will come on and when they do it'll give you enough faith that that'll start happening to you I don't care which way it is some of you may need that to have faith some of you may have enough fate to see it already but I can promise you this one day your loved ones will stand in your living room they'll stand in your bedroom in the middle of the night and brother Mark right in the middle of one morning when you you think you've gone as far as you can go and you don't think you can make it another day the very dearest ones to your heart will be standing there saying hey wake up it's time to go there's a knock on the door the Judgment of God is coming to this land but he's calling you out I promise you that I don't know a lot of things but I can promise you that I'm not ashamed to stand with the Gospel of Jesus Christ Paul said he's he's given us something greater it's immortality in life not to be bound by death my even just talking about them they gather around where we are the angels of heaven can gather around our loved ones gather around the meetings if you could see what's in this meeting this morning if you could see those that are gathering around you in this meeting this morning it's like it's like Elijah that one time when he told the prophets or the the servants Eyes Lord would you open his eyes that he could really see the prophet didn't go out there and look and see what it was he just believed by faith that they were there he didn't have to go outside he believed it by faith that's what Rahab done she heard and she believed it by faith I wonder how many this morning can be like that Prophet was and say I'll just believe it by faith faith I can't see them but they're there I can't see the Angels but they're there when I'm in the M middle of trouble I can't see God but he's there he's there all the time calling us out ah he's here this morning isn't it something to serve a God he said he won't leave you in that state I'm waiting on that knock I'm going to walk in and I'm not going to be ashamed I'm going to be a real Soldier I'm going to do my best I may fall flat on my face sometimes sometimes I let y'all down I don't mean to I pray you forgive me for it sometimes I Don't Preach good enough I go home and think my they need to find a better preacher sit there and think all the what I could have said and what I could have been a little bit better maybe I should have slowed down maybe I should have sped up maybe it would have been better maybe the people would have received it better maybe that it would have been a little bit better for him every time I almost I think that way I don't ever feel like I'm good enough for that but I know this I want to stand for the Lord I'm not ashamed of the Gospel I encourage you this morning take a hold of it be not ashamed amen maybe we just bow our heads this morning I didn't mean to hold you so [Music] long Lord Jesus Lord how we love you Lord oh we're so thankful Lord a token that we can display this morning God something that we can stand behind Lord God I know that many today Lord that are watching this service or even here and God may be going through great trials and decisions in their life and looking for directions and answers help and healing for their bodies and so many things Lord for we're a needy people Lord I know how the enemy would bring such things upon the church and try to steer it from the rightful Direction but Lord I just pray you'd give us the courage as Believers to stand on your word and Lord I pray God you'd bring such a spirit of unity amongst the brothers and sisters Lord It's the desire of My Heart Lord I've gave my life to this gospel Lord to be able to preach and encourage people to love one another and do for one
