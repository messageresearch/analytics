amen I I'm thankful tonight to be called by the name of the Lord and amen to know tonight that no matter what we're facing or what we're going through uh I believe it is an honor to be in his house tonight amen to know that on a Wednesday night he can come by and speak to us and fellowship with us in his word and amen I believe things can change on Wednesday nights don't you amen just a few moments in his presence and things can change forever you know I heard brother Matt saying out here may have had a rough week and a rough day and I don't know what everybody's going through but the Lord knows tonight and amen I was just heing the prophet of God this week he was speaking in the sermon and there was a person come to the meeting they were blind and they were deaf and brother B said they never missed one service he said every service they was there and finally somebody went to them one time and they had however they could communicate with them they ask them why ever service are you here in the service when you can't hear you can't see you're in this condition and however they communicated back they let him know that they wanted the devil to know whose side they were on and you know I thought that was something amen there's not one of us tonight in that condition amen but we're here tonight no matter what we're going through to let the devil know whose side we're on Amen we're on The Winning Side tonight the prophet of God Called It the amen side and amen we're honored to be on his side tonight if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to go straight to the word we have a few places to read tonight we want to look in the Book of Genesis the 19th Chapter and then also we're going to read in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter amen and while you're turning there tonight we do want to greet you in the name of the Lord and it's sure good to see everyone out tonight in the house of God and we do count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and just under expectation for what the Lord is going to do for us in the meetings this weekend and amen just to open our hearts up tonight and amen prepare ourselves to receive from him amen amen the Book of Genesis the 19th Chapter and just before we read the word let's just bow our hearts together tonight and let's ask him to come by and send the spirit of Revelation in Among Us how many would say Lord reveal yourself to me tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you on this Wednesday afternoon Lord as I stand here tonight behind this sacred desk once again Lord I'm very well aware that we're not here in this building by ourself but Lord there's an unseen Supernatural host in our midst that has come in this place tonight father to push back every Spirit to push back every enemy that would try to hinder your word as your Prophet has t us Lord that the word Goes Forth and the devil does everything he can to beset it he said but one believer is the majority in God and Lord as I look across this building tonight there's more than just one believer there's a whole church full of Believers here tonight that would come in one mind and one Accord then Lord we know that every devil is defeated Lord every spirit's power is broken father and Lord as we have sung the songs of Zion and the spirit of the worship has gone forth we're now inviting you to come and Lord may you be the speaker among us tonight oh God may you push my thoughts aside push Lord the things that Lord maybe that I've studied and looked at if it would not be what's on your mind or heart for this service I've done what I know to study and apply myself so Lord I surrender to you tonight Lord may you come and take control of the gift that you placed in our life father may you not just speak through me oh God but Lord may you hear through the Believers tonight Lord and father May the fertile ground of the heart tonight be Lord may it be cultivated Lord to father to prepare to receive the things that you have for us Lord now Lord we commit this meeting tonight in your faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says am amen and amen the Book of Genesis the 19th Chapter and the first verse the Bible says there came two angels to Sodom at evening and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground now I want you to notice here that lot is entertaining these angels and I want you to notice where lot's sitting the Bible says he's sitting in the gate lot is sitting in the gate of Sodom now if we go back to Genesis 18 just one chapter over Genesis Chapter 18 and verse number one we're going to read about another man and his name is Abraham and the Bible says that the Lord appeared unto him speaking of Abraham in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day so it's a Divine appearance and one man sitting in the gate but there's another man who's sitting in the tent Door In the Heat of the day now also in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter I want to read there uh from the ninth verse uh you'll know that brother brandham uses this text in his sermon going beyond the camp in Hebrews 13 and verse 9 Paul here writing he says be not carried about with divers in strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace and not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein for we have an altar I I love how Paul says those words we have an altar we're not looking for one we have one we of the they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of those Beast whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp now wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate so verse 11 Paul is referring to the Old Testament verse 12 Paul is speaking of Jesus but then if you look in the 13th verse he says let us go forth therefore unto him so it's gone from the Old Testament to Jesus now to us the believer and now he's saying let us go forth unto him without the camp bearing his reproach now watch this for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen we have no continuing City but we seek one to come we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen we we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I want to tonight by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight I want to be mindful that it is a a Wednesday evening so we'll not try to hold you too long I'll preach fast and you amen fast and we'll get out fast okay uh but I I want to talk to you for just a few moments tonight on this thought if I would title it amen I want to speak to you on going be on the gate amen going beyond the gate brother Bram says in 1960 is there anything too hard for the Lord he said did you notice when the Angels Came to lot he said lot was sitting in the gate amen but Abraham was sitting in the door see the gate comes into the yard but the door goes into the house he said i' like to sit on the door or in the door on the altar as close as I can to him that's where my expectation is on the altar amen waiting for his appearing so uh brother Brandon must have known that there was some significance to these two scriptures amen that he would take time to positionally show where lot was sitting and then to show where Abraham was sitting and as you look at this amen lot was sitting in the the gate and the prophet said the gate comes in the yard amen but then he says Abraham was sitting in the door amen and the door goes into the house so it's showing us that the gate is an entrance amen so far amen but then there's a further place to go so you can come into the gate and you can come in the yard and you can settle down there but then you realize there was another man amen who went beyond the gate who went beyond the yard he went into the house amen and his name was Abraham I love that because the prophet of God shows us amen that we're living in a day of going Beyond he says it seems today to be a day of when people are going be on the camp Amen in everything they're going Beyond now you have to agree tonight that in education they're going Beyond in science amen they're going Beyond in religion they're going Beyond in everything in the world Amen they are going beyond the camp now amen Webster gives us a beautiful definition of the word Camp he said it is a place with temporary accommodations amen of Huts or tents or other structures amen it is a temporary dwelling place so a camp amen does not have a foundation it does not have amen Footers or concrete it's a tent or it's something amen that is not permanent it's only temporary amen and I want to set to you like this that we cannot make amen a temporary Dwelling Place a permanent place amen amen there's some places that we've got to go amen but we cannot stay there we've got to move forward because there's an anointing on amen not to stop short of the promises of God Amen in Genesis 13 the Bible speaks of these two men Abraham and lot and he says brother said we find out there come a Strife between lot hergan and so forth he said I want to show you something here about the coming of the Lord he said Abraham was an heir to the world how many would agree that Abraham was an heir to the world he said but lot was a type of the luk horn believer so now he's going to establish to us amen that Abraham is heir to the world world but lot is a type of the Lorn believer he was a Believer he left his homeland to sojurn with God but never fully surrendered he said and that's what's the trouble in the Full Gospel Church tonight along with the rest of them is people who has left the world Amen they keep out of the world they don't want to go gambling or drinking or carrying on Amen they are a Believer but have never made a complete surrender amen so lot was a type of a Lorn believer that had surrendered so much amen but he had never made that complete surrender that would take him Amen to the places that Abraham could go another place brother said remember that lot amen lot was a type of America he said it's proven what was the sin of Sodom it was perversion he said in this American country of ours the women has degraded themselves so much amen until the natural sources of man amen has been perverted so here a prophet is establishing that lot is a type of a Lorn believer he's a type of America not 1964 he said down there in Sodom we've seen what taking place lot was a type of the church natural that was down in Sodom the organization and they got a messenger down there there was a couple Messengers went down there a modern Billy Graham and Oral Roberts amen I'm I'm I'm laying the foundation that lot was a type of the Lorn believer he was a type of America now he's a type of the organization down in Sodom and then the prophet of God says and God's word calls for total separation he said lot wanted the world so now we see amen why that lot did not go all the way because he still wanted the world so amen if he went through the gate into the yard he was in the gate so he could still hear what was going on in s him and he could still see what Abraham was doing but he did not want to make that Full Sacrifice or that full surrender he said and God tore his world up and separated Abraham and lot he said because lot being a type again of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true he just went on down to s him because he did not have the spunk Amen to call right right and wrong wrong now I want you to catch something here amen lot is a type of a Lorn believer he's a type of America he's a type of the carnal Christian he's a type of organization can I say this to you amen lot is an established type of somebody amen that can only go so far but they cannot go the rest of the way amen but our God is not a mixer he is a separator and God did not leave lot and Abraham together but separated them because he had more inheritance amen for Abraham to move into than lot was willing to go amen see Abraham was a separator and lot was a mixer you say why would God call that a separation he said because God called Abraham to a total separation because God requires somebody say requires amen God requires a complete separation from all the world amen amen in order to bring him into what he was air to he had to separate from the things things that would hinder him amen from going into to what his inheritance was now I'm I'm going to say this as plain as I know how sometimes amen advancement requires separation y'all forgive me that's pretty straight but I'm just going to say it amen sometimes in order to advance amen it requires Separation The Prophet said no matter what the world says they still want Amen to bow to the Modern Trend of modern religion but there was no social gospel for a real believer he said they still believe that God is Holy amen they believe that he requires Holiness and he requires the new birth amen and he requires a separation from sin amen now let me say this when God separates you amen he's not doing that to be mean he's not doing that to be unjust he's not doing that to be a to be an uncaring or unloving father but he's separating you from something Amen to something so he don't separate you and leave you Idol without something to come to but he separat at you from something to join you to something else and brother said Jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation he said we find the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when he will Ascend in the presence of God there will be amen a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats he said God will continually has been separating amen and that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does you see it in every meeting he separates a and Faith from unbelief amen listen we're getting ready to go into a meeting amen I think tonight would be a good night for a total separation amen from unbelief because listen amen unbelief is not going to inherit the promises of this message unbelief is going to say that's not so and that's not so amen but if you can separate yourself from unbelief then you can realize that God is not calling you to a total separation to leave you without something he's trying to take you into something that's greater than what you're part of right now I think it's a powerful thing when the prophet shows us that the first man amen that separate himself he said that man was Adam right I want to establish this he said Adam separated himself amen from the word to go with his wife amen so Adam's separation was not an advancement amen it was a regression amen Adam separated from the word amen to go with his wife that question whether God kept his word or not he said what a perfect type of the lukewarm carnal Ed believer today that still wants to cling with their tradition instead of taking what the word says He was separated to his wife he said and the carnal believer is separated amen from the word to the church amen I'm narrowing it down here amen because we're not a bunch of carnal Believers amen lot is not our type amen we do not separate from the word amen to stand with the church amen but we separate from everything that is contrary to God's word amen to stand with the word said that Catholic told him said well God is in his church he said God is in his church but he's in his word and the only way he'll be in his church is if his word is in his church and I believe there's a bride in the last days that is not built upon the ideas of a man she's not established on the personalities amen but she's following Vindicated word that is calling her from the separation from unbelief and tradition Amen to move into the inheritance that God has given her in the age she's living amen always somebody say always the word requires total and complete separation regardless now somebody say well that's a little hard no it's not regardless of who you are regardless of where you come from the same requirements is is is established to every believer now every one of us sitting here tonight we're on a journey how many would agree amen we're on a journey and I believe that in a journey amen there are steps in that Journey I do not believe that we are on a journey of of of of of of reduction amen but I believe we're on a journey of growth is it is it okay I believe we're on a journey of growth and I believe that as long as we are here amen we are growing in Christ I believe as long as we're on this side of Eternity amen we are growing in Christ no matter how long you've been serving God Amen there's always room to grow in the revelation of the word that you're following now when you look at this you realize that the natural a types the spiritual and you know as humans tonight you had a human journey and that human Journey began as a birth and you was born an infant right amen a newborn then become an infant then become a baby then become a toddler then become a child amen then become an adolescent then become a pre-teen then you become a teenager then you become an adult then you become an elder amen see it's constantly but it's not you going down amen so to speak it's you maturing amen or moving forward now Paul says in Ephesians 4 he said that we would all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen another word for stature amen is maturity amen so Paul is not praying that the church amen would shrink amen but he's praying that the church would move amen from infancy into maturity they would move from adolescence amen into the full stature and that word fullness in the New Testament is a body of Believers that which is filled with the presence and the power and the agency and the riches of God of Christ amen I want to go ahead and preach for a minute tonight amen this church is not full of tradition and she's not full of Creeds and she's not full of dogmas Amen but there's a bride on the earth tonight who is a living manifestation amen of the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ in the age we're living listen we're not packing a bunch of bitterness and we're not packing a bunch of ill feeling amen but we are packing the divine presence of almighty God we are packing the power of God and the mind of God and the faith of God hallelujah and the knowledge of God is in this body tonight and it's moving you into maturity now I can prove it to you because the very next words Paul says that we henceforth be no more children that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of do by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but Paul says speak the truth and love that they may grow up somebody say grow up that they may grow up in Him in all things which is the head even Christ I love this word grow it means to increase it means to become greater so Paul is saying that as the knowledge of the Son of God comes into the church it will literally establish the church and it will move the church chur amen from childhood into manhood and the prophet said Born Again Christians amen they grow into the stature of Christ as they live they are born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby it takes form and begins to grow and the first thing you know here they are in the full stature listen you got to quit letting the devil sell you a bunch of lies about yourself that you're not growing and you're not progressing amen when I'm not taking steps like brother mad I'm not taking steps like brother Joe amen I'm not taking steps like this one amen your measuring stick is not somebody else your measuring stick is the word of God and the Bible says amen that footsteps means possession and some people here tonight got a size nine foot and some got a size 10 and a size eight and some got a size 15 amen listen they're not all going to make the same steps amen but if they're moving in the same direction amen then every step is an advancement from where they were when they started and I believe I'm looking at some people people tonight let's got their walking shoes on in the promises of God listen I may not be where I want to be amen but thank God I'm not where I used to be I may not be where I want to be but there's a word that is speaking over my life and it's causing me to grow it's causing me to mature it's causing me to move into Christ where he is the head of my life and he is the very captain of my salvation listen if you make one centimeter today and two tomorrow you're three centimeters ahead of where you were when you started if you make one foot today and one inch tomorrow come on some days are going to be inch days and some days are going to be feet days and some days are going to be centimeter days amen but whatever you do just keep on moving amen because there's higher Heights and there's deeper depths of the grace of God for the bride to move into there you are day after day year after year they stay the same see now come back to the word remember showing you the reason why they stay the same why they stay the same in growth is because they're growing in the word see that's the place the bride grows is in the word again he said we went through it this morning but you cannot expect a baby to be born to man it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow go preach the gospel amen but we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ amen so Paul's holding desire amen is to move the church from childhood into manhood amen now listen the prophet that we're always talking about how bad the world is getting amen and we are forgetting how powerful amen the church is getting at the same time that we're focusing Brother David on how bad the world's getting listen we know the world's getting bad and it's not going to get better amen but I refuse to let the devil use my eyes Amen to investigate how badly ought to see is kidding amen I'm looking looking at the Unseen amen I'm looking at the power and the faith of God and that's all I can see I can see beyond what America can see I can see beyond what Sodom can see I can see beyond what the lukor church member can see because I'm not a lot I'm an Abraham and I've got an inheritance and it's not in the yard it's in the House Pro of God said the church is growing how many believes the church is growing each age is lot in the scripture here so through the Holy Spirit Reveals His word amen by manifesting it man it feels good in here tonight amen by manifesting it and Vindicated it his amen showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised in amen now listen do you realize amen that the word of God is a spoken word and when that word is spoken it has to be manifested and the manifestation of the spoken word of God Amen is the Vindication that it is is the spoken word of God in other words when it spoke and it manifest there's no more questions this day this scripture is fulfilled in other words when Jesus rather when God Amen in the Bible said let there be light amen he spoke the word right amen and the prophet said he spoke and said let there be light he said and out of nowhere there was light he said the light was the manifestation amen of the spoken word he said and the same light that was the manifestation of the spoken word was also the Vindication of the spoken word listen friends amen and the same God that said let there be light they said let there be a sun they said let there be a moon it's the same God that said let there be a bride he said let there be a bride amen and I want to say this this bride is the manifestation of the spoken word of God in the hour that we're living in amen what are you saying I'm saying what a prophet said in the Rapture he said when a germ comes in the womb of a female he said you didn't become a human germ from your father and then the next a germ from a dog and the next from a cat and the next from a chicken amen it was all human germ amen so from the time amen of come on now amen from the time that baby was conceived in the womb of that mother it was a human germ and it was another human germ amen and for n months or was human J God hallelujah there was human germ on top of human germ amen someday she could feel it kick amen somay she could see it kick amen some days she didn't feel it kick amen but she never lost the thought that I am carrying the prod I am carrying a child and in nine months this child is going to be born and he's going to be the manifestation amen of the seed on the inside of me listen church of living God Amen you cannot give up and you cannot turn around and you cannot let the devil at chm from denomination and from tradition you are a word born pride and the only thing that will escape the wrath of God that is coming upon this world is the word of God manifested In the Flesh of the Bride then the body of Jesus Christ the bride will be a part of his body he was the word and the bride will have to be the word that's plain enough for me it'll have to be the bride have to be the word he said now watch Luther amen watch word added to word somebody say word added to word word added the word not tradition added the word not Creed added to word not denomination added to word not Sodom added to word not Lea added to word but word added to word see Luther's justification Wesley's sanctification Pentecostals baptism of the Holy Spirit the rest restoration of the gifts and all the rest of it goes with it see but it's got to be word on top of word amen germ on top of germ life on oh God life on top of life amen to bring out the full stature of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he said and what is that word bride is the manifestation of this hour see the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living in that's why Prophet said this this is not Luther's day this is not Wesley's day this is not Pentecost day amen this is bride time this is the bride day listen Luther manifested his word Wesley manifested his word Pentecost manifested her word amen but now there's a virgin born Bride on the face of the earth that is going to move amen from the infancy of Pentecost Amen to the maturity of the word and all the life that is in the seed is going to gather in this bride come on you've not been thrown out you've been built you've not been thrown out to the wind to land wherever the wind goes you have been built Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not amen Prevail against it amen well I might as well preach I'm here amen the gates of hell has been against this church it has been against you body of Believers amen but listen you're still here and the Gates of Hell have not prevailed as a testimony that the Gates of Hell will come against it but they will never Prevail against it because greater is the germ of the word on the inside of the church than the pressure of the devil against it are you hearing me the devil will throw everything he's God but you'll still be standing the devil will throw everything he's got but you'll still be standing because you're not part Baptist and you're not part Methodist you're not part hybrid and part this amen but from the bottom to the top you are word through and through well we might as well enjoy ourselves amen this is a word church where the word has become the headship amen we sing by the word we Shout by the word we operate the gifts by the word we preach by the word we conduct ourselves by the word it's a word built church and Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation flesh and blood is not revealed this he said what was it a revelation of who he was see you're built on a revelation of who he was and if you're built on the revelation of who he was he's the same oh God yesterday today and forever than what he was yesterday he is today and what he is today he'll be forever because he's the unchanging God with unchanging ways the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the Bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature he said therefore can I read this to you if the corn of wheat of Christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the Dark Ages any grain that goes in the ground must die or it cannot produce itself reproduce and the great church that he established on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer martyr and go in the dirt in the Dark Age to bring forth again the age of Luther and come on out somebody say come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day I love what he says brother Matt therefore the bride Amen in the Rapture the bride in the Rapture will come forth listen if Luther come forth and Wesley come forth and Pentecost come forth this bride will come forth and she will be in the Rapture there is all pre-planned by God and God is backing it up well you might as well tell that devil to get out of my way I'mma go in the Rapture my body's going to be changed there ain't no devil can stop it there ain't no Spirit can bind it listen this ain't a man backing this up this ain't a preacher backing you up this is almighty God is backing you up and he will put you in the Rapture by the power of the Holy Ghost and he'll not ask one devil if he can do it he'll not ask one critic if he can do it what God determines to do he's going to do and hell will not stop him high water will not stop him there's a force in this Pride it's the force of almighty God that'll Lift You Off the Earth someday what are you saying I'm saying God's going to have a mature church and no Devil's going to stop it he's going to have an adopted church and no Devil's going to stop it brother B said I believe we've been children long enough I think we can say amen God is going to turn his church into manhood now when we turn oh God when we turn that corner and we move into man manhood we quit acting like babies we played and Frolic as children amen but now somebody say now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child listen you know why I spake as a child brother said because he thought as a child we could fix a lot oh help me Lord we can fix a lot of problems if people would change their thinking we could literally fix a lot of situations if people would stop thinking like babies and then acting like babies now come on y'all know I'm not a politician I'm a preacher quit thinking like a baby and then everybody don't look at you won't offend you quit oh quit thinking like a baby and then every time you don't get called on somebody wasn't against you when you can lay aside childhood and take on manhood which is the maturity of the headship of Christ it'll change the way you think and brother brother Morgan Paul said amen let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus do you really think Jesus thought like a baby do you really think he let every little whim and every little thing that went around amen keeping from the house of God no he knew who he was he knew where he come from he knew where he was standing and there's a reason there's a devil against this church it's cuz you're not a bunch of babies playing Church you are manifested Sons and Daughters of God following the pillar of Fire come on the devil's give you every reason not to be here but you're still here Grace Tabernacle the devil's give you every reason to quit amen but you're still here and you're still growing and you're still moving forward what are you saying preacher I'm saying greater is he that is in Grace Tabernacle than he that is in the world against it it's a bride that is mve from thinking like a child into thinking like an adult because she's now now can I tell you why because she's moving from the milk to the meat she's moving from milk to meat as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby so they got to have milk to start but they cannot stay with milk they got to move on to meat I remember when Malachi amen was living on a bottle amen every time every time you want to eat he got a bottle milk got a bottle I remember one night Mariah was feeding him and I looked over and he's asleep and I'm thinking wait a second he's eating wake up she said oh no he's fine he can eat and sleep I thought I preach to people like that they can sit there and sleep cuz all they want's milk and they never grow well come on Church they never grow but when you start eating a T-bone steak you don't fall asleep at the table and eat that T-Bone steak and if you're going to claim to serve steak serve some steak come on church are you hearing me I believe this message is serving steak I don't believe we're serving come on I don't believe we're serving milk anymore some are getting milk but there's a bride here that is eating steak come on you say preacher are you saying we all got to go to meat no because some still need milk amen but don't stop at the milk stage amen come on into the meat of the word of God that is in season it'll put some strength on your bones it'll put some Faith muscles in your spiritual body it'll teach you how to fight against the devil it'll teach you how to fight them come on it'll Fe teach you how to fight them depression Spirits amen when you start eating some meat of the word it'll cause you to come to church when you got ever reason to stay home when you start eating the meat of the word it'll cause you to love and forgive you know the Holy Spirit feeds on the word every word now there are some people they're still eating on me they're still eating on milk and when they do come everything bothers them well don't get mad at us cuz we're enjoying some steak well preacher all that shout brother said people don't believe in shouting thing of it is they haven't got spiritual joy and the joys of the Waters of Life cannot flow through he said because the unbelief and the cares of the world has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth so when somebody does start growing and eating some meat well they're just emotional and they're just Pentecostal and they're just too loud they're just too hell come on Church y'all know I'm telling the truth I have literally seen young people get the Holy Ghost and break out in a Revival in a church and go out somewhere and hear somebody sit there for 30 minutes and tell me how horrible it is that them young people are shouting and they're on their feet and they're dancing and I'm sitting there asking them well listen I remember when you used to act like that come on I tell you what we might as well preach it's Wednesday night but you know what happened amen as we got a little bit of knowledge and we got a little bit of understanding and we got so revelated that we don't need to sing No More more and we don't need to shout no more and we don't need to pray no more amen but that's where the devil will kill your spiritual growth but I say Satan you will never write the word kabad over the Church of the Living God we'll fight that devil until the presence of God comes in the church and changes somebody's life because God desires amen spiritual growth more than natural growth don't get mad at me God's not God's not upset for natural growth he loves to see it but what he really wants to see is spiritual growth amen listen the Bible says in Deuteronomy 2:1 that we turned and we took our journey brother brother mad it amazes me we turned and took our journey he says Into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea and the Lord spake unto me and said you have compassed Mount sier many days and the Lord spake unto me and said he have compassed this mountain long enough you've been around this mountain long enough and the next words he says brother Wesley he says turn you northward in other words he changes brother Ro he changes their Direction he says listen Mount Sierra was not a bad thing the Red Sea was not a bad thing that was a stage in your journey you had to go there but you got to go beyond this mountain there is more in your journey the prophet of God said they were 40 he said by automobile they were an hour and a half away he said by walking they were two or three days he said listen they could have been in there in no time he said they were that far away from the full promise he said but a short Journey amen turned into years of wondering in the wilderness amen all because they chose amen law over Grace brother B said watch Grace had provided them a great thing it provided them a Passover Lamb for their sins provided them a prophet as their instructor provided them an angel as their guide and they broke out in the greatest Revival they had ever seen when the world was in darkness Israel had light when the when the Israelites was in bondage and then they had Deliverance see Ram said watch he said and in this revival they crossed the Red Sea and they found all their enemies dead in the Red Sea behind them then why would they want to add anything to that now think about this because the prophet said let us notice here amen how the children of Israel starting on their journey is a perfect type of the church today amen making its way to the glory land don't you believe that we're each day amen gaining a little ground as we go along building a campfire on a new ground every night he said I feel a little closer than I did yesterday and I believe you do just building a new campfire each night amen moving on up somebody said that with me moving on up so we're not staying where we're at amen but every day we're moving on up see God's church is not going down we're going up what devil sold you that lie that we're going down we're not going down we're going up because the force of predestination is on the inside of our soul listen the world forces that way and the world forces this way but the power of God forces upward and the bride will go in the Rapture by the power of God now I believe it I believe God foreen a church I believe he ordained a church that's going to stand before him as a manifestation of what he thought of in the beginning I believe it church I believe that Martin Luther amen didn't stay where he was at remember said he reached justification then he said Wesley he reached sanctification he said then Along come the Pentecostals in the baptism the holy spirit amen what were they doing moving on up into higher Heights amen is it okay tonight he said now when the Brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said who said this they said they said this is the summit God never said that they said this is the summit this is all of it he said but Brethren that's wrong see there is no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God that has never been tapped yet amen the blessings and the powers that we know nothing about it's never been revealed to archangels is just laying ahead for the church amen that will believe listen church amen the power of God the revelation of God is not coming it's here and the prophet says let's move up and claim our rights Brother David I think it's time to move up and claim our rights listen you got rights in this message come on Church you got rights in this me you have got rights in the revelation of the message of there I'm just going to go ahead and preach since I'm here because a bunch of scarecrows have got around the revealing of the son of man and around the Revelation the seventh seal and around the third pull and all the things of the message and said now listen don't go in there because if you go in there you'll just be a dead intellectual member with sin in your life amen but that didn't come from what a prophet said because a prophet got the revelation of the seals and he said whatever I received was stimulation of Revelation and he said I like to woke up the entire neighborhood amen and then he says a mystery is the mind of God revealed and the supernatural element Still Remains don't you let some devil tell you that the revelation of this message takes the supernatural out of the church that is a Lie from the pits of hell if there's ever been a supernatural it ought to be happening right now as the bride is moving into the revelation of the revealing of the word of God in the age she's living in let's move on up now I know what people say they say well I don't know if there's anything for me well the prophet said let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God he said I think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the Lord Jesus how many loves the Lord Jesus he says your motive ought to be to receive all that you can to receive all that you can from his Bountiful hand of mercy so this message has literally got you eaten out of God's hand now you say brother Andrew where are you going well remember this the prophet said in Masterpiece 64 he said notice here the life somebody say the life the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tassle in the husk all gathers in the seed he said now the life that was in the stalk went on to make the other see and justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection amen back to the word again to manifest itself listen that's not a quo to find that's a quo to preach the devil out of the church with anden this message did not put the anointing on the outside it brought the anointing in the church and released us to know the difference between the Shu and the seed and the way of the Holy Ghost has been made and he's now here in the person which when he came in he was announcing you're not just church members you're adoption people you are the people that a prophet prayed and said God has been preparing a people to believe all things you are Romans 8:19 you are the earnest expectation of the creature amen waited for the manifestation of the son of God Amen this is one of them quotes brother Mt amen I love to read it in serpent seed he said God hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudence and promis to reveal it to the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God would be made manifest when God's sons that rejoiced with him before the foundation of the world when the Great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days he would manifest these things to the sons of God you know the scripture teaches that prophetic announcement and here we are we're not coming to it we're in it the Revelation is not on its way the Revelation is here then somebody tell me amen what a disappointment it must be to God when he looks at people and says when you is in my mind I seen you shouting about these things but now that I released them you're arguing and separating and contentions well come on church amen and listen amen well we don't need that we don't need this amen how about we just get back to saying what a prophet said we need and he said we needed prayer lines and he said we needed altar calls and he said we needed the spoken word and he said we had the third pull and he said we needed repent services and we need shouting Services he said we need prayer services and we need testimony Services I just got one question who died and left you in charge Amen to put the church in order the church was already in order when a prophet walked off the scene he say preacher back away I will not back away from that nickan devil that's trying to creep its way in this message and clamp our young people down and clamp our churches down I think if there's ever been a time Amen to shout that devil out of the building right now is the time to do it and let the liberty of the Holy Ghost come back in the church and manifest himself with power and Revelation back up amen how much further we going to back up till we ain't even got a land come on Church how much further we going to back up until we're another cold formal bunch of message people sitting in a building I refuse to back up I refuse to lay my sword down and let some unbelieving Child come in this land and strip us of a blessing of the power of God I'm going to shout when I feel like shouting I'm going to dance when I feel like [Applause] dancing I'm going to preach deep when I feel like preaching deep and I'm going to preach what the Holy Ghost leads me when he leads me I know that devil don't like it but I really don't care you can clap a highand down but I ain't a highand that's the reason God's opening these things to us is God is bringing his sons into manifestation can I tell you what he's doing he's going beyond the limitations brother Matt he's going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge way into the spiritual Revelations and bringing it down don't get mad at me but for the first time in 2,000 years there's a people that's got a right to preach these things we don't have an education we're not intellectual men we didn't come from the right come on let me let me just go ahead and preach to you tonight for the first time there's a people got a right to enjoy these things for the first time the denominational hierarchy has been Stripped Away from the life of the believer and no matter what background you come out of no matter where you was born no matter what you've been through you have got a right to enjoy the revelation of the word of God in the age you're living now I know what I'm talking about amen cuz if this was a reformer day you would have had to had an education but this is not a Reformation this is a restoration this is not a desperation this is a restoration come on the bride age is not an age of desperation it's an age of restoration it's an age when everything that was in the beginning has been returned to the church now can I prove it to you can I prove to you you got a right to enjoy these things no matter where you come from is that okay the one bringing it to you was packing water to a moonshine steel when he met the pillar of fire and was commissioned not to smoke not to drink or defile his body in any way come on sister destiny he was met and he was separated amen from the world to the word he was separated by the pillar of fire brother Wesley from the world to the word so he could stand in a pull pit and look at AA Allen and look at or robbers and look at all kinds of intellectual Giants and say come take your Bible and stand by my side you know why because he went beyond the limitations somebody shout it's time to go beyond it's time to go beyond the limitations brother said he's gone beyond the limitation amen have we SE in the Bible here's them that has wisdom not he that learned in some Seminary but what he can learn on his knees before God and what God pleased to give him is the sons of God made manifest so if we back off of the message and we back off of the anointing what's going to bring the church into the manifestation of the word of God Pentecost failed brother said it was a good shuck but it's dead see but listen God is all knowing so brother said I'm finite and he's infinite how many can say Amen so he cannot can have a few more minutes so he cannot make a mistake I can and you can our Brethren can Oh Glory to God well that's a good point right there amen I think that help a lot of preachers around this message is to realize amen that this message don't need your ministry your ministry needs this message come on church I'm just preaching the word when you can humble yourself to the message preacher Deacon or lay member and say I'm wrong but a prophet is right you can move from the confusion of the Shu into the presence of the Sun and let it bake all the greenness out of you and then the prophet said we can stand today and say I don't know more than I did last year I'm not progressing any he said but God cannot progress because he is perfect to begin with can I tell you what the devil's Desiring to do and I'm just going to I'm going to just just put it low gear and plow for a second the devil is Desiring to stunt your growth and he will go to any extreme he has to to do what he wants to do brother B said watch he said the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on again 1962 returning Jubilee the church was to go on to the full promise the church tonight should be in her Splendor of Glory she should be waiting for the coming of the Lord instead of that she's scattered everywhere wondering which is right is this right is that right I'll join this I go over here and down there oh return and get away from those things and I can I go on you see that the progress of the church has followed the progress of time listen can I can I give you a prophetic announcement we've changed from airplane to astronaut we have changed from airplane to astronaut there's got to be a change and we've seen the three changes come in the progress of Transportation of power it's always an added power an added power an added power keep more and more and more why don't the airplane get up there it hasn't got the power to do it it isn't built for it amen it couldn't do it but the astronaut has the power so do we just stay in the airplane and sympathize with the airplane and feel sorry for the airplane no we're ordained brother Jared to get out of the airplane and get in the astronaut and go beyond the limitations come on church he said listen the tues in it has the power so when he gets in there he don't put the power in it the power's already in it oh God the power is already in it come on Church you're not adding power to this message the power is already in it come on when you get in the Astron the only thing he does is just get in there and sit still and watch all the Dows the power that lifted off the Earth is already in it again horse and buggy was Earthbound but now we're in an astronaut age and so has the church that's the big swing over that I cannot get before the people they've settled down for an airplane some of them for a horse and buggy but God's got an astronaut age what are you saying preacher I'm saying don't settle for nothing less than what God has ordained for you to have the devil has another way to pervert he said see the devil perverted let you think to satisfy your guilty conscience that you go join a church and you're all right that's wrong that's perverting you cannot get satisf faction amen by joining a church you only become mental it's an intellectual Affair can I tell you what a prophet said if the devil can get you out on those things he'll take you to this other but don't settle for nothing less than an oldfashioned experience of the new birth to be born again of the spirit of the Eternal God when your soul and God you unites together and you become one in other words the prophet is saying don't settle for a horse in buggy age don't settle for for an automobile age don't settle for an astronaut listen Church there's an as there's a there's an astronaut to go get into that'll take us Beyond where we're at now now if you study the Bible and I'm going to hurry through these points because I I want to lay something in here in Exodus 33:7 the Bible says that Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it without the camp right a far off from the camp and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which s the Lord went out into the Tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp in the Book of Numbers the Bible says that the that the sacrifice was taken without the camp and there was the Waters of Separation now watch the prophet picked this up and going be on the camp he said said Jesus suffer out the gate he said seek to sanctify the people with his own blood sanctification comes from a Greek word which means cleansed and set aside for service now watch this in the Garden of Eden amen God established his camp for his people how many believes that he fortified his people in his camp now watch God's camp and God's fortification was this stay with the word regardless of what anybody else does you set separate from everything else but you stay with the word now the pro of God said that Satan amen is taking his people the other way he's taking them beyond the camp amen but God is taking his people this other way see Satan is taking his people beyond the camp of Reason beyond the camp of Common Sense beyond the camp of common decency see where the devil's taking them he's taking them into a camp of denomination but God's Camp is different from a denominational Camp the Bible says let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away see they go beyond the camp of God's word to find their answer now we're seeing where the confusion comes from is when they go Bey on the camp of God's word which is the message to find their answer he said people are persuaded of their dogmas and Creeds without the camp in their Camp of Dogman and Creed they have a camp also soul that puts them in this Camp his is the camp of Education theology Works doctor's degree educational personality everything that's against God's word camp but God is not going to leave you in that camp he's going to bring you unto himself to manifest the full stature of his promises in this age let me say it like this do you realize Moses was in the camp of Egyptians he was in Pharaoh's Camp brother said he was in his own Camp tending his father's sheep right he said and the pillar of fire come down and met Moses and Moses come out of his camp and got into God's Camp when Moses separated from his Camp over to God's Camp brother BR said now watch he said what did he do he said he went out there and saddled up a mule put his wife and baby on there and they said where you going Moses he said I'm going down to Egypt to take over he said a Onan Invasion now listen here's Israel in the bondage of the Egyptians and here comes Moses into that camp with the camp of God's word and says listen church he says watch when Moses came down the Vindicated word of God was at hand God made the promise he was there to deliver the people they moved from the camp they were in into the camp of God's promised into the camp of God's promised word of this hour listen they left their natural Camp they left the mud Camp they left the camp made with straw and brick and dwell in tents in the wilderness there was no grain or nothing else listen but what was God doing he was separating them because advancement requires separation now can I can I tie this together brother said watch he said one day God said Moses separate yourself from them so what did he do he separated Moses and Dayan and cor went right on and he swallowed them up in the gain Sands of cor he said now watch the same things have happened today that man made himself a camp amen a camp of creed and tradition and not God's Camp of his word see a camp of their own can can I can I can I bring this down he had to leave them for he is the word can I say this this he cannot stay where people are taught out of this word so the very minute you begin to teach out of this message is the very minute that God leaves the camp and the prophet said he cannot stay in that camp he never did he must stay exactly where his word is can I ask you what put him out of the camp what put him out of the camp brother B said their Traditions their Traditions put on the outside he said they let the Traditions take the place of the word of God he said may I say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today it hasn't changed a bit when he comes among the people it his power and manifestation to prove that his word is the same the people says a fortune teller a beyb a Jesus only listen but it has to be that way do you know what tra can I can I say this traditional teaching apart from the word literally crucifies the effect of the word Jesus said making the word of God of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such things do you look at this word effect it is to deprive of force and Authority the prophet of God said watch he said here could it be possible that the Gentiles has did the same thing when they've had the church ages of the Son of God but when now the veil of this denomination and things this veil of tradition we've got since Pentecost when the church Traditions has been rent the things that people said the days of Miracles has passed these things don't happen listen it's been brought into Plain View and they're ready to crucify it again now don't get mad at me but they're not taking this message to baptist pull pits and crucifying it they're not taking it to Pentecost lost the pull pits and crucified it but they're laying it on message pulpits and crucifying the effect of the message of listen I believe in the mechanics but pray tell me when is the Dynamics going to come well don't get mad at me they're already here and you know what I believe I believe our young people ought to know there's more to this thing than a bunch of mechanics and a bunch of intellectual gatherings I think they ought to know there's some fire I think they ought to know there's some power and some manifestation come on I think our young people didn't know what it's like to get lost in the spirit well brother Andrew you're getting way out there am I really y'all forgive me I'm struggling with my voice Jesus the word came on the scene he was a fugitive to his own see he went beyond the camp B said why they confess him is because their Camp can I can I close on this the reason they would not confess him is because they Camp had set its boundaries it wouldn't let him in the camp and it wouldn't let anybody go out too him they had their own camp but when he come among them I love this he was a breaker of their tradition brother Joe when he come among them he was a breaker of their tradition he did not come in there and agree with their tradition he came in there and broke their tradition because was some seed the proud of God said there's only one place he can go and that's under the shed blood now brother Andrew what are you getting that can I show you very plain Jesus was a breaker of tradition the Bible says in John 6 he said I am the bread right I am the bread brother B said Harvest time he said when Jesus said that was at the Feast of Passover they were standing there brother Wesley holding kosher in commemoration of the Mana that come out of the heavens in the wilderness they were drinking water from some rock and Jesus stood up in their midst and you know what he said he said I am the bread of life I am the water that came out of the Rock and they everyone rose up to Stone him do you know why because at one time that kulture was a blessed symbol but now it had become a blinding Tradition at one time it was a blessing to hold that culture amen but now the blessing has moved from the from the partial realization into the perfect realization church of living God don't get mad at me tonight amen but at one time it was good to be in the shuck amen but the seed has G forth from the shuck and now there's a bride that's not imp partial realization she is in the Perfection of the Perfection of the word of God now I know what you're saying and you're saying brother Andrew Jesus was a traditional breaker amen but am I well this what the prophet said he said let your faith in him who is the word revelation 19 when he comes he's going to be called the word of God riding up on a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him have I got any followers of Heaven they'll be behind him he said now watch break the denominational veil of tradition break those veils that's hiding from you break those veils of Pride you women your King's Daughters act like it live like it break every Veil no matter what PhD and lld says if it's contrary to the Bible break through that Veil and you will see if you'll just do that them old traditions and things and come to him you'll see him standing the mighty conquer the word promise of this age made manifest you'll see the Mighty God unveiled right here Among Us unveiled the Mighty God unconquered by traditions what are you saying brander I'm saying Traditions are barriers which become limitations but they've got to be broke sir because you're not lot you're Abraham lot is satisfied in the gate but Abraham I got here too late Abraham is fing a pull From Another Dimension can I can I just tie this together I'm going to do a horrible job at it but I'm gonna do my best I don't have time to read it I got to preach it Abraham is filling a pool this separation is not coming from what he can see Brother David he's feeling the separation coming from The Unseen you know why he's feeling that now come on Brothers you go home tomorrow or whenever go home tonight and let your wife wife go in the kitchen and see all of her Machinery there and go in her house and see all her decorations and say in the morning we're packing up we're leaving this house hold it where we going we're selling everything why see there's a call there's a pull are y'all with me come on there's a tug there's a city there's something beyond what we're at there's something high are pulling at us so Sarah we're selling everything we're going to become pilgrims and strangers and we're going to go find this city Abraham wait a second you mean I got to leave everything in here and go search for this city you got to leave everything Sarah if you'll separate from this what we're looking for is greater than this are you hear me so they s out and brother Wesley the Bible says they set out to find this city do you realize that they never found that City they never saw that City but the prophet said the very place where the city will sit is the very place that MDC served communion to Abraham are you hearing me there was a call and it was a strange call but it was a call to go beyond it was a call to go beyond your comfort zone it was a call to go beyond what you're used to listen there's a city let me just go ahead and say it amen I can't sit down and I can't shut up and I can't lay the microphone down and let some intellectual giant take over there's a city and it's a real City and it's calling my name it's calling your name the evidence of that city is in your soul [Applause] tonight you got to go beyond the Traditions you got to go beyond the limitations you got a part in that city as our musicians are coming it's a call it's a call to separate it's a call to go beyond the limitations R said when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is is now listen church God he sets boundaries for his people God sets boundaries don't ever forget this God sets boundaries Satan sets barriers brother Tom God sets boundaries but Satan sets barriers you know what those barriers prayers are they're an obstacle that will prevent you from moving or excessing so there's something out there for you there's something more there's more Revelation there's more understanding there's more Victory there's more anointing there's more power it's out there but there's a barrier stopping you right but the prophet said break down every barrier throw away all self and surrender that once Supreme surrender to the Lord Jesus again I've got to nail it down or Satan's going to rob you from it from this greatest display of the presence of the Holy Ghost here tonight be on the shadow of a doubt Bible evidence what God Said would take place listen friends I'm just going to read this and I'm going to dedicate it to these meetings this weekend there's a mighty rushing wind trying to get into the audience and to fill Every Soul here with the presence of God don't let Satan take it away from you hold on to it till you've passed the barriers of unbelief you said brother Andrew why would you dedicate that to the meetings because the prophet of God said that fourth stage was divine presence the word coming in the [Music] church will there be one here tonight could say I'm Abraham and I'm ready to go beyond the gate I don't want to settle down here in the yard I don't want to move in into the yard where I can still hear what's going on in Le oysa but then I can still hear Brother Matt preach on Sunday I don't want to sit here in the gate where I can still I can still flirt with this things of the world but then I can come to church when I need something from God but I want to go through the gate I want to go through the yard I want to walk into the door and I want to get on the altar amen we have an altar and I want to sit down there on that altar not by tradition but by Revelation and set my expectations on him Beyond any limitation I'm ready to move into all the promises well there be one here tonight could say that's me I've been saved I've been Justified I've been Sanctified maybe you've been filled with the Holy Ghost but listen Church it's the hour to move into the full promise want you to stand to your feet with us tonight how many can say I believe that I believe it's the hour I believe it's the hour to keep growing brother Matt I I pray it be okay to read something here and dedicated to this church I read this quote the other day and I was reading over to in today and the Lord just just begin to stir it in my spirit he said here's our little church sitting here Lord men and women who I believe loves you and I pray God that the spirit that's filled many of their hearts and days gone by will now come deeper and more so there's more may they lay aside every malice every Strife everything that's unlike you and move up today not to the manger but to C Calvary not as allog together to Calvary but to Christ the hope of glory the deity of God the magnificence of God the power of God that's now in our heart trying to draw us out of the things of the world that he might take us out of this Earth someday unto a better land God grant it today how many can say that's me Lord I'm ready to move out of this Earthbound Realm Heavenly Father all across this building tonight Lord is Abraham's father they're more than lot lord they're not satisfied with the yard they're not satisfied with a gate but Lord there's something on the inside of them there's something on the inside of them that's calling out for more of you more of your word more of your power more of your knowledge more of your understanding Lord the the prophet of God said move from the manger to Calvary from Calvary to Christ to the deity of God to the magnificence of God to the power of God Lord that strange call that strange call that Abraham received one day that strange call to leave everything behind and go sojourn in a Strange Land among strange people that you're Bible says Lord that by faith Abraham set out to find that City Lord by Revelation Abraham separated himself to follow you because Lord you didn't separate him to leave him in the minimum you separate him to bring him into the fullness and Lord I believe there's a group of people here tonight Lord father you've called them you've elected them you've chosen them Father some of them have come from different backgrounds than than others Lord that they're here tonight they love you with all their heart they believe you with all their heart Lord Jesus we want to be more like you with all of our heart we want to fulfill your word we want to walk in your ways we want to believe in your promises we want to see them manifest in US Lord give us the grace not to settle down give us the grace not to back up and let the devil make us feel like we're trespassers when we move into the revelation of this message Father I refuse to let the devil scare me out of the good things that God has revealed in this end time word father I know there's been many voices throughout the ages throughout the last days has said all this message is the truth and God sent a prophet and it's a it's a powerful message brother Brandon was a prophet he had a Healing Ministry he could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but Lord they never want to move move over into that third pool they never want to move over there where all the promises are laying they won't want to move over there where there's rights for them as the Believers they're scared they become too deep or I can't understand that there it's not for me Lord I pray tonight dear God that you would open up every heart Lord you would go in the depths of that heart and Lord you would place a craving in there a craving for the word of God a craving for the message of the hour a craving for the super Hallelujah for the supernatural Lord may it not just be something they hear on Sunday May it not just be something they listen to on Wednesday but father May every day they feed on this message and as they feed on it they're growing they're going beyond the limitations they're going beyond the barriers they're moving into manifestation they're moving into Revelation in Jesus Christ's name we pray with ever head bowed every eye closed please no one looking around just you and the Lord tonight with your heart honest before God you say Lord I need you to come I need you to come and put that craving in my heart I need you to come I want to feed on this message I want to feed on it more God bless you maybe there will be one here tonight just you and the Lord right now you say Lord we're getting ready to go in these meetings and the man of God is prepared laid himself aside set himself aside we're going into a Bible Conference I believe in these Bible conferences my life was changed forever in the first one 10 years ago it was in that meeting that God performed a heart surgery and put a craving in my life for the revelation of this word like never before you say brother well you're a preacher you needed that you needed that no I was a Believer and a Christian before I was a preacher you say brother Ander I'm just a young lady or just a housewife but can I tell you tonight you need that craving for the Revel ation to this word because it's what you're going to take a Rapture by how many can say tonight Lord I'm ready for that Grace that Paul spoke about to establish my heart I'm ready to lay aside things if I got to if I got to set aside this activity and if I got to separate from this activity Lord I want to eat on this word I want to feed on this word till it literally puts vitamins in my life Heavenly Father Lord all across this building right now Lord are hands raised before you father these are not just church members Lord these are sincere Believers father they've persevered through many limitations they've overcome many hindrances dear God to be where they are tonight now Lord I want to stand here tonight and declare to that devil that the Lord did not bring us as far as he has to leave us Lord you didn't justify us just to leave us you didn't sanctify us just to leave us you didn't just fill us with the Holy Ghost to leave us but Lord you've called us to move into that Perfection of your word father to feed upon the Mana to feed upon this message Lord father as I heard your Prophet say this week he said I get tired as a preacher sometimes he said I don't feel like going out on the road and preaching he said I get real weary in my body and tired in my spirit he said but then I get in there and I get to feeding on this mana and he said it just puts such a great capacity in me he said that I just got to go tell somebody about it Lord father I pray tonight dear God that that capacity would come into every believer in this room tonight I pray that capacity dear God would move into every life tonight dear God that they would get on a steady di of this books and tapes they would get on a steady di of this word father they would feed upon every promise they would feed upon every bread of your presence Lord and father as we go in these meetings this weekend Lord I bind the hand of Satan I bind the hand of confusion I bind the hand of Satan in every way it will try to hinder the word of God it would try to hinder the move of the spirit of God father we bind that devil in the name of the Lord Jesus and Lord we consecrate ourselves to you tonight as we move out this weekend in these meetings Lord may we shut ourselves in your presence father and Lord may we feed not upon the mind of a man Lord we're not feeding upon the mind of our brother Wayne Lord we're not feeding upon the mind of just brother Brandon but Lord we're feeding on the filling body word of the son of man and Lord it's good for the father it's good for the mother it's good for the teenager it's good for the preacher oh god father as hungry Eagles gather this weekend Lord Feed Us of your bread Feed Us of your presence oh God let us break beyond the limitations

but as long as I know Jesus I say that I can still go free will I say that I can still go free tell me what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me I'm So Unworthy to live yet not free to K but then a man on the cross put my name is really said that I can still go free now I never could Qui understand this one thing tell me why a king would want to leave his throne just to put on the road of an Earthly man and feel the pain of common flesh and B then he would later walk down that lonely path that LE to dark calary and the blood he shed my part in said that I could still go free when I say that I still go free tell me what kind of a man whatever reach down his hand and do this for me I'm So Unworthy to live yet I'm not free to kill but then a man on calvary's Cross he wrote my name it his will he said that I could see Go free that I say that I can still be free thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord reach down his hand and want to do this for me I'm So Unworthy to live yet I'm not to kill but then a man on the cross he wrote my name in his will and said that I could still go free can I sing this one more time will I never could Qui anybody ever just thought about it I couldn't understand this one tell me why a king would ever leave his glorious strong to come down to this whole earth and wear the robe of an Earthly man and feel the pain of common flesh and then to later walk down that a long road that led to [Applause] [Music] dark but the blood red stain they br all of my change and so that I could Ste free I say it I wonder if there anybody disree this evening say Lord I Thank you for the price you paid on calvary's Cross if we can come in in an assembly and lift my hand and be a free man or a woman of God Lord I Thank You Lord I'm Grateful this evening thank you Lord Jesus for me with I'm So Unworthy to live get my Fe to keep but then a man on the cross he put my name in his will and said that I could still go free I say a man on the cross he W my name in his will and he said that I somebody made a declaration this evening you didn't have to be bound amen there man on the cross he wrote my name in his will it wasn't I that told you brother the Travis it was he that told you we got a right to be free amen somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this even I wonder how many he broke through the barrier he said Satan has barriers you know what a barrier is a barrier is an obstacle that prevents you from movement it's an obstacle that prevents you from having access to something but I thank God that he sent something that we could break through the barrier isn't it wonderful how many's broke through it tonight let me I don't know if you ever seen a seen them horses get out there and line up to race you know what they put the horses behind before they run the race a barrier and after a little bit that old bell will ring when the bell rings the guy in charge he'll he'll break the barrier loose and you've never seen 1500 lb of muscle come out of a out of a chute that's been locked up and he's been he was born to run everything in his blood he was bred to run but he's been tied up and in a stall and everything in him they hold him back until race day comes then they March him out in front of a bunch of people and lock you behind the barrier and everything in him is what they they buck and fight and snort in there cuz something on the inside of them wants to run and finally the barrier gets broken and Buddy they come out there ain't nothing could stop them brother Mark that's what God's done for us we're not we're not just a bunch of mixed breed up thing bunch of a bunch of Believers but we're thoroughbreds amen you're thorough breads you're a pure seed of God and you're made to run amen I believe we ought to run this race we got a we got a word tonight that said we have the the power to run this race the Liberty to run this race amen I want to know how many's going to run it with me amen I believe I believe we're in good hands tonight that's what the prophet said he said God left us in good hands he didn't leave you in the hands of some priesthood or something that that the ministers are all up higher above the people and there's this hierarchy and all this he said but he left them in good hands of God-fearing men that love the Lord and and they'll preach the word of God and the and they're servants to the people they know their place they don't lift themselves up above people God's left us in those kind of hands that we could follow the Holy Ghost and I believe that's the desire of our heart we may all make mistakes we fail some sometimes we we get we say things we don't mean to say but our heart is right we want to serve the Lord we want to see God's children to be free that's how this church was started people being able to be free and serve the Lord and worship God according to the dictature of your heart and here brother comes tonight to remind us this is a message to our church this is where we stand as a body of Believers is the liberty of the Gospel is on display in this building it ought to be on you have the liberty or the freedom to have it on display in your life and mean you don't have to be bound by nothing we're a free people you're God's children how many just lift your hand tonight and say Lord I Thank God I'm free let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful tonight for a word Lord that would come and Lord what a privilege it is Lord to be able to live in this hour and to be able to have the word that we have Lord what a wonderful message Lord I Thank You For Men and like brother Andrew Glover and Lord the many evangelists Lord that are on the field today Lord I realize how
