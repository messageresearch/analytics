So he came looking for you tonight. I was listening to the prophet today and God rich in mercy and he said we were out there dead in sin and he said we deserve to be out there. But he said but God rich in mercy reached out his hand and pulled us from where we were. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? Well, one night wild home life raging sea. Oh, it looked as if I would suffer defeat as the blackness of night. Oh, closed off the light. My heart sank with fear. Oh, and my desperate crying out with pride. All I could see was no sight. With faith all but gone, I met the one who came looking for me. Yes, he came looking for me. Oh, he came looking for me. Oh, he made a way. There was no way that I could see. Well, I drifted far. But Jesus was near to rescue my soul and calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm. Cuz I met the one came looking for me. When oh Satan had already picked out my grave. His plan was to fall and put me away. I drifted so far. But anyone care, I soon be lost. Oh, I knew my destruction was a matter of time. But my Jesus appeared. Said, "This child is mine. Now I'm safe from all harm. For he walked through the storm when he came looking for me." I sing it tonight. He came looking for me. He came looking for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, he made a way when there was no way that I could see. [Music] When I drifted far, but Jesus was near my soul. All my fears. Now I'm safe from all harm. I like the Lord for me. Well, now Satan had already picked out my grave. His plan was before me, put me away. I drifted so far. Would anybody care that I'd soon be lost? I just knew my destruction was a matter of time. But Jesus came in and he said, "This one's mine. Now I'm safe from all harm cuz I met the one that came looking for me." How many can say you met him tonight? For me, he came looking for me. Well, he made a way and there was no way that I could see. I drifted so far, but Jesus was here to rescue my soul and calm my fears. Save from all harm. Cuz I met the one that came looking for me. Won't you give the Lord a hand, clap a praise tonight? I said, "I'm safe from all harm because I met the one that came looking for me." I think we have a right to praise God. Amen. If you don't have a right, you sure got a reason. Amen. We got a reason to praise God. How many's got a reason to praise the Lord? Amen. It wasn't just me that went looking for him, but it was him that came looking for me. Amen. Whenever I least expect it, but God showed up. How many's got that kind of testimony? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wasn't really looking, but God was looking. Amen. And he found us. He placed us. He called us. He set us aside for his purpose. Amen. And now we come to give back to him. You love the Lord tonight. How many say it's good to be in the house of the Lord? Amen. Somebody turn around and tell somebody say, "It's good to be in the house of the Lord." Amen. Amen. we come to receive something from God and certainly want to welcome everybody uh to the tent meeting and just look forward to what God has in store and uh brother Jonathan Martin will be speaking to us tonight and from Ohio and and uh uh he he's been uh he's been around the world and back in the last few days. I just got back from Pakistan a couple days ago and uh leaving here in a couple days and going to Jamaica and then to New Zealand and uh and in all of that he came to the country of Arkansas right in the middle of it to have church with us. So we're sure glad that him and his lovely wife and little Andrew there uh today was able to spend some time with them and so we want to welcome them. our ministering brothers that have came. Uh they've traveled a long way, made time uh to be here. Brother Wayne Lawson will be speaking for us here tomorrow night. Him and Carrissa certainly dear to our heart and and our family and uh and is always meant a lot to me. And we just got to spend some time in Ohio with brother Wayne, a lot of the the family there. So we I feel like we've been hanging out a lot lately. So we just been having a good time. and also brother David Siler and I've seen sister Susan today and they just made it in. So we want to welcome uh these pastors and taking time away from their churches and assemblies and I know that's a great uh burden to do that but we certainly want to welcome them uh in wonderful message last night. Brother Andrew Glover God be bless you buddy and Amen. Amen. And I sure appreciate them. I know they've been going through and just had the new baby, Sister Mariah, and I seen her back there bringing in the New Haven there to come to the tent meeting. This is her first tent meeting. So, uh, she lo shall this building. She's brother Andrew Glover's daughter. I mean, so if y'all hear a baby screaming back here, that's just her praising the Lord. Don't you worry. And, uh, if you hear a mama screaming, that's just her praising the Lord. Don't you worry. But we just, we just good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. And sure appreciate that message. I think that was a perfect message to uh to start a a meeting by and brother Andrew was preaching on God's soldiers and God building an army. And you know I I was reading today, Brother Bram said that's the way God's soldiers are today. He said they are trained to the word of God. Amen. I believe that we're a trained group of people. Amen. And he said and that so us. He said we are of all one great big army of God's soldiers and we're marching on towards the final victory at the end of the road. So, I welcome you tonight as members of that great big army of God's soldiers. That that's who's here tonight. So, uh we certainly appreciate all of God's soldiers being here, you brothers, minister brothers, pastors, uh churches represented, and just trust that you can just allow the Lord uh to use you and in worship and uh some with a song. If you have a song, make sure brother Ben knows. And I know he's maybe have a long list, but we just want the Holy Spirit to lead the meeting. And uh we just want to let God have his way. And uh certainly looking forward to the word tonight. Amen. And uh just but before we ask brother Jonathan to come, we want to had a couple prayer requests. Been praying for brother Roy was not feeling well. Also uh my daughter Jordan uh she's watching the service tonight and went to the uh doctor this morning and they they're trying to get her to hold on for uh uh 10 more days before they uh take the baby induced labor and and so her blood pressure's been really high. And so we just want to remember her in prayer as well. And and maybe if there's any any others that had a need, brother Brian, would you come and and uh and pray over these uh special requests tonight? Amen. If you have a need on your heart, just lift your hand to the Lord tonight. Bow our hearts. Most gracious heavenly father, Lord, we come before you, Father God. Lord, we've gathered around your word, Lord. And we know, Father God, that every promise is unto the believer, Lord Jesus. And we stand, Lord God, upon that promise, Lord. You see all the requests that were brought forth, Lord. Father, already being spoken by a son of God, Lord Jesus. So we've know you've heard him, Lord. We've know, God, that you've already gone into action upon their behalf, Lord. So, Father, the greatest thing that we could ask for, Lord, is that you would anoint our brother, Lord God, as he comes forth, Lord God, with a word upon his heart, Lord God, to feed us, Lord. Father God, that our faith, Lord Jesus, would reach high enough, Lord, to please you, Lord. Father, anoint this service and every part of it, God, that you would be pleased to come and dwell with us tonight, Lord. Father God, that we could raise your voice, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord God, that all of heaven, Lord Jesus, Lord God, would say that this is a good service, Lord. Father, we ask you to anoint every minister, Lord, that is here for these services. Lord, we ask it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord God, we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. How many's come to hear the word tonight? Amen. How many's ready to hear the word? Amen. We come been praying. And you know, I I asked the other day, how many's going to fast and pray for the meetings and get ready? There wasn't a lot of hands. I said I should have just said pray and not fast. People don't want to miss out on too many meals. But there was several that fasted and prayed. And but how many's been praying for the meetings? Amen. And praying for God to do something. And now we are in that moment where the Lord can come and speak to us. And you know, and just a few words in the presence of God is enough to change every situation. And anything that's going on or something you have need of, we just want to dedicate this time to the Lord and the receiving of the word of God. How many raise your hand say, "I'll do that." Amen. Just to allow God to come and speak to our hearts. And so we want to get prepared as brother Jonathan would make ready uh to come tonight and just allow God to have uh plenty of time and an open platform to be able to speak what's on his heart. Amen. Well, I sought the Lord and he answered me. He delivered me from every fear. Those who look on him are radian, they'll never be ashamed. Never be ashamed. This poor man cried. And the Lord heard me. Then he saved me from my enemies. For the son of God, he surrounds his saints. He'll deliver them. He'll deliver them. So magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. [Applause] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. How many can you say he's good? Blessed is he who hides in him. Oh, fear the Lord. Yes. All you say, he'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. So I say, magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name together. [Music] The Lord will be all his name forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a mighty God and he's our conqueror and uh he has destroyed the yolks of the enemy off of our lives. And I think that we should just give him all of our praise, all of our life. And and uh to give him all of the glory and the honor and uh so good to be under the tent. Uh just a tremendous atmosphere and uh so enjoyed the word of the Lord uh last night. And I say God richly bless brother Andrew and uh my just a just a perfect start to a tremendous meeting and uh just looking forward to what God has in store for us and and believe that God's going to move in a special way for his people and uh it's definitely a real uh privilege to be here and we appreciate uh brother Matt giving us the the invite and the opportunity to be here. I've I've got my wife here and my my youngest boy here somewhere. And uh there she is there in the back. And uh and uh so also it's just a real privilege to be able to preach with these wonderful men of God. And I've got just the the uh tre tremendous respect for them and the gifts that God has placed in their life and their ministries and uh just such a a tremendous blessing to the bride of Jesus Christ. I you know I I believe that we're we're preaching the greatest message that has ever come to the earth and and uh I I believe that God has given us everything we have need of for for the translation and the change of our bodies and and uh we're we're doing everything in our in our power uh to preach the message and to believe this message and it's not just a minister's message but it's it's a bride body and and I think we put our our licks of fire together and the fullness of the Godhead is dwelling bodily here among us this evening and everything that we would uh have need of God is here to supply it and and uh to meet in every heart and every life and so why don't we just uh bow our hearts and in a word of prayer and uh if you've come to the meeting this evening and you've got something uh just on your heart why don't you just lift that before the throne of grace this evening and let's just invite God's presence. I know I know he's already be been invited, but let's just now invite him to speak through his word and to deal with with every heart and every situation. Heavenly Father, we humbly bow our hearts in great reverence before your throne of grace, realizing that we're in divine presence. Lord Jesus, you are the almighty God. And we know that you're omnipotent. And Father, you are faithful to your promise, Lord. We know that you are here to meet every need and to minister to every heart, Lord. And we just invite you to speak through your word now, Father. Lord, the atmosphere has been created. There's been preparations made. Now, oh God, we would ask that you would just walk the aisles and come to every heart. Lord, you're the one that can change situations. And Father, you're the one that through the preaching of the word drops faith in our hearts, Lord. That we can reach out and touch the hymn of your garment as you walk by. And oh God, I pray that you would just uh minister to your children. Father, if there be any sick, any discouraged, Lord, you know every situation. Father, you're the great comforter. Lord, you can minister to to hearts where man cannot touch a situation, doesn't know how to do it. But Lord, you can move and and Lord, you can just move so perfectly, Father, and just just five minutes time and your presence can remove situations and change situations. God, we just ask that you would move, Father. Now hide us beneath your blood in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God richly bless you. If you have your Bibles, we will turn to uh Zechariah the 4th chapter and we'll uh read the first seven verses and then we'll also read from Psalms 110 and uh verse three. And again, we just want to say we appreciate uh Brother Matt and uh for giving us the invite and we love uh we love Brother Matt very much and we appreciate his friendship and his stand for the message of the hour and and uh he's always been just a a real blessing in my life and a real strength and encouragement. And um you know I I I was over in uh uh Pakistan just this last week and uh I I got I I I started getting some text about uh the service where brother Matt had ministered there at the home church and um how that God would just begin to move and just in a sovereign way and and uh you know uh begin to begin to hear about how that God began to pour out the his the power of his spirit and my daughter dancing in the spirit and my wife getting touched and moving in the spirit and you know uh brother Matt my my wife actually just she had told me just a few days ago she says you know ever since that service uh something's been totally different and uh so we thank God for that and we we praise God for for men of God who can be led of the spirit and and can preach the word and and believes in the moving of the Holy Ghost. And my we believe it with all that is within us. And and so Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning at verse one. And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, and said unto me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof. And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubable, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubabel, that thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. Now also Psalms 110 and verse three. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dw of thy youth. Again thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. Amen. So God just add his blessings to the reading of the word. You may be seated. I would like to speak on faith in grace. Faith in grace. Brother Brandham reading there in Zechariah the 4th chapter and when he come to the sixth verse that this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts. The prophet says, "Do you see the message will not come by some great might or powers, but by the spirit of God?" &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say in the junction of time that I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known. I believe that we are witnesses of that that we have seen the greatest vindication of omnipotence which omnipotence is all powerful and God has vindicated his presence with omnipotence and it's the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known. The move that God is moving through this bride is so far beyond man's thinking, man's intelligence. But this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our sight. Amen. We find that David wrote this in Psalms 118 and then Jesus picked it up and he says, "The stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. I believe that we are living in that day. This is the day that the Lord hath made and the this is the time that the headstone or the cornerstone has become the headstone. And this is this is not man's doing but this is the Lord's doing and we have seen it and it is marvelous in our eyes. Jesus said that I will come to you and the world will not see me but you will see me and because you see me you will rejoice because this is what God is doing through the church of the living God. It is the Holy Ghost moving in power and in manifestation that the world does not recognize what has taken place but the bride of Jesus Christ sees it and then Jesus said because I live you live also. Amen. So to see it to recognize it there is a manifestation of quickening power to bring life to the sons of the daughters of the living God. I believe that the bride of Christ has been awakened by a message to a realization and understanding that all the saints have longed to see it. Amen. They we have been awakened to something that is so supernatural, so sovereign, so unear. Amen. something that is beyond human efforts and and beyond laws and controls and regulations and dictates of human efforts and so beyond our five senses of of spirit and of flesh. But it has awakened us to something that is so far beyond our human intelligence. Amen. that the human mind cannot even truly fathom what is taking place in this age. Amen. But you see the prophet of God would describe it like this that we have been caught up into the realm of the Lord's thinking. Amen. This is not man's intelligence but this is in the realm of the Lord's thinking. This is not man's day but this is the Lord's day. This is a time of supreme of supreme authority. This is the time where the lion has spoke. This is the time that God has pronounced judgment upon the world. It is a judgment unto condemnation. It is a sentence of damnation. But to the bride of Jesus Christ, it is a supreme authority over every every demonic force of hell that has tried to bind this bride. It is the supreme authority over every spirit of fear, over spirits of discouragement, over spirits that are trying to hold this bride captive. Amen. Forces that would try to hold this bride and tell you the rapture is not for you. But there is a power, there's a force that is moving among this bride that is so far beyond our understanding that all we can say it is the grace of God. It is God coming down and moving not through uh amen not through the dictates of man. It is not through the dos and the don'ts but it is through the supreme power of omnipotent God to break the shackles off of God's people. It is a voice that is went forth in this day that said let my people go. Uh it is a voice of God uh that is standing in the gap uh and interceding upon the people and saying Satan you can't have them. You can't hold them any longer. But I have stepped in on the scene. Uh it's a vindication uh of divine presence. Uh it is a vindication uh of omnipotence. Uh the power of God uh that says Satan, you can't hold my people any longer. I pay the price. I've redeemed them. They're called out for my name's sake. &gt;&gt; You see, there's been a blending of dimensions. The Almighty God has moved among us and vindicated his presence like no other time in the history of the world. Amen. It's for a purpose to empower a bride. Amen. To manifest everything that God prophesied that this bride would be. Amen. It's a blending of dimensions. Amen. to catch you from one realm to a supernatural realm to change how we think. Uh I tell you friends, uh his presence has come among us to change the way we view ourselves. Uh to change how we view our families, uh to change how we view our failures, uh to change how we view trials, uh to change uh how we view our humanity. Amen. And it's a blending of dimensions. Uh the world won't see me, but I'll step in to your flesh. Uh it's a blending uh of dimensions. Uh where omnipotence uh is stepping into boys and girls and moms and dads. Uh and you're not looking at failures. Uh you're not looking at the weakness of flesh. Uh but you're looking at the power of the promise. And God is here to make good the promise. &gt;&gt; We've moved into a faith walk &gt;&gt; where God has made believing for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Believing for the rapture, &gt;&gt; believing for our own body change as easy as walking in the promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're a promised land people where grace has prepared us to walk in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace has provided us a pillar of fire. Grace has provided us, Amen, with an atonement. Grace has provided us with a vindicated message. Uh grace uh has prepared us uh to step into the realm of impossibilities. Uh amen. grace has has called has brought us into a walk uh amen that we can walk in through the promises uh and please God uh where God can look upon his children and say I'm pleased uh not because of your works uh not because of your humanity but you're walking uh in the footsteps uh of faithful Abraham uh calling those things uh that be not as though they already are. It's because you've come into a different walk, &gt;&gt; a promised land, people. You see, the token has given us the evidence. It's a good land. &gt;&gt; Amen. The token has given us an evidence. The angels are in the room. The Lord Jesus is in the room. The token has given us the evidence that our theophony is here in this room. The token has given us an evidence. Amen. That that that that we're hearing from our theophony. This message is everything you have need of to make the body change. &gt;&gt; It's your theophony. It's the evidence. It's a good land. &gt;&gt; You're not born of the natural Jerusalem. You're born of the heavenly city, New Jerusalem. And the toolken's giving you an evidence. It's a prepared city and God by grace is preparing you for that city. &gt;&gt; And it's a character that is fit to rule. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a good land flowing with milk and honey and the benefits of Calvary flowing from his bleeding side. But you see, the chemistry of the blood has already went to the ground. But you see that the spirit that was in that bloodshell broke and now it's a bleeding blood. It's the Holy Ghost that is moving into the church of the living God. What is it doing? Uh the the benefits of Calvary is flowing into the church of the living God. Healing is flowing. Deliverance is flowing. Joy is flowing. Peace is flowing. uh stren your children being saved uh and ready for the rapture is flowing. Uh revival fires uh is flowing. Uh the power of dynamics to the mechanics is flowing. &gt;&gt; You see the seven thunders of revelations 10 has locked the mysteries of the entire Bible. The thunder is the voice of God. So we have spo we have heard not from a man. We have heard from the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And it's for one purpose, to take the seals off of the Bible. Amen. And God did it for one purpose. And that is to give faith for that rapturing grace for the church. Amen. God in this day and hour, he vindicated his omnipotence to let you know that he is the lamb that has been interceding upon the ignorance of the people for seven church ages. Uh through the dispensation of the son of God, uh the holy ghost moving through seven church ages. Uh but when the lamb took the book uh it was a change of dispensation. Uh it went from son of God uh to son of man dispensation uh it went from just being a church uh to an adopted bride. Uh it went from just being church uh to Mrs. Jesus Christ. And in my name you have power. In my name you have supreme authority. It went from just being religious but it went to a son of man authority. It went to dominion. It went to rule over every power of darkness uh that would try to hold this bride. &gt;&gt; Grace, &gt;&gt; a change of dispensation &gt;&gt; from manage to grace. &gt;&gt; I'm building to something. You see, we've heard a we've heard and received a message of grace that ever since the fall, man has been waiting to hear what you hear right now. &gt;&gt; Adam longed for this day. &gt;&gt; Abraham longed to sit in the seat where you're sitting. &gt;&gt; I know you, the devil tries to tell you that you're a nobody, but Abraham would like to take your seat. Moses would like to sit where you're sitting. You young man, you young lady that is fighting spirits of depression and spirits of confusion and spirits of homosexuality and spirits of gross darkness. But I tell you, grace put you in that seat. &gt;&gt; Grace put you where you're at. Abraham would like to sit there. Moses would like to sit there. Jeremiah would like to sit there. But let me give you a news flash. Jesus longed for this day. &gt;&gt; Abraham longed to see Jesus day. But Jesus came to die on the cross. That he could step into this age. &gt;&gt; That he can reveal himself. Amen. That everything Adam lost is now given to you through the through the abstract title deed. Uh the abstract declares uh the devil does not have one lean on your life. But you were hid in the eternal thoughts of God and the devil can never get to you. It's grace. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This message of grace didn't come like a TED talk, but it came in power and vindication &gt;&gt; to con to convince the bride of her position. The power of God will put the people in the bride. The spirit of God, which is the word of God, my word is spirit and life, will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word. Then she's in Christ. Will put her in her place. I am looking out over this audience, this congregation, and I am seeing a grace woman. &gt;&gt; That may not be dig the right way to say that, but that's that's the way I'm trying to get it across to you. I I I'm I'm seeing a lady that the prophet of God would say, "Misgrace." &gt;&gt; Maybe I can take liberty and say, "Mrs. grace. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You see, grace is the unmarited favor of God. &gt;&gt; You can't earn it. &gt;&gt; There's not enough perfect works that you can do to earn &gt;&gt; the the merits of God. &gt;&gt; It's simply unmmerited favor. You see, Rahab's status was changed from prostitute &gt;&gt; to a condition, a status change that she was no longer considered Rahab the harlot. &gt;&gt; Grace did that for her. &gt;&gt; Tamar found favor to manifest seed. Grace did that. Sarah who was struggling in her own failures and complexes and and could not in the sight of the promise. All she could see was the weakness of her own frail condition. &gt;&gt; But grace provided Elohim &gt;&gt; and Elohim dealt with her complex &gt;&gt; and dealt with her struggles and dealt you see Abraham had already had a name change. It shows us that the seals had already been broke. That she had already been changed from just the old church to a an adopted son and daughter of God, if you will. &gt;&gt; But she still was struggling seeing herself a part of that promise that was broke over her life. &gt;&gt; But when Elohim came, he didn't deal with her &gt;&gt; with her own church name. He dealt with her &gt;&gt; in her name change. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. You may be struggling in your humanity. All you can see is your glaring complex. All you can see is your own failures and and inabilities. But let me tell you, the voice of Elohim is still speaking and discerning the thoughts and intents that is in this heart. And he is here vindicating his presence time and time again. It's because he's dealing with you. He's not dealing with you according to your own church name. He's dealing with you according to the promise. And he says, "You're my bride. &gt;&gt; You don't come pride because all of a sudden you're being good enough. You're bride because of grace. &gt;&gt; You're what you are by the grace of God. And no human efforts will ever do it. No goodness will ever produce it. &gt;&gt; But God has sent a message to deal with you, Sarah. God has sent a message to change your thinking. To change how you view your situation. God came and vindicated omnipotence. Elohim mechaned is here because he wants you to see you're a grace woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God will not replace you. God don't have spare bride. &gt;&gt; God don't have spare parts. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have spare young people. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a spare mother or a spare. Are you understanding? You're it. &gt;&gt; So God has sent a he sent a five-fold ministry to take this message and keep preaching it and preach it and preach it and wave the promise and say, "You're it. You're a virtuous pride. You're justified as if you never sinned in the first place. &gt;&gt; You're it. &gt;&gt; No one's going to take your place in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Esther was just an orphan girl. Positionally placed. Positionally placed for such a time as this that she could intercede upon the for her people. Satan has tried to hire breed this bride. He's tried to denominate this bride. &gt;&gt; He's tried to confuse this bride. &gt;&gt; He's tried to box this bride in. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. The power of God will raise this bride out of everything. &gt;&gt; He's going to raise her out of confusion. He's going to raise her out of denominationalism. He's going to raise her out of every box a preacher tries to put this bride in. is because the power of God will lift her up, raise her up, and he's going to put her in glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is not an ecumenical move. &gt;&gt; This is a Holy Ghost move. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not an Ahab tied to a Jezebel system. &gt;&gt; This is not a good man getting t getting getting crossed up in some ecumenical move. &gt;&gt; I tell you, God still got Micaas. He's still got men who have heard Elijah's message and just because lying spirits, enticing spirits have gotten into a false ministry and are trying to get the people also bowed down uh amen with some kind of false religion. But I tell you friends, uh I don't care how true it is. Uh I don't care how much message it is. Uh God will not identify with that Jezebel system. &gt;&gt; There's no life in it. There's no power in it. I don't how I don't care how close it looks. I don't care how much they shout, how much they dance, how much they whatever. There is a ma. There is a believer that is not a part of that ecumenical move, but saying I'm a part of a holy ghost move. I'm a part of a vindicated message. And it's separating me from all gross darkness that I can walk in the light. I tell you friends, &gt;&gt; well, how are we going to get these people to how are we going to get Ahab, &gt;&gt; lying spirits coming into the presence of God? How are we going to get Ahab to believe to do what Elijah said that she's going to he's going to do? I'll tell you, I don't I don't care how much Ahab said, "That's our land." &gt;&gt; And he was scripturally correct. The prophet of God said Ahab was scripturally right. &gt;&gt; But that didn't change anything. &gt;&gt; God would not bless that Jezebel system. &gt;&gt; And I don't care how many ecumenical councils &gt;&gt; try to get us away from Elijah's message. &gt;&gt; I declare there's a grace upon this bride that she will die out to every other voice. She will not surrender her life to any other voice but the vindicated message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let me tell you friends, Micaas represents you, the believer. &gt;&gt; And believers are standing with this message and they're saying this is where the move of God is. &gt;&gt; This is where the power of God is for my family. This is where victory takes place in my life. Nothing else will work. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to uh you forgive me for slowing down here and there, but &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to show you grace for a moment. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "You say me &gt;&gt; are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmmerited grace." A wedding base of a wedding band of grace unmmerited of your own. God did it himself. &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you there. Put your name on the book. [Music] &gt;&gt; Your very identity is grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace. &gt;&gt; You were chosen before the foundation of the world by grace. &gt;&gt; Your whole makeup is grace. The Bible says, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly. &gt;&gt; For our sakes, the wrath of God was poured out upon him. He Jesus who knew no sin became sin for us." &gt;&gt; The Bible says he bore our shame. He bore our humiliation. And he did it for you and I. The prophet of God says he paid the debt of your high breeding. There it is. What is it that you can die to yourself until you're no more yourself and be filled with his word believing his word and then the holy spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow. &gt;&gt; The prophet again says Jesus the word took my place. He become me that a sinner that I might become him. the word. Let me hold true to it, not the church. &gt;&gt; See, she's called the elect lady, &gt;&gt; which the prophet says elect comes from the word elected lady. One lady amongst all the other ladies was elected. He says just like the virgin Mary was to bring forth the body of God on the earth, she was an elected woman. God chose Mary. Also God has chose an elected lady which is his bride. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say in 62 that five stars have aligned. He says it is showing God's grace that the power of God has beun to fall on an infant bride upon the earth. God's power has be to fall upon an infant bride upon the earth. But you see, it's God declaring grace. It's five stars that have aligned showing its grace. The power of God has begun to fall upon this church. It's grace. And it's the power of God that has been ripening this bride. Amen. And bringing us to a position of power and authority is still grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; God stepping in to bride form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word becoming the word grace. You see that spiritual union of Christ and his church. Now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested, vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day. It's happening day by day. You see, the prophet would say there's been churches, churches. If I could just get the monitors here. Uh there's been churches, churches. Oh, but there's a real bride that is coming on the scene. Amen. There's a bride that's got not only mechanics, but dynamics as well. There's been churches, but there's coming one that makes that church live and move in the power of his resurrection. You see, this bride is under a grace covenant. Amen. Christ is God's covenant. &gt;&gt; It's not if you will, but I already have. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see there in Revelation the 5th chapter, amen, that John wept because no man was worthy. Moses was not worthy to open the book. Amen. No man, uh, Amen was worthy throughout the ages. But then we find that there came a message. There came a good news uh amen weep not for the line of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed uh to open the seals uh we find there in revelations 10:1 that a mighty angel is descending putting one foot on land one foot on sea open book in his hand and the prophet said only Christ it can be &gt;&gt; showing that God's covenant is now being coming down in the ministry of the son of man. And that covenant is coming back into full strength. &gt;&gt; The covenant, not if you will, I will, but a covenant coming back into full power and manifestation. Calvary, not something that is just a day gone by, but Calvary coming back into full effect. &gt;&gt; The blood of Christ coming back in full power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's doing everything in his power to kill the effects of this message &gt;&gt; to make the blood ineffective. &gt;&gt; To make the word just a cold, powerless, ineffective gospel. &gt;&gt; That's why we're still in the calling out time. &gt;&gt; We're the pulling out time. Come out of her. &gt;&gt; Come out of the confusion. Come out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Come out of condemnation. &gt;&gt; Get away from those skeptic spirits. &gt;&gt; Get away from those cold, lukewarm, dead, formal, religious spirits. &gt;&gt; Cut loose from the bows that are trying to hold you earthbound. &gt;&gt; The reason that this message cannot have an effect in some of us lives is because we've got too many bolts. the pull's here, the magnet. And we have and we've got what it takes to be magnetized. But we've got too many earthbound bolts. I tell you what we need in this Holy Ghost move is the word to discern our hearts. And for us to be honest enough to say, he's talking to me. I need to die out to some things. I need to get rid of some habits. I need to get rid of some earthbound things that is holding me bound in my mind. It's time to go up. It's time to step into position. It's time to believe in the grace that God has given this bride in the end time. The covenant &gt;&gt; is in full effect. &gt;&gt; We don't lack for anything, friends, &gt;&gt; magnetized &gt;&gt; to the headstone. The greatest draw that this world has ever received is the draw of the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says the moment that the that the gospel starts stops drawing, I'll stop preaching. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to say the word of God is still in full effect. &gt;&gt; The word of God still heals. &gt;&gt; It still delivers. It still sets the captives free. It still breaks generational curses, things that you that you can trace all the way back to generations upon generations. Your great great great grandfather and the devil's telling you you can't be free from that. I just want to say the gospel is in full effect. &gt;&gt; We heard last night that we're in a warfare. And I tell you, this is the greatest battle that was ever fought. And it's the opening of this word putting the gospel in full effect. Is where the battle begin to commence. Amen. Not in the man age. Uh not when just the Holy Ghost uh was moving in the church. Uh but it's when the person of the Holy Ghost is taking bride form. That's when the battle that's when the battle rages because now the sword is in your hand. The sword is in your mouth. And now you have been commissioned to do something with it. In my name you shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. Why are we crying? Why are we belly aching? We've got the message of grace. The covenant is in full effect. Calvary is in full effect. The Holy Ghost is got a blood flowing through our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's still the greatest draw. There's a real devil &gt;&gt; and we got to recognize him real. But as you're recognizing that he's real and don't start glorifying him, &gt;&gt; don't start praising the devil. &gt;&gt; Well, he's so big. He's so mighty. I just don't know how I'm going to get over I'm going to overcome. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says to overcome, you got to recognize him that he's real. &gt;&gt; That's the first step. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then just a couple of sentence sentences later, the prophet of God said, "But then you got to re you got to recognize &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ has already defeated the devil." &gt;&gt; So the trials that you're going through, they're real. &gt;&gt; The situations that look impossible, they're real. the devil that's hounding your mind and bringing up your past mistakes and your failures and trying to condemn you and trying to take faith out of your life. It's a real battle. &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is you got to start confessing that Jesus Christ has already defeated that devil. &gt;&gt; He's already whooped pornography. &gt;&gt; He's already whooped those complexes. He's already destroyed the yolks of sin off of every single one of our lives. And Calvary is in full effect today. What does this message mean to you and I? Calvary is in full effect. &gt;&gt; Then you've got to say, greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Greater is he &gt;&gt; is he &gt;&gt; that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God, he's going to he's going to he's going to give us something real real special in discernment. he that is in you. He's going to tell you how that he spoke a blizzard out of existence. &gt;&gt; But then he comes to the very last of that service and he's preaching, "Greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world." And then he begins to talk about Peter after the day of Pentecost and Peter and John is walking to the gate beautiful and they see that that there's a lame man there and he's been there for years and years. But Peter, he's over there begging for alms. And Peter says, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee." Now, Brother Brandham says, "What did Peter have that was better than silver and gold?" &gt;&gt; What he had was faith. &gt;&gt; So, he released faith to that beggar that he could be healed. Now I I I just want to say amen that he reached out and he grabbed him by the hand because the beggar wasn't moving and he pulled him to his feet and instantly his ankle bones receive strength. Now the prophet of God would say now such as I have &gt;&gt; give I thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says and what I have I give you faith for the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet in spiritual food and due season, he would say, "I want you to get built up in the faith of this hour &gt;&gt; because it's going to take more faith at every in every age. It's going to take rapturing faith." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I I want you to notice what the prophet of God is releasing something &gt;&gt; that all throughout the denominational ages. They had beat that faith out of the church. &gt;&gt; They had explained miracles out of the church. They explained the supernatural out of the church. They they had they they had explained God made flesh. They had turned the oneness Jesus' name into into the trinitarian and all of these things. But the prophet of God, he began to deal with that church and say, "You can't have faith for a headache hardly. How are we going to have faith for a rapture?" &gt;&gt; It's because of those denominational spirits. &gt;&gt; But when the word became flesh, &gt;&gt; it began to rebuke those spirits. &gt;&gt; Say, "You preachers have been you you've got those you've got the people living a million miles below their privileges." But he stood in the gap &gt;&gt; and he stood there as an intercessor and he said, "I'm giving you faith for the hour. Believe for all things." God's still a miracle worker. God still changes situations. God still raises the dead. God still saves sons and daughters that are bound in drugs, bound in alcohol, bound in homosexual spirits. The faith of the hour believes in the grace of the hour and says, "God, you promised &gt;&gt; and Calvar's flow comes flowing through the moving of the Holy Ghost, moving upon the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Manifest the promise in our lives." &gt;&gt; You want to see the Holy Ghost move in action, believe the word. The prophet of God says every time your pastor preaches the word, it is a conductor for the power of the Holy Ghost to begin to flow. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is moving upon that word and it's releasing faith in your heart. You come in a bad mood, you come in and with a doubting spirit upon your life, but you begin to entertain that word and you are entertaining omnipotence. And when you begin to say, I believe that word is for me. It's the Holy Ghost begin to brood over your life and saying, "It's for you. is for your house. Uh it's for your body change. Uh it's for your job. Uh it's for every situation. I tell you, believe in the grace of God. So beyond our thinking, so beyond our senses, so beyond human intelligence, and yet it's grace that said, I've already put the wedding band upon your finger before the foundation of the world. And if we believe in it, it releases the power of almighty God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The It's a real devil. &gt;&gt; But I got some good news. &gt;&gt; The lamb prevailed. &gt;&gt; He turned and he saw a lamb &gt;&gt; as if it had been a battle. While we were yet sinners, &gt;&gt; while the devil was beating us up, saying, "You're not going to make the rapture." &gt;&gt; But there was the lamb of God &gt;&gt; doing battle against that spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very spirit that is telling you you can't be healed. &gt;&gt; That lame become bloody because he was doing battle with that spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That devil is telling you young people that you can't live this message &gt;&gt; and trying to tell you you're too weak. You've got too many faults and mistakes. I just I got some good news for you. &gt;&gt; My lamb &gt;&gt; did battle against that spirit. &gt;&gt; That's why he was bloody. weary spirits that are trying to grip you mamas and telling you you don't have what it takes to be the fifth gospel and to apply the token over your children and cast out spirits when they're trying to come against your babies. Amen. That I say my God did battle against that spirit. &gt;&gt; And I say greater is this lamb. Greater is this this conquering power that is dwelling in this bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No foul spirit &gt;&gt; trying to beat you up and trying to hold you captive and telling you you don't have what it takes. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the devil's already been stripped of his power. &gt;&gt; He's defeated. &gt;&gt; We are dealing with a defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; Everything's defeated. Can you say that with me? Everything's defeated. &gt;&gt; Sickness, &gt;&gt; death, &gt;&gt; hell, &gt;&gt; temptations, &gt;&gt; struggles of unbelief, &gt;&gt; struggles of fear, &gt;&gt; spirits that are trying to tell you you're not going to make the rapture. You're going in the tribulation. Every spirit is defeated and it's under your feet. &gt;&gt; The lamb prevailed to take the book. And the lamb stepped. The lamb came with pillars of fire &gt;&gt; and he put one foot on that Hollywood spirit and he put another foot upon that political spirit of Rome. Every spirit of hell is under the feet of this bride because he is the head of the body and in the day of his power there will be a bride that's willing. There will be a bride that's willing. to put one foot, another foot, another foot, another foot. You're doing battle because you've got the abstract title deed and you're putting every spirit under under your feet and saying, "Satan, you have no control of my life any longer. &gt;&gt; Lust, you can't hold me. &gt;&gt; Pride, you can't hold me. Tribulation, you can't hold me. We are dealing with a conquered enemy. [Music] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how do I possess it?" &gt;&gt; Well, you're a promised land people. &gt;&gt; You just walk &gt;&gt; into it &gt;&gt; as an inheritance. &gt;&gt; I don't have any money which Wish I did for somebody. I got a I got a million dollars here for you. And I say this is your inheritance. I'm leaving it to you. It's a sweaty handkerchief. I knew exactly what you guys were thinking. Here, I'll give you something better. Oh, well, praise the Lord. Uncle Matt, &gt;&gt; you do the example. &gt;&gt; I'll come to you. &gt;&gt; I've got something that's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Come on, baby. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to beg for it, do you? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I say it's yours. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it? &gt;&gt; Come and get it. &gt;&gt; Come and get it. &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You just walk into it. You just walk into it. Thank Uncle Matt. &gt;&gt; You got more. &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's why Caleb reminded Joshua, &gt;&gt; you remember what the prophet said about me in my land. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that mountain, that's Hebin, that's where resurrection power is at. &gt;&gt; That's where overcoming grace is at. &gt;&gt; And Caleb says, "You remember what the prophet said about me in that mountain?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I've I've got the strength to go and to possess it, and I've got the strength to come back." &gt;&gt; You know what he did? He stepped into it as an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Now, there were some giants on that land. Come on. &gt;&gt; But Caleb wasn't je he wasn't worried. He wasn't fearful because he was walking by promise. &gt;&gt; He knew that there was some there was a promise over his life that he couldn't die. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me. I don't know. I I it was Let me just say it like this. I believe it was the Holy Ghost that brought an inspiration in his heart that there is no way that you can die until you possess that p that mountain. Something was in his heart that lined him perfectly up and perfectly in tune and he knew that that was his mountain. He had the strength and he knew he was going to conquer every giant, &gt;&gt; every spirit that was laughing and scorning and saying he didn't have enough to possess that mountain. &gt;&gt; But by the promise, inspiration was dealing with his heart. All he had to do was light himself up &gt;&gt; and fire it off. I tell you, the prophet of God says that he is already conquered for us. &gt;&gt; We're dealing with a defeated enemy. He has already conquered for us. &gt;&gt; But he didn't stop there. He says, "But his presence has come down to vindicate sir &gt;&gt; that he's conquered." &gt;&gt; Are are you understanding what I'm saying? The vindication of omnipotence is a declaration that he has conquered. &gt;&gt; We're not looking at 2,000 years ago and saying, "I wish and I hope and I it's too good to be true." But he's here &gt;&gt; and he's vindicated time and time, thousands upon thousands upon thousands. the greatest move of the Holy Ghost in the history of the world to vindicate his presence that he's conquered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? That you can believe in his grace. &gt;&gt; It's a grace covenant. &gt;&gt; It's already settled. &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ was was here behind this desk, he could do no more for you this evening than what I could do. Wayne Lawson, Andrew, Dave, Brother Matt, &gt;&gt; it's done. &gt;&gt; I know it's simple, but the devil's doing everything in his power to make that ineffective. &gt;&gt; But all you have to do is step into it by inheritance and say, "By his stripes, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; By the token, I claim my rights. I claim my children. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would go on a little bit further and says, "Now, now the devil's doomed." He said, "The devils, we got we got doomed devils on the run." &gt;&gt; And then he would tell us, he said, "Now the pro the problem with that last revival that we had, he says, "Now, are are y'all hearing me?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We had the devil on the run, &gt;&gt; but we let up. Come on now. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God took the open book and actually beat the devil so so in humiliation that he began to run. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he'll flee from you. We heard that last night. &gt;&gt; But the devil but brother Bradom says now the problem of that is is we we stop chasing the devil. Well, I I just want to say something. I'm so fed up with the devil. I'm so fed up of his lies. &gt;&gt; I'm so fed up with him trying to beat up the children of God, &gt;&gt; bring up their mistakes and complexes and fears. I something's just burning up in my soul. &gt;&gt; I just want to make a vow to God. I I I I think I can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with these men of God and say in this revival, this Holy Ghost move, I will not knock down for the devil. In this Holy Ghost move, we This message has got the devil on the run again. And I declare unto you, I stand shouldertosh shoulder with this vindicated message. And I've got my sword drawn. And I'm going to chase this devil. I'm going to put him in the tribulation. I'm going to I'm going to chop him to bits. I declare he cannot hold the children of God captive. I declare that he's already conquered. Hell is conquered. Death is conquered. Fear is conquered. Every tormenting spirit of hell is conquered. I stand in the breach and declare you're free in this Holy Ghost move. You are free from every voice of man. You're free from every doctrine of man. You're free from every ecumenical move of man. We are free to walk in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Every promise of God is true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God would tell us that he'll weep with those who weep. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you want to weep, he'll weep with you. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we feel like weeping, don't we? Sometimes we go through hard times and struggles and we don't know what it's about. &gt;&gt; We get a poor as me spirit on us. And do you realize even that thing's conquered? &gt;&gt; But I tell you, the prophet of God gave us a secret. He says he'll weep with those who weep, but he'll be in victory &gt;&gt; with those who are victory. And then the prophet of God stopped and he says, "Now, let's keep him in victory." &gt;&gt; I know sometimes it makes us feel good to give our our our our wife a soba story and oh, I'm talking to our humanity. I know. I know I am. &gt;&gt; And our wife starts giving the husbands a sob story and before you know it, you got a spirit of doom and gloom all in the house. Now, now if that's the way you want our conqueror, &gt;&gt; but the prophet of God says we can keep him in victory. &gt;&gt; I think we should all take a vow and say there is something so supernatural moving. This is a 20 in 2025. This is a supernatural season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything that has been laying in that message that has been ripening our life and ripening our faith. I just want to declare there is a mature bride upon this earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a bride that is so perfectly in tune with this Holy Ghost and this word. It is positionally placing her in that inheritance and she is looking at that and says, "Why would I just sit here and die? Why would I sit here in my own self-pity &gt;&gt; when I can walk into my inheritance? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tow the line with the devil &gt;&gt; and I can whack that thing and whack it. And if it don't move, I whack it again. &gt;&gt; And if it don't move, I whack it again. And I'm going to whack it. And I'm going to speak and I'm going to speak. And I'm going to speak. And I know that mountain is moving. I know that there is such a move of the Holy Ghost that he's moving obstacles out of my life. He's changing family situations. He's restoring marriages. He's restoring family structures. It is the power of omnipotence in 2025 that is bringing a message of adoption into the church of the living God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pastor is not here to fight your battles. &gt;&gt; The pastor is here to wave this promise over your life. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is moving on that conductor right into your heart. And something's saying yes to the word. &gt;&gt; I know things look impossible, but something's saying yes to the word. &gt;&gt; Well, there's a yes and someone else says yes. And some brother brother says it's a power. It's a power of agreement with the word. And all of the sudden, you've got the power of omnipotence moving among the bride. All because there is a union in agreement &gt;&gt; with the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm trying to close. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it to this point right here because as much as your faith will be released, that's how much power you can have. &gt;&gt; You see, it's God and Morphe. It was God and Morphe and the prophets. It was God and Morphe in his word. It's God and morphe in every. &gt;&gt; But you see the prophet of God says that it was when the word comes to those prophets, they were called gods. &gt;&gt; The prophet says says the same thing is today. It's God manifested in flesh. The message of the hour, the light of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately the prophet of God says that's the greatest indep. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is ye are God's. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The message, the light is this word made flesh &gt;&gt; in bright form &gt;&gt; is the light of the day. And to point to anything back there is the greatest indebtment there is &gt;&gt; because you'll wreck up somewhere because you're looking at a false glare. Come on. &gt;&gt; To let your complexes rob you of who you are as a son and daughter of God is an indep. &gt;&gt; To allow a preacher &gt;&gt; to not get caught up with the message of the hour and and declare it's God in flesh. &gt;&gt; It's God and boys, God and girls. It's the moving of the Holy Ghost making the word live in human flesh in this last days. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest indebtman. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God would say that they're trying to limit the church by looking at a at a false glare. &gt;&gt; You see, they put traditional barriers over the church. traditional barriers that well Jesus is the same way back there but he's not the same today. It's a traditional barrier &gt;&gt; and it's limiting the faith &gt;&gt; of the son of God in the church. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God says now if you can just break past that traditional barrier &gt;&gt; if you can just break free of your own sound barrier. Now, we heard it last night because brother Andrew said what it is, it's reasoning. &gt;&gt; And your own human intellects begins to reason with the word and trying to put limits on your faith. &gt;&gt; And trying to trying to tell you that you, oh, you can only believe for that and you can only believe for that so far. And but you've got to break past your own humanity. &gt;&gt; You've got to look in the mirror of this word and come to an identification and say, "I am Mrs. Grace. There is something moving in my life that is it it's it's it's it's so beyond my my my humanity. It's so beyond my own human thinking. All I can say is there's an inspiration that is bringing me in tune with this word. I believe it's for me. &gt;&gt; It it's something that is causing me to rise up and say I am everything this word says that I am. &gt;&gt; And you begin to speak the word those blast words over your life. Thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I read something in the message of grace and if you haven't if you haven't went through that message start from the beginning and go go through it. The prophet of God gives some different different experiences and I'm not going to go through it but he says that he brought he says that just a year before he spoke those squirrels into existence. He said, ' And something just drew him to that same tree as he was hunting. He was hunting. He said, 'I went over there to that tree and I'm just thinking, you know, this is where, he said, this is where it happened a year ago. He said, all of a sudden, God just began to speak to his heart. And he said, now what do you need now? Now, I want to take you back to when the first time it happened. Now, the prophet of God was wondering, who am I talking to? what is this all what's taking place? And and and and remember he said there's going to be a squirrel there here and it's going to go over there and and then he got excited and he even shot before it went over there and he missed it. But now the prophet of God is so sure of who's doing the talking &gt;&gt; that he says I'm going to get a mess of squirrels. He says, "I I I spoke." I said, "You know," he says, "there was there there there was uh mosquitoes everywhere." He said, "I not one of those are going to bother me again." And he and he said it was raining. He says, "The sun's going to shine in 30 minutes." All those things happened. He said, "Behind me, I heard something and I turned around." When I did, he says, "About 70 yards away, there was a red squirrel." Brother Brandham is so sure of what has taken place. &gt;&gt; He said, "I just turned around." He said, "I put my gun up." He says, "And that high-powered scope." He said, "I could even barely even see the squirrel." He said, "But all I did is I just put it in the vicinity. I just pointed the vicinity and I just put it up above the squirrel and I pulled the trigger." He said, "And when I pulled the trigger," he said, "the bullet went right to the eye. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know how that prophet &gt;&gt; reasoned everything out and knew that he was just going to simply point it in that direction and pull the trigger and he wasn't going to miss it. But he was so confident. &gt;&gt; There was an inspiration that was upon his life &gt;&gt; that he knew that that was his squirrel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And all he had to do is just point it in the direction. just lift it up and pull the trigger and he hit it in the eye. &gt;&gt; All of the sudden, you know what? My mind went to another time in the Bible that David had come among his brethren. &gt;&gt; His brethren were all cowarded down. &gt;&gt; And David said, "Why are you guys cowered down for?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, there is a there is a a giant over there &gt;&gt; and he's challenging Saul's army. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And about that time did a Goliath stood up and he said, "I challenge the armies of Saul. &gt;&gt; I challenge the armies of Israel." And David heard that and said, "Who's the armies of Saul?" &gt;&gt; He said, "We're not the armies of Saul. We're the armies of the living God." &gt;&gt; You see, David David had a pulsation within his soul because he knew that he was anointed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew that he was a part of a Holy Ghost move. &gt;&gt; And David is looking at these at his brethren all cowered down and he hears the challenge of Goliath and something bubbles up in his soul and says, "I'll meet that challenge." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says David was so uh so anointed of the Holy Ghost that David started dancing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David started dancing all the way to the brook. &gt;&gt; He got five stones and he's dancing. &gt;&gt; It's because the prophet said by faith, David knew that he was dealing with a defeated enemy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; David knew there was no uncircumcised Philistine that could stand before a son of God. So David by faith already looked ahead and he saw that giant falling at his feet. He already saw himself drawing the sword. He saw himself cutting his head off. &gt;&gt; So he's dancing and the Holy Ghost moving. Everyone else has cowed down and peeking and said, "Oh my, this is not going to end good." And what is that holy roller doing? He's a fanatic. &gt;&gt; He's embarrassing us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David dances all the way to the very t the very just just just uh ju in the presence of Goliath there and he hears Goliath make those boast &gt;&gt; and something in David says you're going to be like one of those sheep or one of those lions. You're going to be like that lion and that bear. &gt;&gt; He spoke it. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says he wasn't crying. David didn't need an all night prayer meeting &gt;&gt; to get anointed &gt;&gt; because God had him prayed up before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, we're in a different season. &gt;&gt; We're under a different atmosphere. We're in the presence of the capstone coming down upon the bride. This is the power of omnipotence. [Applause] This is the day that the people are willing to be some David's. &gt;&gt; David just put that just still dancing away. &gt;&gt; Put that stone in there. There was only one little spot on his forehead. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have to aim. &gt;&gt; He just got that. He He was inspired. &gt;&gt; He knew he couldn't lose. &gt;&gt; He knew he couldn't go. Are Are you with me? I'm going to I'm going to deal with it. He knew he couldn't go in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how his children are going to be saved. But he knew he just had to speak the word. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how he was going to be delivered from cancer. He didn't know he didn't know how he was going to be delivered from pornography. He didn't know how his marriage was going to be healed. All he had to do is speak the word. He didn't have to add it up. He didn't have to make all the quotes fit. He didn't have to get with this pastor and this preacher and make it get an ecumenical council together and make sure that he's in the will of God. All he knew is his faith was lining up with the vindication of omnipotence. And all the sudden the dynamics got to the mechanics &gt;&gt; and begin to supersonic speed a million miles an hour and got a hold of that rock and hit the only spot that he can get the kill zone. Oh, I can hear a prophet saying, "God is raising up another generation for the last great kill. There's a kill zone." And the Holy Ghost knows where the kill zone is. You don't have to do it. It's not by might. It's not by power. It's by my spirit, saith the Lord. Speak. Speak the word. Why cry? Confess the promise. Get that rock in your mouth and confess that promise and see the Holy Ghost get a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Break that traditional barrier. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. &gt;&gt; This is the way I've always done it. Break that traditional barrier. &gt;&gt; Well, this is the way so and so preaches the message. Come on. &gt;&gt; I may have great respect for brother so and so, but this ain't his message. &gt;&gt; This ain't brother so and so time. This is bride time. &gt;&gt; This is bride age. &gt;&gt; This is eagle age. &gt;&gt; This is flying eagle age. &gt;&gt; This is word age. Astronaut age. Rapture age. Are you getting it? Speak the word. It's your time. [Applause] Quit backing up for the devil. Pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Get the gun off of the shelf and pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not trained. &gt;&gt; Who said you had to be? &gt;&gt; Pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You may not know the ABCs of the message hardly. Pull the trigger. Anyways, &gt;&gt; God's not looking for scholars. He's looking for someone that'll believe in his grace. &gt;&gt; Someone that can put the word in action. &gt;&gt; If it be a 5-year-old, an 8year-old, 10year-old, or an 80y old, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; There's a generation upon the earth right now that takes God at his word and isn't ashamed to pull the trigger. I'm not ashamed of the power of God. &gt;&gt; For it's my deliverance. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. &gt;&gt; It's the message of grace. &gt;&gt; Well, what if I miss? You can't miss. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; You can't miss. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But just in case you're having a hard time with what I'm trying to tell you, the prophet of God was a very nervous man. And he was he was nervous about getting this message wrong. &gt;&gt; He wanted to make sure that he was hitting right what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; So God put him in an experience where he hit he he he shot his he shot his rifle and he hit the same hole nine times. Nine times. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then his gun got all out of whack. He missed the target. He couldn't. We all know the story. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says now that God spoke to him said, "The way I made you is thus because you want to be right on every time." &gt;&gt; You know that if Paul hit the mark &gt;&gt; and you're preaching what Paul preached, you'll hit the mark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're just preaching what Peter preached, you'll hit the mark. Well, I I just want to let you know, stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Stay with the message. &gt;&gt; And you can't miss. &gt;&gt; But while you've got it all lined up, &gt;&gt; the message has already got it all lined up &gt;&gt; and you're still sitting there wondering if it's for you, &gt;&gt; and the devil's beating you up. &gt;&gt; And the devil's got a complex. and the devil's trying to get you to be one of David's brethren hiding behind the rocks. I just want to let you know if there's an inspiration that ever strikes your heart that if you'll just take this this word &gt;&gt; and just &gt;&gt; it'll hit it. &gt;&gt; And it not ain't going it ain't going to just hit the squirrel. &gt;&gt; It's going to hit in the eye. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to hit it exactly where it needs to hit. &gt;&gt; Young people, shoot the gun. &gt;&gt; Elders, shoot the gun. We've been worried for too long. We've been fearful for too long. We've been letting it up, leaving it get up to the minister for too long. Pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Get fed up with that devil. Get fed up with his lies. Get fed up with those tormenting spirits. [Music] &gt;&gt; It'll hit it. &gt;&gt; It'll destroy the yolks of the devil off your life. It'll defeat that spirit that's trying to destroy your home. Shoot the gun. &gt;&gt; Shoot the gun. We're got the sons and daughters of God. Why hold back? We have his mind. We have supreme authority. We know what he wants done with the word. Shoot it. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Dance yourself into the battle. &gt;&gt; David wasn't picking up stones wandering. Well, I don't know. Am I doing right? &gt;&gt; He had already seen it. &gt;&gt; He'd already seen that devil fall. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, I've already seen this devil fall. Sir, &gt;&gt; the devil don't have enough. &gt;&gt; I I I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what David did. Let me Let me just put it in our language that I like. When the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone and hit him right in the eye, &gt;&gt; right? Right between the eyes and went over there and he got his own sword. Jubilation just flowing through his soul. &gt;&gt; Got that sword. Now, let me just say it Jonathan Martin style. If I was there, &gt;&gt; I would have looked at that giant and I would have said, "How do you like me now? &gt;&gt; You boast against me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You tried to discourage me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You tried to tell me I didn't have enough. How do you like me now, devil? &gt;&gt; Get a hold of his head. How do you like me now, devil? You don't have enough. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't have enough. He doesn't have enough. God's already predestinated you to victory. It's shadow. He's already called you, already predestinated you, already glorified you positionally. [Applause] It's time to flex your muscles. &gt;&gt; It's time to put your faith into action. &gt;&gt; It's time to speak to that tormented spirit that's been tormenting you. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you don't have enough." &gt;&gt; Why don't you just look back in your life when the devil tried to tell you that he was going to destroy your life? &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Go ahead. Let's go. Let's go through memories lane. &gt;&gt; Last year when the devil said, "I've got you." And you're here, aren't you? &gt;&gt; Don't you remember? &gt;&gt; The last tent meeting, &gt;&gt; he told you that you wouldn't make it this to this one. &gt;&gt; Don't you remember? Don't you remember, Bethany? &gt;&gt; But he didn't have enough, did he? &gt;&gt; How do you like me now, devil? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That girl's been dancing all over the devil's head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you like me now? &gt;&gt; Oh, greater is he that is in me. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me. Oh, greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Sing it again. Greater is he. Oh, greater is he. Yeah, greater is he. [Music] Well, Satan's like a roaring line roaming to and fro. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. You might as well praise him. Well, give him a wave offering. Well, creator is he. Well, greater is he. Oh, creator is greater. On the day of Pentecost, on the day of Pentecost, rushing mighty way flew into the upper room and baptized all of them. Oh, with the power ger [Music] we fall. I'm so glad I got it for you. Going to let the whole world know. Yeah. Yeah. Greater, gater, gater, gater. Oh, gater. [Music] Let's sing it again. Oh, gater is he. Oh, mercy. Greater is he that is in me the world. [Music] Praise [Music] that is in me that he that is in the world will I say on the day of Pentecost came rushing will it blew into the upper and baptize all of it. And with the power gater than any earthly fill, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I want to let How many Let the world know tonight that I say, "Greater is he that is in me." Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. When I say greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. What will I say? On the day of Pentecost came a rushing mighty way into the upper room and baptized all of the and with a power that's greater than any earth before. Well, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the devil know that greater is he that is in me. Greater is he. I said my God is gater, greater. Oh, gater is he than he that is in the world. And I say, "Greater is he that is in me." Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. One more time. Well, greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? Amen. How many's got something greater in you than that which you're facing? Now, what a powerful message. The devil said, "You're a disgrace." I'm not a disgrace, but he said, "I'm Mrs. grace." &gt;&gt; We're not a disgrace. I'm Mrs. Grace. I've been called by Jesus Christ. I was called of God before the foundation of the world to overcome in this hour. Brother Johnson said, "You take your faith and arm it in your sling, turn in the general direction of the devil and just let it go." You know why? Because faith is the victory and it always finds its mark. No wonder God gave us faith. I believe that God gave us something that'll overcome every devil. It don't matter what you have what you're facing tonight. You may I don't know how you felt whenever you came in, but go ahead and just lift your hand and put the devil in it. I mean, take their sling and put it over their hand. say, "I'm just going to put the devil in his place. He told you he was going to quit. He told you to give up. He told you you couldn't make it. But I say, devil, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. You ain't going to stop me. You're not going to turn me around. You're not going to cause me to retreat. I've got one direction. I've been called of God, and I'm heaven bound." Amen. I've been called of God to move into another dimension. Can we sing that? Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might fall too. [Music] You might also accuse me, scandalize my name. Going on with Jesus just the same. Well, the devil ways a straight way. It has no crooks and bins. I got to go on with Jesus. I know he's my best friend. Well, Satan try to stop me. Push down the blocks in my way. But I rise up from my bend and knees going all the way. But I'm going on the tears just the same. I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Will you not for accuse me, scandalize my name? But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, some people they may laugh, talk about me when I shout, but there's one thing I know. I know what I'm shouting about. When Satan try to stop me, put stumbling blocks in my way. I stand up for my Lord and this is what I say. I'm going on with Jesus just the same. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might talk about me standalize my name, but I'm going on. Let me ask you tonight, are you going on? Are you going on? Are you going on with Jesus just the same? Well, you might accuse me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, there are some places that I may never go and there are some things that I may not know, but this is one thing. And one thing I am sure that Jesus is a living for he's living in my soul. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Well, you might accuse me. Standalize my name. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Are you going on? Are you going on? How many is going on? I'm going on with you. This is your opportunity tonight to put the devil in his place. It don't matter what you say about me. It don't matter what you think about me. But I'm going on with you just to see. Well, the devil weighs a straight. It has no but Jesus. I know he's my best friend. When the enemy's all around me, till the sorrow tears my eye, I fall down on my bend knees, but I rise up with a smile. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Help my heart my feet scandalize my name. But I'm going on Jesus just the same. Are you going on? Are you going on? But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Are you going on? Are you going on? I said I'm going on with Jesus just the same. How many's going on with the Lord tonight? See, brother M, where are we going? We got a destination &gt;&gt; and we're believers. We're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That was God speaking to you tonight. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz it was the message of the hour. And that's God's message. He said, "It ain't no man's message. It ain't no pastor's message. It was God's message. We don't have a message of our own. We're running with the king's message." Amen. It ain't mine. It ain't our It's the king's message. He's entrusted it to the bride of Jesus Christ. And we're going somewhere tonight. Amen. And we ain't bound for this earth. We've been stuck on this earth long enough. But we're going somewhere tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what Satan, he's been trying to hold you down. You've been fighting with it all week and battling cuz you're trying to get ready for a meeting and you couldn't get you couldn't get the the world off your mind and the worry off your mind and trouble off your mind cuz you're trying to get ready for a meeting. &gt;&gt; So, because we're living in this old Exodus time, Satan just cast on the burden. But you know what? We going to tell the devil tonight, I'm going anyway. Somebody say, "I'm going anyway." &gt;&gt; I believe that tonight. I'm going anyway.

I'm going to the meeting where I move the &gt;&gt; to the brand new home. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. &gt;&gt; When I get to the meeting, I'm going &gt;&gt; I got something I want to tell you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go. &gt;&gt; You came to my life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the heal my soul. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the You got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let the world know about it tonight.

And I'm going to shout. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. Trouble's over. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. &gt;&gt; Just wait. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting &gt;&gt; to my brand new. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting &gt;&gt; around the throne. &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all, but I come to have church. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. &gt;&gt; God done chat that message was for me. He said, "You just step out and take it." &gt;&gt; That cost me $100. I'm going to get my victory. &gt;&gt; I paid for it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get my victory. &gt;&gt; Step out and get it. Put the devil in his place. &gt;&gt; We're in a tent meeting on a Thursday night. &gt;&gt; Come to have church. &gt;&gt; The devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; Made you so sick you didn't want to be here. And &gt;&gt; dizziness and all these things going around. And &gt;&gt; man, I I don't know if I ought to go, but you came anyhow. We'll just put the devil in his place. &gt;&gt; We come to have church. I'm happy in the Lord &gt;&gt; and the devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; This is our meeting. It ain't the devil's meeting. So, sometimes you got to stop telling the devil's testimony and stop and start telling God's. &gt;&gt; That's that's my new saying to the devil. He's done showed his ignorance too much to get the believers to believe that they had to be defeated and beat down and had to be beat up in order to have church. You ain't got to be beat up. The word of God, it elevates you. It lifts you. It edifies you. It strengthens you. And it gives you victory over the devil. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be the son of God to get him into submission to the word of God. All you have to do is give him the victory of the message of the hour. And you'll watch him rise up &gt;&gt; and be victorious over his enemy. How do you like me now, devil? &gt;&gt; I want him right in my face. How you like me now? I've been nice for too long. How do you like me now, devil? &gt;&gt; You ain't never going to make nothing. How do you like me now? You ain't never going to do nothing for the Lord. How you like me now? You ain't nothing but a madeup makeup phony bunch of madeup man. But how do you like me now, devil? You couldn't do nothing for the Lord if the Lord came and gave it to you in a gift basket. But how do you like me now, devil? You don't have the ability. How do you like me now? You don't have the backing. How do you like me now? You don't have the support. How do you like me now? You don't have God on your side. How do you like me now, devil? &gt;&gt; It ain't the armies of Saul I've been fighting for anyway. It's the armies of the living God. And I'm going to say it right in front of every Philistine, every lion, giant, devil, Philistine spirit that would come under this tent. How do you like me now? I got a ride as a son of God. You got to ride as a daughter of God to stand up in the face of every enemy and say, "Devil, how do you like me now? I've got victory in the house of God." Time to put the devil in his place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to put him in his place. You want me to tell you how to put the devil in his place? I ain't even one way to put him in his place. You got to get in your place. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But said the devil's sitting there trying to poke things down your throat. He said, "Don't you believe it?" He said, "It can batter against you, but it can only get to you if you accept it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So I say, "Devil, I don't accept your lies. I'm victorious." I mean, lift your hand. Say, "I'm victorious. I ain't never going to accept it. I'm getting tired of the devil's lies anyway." Key of F. Well, I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. [Music] Well, you said I couldn't make it. You told me not to try. But I'm going to live for Jesus until the day I die. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a victory song. Well, you threw the Hebrew children in a red hot burning fire. But they came out the winner. Devil, you came out the liar. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me down for too long. I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. Well, if you're one of God's children, you're tired of being bound. Just raise your hands to heaven. Pull you a blessing down. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. Anybody feel like telling the devil something tonight? Well, now listen to me, devil. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. You walked on me long enough, so now I'm going to walk on you. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me back too long. soul. I'm going to raise my hands on heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. Well, you told me not to sing. You told me not to shout, but I'm going to take the word of God. Turn that devil out. I'm sometimes Satan. You've had me down too long. Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me. How many Davids do we have here in the building tonight? If you want God's children and you're tired of being bound, just draw your sword and put on the devil's head and dance all around. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing you a happy song. Let me just say the truth. You said I was a weak Christian. You said I had no power. But I was given a party over you by the rest who turned me out. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. Well, I've got a right to sing. I've got a right to dance. But I'm not going to wait till tomorrow. Cuz tonight, God gave me a chance. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. [Music] Well, listen to me, dear. I tell you what I'm going to do. You walked on me long enough, so I want to walk on you. And sometimes, baby, Satan, you've had me down too long. I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. Well, I wrote a little message. I wrote it just for you. And I put it where you could read it. Right on the bottom of my shoe. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You had me bound up way too long. So I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. You can call me Pentecost. Might be a little loud for you. But let me tell you what a prophet said. If you felt like I fell, you be something, too. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've held me down too long. [Music] I'm going to lift my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. A happy song. I'm going in a happy song. A happy song. A happy song. A victory song. A victory song. A picture song. Well, I wrote a little message. I wrote it just for you. And I put it right where you are, devil, on the bottom of my shoe. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound just too long. I'm going to rest my hands toward heaven. I'm going to sing me a victory song. I said, I'm going to raise my hand to heaven and I'm going to sing me a victory song. Oh, somebody clap the victory tonight. Somebody shout the victory. Somebody dance the victory for the devil in his place. I've got victory over the devil. I can tell the devil don't like that. But good. He's been beating up me for months. It's my opportunity to hit again. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew done preached it last night. He said he came here blow after blow after blow. But here's your opportunity to turn back to that same devil and hit him blow after blow after blow again, night after night. And he drive every devil out of your life. I want to send him right back to hell where he came from and tell all his little devil buddies, "Don't bother them people under that tent. You know what? Leave them. There there's a no trespassing sign out there. It said, "No devils are welcome in this place." I think we need to stamp it right on our heart. There ain't no devil welcome in this place. I got a no trespassing sign on my life. Devil, you ain't welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what the devil said? I'll tell you what I'll do. I've done everything to take you out and it didn't work. Shot every weapon at you and it didn't work. Fired every bullet at you and it never worked. But you don't even have to be a good aim to hit the devil. That's what I heard tonight. That he's been training for 6,000 years trying to destroy you, but he never could take you out in just a few days anointed under the power of the Holy Ghost. A little young believer can take a sling by faith and hit the devil right where it counts. &gt;&gt; I thought, my, he was trained and couldn't kill you. My goodness, you just took a little bit of faith. My I'll tell you what we tell the devil. He says, "You know what? I've done gave up. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll just kill you. I'll take your life and then then I'll have you. But you know what? I'm going to tell the devil tonight." Well, Satan, I died already. [Music] My life has been hidden. And he said, "I'm the resurrection." And he gave me eternal life. So I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. I said I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a victory song. Will the prophet preach the message back in 1962? He proved to every believer they had power over you. I'm so tired of you, Satan. You've had me bound too long. But I said I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. I said I'm going to raise my hand to heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy song. [Music] Amen. Amen. We have victory over the death. Amen. How many's free tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many How many's looking forward to He said we ain't got to wait. Take the devil push him out every service. &gt;&gt; A little bit more and a little bit more &gt;&gt; until you get so free in the Holy Ghost that you don't even you don't even know who you are. And you don't even you don't even know where you're at. That's where we want to get to. And when you get to that place, then the devil, he don't even know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that our desire? Let's get to where God can use you so much that the devil can't use you no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get to the place where God can use you so much that the devil can't use you no more. &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's using you. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Somebody's using you. &gt;&gt; But I want to get to where the devil ain't got no room. &gt;&gt; Said I can't use that one. He's broke. He need to come with an owner's manual. You can't get him to do anything you want him to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be like &gt;&gt; I want to be like a Teeu item, &gt;&gt; owner's manual and instruction manual on how to put together the brand new boat motor that you just bought off Teeu. You ever opened up the manual? First of all, it ain't in any good language. And then when you find the English language, it's words that none no English man ever really used. And you can't understand it. Half the pages are gone. The pictures don't line up. The bolt holes say here, they ain't even there. That's my owner's manual. When the devil tries to use me, I want it to be so mixed up. I can't do nothing with it. It It just seems like a mess. They seem like a wreck. I don't know what to do with him, but God can take a hold of you and use you. I never tried to be a somebody anyway. Y'all can call me T-Mu if you want to from now on. I never tried to be a somebody anyway, but God can use me. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. I just want to be somebody God can use. How many raise your hands say, "Brother Matt, that's my desire. I just want to be somebody God can use and let God use us for his glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can glorify his name forever and ever. One day we'll be we'll join him on the other side and we'll be singing that same song. I give you the glory. [Music] All of the glory. I give you the glory. Again and again [Music] for me my worship is only to give you the glory forever. Amen. forever. Amen. Oh, I give you the glory. All of the glory. I give you the glory. Again and again.
