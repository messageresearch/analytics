a real special time to serve the Lord amen amen we pray the Lord's blessing you and walking with you and fellowshipping with you and amen we was over in Florida for a few days and bringing greetings from the brothers there brother Jack Duff and brother Danny steeman said to be sure and greet you all we bring you greetings from those brothers and just had some wonderful meetings there in the presence of the Lord and just under great expectation For What the Lord Has for us here tonight amen in Joshua chapter 1 in verse number six the Bible here says be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them now only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my vant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper somebody say Prosper that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest now this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein on Wednesdays and Sundays or once a month or Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written there therein so as you're meditating on what is written in this book it's going to open up to you and then thou shal make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest now in the book of 2 Chronicles the 20th chapter 2 Chronicles chapter 20 I want to read one verse there and then we're going to turn to Luke 4 amen you love the Lord tonight amen second chronicles 20 and verse number 20 the Bible says and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God and so shall you be established so belief in God will establish a Believer but watch this believe His prophets and so shall you prosper so the belief in the Lord your God will establish you but believing in His prophets that he send you so shall ye Prosper one other place I want to look is in St Luke chapter 4 St Luke chapter 4 it's a very very familiar reading brother brandom uses this in this in the message he preaches this day the scripture is fulfilled in Luke chapter 4 and verse number 16 and it came to and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read so he's reading from the Scrolls that Joshua has been told to meditate therein day and night he was reading from the Scrolls now watch this and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he opened the book he found the place where it was written let's read that last part there and when he had opened the book and when let's read that together and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord tonight I've uh taken a few parts here on this thought with you all and maybe uh just one more portion that's on my heart tonight we spoke to you on the peculiarity of life the believer walks in and last time we spoke to you on footsteps means possession tonight I want to speak to you on walking in the light of prosperity and success amen walking in the light of prosperity and success I remember here in 1956 brother Ry says now when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with a man when a man will walk for God and walk with God Amen God will walk with a man but when that same individual turns his back from God then God just lets him shift for himself amen so a man that will walk with God and for God God will walk with that man and God Will Make A Way amen for that man now you all know we've been taught since little children amen that the Lord actually orders our footsteps I believe amen that the Lord orders our Footsteps in his word and as we were speaking to you last night amen this is the last time this is the fever season Amen to possess lamb there when Joshua would say in Joshua 13:1 he said now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and stricken in years amen and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed now there just a refresher that word land actually was territory and that word possessed was to be Heir amen or take possess of Amen to destroy to bring to Ru to disinherit now that might be uh confusing that The Possession would actually destroy something amen but the reason they had to destroy something is because something was inhabiting their land that did not belong there they had the full inheritance but the Giants was on that land so God told them you go in and drive out the inhabitants of the land now there remaineth yet very much land not just a little or just a portion amen but there is very much land and Joshua's whole commission amen from God was to get the people people into the land of their inheritance now in Joshua 1:3 he says it this way every place amen that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses remember said when Joshua was over there walking around after he crossed over Jordan then be to eat some of the old corn he said he had a great vision the Lord said I will be with you amen just as I was with Moses so will I be with you called him out one night and said now look Joshua my servant Moses is dead amen now rise and go over this Jordan thou and all the host of Israel and the Lord thy God will be with thee no man amen shall stand before thee all the days of your life as I was with Moses amen so will I be with you only be good courageous do not be discouraged just keep moving on I will be with you every place that you set amen The Souls of your foot is a possession for you he said Footprints means possession brother and what the church needs tonight is some more Footprints over here on this land don't hang around Jordan too long let's get out here amen and see what we got every time that he made a footprint every time he footprinted on it it was a possession he says again Brothers it's time for us to make Footprints we cannot stay amen right here in this same camp the fire amen is moving on so let's move move on from glory to glory amen and from Bible experience to Bible experience amen is't that powerful Amen brother Joe from glory to glory amen and from Bible experience to Bible experience let's unfold and open up our hearts and raise up our hands to God but let's keep saying and let's stay in the Bible don't get outside of that amen stay right there following the word of God let me say to you we are not looking back to what God has done for us amen we are looking forward to what he is going to do said that's been the problem is men has always looked back amen and they've seen what God done and they've looked forward to see what God's going to do amen and they are missing what God is doing right in front of them listen you say I'm going to have a Bible experience what can I tell you amen it's not going to be handed to you amen you're going to have to pick up a sword amen and fight for every experience that you get the prophet of God said anything that's handed to you on a platter amen you don't enjoy it certainly you can't appreciate whatat give to you and God told Moses I give you Palestine amen I've swept out all the houses hung up the curtains you all just go right up there and live there would that have been it they never would have enjoyed it he said but I'll give it to you but it's full of giants amen you'll have to fight every inch of the way amen but every place the soul of your footsteps amen that is a possession amen go and take make it sure as I was with Moses amen I will be with you listen when they receive the Revelation that my footprint Amen on a promise is my possession it removed the need for God to come down in a Corporal body and remind them what you're standing on is yours they received a revelation if I can just put my foot on it amen I've got a right to claim it because God has already given it to me let me say to you tonight listen we don't have to go back and get saved amen every service or go back and do the first works over when God Saves a man and gives him the Holy Ghost he is sealed until the day of his Redemption he is not sealed from one service to the next he is not sealed from one Camp to the next he is not sealed from one tent meeting to the next he is sealed until the day of his Redemption and every time you make a mistake there is a blood amen an atoning blood and a powerful blood to forgive you and tell you amen get back up and keep on walking you got land to possess I believe it I believe it's time to walk around unafraid I believe it's time to walk around not a fearful amen I believe it's time to walk around in the land of our inheritance how many knows in the Old Testament there was a Joshua amen and there was a Caleb do you know in this last day there is again another Joshua and Caleb brother said like this let me read this to you he said now let us stand like Jos josua and Caleb our promised land is coming inside amen even as their's dead he said now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader amen so Joshua represents a prophet amen coming to an age as a leader amen with the word he said but Caleb represents those amen that stay true with Joshua amen so there was an end time leader amen but there was an end time follower amen of the end time leader listen I don't know maybe some are ashamed of it or embarrassed of it amen but I am not ashamed Amen to say I have found my type in the scripture I know I'm not Joshua amen but I have received a revelation that I am Caleb and I have recognized my Joshua therefore I will follow my Joshua and as I follow Joshua amen oh I come on Church amen I just can't help but preach for a second Amen brother said the greatest Revelation that Joshua was God Amen as I was with Moses amen so will I be with you remember said what was that Revelation that all the mistakes amen that Moses made God never left Moses and he said brother Travis If God stayed with Moses in the face of all of his mistakes he said then I know amen he will stay with me well come on church was there one God for Moses and one God for Joshua and another God for Caleb the same God of Moses was the same God of Joshua was the same God of Caleb and if the god stayed with Moses and God stayed with Joshua he's going to stay with Caleb come on bride of Christ amen he stayed with this prophet and he's going to stay with you you say I got mistakes that don't make no difference your mistakes don't change the Revelation that as I was with Moses so will I be with you remember God Israel amen as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different see amen so did the last day church God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua and said the land is ours let's go take it Joshua you're all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power that you used to have see you used to hear from God and you used to know the will of God and act amen quickly something is wrong with you amen but Joshua was a godsent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clearcut decision from God and when the time came to move amen God placed the full leadership somebody say full leadership the full leadership into the hands of Joshua because he stayed with the word see God could trust Joshua but he could not trust the others amen so will it repeat in this end day amen the same problems and the same pressure now there was a Joshua and there was a Caleb can I tell you what Caleb's responsibility was amen Caleb's responsibility amen was to stay with Joshua screams it out keep and step with Joshua he said get the new grapes and the new Pentecostal wine Heen get drunk on it brother you won't even look to the world anymore he said oh let us go forward amen following the steps of our great leader amen and Conquer remember God told Joshua brother them footsteps means possession he said now listen amen keep your eyes on Jesus amen the Joshua the leader amen just keep moving on deeper depths and higher Heights until you possess everything that God promised you in his word amen don't you stop moving until you possess everything amen that God has promised you in his word can I say something to you not everybody can receive this it is hid to the eyes of the world it is foolish to them but those who are born and elected to eternal life amen they believe it we see the hour We're living so let's go forward amen remembering this that we have something behind us now let me preach here for a second remembering this when we go amen there is something something behind us amen there is something in us and there is something before us listen you're on a journey church amen there is something behind you there are some powerful experiences behind you there are some might victories behind you there are some Holy Ghost camp meetings behind you oh come on Amen there's some powerful healings behind you but we're not going to stop amen and start looking back and saying I wish we could go back I wish we could go back no whatever was behind us amen is now in us hallelujah whatever is behind us is now in us and he said there's something before us he said there it is something behind us amen something in us I love this and something more for us he was he is and shall come the same Jesus that was is the same Jesus tonight and the same Jesus that shall come the same yesterday amen today and forever what are you saying I'm saying amen you are Caleb you are following Joshua and you just got to keep on walking he said brother Andrew I'm coming up against some things the walls of Jericho is not moving situations are not changing amen problems are not getting better amen issues are getting more and more amen but can I admonish you tonight amen stay in step with Joshua remember said there is his word and his blood to take care of it everything he put in the the atonement is ours and we have it by faith amen so just accept it and walk forward and confess it amen and watch what takes place the word will work amen the same word that brought a vday to Joshua after the River Jordan is the same word that is here tonight you said well brother Andrew I've had disappointments brother said God let disappointments happen Amen to show Victory see amen you only see these things that seems to be buing you and upsetting you they are trials they are thanks but stand still and focus your glasses on the word of God and speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to do we come to a time say God I don't know what to do I'm up against it amen can you take Joshua's instructions Caleb he said speak the word amen Lord I believe and just start walking forward amen and God does the opening up of the sea you just keep on walking and God will do the opening listen you ain't got to figure out how when you get there brother Mark the sea is going to open you don't have to figure out how when you get there the walls are going to fall you don't have to figure out how amen that loved ones are going to raise some morning Incorruptible you don't have to figure out how amen that a cancer is going to leave a body you just got to be Caleb and take God at his word and say I'm going to walk forward underneath a bloodstained banner confession Lord I believe when I feel good I believe and when I feel bad I believe he said dear God may we not fret now after this and remember that these trials and things amen come upon us and they're only done because God loves us you want me to read the rest of this he gives it to us because he got confidence in us he believes that we have faith and love for him and that we'll be a able to overcome it my goodness let that sink in your heart tonight while you're facing the trial and you're wondering how I'm going to overcome it God has got confidence in you amen knowing you're going to overcome it listen God didn't put you in Leota hoping that you come out he put you in Leota knowing that there would be nothing in leosa that would have enough power Amen to stop you as a Caleb following Joshua listen we just walk up there and speak the word the vday will come may this be one of the greatest V days amen of our time now we're in we're instructed Amen to walk forward but can I tell you this we got to walk forward with undying faith in the word can I tell you something grace Tabernacle amen our victories come amen by the word yes sir our victories don't come by our feelings amen our victories don't come by our emotions or s ations amen our victories amen they come by the word in Hebrews 4:12 Paul says this he said the word of God is quick and it is powerful and it is sharper than any two-edged sword it pierces even to the dividing of suer Amen of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the fals and intents of the heart brother said this he said the sword is plenty Sharp yes sir I don't know about you but that makes me want to shout amen the sword is plenty sharp it's not a question of whether the sword you're handling amen can take the head off of that giant amen the sword is plenty sharp he said it goes beyond the physical it goes into the spiritual realm and picks up the thoughts of the heart and reveals them the spirit of God Amen the word of God he said now that word amen will cut in there if there's enough arm behind it to put it in listen I want to read this to you it'll find its place and'll cut every promise out and give it to you if you just got the strong enough arm behind it amen the sword pick it up in an arm of faith and grip it hold it tight and walk into the face of the enemy I don't know if I'm reading that right or not but I think I am he didn't say run from the enemy and if you trip and fall face the enemy he said turn and walk in into the face of your enemy listen how can that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God so you take the sword of the word and every promise belongs to you you pick it up in a strong hand of faith and walk forward if you need healing cut it out with the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if you need salvation every promise in the Bible is yours can I say this it's laying back in there his quotes been eating me up for weeks it's been laying back in there and Satan is trying to hide it but take the sword and push through the darkness until the light of God shines in upon your soul and you have the promise my goodness it's time to tell that devil I'm done playing hide and seek with you I'm done letting you hide the promises of God and then me try to get enough strength or enough goodness Amen to seek them I know who I am in the word of God and the life of God is none other than the pillar of fire and I pronounce to you tonight the pillar of fire is right here in this building tonight listen there is some promises in front of you there is some victories in front of you there is some revelation of the word and it's laying in front of you and the devil's trying to hide it from you but it's time to rise up Caleb and follow the instructions of Joshua and say I got a sword in my hand I got a word on my lips I got the holy ghost in my soul I know who I am and I refuse I refuse to allow you to hide amen the Revelation from my heart any longer devil yes sir the light of God is the pillar of fire so you mean to tell me Amen brother Joe the pillar of fire can come into your heart the pillar of fire can come into your heart he said look at Israel he got Palestine for a land they left the old land down there and got Palestine it was a land flowing with milk and honey yes sir they left the hot suns under the Taskmaster down in Egypt what did they get for leaving the warm sunshine down there they got to walk in the pillar of Fire's light they were leaving that hot sun down there Amen to walk in the light of God's Pillar of Fire he says what an exchange amen wouldn't you like an exchange like that amen a pillar of Fire see walk out of the light of this world the things that's of the world to walk in the light of God walk out of the light of the world to walk in the light of God I love what David said he said thou Hast delivered my soul from Death how many believes God has delivered your soul John 5:24 he that believeth on me hath passed amen from Death un life and shall not come into condemn ation so you shout about the fact that your soul has been delivered from death but why don't you shout about the rest of it will thou not deliver my feet from Fallen come on church we shout about God delivering our soul from death amen but then we're afraid to get up and walk because we're afraid we might fall and make a mistake if he was big enough to save your soul he's big enough to keep your feet from falling and I may walk before God in the light of the living I love what David says he says I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living see what a Believer is doing is they are walking before the Lord amen but they are walking in the truth of his word in Psalms 8611 David says teach me thy way oh Lord and I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name in 2 John 1:4 I Rejoice greatly that I found of the children amen Walking In Truth as he received a command from the father again third John 1:4 I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth Listen brother said for a man that comes to truth and fails to walk in the truth then he has according to the scripture he has blasphemed or rejected the holy spirit of God and is a past a day of redemption another place we were sent to preach amen I can bring the truth but if you reject it and walk away I know that the Bible says if you do that then there's no more remission of sin amen till you come and make that right again so if you see the truth amen you walk in truth when you see the truth amen you walk in truth amen I'm not preaching on marriage and divorce but I want to read this he said now tomorrow night Lord willing

prophet who says listen amen here's a prophet and you know what he says he says I am tired amen of seeing the church amen walking in the death of denomination so I'm asking God Amen to bring me the truth so you can know the truth and you can see the light and you can walk in it that's why John said if we walk in the light amen that is the light of the hour amen or the light of the age can I say

Pentecostal line you are condemned this is the season of the believer this is Caleb's time this is Caleb's life so if we're going to walk in some light amen we got to walk in the light of the hour in other words quit wasting your time in things that don't Prosper you quit wasting your time and things that ain't benefiting your family and edifying the atmosphere of your home amen if you're going to

they were a bunch of Helens and talk to denominational people like they were angels come on well we might as well preach we here amen this ain't just some little bunch of people that you're talking to this is the land of the living this is the field of the son of man this is the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ if you're going to talk to the bride like a dog amen go talk to a tree like a dog amen but don't you talk to this people like or just a bunch of somebody amen we are the Church of the firstborn we are the sons and daughters of God and listen we may have failure and we may make mistakes amen but at least we ain't shacking up with a bunch of denominational ideas amen trying to call it a move of God well we might as well preach we here there is no room in the land of the living for a bunch of Pentecostal hog wash Amen to be brought in and trying to put some message flavor to it amen either say you believe the message or say you don't amen but quit trying to mix the two together it's going home time I said it's going home time I said it's time to walk Amen in the light of the living brother said like this to me he said I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know amen what the light of the hour is amen so I can know how to walk in it I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in and how far up the road I am amen woo brother Hallelujah so Luther walked in justification life Wesley walked in sanctification life Pentecost walked in the restoration the gifts light amen but we are walking in the light of the fullness of the word notice he was the word made light or became light the word in that generation he was speaking of Jesus he was the word light of that generation why was he the word light of that generation brother Jared because the prophets of old had spoke of him and here he come and Vindicated he was the light of God's spoken word all the prophets had said had been fulfilled in him the prophets back here amen with the word so when you seen Jesus you did not have to go back and read Zachariah when you seen Jesus you didn't have to go back to Isaiah's prophecy when you seen Jesus brother Carter you didn't have to go back and read what Moses said you were looking after fulfillment of what the prophets had head in the manifestation of the Flesh of Jesus the son of God well I might as well just preach since I feel good amen I don't have to go back tonight amen and see if a prophet said there would be a bride I am looking at fulfillment of what a prophet said In the Flesh of the Church of the Living God what a prophet spoke amen has now somebody say now it has now been fulfilled in you you say well brother Andrew there's many lights brother B said there is no two or three lights there is no four or five different organizations there is one light there is not Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian amen Christ is the light and the light is the life and the word manifested is the light of the hour another place we are to be the children of the light amen and the light is the word which is made light for this age amen my goodness how do we know light except it comes from the word so the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it so the light of the hour is the Vindicated word which is the message of the hour I know people say what is the message of the hour and guys have tried to make a big deep theological explation explanation Amen Let me just tell you what the prophet said he said when you hear the term the message of the hour what we're getting at is what God promised to do in the age we're living in so you see somebody get the Holy Ghost a real word birth amen that is the message of the hour you see somebody come to an altar and get her healing that is amen the message of the hour you see the chains of sin and defilement fall off of aive amen that is the message of the hour you see a broken home amen come in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and all the bitterness and coldness melts away that is the message of the hour the the message of the hour is what God promised to do in the age we're living in he said to you man that's listen to this across the world wherever you may be there is something wrong with your experience when you say that you love God and you refuse his word there is something wrong with your experience when you say you love this message amen it want to shack up spiritually with a bunch of denominational ideas there is something wrong with your experience listen you call it witnessing you call it whatever you want to I'll tell you what I call it I call it compromising amen I call it somebody that ain't got enough guts Amen to stand on a rock somewhere and preach this message but as for me and my house and I think I can speak for Grace Tabernacle we're not going back we're going to keep on walking we're going to Keep On Believing we're going to keep on preaching brother Joe we're going to keep on shouting and we're going to keep on dancing and we're going to keep praying for the sick we're going to keep having old time Holy Ghost out part and one of these days we're going to change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an eye the old is going to become young that is the message of the hour yes sir then if we are walking in the god-given light of the hour then God takes the word that's given for the hour and vindicates it just like he did in Genesis 13 He said let there be light you say who you after the devil and spirit let there be light and light come forth his word went forth and light followed it and cleared away the mist and the Darkness went to one corner and the light shined on the other side remember said that's the gross Darkness that's upon the churches and things today to fail to see amen the light that shineing come on anden if you're going to help somebody tell them about the word if you're really trying to help somebody if you love them tell them about the word come on church amen you know what the definition of insanity is right brother Bobby they've been doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result so they've been preaching the same ideas for hundreds of years and ain't changed nothing amen so somebody trying to put a little message flavor to it ain't going to do nothing either we had to come out of the world's light to walk in the pillar of fire he said no man will never see it it's only the predestinated seed that's going to receive it but we've come to the place again that the Bible said you are the light of the world can I say what a prophet said Shalom 1964 and in this hour that we're living in now the EV indicated word of this hour Pentecostals you say speaking in tongues and so forth that was the day of Pentecost that was the light of the hour then see but this is another day he's the light of the hour today so brother John he brought that light down amen for more than just it is the light of the hour he said but he notice not it the gift amen but he the person amen The Giver is the light of the hour the word is light when it's Vindicated until the word is Promised for the day is a Vindicated then it's not light it cannot be there is a lot of the hour today that is Jesus Christ in the power of His res Resurrection his word that is Promised for this day what is his word promised for this day Eagles The Works that I do amen shall you also sorry I'm just feeling the Liberty right now the works that I do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do for I go to the father Works greater than he did do you believe it I believe it it seems humble it seems like it goes over the top of the people's head look when he was here on Earth how could you do Greater Works I've translated it many times amen it's not greater it's more the same thing there is what the evidence of the holy spirit is amen now some of y'all Amen Let The Devil beat you around a bush all the time do I have the Holy Ghost do I not do I have the Holy Ghost do I not it's been a month since I felt him it's been a week since I felt like shouting it's been a week since I felt like dancing amen can I tell you what a prophet said there is what the evidence of the holy spirit is is believing the word of God when it's manifested for he was the word manifested well glory to God the only evidence there is is when a man believes the written word come on somebody say well that's just simple no that's a powerful thought church when you can believe the written word that is the evidence of the Holy Spirit when it is Vindicated and you believe it and you walk in the light of it Jesus was the light of the hour because he was the promised word of the hour and he tried to tell them so but they were too much in darkness to understand it amen so it is today now listen how did Jesus bring confusion upon them by identifying himself as the written word in Luke 4 and: 16 he came to Nazareth when he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered in him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book oh church I can preach there and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written he could not find the place that was written of him brother Emanuel till he opened the book listen neither can you find a place to stand and whip that devil that's trying to kill you until the book has come open but may I announce unto you tonight amen Seven Seals have been revealed the third pool has been manifested the seven Thunders have fluttered listen the book is open come and see your place in the written word hallelujah come and see that you're more than just a church member come and see more than you're just a member of Grace Tabernacle come and see you're a Caleb come and see you're a part of the rapturing generation yes sir when the book was open he found the place where it was written then if he had recognized the one they were talking about of being a prophet look like they would have seen right there that same Prophet oh God picked up the word again amen the same Prophet picked up the word again and began to reveal it which he was the word I love this and was revealing himself by mouth oh God so revealing himself by mouth he's no longer just heing the sick revealing who he is he's no longer just raising the Dead revealing who he is but now by his own confession Hallelujah Now by his own confession he is revealing who he is oh church of living God I think it's time to change the way you talk about yourself I think it's time to quit saying I'm this and I'm mad I think it's time to stand up in the morning and say I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and when you go to bed say I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ if you got to walk around amen I just say this amen I holler at Malachi sometime I say Malachi are you you a Jesus boy he said Jesus boy listen it's time to change amen the you say well that's a bunch of fanaticism no I call it train up a child in the way should go and when he reaches his teenage years the transgender agenda and the perverse of Hollywood will not be able to shake him from who he knows he is I say to you tonight it's time to get a confession as the angels of God can shout about it's time to get a confession I am the bride I see it in the word I see it in the message I see it in the heavens I see it in the earth it's written in my soul he began to reveal himself by the word that was written of him he began and started from Moses and explained to them all the prophets had said then he said fools and slow a heart knowing that Moses and all the prophets said Christ must suffer and enter in his glory see for that age that's what's supposed to take place don't you know he's supposed to do that see revealing oh God revealing the written word of him I don't have time to preach on that he found the word and it became his confession we also hear Jesus as I follow amen as I follow the scripture amen the devil don't want me to preach this tonight but I'm going to preach it come on on amen amen Jesus well glory to God he found the written word now you say the written word John said amen there would be a greater witness come among the church right amen a greater witness would come among the church now look here he found the place where it was written and he said this now you won't receive me but another will come and come in his name and him you will receive we can join a Creed another we can join the denomination and you'll receive him but you but when you receive Jesus it's different another will come and I'll say I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian and you'll receive that all right but I come in my father's name doing what the father said I would do and you receive me not he said John came he had a great witness but I have a greater witness in God in God than what John did for what the father has given me to do amen that I do also listen the words that was written of him what he must be in that day can I just tell you a prop amen a prophetic profession is that okay he says this he says say it all together in one Accord I believe that Jesus Christ is alive and here now confirming this word of the hour the prophecies that was written of him has now been fulfilled in our midst come on Zion you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and David wrote about you and you know what he said he said God is in her midst and she shall not be moved God is in her midst and she shall not be moved he said say it in one Accord he is my savior let's say that together he is my savior he is my God he is my king he is my all and all then what does that make you that makes you children of the Word of Promise he said oh my The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word a promise was he himself to be made manifest not a Creed the person he said God was made manifest he himself acted at the same time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God come on Church there's been a seventh angel that has brought you a message but his message is are you with me yes sir but his message is the word of God Isaiah 9 and6 he fulfilled at the time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her because Jesus accepted the word and found the place that was written of himself and chose to walk in it rather than what the scoffers thought of him all of a sudden brother Benji he became a Mystic ain't that something he was not a Mystic until the word come open oh God he was not a Mystic until the word come open and he found the place that was written of himself and he identified that I am he that is speaking there and they then turned and said you're a Mystic you're weird yeah you know why they think you're weird because you think you're just as much a part of this Bible as Moses was you know why they think we're a Mystic is because we are convinced by scripture and Supernatural vindication that William brandom is just as much a part of this Bible amen as John the Baptist was you know why they think we're Mystic is because we don't welcome psychology into our pull pits to fix our homes you know why they think we're Mystic is because we stand on the old Holiness landmarks and we preach a man ought to look like a man and a woman ought to look like a woman and a church ought to operate as a church well you know what I say I don't care what they think about me I know who I am I know where I come from I know where I'm going call me a Mystic if you want to I found my place in the word of God and I refuse to walk in anything else Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and the perfect God in which he was that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world am I reading that right and becomes I like it whoever said it and becomes said exactly and be somebody been reading and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition sir when you come into a world of faith alone with God that means for each one of us not just the pastor not just the deacons not just the trustees that means for the Ley come on church amen it'll get very lonely if it's just preachers walking in this world come on it'll get very lonely if it's just the deacons or just the trustees I say it ought to be our youngest of children amen walk in this world you say what do you mean by walk in this world he said you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God and he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same woo glory to God now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with this perfect faith and so it is now with fol who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others can I tell you something how many can be honest and say I've been tempted to the devil this week sir I've been tempted to the devil today did you get out of bed I've been tempting the devil today we all have but you know why we're Mystic is because when Satan tempts us we resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word just like Jesus did come on Church that's why you're here tonight is you got the ability Brother David to shake the devil off that's why you're here tonight brother Bobby is God has put something in your soul by revelation God sent a prophet to open the word and to show you the place that was written of you and he turned to John 14:12 and said sister kareim that's you that's you paig that's you right there in John 14:12 Greater Works than this shall I do and you're still here tonight amen because the faith of God is in the Church of God by faith in his word we conquer I'm sorry I'm feeling good he said there he was walking he was walking in a world with perfect Faith because he was the word because he was the word you say Jesus was the word yes he was Jesus was the word you say the word of what he was the Word of Promise amen he was the Word of Promise promise now let me say this to you tonight amen we know a prophet made a connection he always made a connection between you and Jesus you know what he said he said now if you abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my words are you with me and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of a way so the word has brought you in the same kind of way that Jesus walked he says the virtues are flowing from you the rivers of God The Fountains of blessing just flowing out to the people if you just imagine it that don't do any good but if it's really there then it really happened oh church of living God all right if it's really there brother Joe it really happened that's right brother Matt if it's really there then it really happened brother Mark if your name

let me give you something to shout about it really happened it really happened and therefore it's really there it really happened that God saved my soul and he revealed the message of the hour can I tell you something it really happened that a prophet I feel like preaching it really happened that a prophet went in the mountains of Arizona and the Word was revealed to him it really happened that a pillar of fire come down and said it's John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second it really happened you say how do you know that because I'm here you're here it really [Music] happened you can't help but walk you can't help but get knocked down and get back up amen you can't help but shake your fences off light has come Isaiah said arise and Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee look at this word light brother Noah it's the light of prosperity and it is the light of instruction Joshua only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to the law that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law I'm closing on this shall not depart out of thy oh church this word shall not depart out of thy mouth amen which is how Jesus revealed himself when he found himself in the book and thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success I love what Ram says he said Joshua remembered his commission let not this book of the law my word depart out of your mouth I love when brother says in other words he says in other words Joshua I don't care what the tribe says I don't care what the clergy says you stay with this word for then Thou shalt make thy ways prosperous Joshua if you can just keep the confession of my word in your mouth Hallelujah if you can just keep the confession of this word in your mouth you're going to prosper and have good success look what David said he said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly you got to quit walking in the counsil of what people think you ought to be doing when is contrary to what God has revealed that you ought to be doing I got tight there it's ungodly counsel walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever am I reading this right Psalms 1 13 and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper am I am I reading that right yes sir whatsoever he doeth shall prosper John said beloved I wish above all things that thou May prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper look at this word Prosper it means to lead by a direct and easy way yes sir if you can obey the word there is a victory in love divine you say brother that was the hard way but in reality it was the easy way because it was the way that God had chosen for his servant to walk in and prosper amen remember said there's a thirst for Success people spend thousands of dollars to send their children to school and do universities and colleges and so forth get an ed education to be successful they called in life but now I have nothing against that now that's all right but to me you could get all the schooling in the world and still you haven't found the right success say because that will just temporarily make things a little easier for you here but when you die you'll leave all that behind you listen and this entire economy that we have can I just say something to you don't lose sight of the Rapture because the promise of a booming economy the world's view of success and prosperity is different than God's view of success and prosper Satan through sin builds the people up with a great Prosperity or a good time going to the nightclubs said what he's doing is he's only building you up brother Joe for a great let down can I can can I leave you with this tonight he does it in the religious realm as well yes sir said Prosperity is not always a sign that God is with you he said people think that Prosperity is a sign of a spiritual blessing that's exactly contrary another Place usually Prosperity causes sin because many people look upon Prosperity as blessings it would be if we could handle it right but it usually leads to sin and dishonoring God I'm just saying what he said he said Prosperity sometimes is a hindrance he said now man calls Prosperity sometimes religion but Prosperity will blind people's eyes from the word of God you me prove it to you he said I talked to a man the great religious Realms the other day they said to me God proves it he's with us why we grow last year brother Brandon I forget how many hundreds like that I said that's not one bit of approval uh-huh that's right prostitution increased last year about 30% did that show God was with prostitution he said no sir I said sure see what Prosperity does is it can paralyze your faith good said we had a little we had a little breath of prosperity went off into building programs lost old fashioned Pentecostal blessing used to fall Among Us got a new car a new house raised on a job brother said what we did is we forget God when Prosperity comes in like that he said that's what America done they turned their heads that's what the church has done he said but Lord and IET I'm closing right here I'm feeling good there's a good atmosphere here tonight lord it's y'all's fault Lord in our great Prosperity Satan has blowed his poisonous breath again and he said the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit there's no such a thing as a new birth he said Lord God what walk in on your promises walk in on your promises and show to your people that you still live and save them from the breath of Satan somebody say are you preaching against buildings I'm not are you preaching against blessings I'm not I'm preaching against replacing the opening of the word with something else to whip the devil with we are children of promise and the power of God is no longer just in the book it is now walking in us he said God said in Genesis 2 they were Gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world he give them Dominion of all things brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again we are waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested are y'all ready for this are you ready for this when the power of God will walk out that's good did I read that right when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan's Got Away amen from him can I tell you this tonight as our musicians are coming when you get up and walk out of this building you are the power of God Amen walking right out you say I'm the power of God sir yes you say how can you say that because Jesus found the place that it was written and when he found that place it released a power in his life sir to resist the devil yes sir with a perfect Faith Amen in the perfect word believe in the Lord your God yes sir and you shall be established Believe In His prophets and you shall prosper amen that's good can I hone it way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way down for you tonight we say things like marriages are falling apart homes are falling apart churches are falling apart we say things like that family's falling apart we say things like that Ministry is falling apart we look at the world and we look out there and we say my I tell you what look at that look what's happening there but can I can I bring it into perspective to you tonight the only reason we're prospering is we have acknowledged we have acknowledge the words of a prophet that's the success of this [Music] church come on Grace Tabernacle there's churches that start with a lot more than this church started [Music] with is this okay they start with a lot more brother Bobby they start with about five or six hundred members bank accounts overflowing all kinds of prosperity and all kinds of worldly views and popcorn nights and movie Nights oh yeah in a few years it falls apart but have you ever stopped and thought that nearly six years ago in a barn on the side of a road a man and his family decided to acknowledge the words of a prophet and build a place I didn't mean that that is the first time they acknowledged it they built a place that those words could be acknowledged unadulterated and this church is prospering because of the message of the hour and the minute you want to become another statistic lay the message aside the minute you want your young people to become another statistic lay what a prophet set aside but if you walk in the light if you walk in the light if you walk in the light of instruction it may get hard for a while but way down the road it's going to pay off are you hearing me tonight walk in the light of the revealed word amen of the hour won't you stand your feet tonight sorry I hope that was okay you say brother Andrew that's crazy you say that's crazy well is it really that one by one Believers and families begin to come people begin to get baptized Mama's hearts that have grown cold on the Promises of God God in the presence of the Holy Ghost and brother Joe they got lick by the fire of God and something ignited in their heart my babies are going to be saved my family is going to be in the house of God you say what is and I'll tell you what it is it's called the power of God walking in flesh you didn't turn your back the first trial that came and run from the enemy you know why cuz you're not under a Moses dispensation now you're under a Joshua under Moses they was on the defense the enemy chased them to the Red Sea but under Joshua they chased the enemy to the River Jordan they chased the enemy to the walls of Jericho under Joshua they now knew who they positionally were what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying if you can just keep in step with Joshua if you can just keep playing them tapes good and reading them books and listen to that word yes and digging in your Bibles and and going through them messages if you can just keep walking with Joshua amen you're taking land you're possessing promises you're well able to do it you're well able to do it tonight great are our mistakes brother Matt but greater is Joshua listen I don't know about you tonight but I brother Mark I just want to raise my hands and say I'm Caleb I'm Caleb I surrender to my type in the Bible I'm not trying to outrun it I'm not trying to outdo it I surrender to it I'm Caleb and whatever Caleb do

about the way a boy ought to dress come on hello never was a time he said are you sure Joshua that that's the Lord we do this Caleb he knew who Joshua was and therefore he knew who he was and therefore the devil hated him because the devil could not Shake him away from Joshua right come on the devil hates us brother cuz he can't shake us away from Joshua ain't enough pressures to shake us away the word has revealed who we are you love him tonight amen somebody say it's time it's time to face the enemy face the enemy with Revelation from the open book it's time it's time you said

devil's been trying to hide it from you but the light of God has come the pillar of fire and if you'll welcome him in your homes if you'll welcome him into your lives and you'll take that sword of the spirit and you'll turn and face that enemy and say you have hid the promises of God away from me as long as I'm going to allow it I am heir to these promises and I'm going to walk in them I wonder

church um the the brother Wayne's the church is having the the youth banquet in Ohio Lima it's on February the 8th online you can find the sign up uh form for it we encourage you to go um we just uh uh I know it's quite a ways to go but certainly would be a joy to be there brother Joe will be going up and taking the Thursday night service and then they'll have some activities for the young people on Friday and then on Saturday have the youth banquet and brother Ray will be speaking there on the uh Sunday following at the home church so anybody that could go I'm certain it would be a blessing to you also as uh we go I want to remember uh brother Wesley was been sick and still working and know that's a miserable feeling just ask the Lord to touch his body and strengthen him also brother Dave margar ask the church for prayer tonight sick in his body too so as we go let's just remember these in prayer and ask Lord just to strengthen our brother for pouring his heart out and allowing God to be able to use him I believe God has wonderful gifts Among Us that if we can open up to receive them that God can use them to speak to us just like he does I just believe that I don't believe church is a carnal thing I don't think it's some place that we go to take up time or space but we come to hear the word of the Lord that's why whenever I when I hear these ministers preaching I love to I love to hear preaching I know I preach a lot but I love to hear preaching because it's edifying it gives you strength the Bible says iron sharpens iron and I always draw something from it so I appreciate our brothers laboring before the Lord uh to bring a word that is that is relevant and on time and God never fails amen when you get a gift that is surren surrender to God and a people that are surrender to God God never fails to do something for his people so I just thank him for that tonight let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord tonight for this
