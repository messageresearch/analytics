knowing that there are many great needs Lord among us and God that you are mindful of what we have need of Lord you know every trial every that everybody's going through tonight and the decisions that are weighing on our hearts and minds but Lord we just ask you to come and have your way in this service Lord and God we pray that you would take this word that would be spoken and Lord don't let it be the words of a man and Lord anybody could take this book and open it up and read scriptures and Lord say a few things but God we just ask that you would come by Lord that maybe we could just surrender to you and Lord as a as a body of Believers and speaker and hearers alike Lord that we could just allow you to be able to come and minister to our hearts Lord we'll be careful to give you the glory for everything that's done and said tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen we just want to invite you you to the scriptures uh to the book of Ephesians and we're going to read out of the first chapter and we'll just read a couple verses of scripture out of Ephesians 1 and then on the 10th verse so give you just a moment uh to find your place there Ephesians 1 and 10 and I love that song I've Been Changed amen amen I ain't going to go back amen just say it's good to good to be able to come and fellowship around the word of God it don't ever get over does it just to just to come and take the word and there's always you know you can take the same scripture and read it tomorrow and the next day and the next day and there's always just something that the Lord has a way of taking a word that is a Living Word and revealing something to you in it that you didn't see yesterday and that's the beauty of God's word you know uh the same thing's been written on these Pages some uh for thousands and thousands of years but every day when you get up and read it it's just like getting a hold of some fresh mana and so I just love the word of God I I I want to read from the 10th verse Paul said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being somebody say an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings of the reading of his word uh tonight as you take your seats and I want to take a a a moment tonight I want to speak on a Vindicated policy a Vindicated policy last week we were speaking on this um uh subject of the church getting into the spirit and and uh we had gone in that direction out of the Book of Revelations and showing the God that was Among Us uh walking amongst the church in this day and uh and and we had read through about what John had wrote and and you know in John's revelation and how uh that he talked about when you know we must get into the spirit and by doing that we would be able to gain the revelation of the word of God and uh how many realize that tonight that this is not a carnal Affair this is U uh when you're talking about spiritual things or getting into the spirit remember when John uh even wrote the Book of Revelation matter of fact I can say this about every writer of the Bible uh any author that wrote any Scripture that we read was in the spirit of God when they wrote it was the spirit of God that moved upon them uh that caused them to Rite the things that we read and so we realize that if it takes getting into the spirit to write it then it takes us getting into the spirit to uh to receive the revelation of it so uh so by that we know that our walk with God is a spiritual walk our relationship with God is a spiritual relationship and so uh we we actually find this in the scriptures that there's actually a promise that God has given to the Gentile Church in the last days and uh Not only was that promise for us to to uh uh to get into the spirit but the promise of God was that the spirit would get into us and so this is something that God has promised to us as Believers and so uh we realize as a gentile race that we were promised a spiritual relationship with God it wasn't uh it wasn't a carnal relationship that God promised us but he he he he he promised us a connection a close walk with him a a a spiritual walk with him and I know this is uh is something that we talk about or we say many times but often uh we we we miss the real revelation of of having a spiritual walk or having a spiritual relationship with God and and God dealing with us on this level and but you know there's something in in this race of people that we all are here as a a group of Gentiles but uh in our race there's something special about our relationship with God and the what is special about it is our relationship brother Jared is not a relationship that God is dealing with a group of people but your relationship with God is an individual relationship isn't that something to think about that that that God is so big that he could have a relationship with each one of us and it it don't matter what he does for one he can still do something else the same day at the same time and he'll hear the same prayer of another person they they may be across the seas and praying and talking to God and and God Is So vast that we could all approach him at the same time and we could tell him what's on our heart and and and and brother Mark we could tell him our needs and he'll hear every one of our prayer and he'll he'll answer all of our prayer at the same that's how big of a God that God is I I think sometimes we make God too small but we have a great big God God and and he's a god of the individual he you know uh the Bible would tell us that when God dealt with Israel he dealt with them as a nation but when he dealt with the the Gentile he deals with the gentile people as individuals and so so when we read this scripture we read in the book of Ephesians you'll find when Paul is talking he's talking to the Gentile Believers and and uh and when you read this uh this book in the Bible even in the very first verse Paul tells you who he's talking to see don't he makes it plain he said this letter I'm a Al Jesus Christ and by the will of God I am writing to the Saints in other words that was those that were Sanctified by God it was the it was those and Paul said it was those who were at Ephesus and also unto the faithful in Jesus Christ so but when we read this we realize that it was not just a a a faithful church as a body of Believers but when Paul was talking to us it was a faithful church as a body of individuals and so he says to the faithful in Christ Jesus these were individuals brother B said watch how he addresses us he said this is not to the unbelievers but when Paul writes this book he wrote it to the Believers somebody say Believers so when you read this letter this is not written to the whole world this isn't something that everybody can pick up and say this is personal to me but to the Believers and those that are faithful in Christ you can take this uh you can take this book and you can start reading it and you'll realize that this is something that God has written to you and to you alone see it was a letter to an individual he said see it was to the church but it was to the called out ones it was the Sanctified or the called ones that are in Christ Jesus and so the letter by the mark it was written it was it was it was written to individuals and it was calling to individuals to have a relationship with God and brother B talks about this book in in many ways I'm not going to preach the series on it but he says you know this is one of the greatest books in the O in the New Testament because the book of Ephesians is what draws us together and positionally places the church it's what it's what shows you who you are and what your position is in Christ Jesus and and so we see when you when you go reading through this book that the book of Ephesians even uh remember been maybe a year or two ago that we had uh kind of went through how that it was a parallel to the Book of Joshua and the things that uh that that Joshua done in the Old Testament was what Paul was speaking of in the New Testament and so so we how many remembers that I it's been a couple years back but maybe I'll just just lay a a little Foundation from it for some that wasn't here but uh but the Book of Joshua we realize that it was a story of isra Israel possessing the promised land how many know that remember Joshua he was a type of the Holy Ghost and he came in at the end of the Journey of Israel and was what led them into Canaan land remember they went to Jericho marched around the walls and it was Joshua that led them after the death of Moses it was Joshua that took him on into the promised land and so we realize by studying the scripture that this that this journey of the children of Israel was a natural type of what God would do spiritually with the church today how many believe that and so so we see that from Egypt all the way to Canaan land in the natural was a Tope of our spiritual journey so you can go back in the Old Testament and you can read about how they came out of Egypt and how God had called them and they went into the Wilderness and they and God fed them while they were on their journey and they went through this uh this all this phase of this journey and they finally come to the border of Canaan land and God would send a man like Joshua that would lead them into this place and so we realize that that entire story is a type of your spiritual walk with God so so so you can actually go back and read this and you can find out where you are I I love that God would give us a way to find our stage in our journey we can we can find out where we are in this journey and and so brother R would take and show us that that see these three stages he said just as there was three stages in Egypt or in their Journey there's three stages in our journey said see their first stage was they came out of Egypt the second stage is they went into the Wilderness the third stage is that they entered into the Canaan land which was a Promised Land he says so so these three stages of their Journey was a type of the three stages of our journey so so leaving of Egypt it was a type of justification and another words that that that you would go and and repent and and God would forgive you of your sins and you'd be justified remember how the play on words just if I had never done it in the first place it was God and God really forgives you when a person comes to God sincerely and they repent to God for their sin God always he's just the Bible said he is just to forgive you of your sins and so we go through this stage of justification and then the second stage in their Wilderness Journey you remember out in the wilderness and and how that there's such a good atmosphere in here I may as well preach but you remember when they went out into the Wilderness that they that that they had gone through this stage of purification and remember God would give them the order of taking the the sacrifices and lay them up on the Altar and remember the the the the the sacrifice of separation and they would take the ashes and all all the things in in this Wilderness Journey it was a type of purification or sanctification in fact that God would not even let them enter into the land of Canaan in the condition that they were in remember he said they had to be Sanctified they had to to be a pure people they had to follow the word of God matter matter of fact there was so many that never made it into the land of Canaan because they never made it through that that part of their walk with God and so so he says see this is their Wilderness Journey was a type of sanctification and then then they went into the Canaan land and so this is why so many people get this mixed up on this type or they can't they can't find this type perfectly is because there's so many to that toped Canaan land with the Millennium and say well then we'll enter into this land of Millennium but brother man said it couldn't be that because when they went into Canaan land there were still Wars and they were still fighting in the Millennium it was a time of Peace Satan would be bound a thousand years there there won't be no Wars and things like that going on he said so what the Canaan land was it was a type of the Holy Ghost so now you see this three stages of the believer just in that very same uh Journey that they have we can see that in our journey in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost I thought my isn't it something that we've saw that happen and not only did we see it happen in every individual but we've saw this happen with the church and here here we are at the end time and brother Jared the church has gone through this phase it went through an age of justification age of sanctification and now we've came into this age of the Holy Ghost we've came into this Joshua age remember brother Wayne did a whole series on on the Joshua generation and and here that here we are as some Joshua Believers this is our our type in the scripture we're those that would in that they wouldn't be stuck back there they would that they would enter into this place of of of of of of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so we see as Joshua comes in I want to just lay this in here but but Joshua when he comes in Joshua the first chapter he says be strong and of good courage for under this people shall I divide an inheritance in the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them so here in Joshua the first chapter soon as Joshua takes office he announces his purpose and his purpose Pur is to lead them into this place or or into their land of inheritance but notice because they were Jews brother Mark he was going to divide them by tribe so it wasn't that each individual possessed this portion but by tribe they would go into this boundary of land but then whenever Paul would come in Ephesians the first chapter then Paul would show what his purpose was and he said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both him which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in in him in whom also we have obtained our inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will but now this time whenever Apostle Paul begins to speak to the Gentile Church in the end time it is a possession that is inherited by the individual so my it just makes me feel good to think that God would write a letter to me see I you know you can read this say brother Matt it's to every believer but when I read this I read this as a letter to me I I I say Lord he wrote it he says Matt this is your inheritance and this is the promise that I've given unto you that's how I read my Bible this is it it ain't just something for uh for the world or something to be put on to somebody else but I thank God that he wrote it to me how many say Amen to that I I thank God that I can read it and I can read it as a letter as God intended it that this was something that God has written to me and so so we see this it's an individual possessed portion that God has given brother B said what is that land that was promised to the New Testament believer he said it was the promise of the Holy Spirit that's what Joel said for it shall come to pass in the last days that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I thought my isn't it something that there was so many that came out of this land of Egypt there were so many that went out into this Wilderness and brother Mark they died in the wilderness after they come out of Egypt because they never made it into that land of promise I thought Lord help us not to ever be the ones that get out of Egypt and get out into the middle of the Wilderness and get lost in in this Wilderness journey and never make it into the promise that God has given to the church today I think I look around this world and you see so many failed attempts at at being Christians and uh failed attempts at being at being at being saved you see people that whose lives are wrecked you say what happen today many times is because people they come to this stage they say I'm going to stop my drinking and I I'm G to stop doing drugs and I I'm G to start dressing right and I'm going to start living right and I'm going to repent and I'm going to go to church and God's going to forgive me and I'm going to be a good church member and then they come and they go through this stage of justification and they they make their heart right and they and they repent and they really do repent and God forgives them and he really does forgive them and then they enter into this stage of sanctification and they they begin to clean up their life but whenever it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost then they fail to press into it they get stuck or lost in this Wilderness part of their journey and I thought my isn't it something you know why because sometimes it's hard to press into it sometimes it's hard to press over in I I wonder how how they must have felt that day when Joshua was telling them on the outside of the land of Canaan here they came to the walls of Jericho and Joshua said but you have to walk around the walls in order to get what your inheritance is you're going to have to walk and you're going to have to put another foot in front of another and you're going to have to keep walking in the word of God and you'll have to walk around it every day and day after day will make another trip and tomorrow we'll make another trip and tomorrow we'll make another trip I said sometimes people get lost Lo in the journey I I wonder if they didn't get tired but Joshua said but you're a promised group of people you're the people that God has called to inherit this land I know there may had some fathers and you may had some uncles and you may had some friends that lost their way in the journey that never made it this far but God has called you over the river and God has parted the waters that you can walk to the to the cusp of your inheritance that you can Mark you won't get tired when you get a little weak somebody bow them hold them up and let them let them build up a little bit of stamina to go another row another round brother Mar around the walls until finally on the seventh day the Bible said the walls fell down and they receiv received what God had promised unto them I think people give up and they stop pressing but remember said but what we got to do is we've got to press on into the position of the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to have a walk with God you got to press through under that you want to be you want to be able to to be able to serve God and not be in and out of church you got to press through into there it can't be you can't get lost in the wilderness but we had to press true he said let's not stop at just believing in the Lord Jesus and being baptized let's not stop just because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but let's press on into our position let's press on brother Mark justification ain't no place of rest sanctification is not a place of rest it's the worst place you could ever take a nap it's not a place of rest the Bible never never told us that this was our our place of rest this was the place that God had given you you know I think of sanctification like this it's a place that every believer has to go to but no believer should stay in the land of sanctification it's a place it's meant to be a place that you pass through the Wilderness was a place that they were to pass through and it took so long for them to get to that place I thought my you know how many uh theologians or different studiers have showed how long it could have took just a few days to be able to to pass through from one one place to another I thought that's the way it is when you look at the lives of people sometimes it takes so long for them to pass through that place but friends it's not a place of rest we must go on it it it's meant to pass through let me can I tell you what Jesus said he said let me tell you why you don't want to rest in this land I know I know this is simple but let me tell you why you don't want to stay in this place because Jesus said when an unclean Spirit has gone out of a man what is sanctification a life that is cleaned up the devil has been cast They they've left the your life has been turned over to God Lord let all this filth and all these things of this world let it leave from me and now you have an empty house and Jesus said and when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and finds none and then he says I will return unto my house isn't that something the devil calls you his house when you when he leaves he calls you his house I will return man it makes me want to punch him right in the nose I'll return to my house he said I think we ought to look at the Devil and say no this ain't your house house this is this is the Lord's House this is my house that's what we ought to do with the devil and say no this is my house this ain't your house he said I'll return to my house what an arrogant devil I'll return to my house from when I came out and when he has come he finds the house empty swept and garnished and he goes in and he takes with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself that they could enter and dwell therein and the last state of that man is worse than the first you see why this is a d dangerous land to dwell in you don't want to come to this place and rest because it'll never be a place of rest it's not meant to to be a place of rest it's not meant to be a place where that you would live your life that's why that's why you see so many people that are I'm going to get myself in trouble but you see so many mean people running around wearing dresses because they try to get to this place of sanctification and never have their lives fil or filled with the spirit of Jesus Christ and now now now now they're a Target to the devil because they're trying to do something for the Lord and the Bible says when you start to do something for the Lord but said every gun of hell is aimed at you and so here they made a a step to do something for God and the devil's after them and now and now they get into this state and it just continues to get worse and worse and worse they get bitter and then they're they're mad and they're hateful all the time because they're trying to live something that they can't even hardly live and and they're mad at everybody else I mean you I ain't trying to point anybody I know we we we all know people but you wonder what's wrong with them because if if the spirit of Christ was you let me tell you something about the spirit of Christ it's it's an easily identifiable spirit this is not something that's hard to discern for a Believer to look at somebody and say well I wonder if they got the spirit of Christ in them you know it because the Bible tells us the fruit of what the spirit of Christ is so see when a man has Paul teaches a whole message on it the book of Galatians he said when a man has the spirit of Christ he said the H in other words the Holy Spirit produces a certain kind of fruit he said it's love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law so the spirit of God Bears a certain kind of fruit so you realize that in order that what God is trying to get us to is to this place that we can have the spirit of God on the inside of us that we could bear the fruit of what Christianity is not just to go around and say well I'm a Christian because I go to church and I'm a Christian because I because I have a Bible and I'm Christian because I'm a part of GRA Tabernacle but that that ain't what makes you a Christian but it's that the life of Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost with live in the heart of a man I I think it's wonderful that God would want his Spirit to dwell in you the very creator of Heaven and Earth would want his Spirit to dwell in a in a human flesh the the old the old ugliness of humanity but that is the desire of God in this age is to dwell in us see that's the dangerous place to dwell in the state of sanctification said but why because you you get worse and worse but B said like this he said when the devil moves out then that gives God an opportunity to move in amen so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it there if you just repent of your sins and go on you'll be worse off than you ever were you ever thought of that my ain't that a powerful quote it's what a revelation this is how many times that well Lord I pray you forgive me people walk down the road Lord you forgive me Lord and man I feel a bit better because I ask for forgiveness I'm just going to keep asking for forgiveness but he said if you just repent of your sins and go on you're going to be worse off than you were but you got to get to a place where the spirit of God is living inside of you you got to press into this place he said get to the place where Satan once lived man that's good get the place where Satan once lived and get it occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word in you manifested and you'll be able to cast out Devils we ain't just talking about casting out Devils out of everybody else but any devil that would come to your porch knocking on the door brother Mark you could look him in the eye and say this house is not empty any longer the place that you came to dwell is not empty any longer there's no room for you in the end find your you can have your leave he said then you'll have the ability to cast out Devils I don't know about you but I think we want our Lives full tonight we want our Lives full I want my life to be filled with the spirit of God that where to where the devil wouldn't have no room you know I think about this in our in our natural and in our natural life I I wonder how many how many could say that's like I want I want my life to be filled up I you know you you think about in our in our natural life and all the the things that we do we want our natural life we we want to be able to be successful and we don't uh we don't want to we don't we want to be able to eat tomorrow how many how me how me say Amen we you know if I asked the if I asked y'all tonight I said well I wonder how many if I if I if I had the ability to give it and I said well I'll tell you what we're going to do I'm just going to I'm just going to try to give everybody a couple of million dollars and maybe pay off all the what you have and get you a house and everything paid for and we're going to put a three or four million in the bank just in case you have a flat tire or some maintenance or anything like that any just a little a rainy day fund I wonder how many would raise your hand and accept it is there a few that would take it there's got to be come on I'm asking you if I had the ability to give it would you take it be honest with me see everybody everybody would take it because some of youall think I'm crazy you're looking at me like I am but but but but everybody in your honest heart if I really had it to give there ain't nobody in here that wouldn't accept it would say I I would certainly want that why because because you would be you would say well I would have peace in my natural life I would you know I could go fishing I go hunting I well I could buy that hunting ranch that I always wanted and I could high fence me off some deer I we'd never see brother Morgan again you wonder why God don't give Morgan $10 million you'd never see him he'd be off in the deer Woods he'd never come out Lord be so mad at us either that or she'd be having a jubilee I don't know which but but nevertheless but God he said he'll never put on you more than you could bear brother ain't God wonderful I won't give you more than you can handle he he's just a mindful God he a a't going to let us fall I love our Lord but you know if I offered it to you brother Mark we would take it because we want to we want our natural life we want to be able to make it and make make good decisions but you know so so even in our in the natural we look to invest things we want to make good Investments and you know if you ask people actually ask me this all the time and I've gave many uh uh people advice and things that to my best of my ability of where you know to way to invest money and what making good decisions and things like that and but but you know when you you can invest in so many things you can invest in stock you can invest in insurances and policies and all sorts of things in order to make money and actually I I I I was reading here uh uh today and it was showing on in 2024 the best investment landscape uh for this year is is in private Banks or chemicals or consumer durables this is what so there's always something that tells us the best thing that you can invest in in order for you to have success in your Investments and you know I I thought you know if you're going to make an investment in the natural then you're investing for a purpose I don't know anybody uh that would make an investment for the purpose of losing money but when you invest you invest to gain you invest in order you want the stock that that you're invested in not only do you want it to gain value but you want it to I'm not giving you a lesson but you want it to gain value over inflation you want it to gain and otherwise not that it would just be worth more but you want it to be worth more in value to your life so you if you make an investment you want it to bring value to your life down down at the end of the road that there's something that it can bring value uh to your help you maybe help your retirement or help your children or or or or weddings or things that that you got to look forward to but but we make investments to take care of things like that so you want it to add value to your life and you know I thought about thought about this how that we come to this place and and even in our in our lives we we we want to invest our lives in something that will have a good return on our investment and I said I thought about that today of how that God would that would would give us an offer of something if I want to invest my time and my money and my efforts I want to invest in something brother Mark that'll give me the best return and you know I can't think of any greater investment to increase our quality of life or the value of life than the investment that God has offered to us as individuals here God has I thought my isn't it something that the investment that God has offered to you tonight is an investment that'll pay a real dividend you know the investment if I could stand for God tonight and say the investment that God has asking you to make is an investment that brother Mark it has a track record that it's never failed it's a track record that it'll never crash you don't have to worry about it whenever you go and you invest in this what God is offering to us today it ain't something that's going to fall tomorrow but you can invest in the stock that God has to offer it's something that is sure but the mark you know they have what's called shity bonds let me tell you the only real shity bond that there is is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the only real sure thing that that you'll be able to get a return on your investment it's it's a stock brother brother Jared that has never failed matter of fact it's got such a record it's risen from the from the grave for the cross of Calvary to the throne of God I I it's always on the rise I think isn't it something to be able to invest in something that I know that ain't ever going to fall it's an investment that God has offered to us the Bible said Jesus said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne so see here when he would offer this investment he would offer it with a with a reward that is greater than anything that we can possess in this life I wonder if you ask people if you could just ask somebody this tonight and you say well how do you invest in Christ I wonder how many could give you an answer how do you invest in Christ you know mean it's hard to explain things sometimes but you realize that this was the very question that the Rich Young Ruler was asking Jesus whenever he talked to him when it came to him you realize he was a man that had made many natural Investments he was a very wealthy man the Bible called him a Rich Young Ruler so he no doubt made many natural Investments but when he came to Christ notice what he was asking he was asking about an investment he said what can I do to have eternal life I he was wanting to make an investment what what must I give what must I do in order to gain eternal life obviously it was something that he had heard of it was something that that he wanted it was something that he that he had a desire of knowing that it wasn't something that he would be able to obtain in his natural life but he was looking for something to pay dividends down the road I want something down the road I I want I want eternal life and what must I do in order to have it you know I notice how remember how Jesus turned to him he said well sell all you have and give it to the poor and take up your cross and follow me and the Bible says that the man left away troubled because he had many great possessions he was troubled in his spirit that he that he wouldn't want to give it up but remember said what he said what it was what what think about it when a man of business he had been so prosperous but here he was given an opportunity to receive a Vindicated policy from God here God had given him an offer of a policy that could never fail here here Jesus was telling him something of all the things that you could gain I I thought about all the risky Investments that he had made and all the the risky decisions that he had made but here that Jesus was offering an an investment that would never fail he was offering an investment that would never go bad I I thought my of all the risky things that we could do but here's one investment that you can make tonight that there is no risk it has a proven track it's 100% of the time the people that have invested that they have received what what the investment promised that they would receive I think many take this you know many times they they read this Rich Young Ruler and you know I know it gets taken the wrong way and they say well you know that God wants everybody to be poor and you know you got to be poor to serve God that I don't I don't believe that and I I'm not preaching that to you tonight or you can't have nothing but but notice that what Jesus was preaching to this man if you're a good Bible reader you'll find this out that he was preaching unto him a principle the same principle that Jesus spoke in in Matthew the 6th chapter he said seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you so here it was a principle Jesus was trying to get him to invest in this principle of of the kingdom of God he he was trying matter of fact even Jesus told the disciples one time he said I say unto you there's no man that has ever left a house or a brother sister father mother wife children lands for my sake and the gospels but he would receive a h hundredfold in this time houses brothers sisters mothers children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life so God has never asked for anybody an investment that he wasn't intending on giving them a return on the investment it wasn't that God wanted the man not to have anything but he wanted him to he was offering him an investment to give first to the kingdom of God and then allow God to bless him in his life I thought I thought my you know what he was off man I feel like preaching tonight you know what he was offering he was offering him the same thing that Elijah offered to that widow woman that day when her meal Bell had ran dry and Elijah said woman could you go get me some the drink and when you come back bring me a Mortel of bread in thy hand she said I have nothing to offer I got a little bit of oil left I got a few drops of oil and a little bit of meal that's left that I'm going to make my last meal for me and my son and then I'm going to die but you know what Elijah told her he said lady if you'll go first and you'll bring unto me if you'll give unto God first then I'll give you thus sayeth the Lord that your meal bear will never run dry your cruise of oil will never run dry and the Bible said that the lady obey made and she did according to the sayings of Elijah and that day in her house the Bible said her house did eat many days because she did according to the saying of Elijah you see what he offered her he offered her an investment what would you give to God you don't don't you realize it was one meal that she offered but but it was all that she had and because she was willing to give it and then God he filled up her oil he filled up her meal Bell and the next day and the next week and the many days after it continued it didn't matter how much she took out of it I think she could have invited some friends over for dinner and she could have fed every one of them and the next day should have got up and the oil Cruise would have been full and the meal bear would have been full because she made the right investment that was go God was waiting to make an investment Bible said she did according to the saying of Elijah and her house did eat many days I love how this is working you know you know as a preacher you find Little Things Way Things are Written they just kind of stick out to you but you notice the Bible doesn't say that she did according according to the word of Elijah it says she did according to the saying of Elijah and then the next verse it says and her barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail for according to the word of the Lord which was spoke by Elijah you see what she had she had a Vindicated policy she heard the saying of Elijah but that's not what filled her meal Barrel what filled it is because it was a word from the Lord it wasn't Elijah's policy Elijah was the mouth Elijah was the mouthpiece that God used Oh my he was he was the one that was carrying the policy around and walking he was going door to door brother Mark he he knocked on that little old widow woman's door and said I got a policy to offer you I know I know it's a time of drought and I I know it's a time of famine and everybody around you is about to start but here's a policy that how he he he was doing the door too sales I wonder how many times that he knocked on our door a Vindicated policy but what made it Vindicated is it was a word from the Lord notice what happened with Paul whenever he saw it he saw the pillar of fire but said what he did when he saw that Pillar of Fire he found a firm that was reliable makes me want to dance he found a firm that was reliable it was a reliable investment he said because Christ had died and rose again and here he was again in that same Pillar of Fire he said he wanted to make an investment he was a great businessman he had good sense so he made the investment and he become a bond slave of love to Jesus Christ and what an investment that he made that's what we all need to make you say well brother M how do I make that kind of investment see to invest but a market means to put something into it see hardly let me tell you why that you have to put something in to make an investment if you ever if you ever go to the bank you know what the bank ask you if you want to buy a truck or a house the bank always says well you have to make a down payment see the reason they make you make a down payment is because if you put something into it you're less likely to walk away from it because it's yours so you put they call putting a little skin in the game so you so you put something in so see so so to invest means to put something in and when you make a a down payment you won't walk away from your investment see so so if you had an investment I wonder if I could say this this way tonight but if you had an investment that was guaranteed how much would you put into it think about it if you had a guaranteed investment what would you put in in the natural what would you put in if you knew it was guaranteed you just going to make whatever you you're going to make a 100% on your money and in 30 days how much of your money would you put into it you'd put everything if it was guaranteed see this is the way it is spiritually see in order to reap the greatest reward your reward is off of what you put in and when you put something in you get something out but even talked about our local assembly when you come to the house of God that you get out of it more than you put in it why because you're making an investment for something that you want to receive and so you go to your prayer closet and you start praying for the services and you you drive down the road and you're listening to a tape and you're and you're singing songs you're not you you get your mind off the world and you come to the house of God what you're investing in the service that you're about to go in because you want to receive something from the Lord and God is Duty bound to give you a return on your investment an't that wonderful how God is he says see so if we want to reap something friends we got a we've got an investment but Jared that you can reap the greatest reward of all which is life what can anybody are for you than life what's greater than life I mean there there there's there's all kinds of of investors you know brother Mark but that's what we're looking for we're looking for a long-term investment I'm not I'm not here for the you know they they have what in the stock market this is free but in the stock market they have what they call day Traders that's the people that go in every day they put a little money in they take it out every night they're just kind of working on the on the moves but we're not day Traders we're here for the long term and sometimes see you me tell you what a day trader will do oh boy but a day trader they'll come in and they have a bad day they'll take all their money out they'll they'll have a little bit of a a rough thing happen or maybe somebody looked at them wrong at church well I'm not going to go back there they'll just pull their investment back out maybe maybe the preacher said something they didn't like well they're a day trader so they ain't going to come back tomorrow but we ain't day Traders we we come to make a long-term investment that's why you can preach and the and the Holy Ghost can move and God can step on our toes and we can take correction because we're not here day by day we're long-term investors and we're we're looking for the that that that return of eternal life so see we these these things that happen day to day they don't affect us you're you're guess what brother Mark your car your tire can go flat and you're still a Christian tonight you the the trailer can break down brother the Joe and you're still the same believer you was you'll see you'll fix the trailer you'll Grumble about a little bit and you'll you'll lug that old broken trailer all the way to the house of God so you can worship God why because you're not a day trader you're a long-term investor that's what we are tonight but B said I'm showing you a real investment to make he said put your life and your time and your money and your talent put everything you've got in Christ God God guaranteed this to us by raising him up again we'll rise in the last days he promised it what more could you look forward to tell me any investment that you could make that would pay off like that tell me what you could invest in this morning that would make $1 million but tomorrow you'd be a corpse what good would it do you what profit the Bible says what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul says but take what we have and and use it for the kingdom of God take what we having used it for Christ and God guaranteed us and then showed us the guarantee by raising Christ from the dead that when the in the last days we'll rise with him you say brother Matt I I know I'm I'm I'm about running out of time but you know you say you say well how how do I know God will see it you realize the things that we do that God go that there Investments that we make in the kingdom of God every every time you pray for somebody every little bit you help you remember St Martin he tells his testimony of how that he went out and and he saw a beggar on the street and he said he took his coat and because it was out in the freezing cold weather and he took the coat and he cut the coat in half and he gave half of it to the beggar and covered him up with it and he went back home covered up with the other half of his coat and that night he had a dream and in the dream he said he saw that the Lord appeared to him and when the Lord appeared to him he was wearing the coat that he had taken off I thought here he was wearing this whole coat and you said well what what does it mean it meant God saw what he done and here that he showed him the the little thing that You' done for him that you done unto me brother said we ought to take that for a lesson he said whatever you do to somebody you're doing it to Christ he said remember let's you you say that together he said what you do for others you have done to Christ can we say that tonight what you do for others you have done to Christ see he sees your investment you say well that was just a little old beggar but but it was something that he done and and it maybe it was just something from his heart but God SE what he done and he rewarded him for what he done do you realize there ain't nothing you can vest that God doesn't see and that he won't reward any big thing any little thing that you do you know the Bible tells us a story of Cornelius Bible said he was a devout man of God he was a man that was uh that was that had wealth and and and but he went out the Bible said he was a a devout man and he gave much arms to the people and he prayed to God always you know you know how many people must have loved seeing seeing Cornelius come he was an old Gentile he wasn't no Holy Ghost filled man he was just a gentile come out of the out of the out of the the group of of men or centurions but but he but he but he loved the Lord and he and he prayed to God always and he would always he give to the poor and and and then and and then the Bible says but then he saw a vision and in the vision that God came to him and said the angel of the Lord came to him and when he looked on him he said Lord what would you say to me and the angel said to him your prayer and your arms have come up as a memorial before God is that something here is a man that had devoted his life and where he was a devout man and the angel of the Lord would tell him that my it wasn't it wasn't that that that everybody else saw it but the angel of the Lord said your prayer and your arms have came up as a memorial unto God my what how that how that must have felt to hear this man to know that what you have done has reached the Throne of God you know what you do it may not be a great thing it may not it may not make the papers it it may not may not be announced at every service it might not make the evening news and sometimes you may feel like like you're doing everything in vain but friends it reached the right place because everything he done it reached the Throne of God in so much that God sent an angel of the Lord down to where he was and he said I saw your investment I saw every time you gave to the poor I saw all the arms all the prayers that you made he said he's reached the Throne of God and let me tell you what God did brother Mark he gave him a reward for the investment he said Lord what would you do he said you call a man by the name of Simon Peter to your house and he has a word for you and when he called on Simon Peter Peter went to his house he remember the the Lord showed Peter a vision of how that he would he would go and take the unclean and he would gather around and eat it and Peter said I'm a Jew I'm not going to eat of an unclean thing I've never ate of an unclean thing and God said don't you call what I've clean don't you call it common or unclean but but then then a man comes in and says Peter you're called to this gentille's house and all the sudden he gets a revelation of what of what the vision meant God was calling him to be able to go speak to this Gentile so he goes down and Cornelius begins to tell him he said I I don't know why I invited you he said I just know that the angel of the Lord appeared to me and he told me that the things that I've done for God that God seen it and they've reached the Throne of God and he said that you had a word to give to me and Peter told him the only word that he knew he said I I don't know a lot but I'll just tell you this he said there was a man by the name of Jesus and he came and he walked upon these Shores and and he was taken by by the these centurions and he was he was taken into captivity and he was hung upon a cross of Calvary and he and he bled and died for the sins of man and they buried him in a tomb down there and in three days he resurrected out of the Tomb and he came and he walked among us and we saw it whenever he ascended into Glory but that wasn't the end of the story he sent the Holy Ghost back down as he promised to the Believers and the Bible said while Peter was speaking unto them that the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Gentiles in so much that they all began to Marvel and they weren't marveling that the Holy Ghost had fail they were marveling that the Gentiles had received the same thing that was promised under the Jew I thought my isn't it something it was an investment that God had offered to him and he had heard it and he took a hold of it and he invested and God gave him a return on his investment see when it reaches the Throne of God God always brings his promise let me tell you why because God is isin that something hearing all that God was doing to those people in that day in the out of the book of Acts they were out there preaching this great move of God that God would go to this little cornelius's house and in everything God was doing but he would see that one man and see everything that he done and he would bring him the promise that he had promised to the Gentile is't it something God sees your investment if the music players come I done run out of time he sees our investment Paul said it like this he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our inheritance in other words it's the down payment of of being able to receive what God has promised to us say the down payment of a Divine promise of God hear that Gentile he what an example to us that this Gentile had received the promise of God you I think I think it's something you know many people look at the things God does and little simple message little simple things that's going on sometimes but you realize that God is big enough to be God to every individual I think I think of it like this most of the time when people look at God they look at God to do great things in order to say he's God if God will move a mountain well I'll just serve him all my life I won know how many of y'all I was I was testifying to a brother the other day and we were sitting there talking about being kids and I said you know we we hear the stories of the things that that God done and how brother BR go over and and and created squirrels it wasn't so we' go create squirrels but I don't know how many of us I I don't know about y'all but I'll just admit it I don't know how many y'all ever sat in the woods as a 12-year-old boy and said let there be a 10-point buck coming out behind the that white oak tree I tried it y'all y'all y'all shake your heads but y'all may as well admit it yeah I see y'all let's I mean Lord if it worked for a prophet Lord could just be a big old 12p pointer come out behind that tree right now see but because because God is he's a god of the individual he but you know I think about these things that God does and Lord if you do that I I'll serve you all the days of my life the goofy things we do as kids you know God Winks at our ignorance but then we we we come and we we get older and we get to look at these things that God does and hear the mighty Miracles and and sometimes we get so caught up in Miracles that we in order to even believe God or have faith or grow in faith then we have to see God do the great miraculous things but you know what does something for me is that brother Travis it ain't the big things that God does that makes God bigger it's that God is so big that he can do things that don't mean nothing to nobody but you he is so big that he can do little things that God the Creator could see little things in your ordinary life that don't don't mean nothing to nobody but they mean something to you and he's that big of a god it ain't B I don't you know everybody's looking for miracles that ain't the miracle that ain't what makes God great to me what makes God great to me is he cares about the little things we do and what we give and the arms of prayers and you know the other day I was I was actually had uh was about to go on a trip and and um I had I had a little pistol that I bought from Brother Phil and I I really liked it it it fit I have small hands and it fit my hand really well and so I you know I could pack it around and I I I really enjoyed it well after you know I had it for a few months there well then I I I I misplaced it and had it in the console of my truck and went out one day it wasn't there but I kept thinking well I'll just find it and I kept looking around the house looked in the safe come looked at the church looked at my wife's truck looked in kids truck just maybe they took it whatever I but I looked everywhere and never could find it so I you know I thought well I just kept putting it off next day next day you know and well when I got ready to leave on my trip it got to really bother me and I thought you know I I don't want to go on this trip and I still hadn't found it so it got it it really started troubling me and so you know for one I don't know if you you know any of y'all have guns you like your guns you know this is this something it kind of meant something to me I liked it and and uh you you know you like you like your guns and so when you lose something like that you want it back and so you uh you brother Joe borrowed a gun from me he gets tickled at my story but uh but when you lose some something you you you want it back and so I you know I I I I got to it got bothering me and so I looked at her I couldn't find it I called my wife said you know anywhere there would be and so she she said I I don't I don't know I looked all over the house and here I was I was about to fly out this is on Sunday afternoon here I'm about to fly out and and uh but it got to bother me it it troubled my spirit I told my wife on the phone I I was telling brothers and I said you know this is this this bothers me because I you know it's something that I really I wanted but let worse than that what if somebody took it you know and and you know then then you're upset cuz somebody took your stuff you know why would they get in my truck and who would who would do a thing like that you know you just get trouble in your spirit and so I just ask can y'all pray that the Lord help me find this and here I am and and uh we we was well I was going to leave the next day and so I and brother jar was going to come over the house and and pick me up and and and so so I I I was sitting there and troubled about it and and then while I was while I was going through this I get a text message from Brother Tom Allen and brother Tom he he writes on there and he says hey just want to let you know I enjoyed that service this morning the what you preached it was really really meant a lot to me and I appreciated and something along them lines and I said well brother Tom I appreciate that that was very that was very thoughtful of you and so you know I get out there I pulled up my driveway and and uh and so I I walk out and I look and the weather's you know it's kind of cool outside and I got thinking about you know brother Tom sent that and I said you know that was nice of him to to send that and that the you know just just you know that the Lord had put on his heart or something that I'm glad it meant something to him and I look at the weather of course you know brother Tom he he he likes to play tennis and and uh he's 70 70 or he's 68 years old and and uh and so he and he likes to play tennis and so and and I I enjoy going out and visiting with him having fellowship and and so when I thought about that I looked at the weather and I thought you know uh brother Tom like to play tennis today and because he just sent that text and I look up on my shelf and there's a tennis racket bag that Salem had put on the shelf and I thought you got to be kidding me so I walked over and I took the bag off the shelf and unzipped it and there my pistol was laying there I thought you know how odd this is you know it don't mean nothing to some of y'all think I'm nuts for even telling that but you know it meant something to me and that's how big God is that he's so big that he could do something that don't mean nothing to nobody else but he would have that guy at that time when I said will yall PR please pray and Lord Lord Lord help me then this guy that very guy that would cause me to look at that this is how big God is orchestrate so many little things but let me tell you he ain't just that way for me he can do that for every one of us every day he's that big of a God what a revelation it is to catch that God is so big he can do little things he tells us to call on him no wonder we friends no wonder we can look and say that that's something I can dedicate my life to I wonder how many today if you stand to your feet say brother mat that that's something that's that's the kind of God that we serve and I I want to I want to give everything that I have to him I want to give all my worship I want to give my life I want to give my my my ambitions everything that I do I I want to dedicate it to the work or the cause of Jesus Christ isn't that our prayer Lord that you would receive us Lord that receive what we have to offer we may not have a lot to give but what we do have Lord we just want to give it unto thee I believe he'll return it friends I can't think of anything that you could give that would be Vindicated like that but what a policy that he's offered give your life to Jesus Christ not just say I want to serve him but but serve him serve him day to day and let our walk be to to be pleasing unto him let him use your lips when you speak to other people let him use you to testify it won't go wasted there's no testimony you'll ever share that won't be returned there's nothing you'll ever give that God wouldn't return he sees what we do amen do you believe that let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord how privileged that we are Lord God just to think of the things that you've done for us and Lord your that your hand is is so displayed in our life and God the mighty things that are done Lord maybe people look on the outside and say well that ain't nothing Lord that's what makes you great Lord we are so thankful for everything you've done for us Lord and God we come today as a body of Believers Lord in the in the presence of in your presence Lord we just feel the feel your spirit moving through this building God

would receive what we have and Lord that that would be such a great return Lord maybe there's somebody that's watching this service Lord and God that would have something in their heart Lord they've been holding back and knowing that they need to make a a real commitment to serve you and maybe they've been caught out in the wilderness a few times few days or months or years but Lord I pray that you would help them tonight God that they could turn and they could surrender their life wholly to you Lord the empty places in their heart the place where the devil once lived would be open to you
