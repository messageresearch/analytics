topical ointment that we can put on ourselves it's his righteousness that he has already given us that he created us from before the foundation of the world it's it's just wonderful to come to that realization that we have access to that Throne of mercy and Grace welcome to the house of the Lord once again on a Sunday we have a few prayer requests this morning but before we mournfully bring prayer requests before the throne of grace which so many times we do I want to bring some prayer requests that were answered maybe sometimes I think we just need to remember that we don't just flippantly put out a request and hope that it's a message in the bottle and some strange land someone's going to find it that maybe God would just somehow happen chats hear our prayers but he answers our prayers every single time just out of recent history sister jarmaine blessed be the name of the Lord thank you for answering her our prayers for her brother Gabriel thank you for answering our

brother Joe's way sister Becky sister Shelley sister Taryn sister Emily we can we can list off Everyone by name for the the limitation of the people Brother John sister Grace brother Andrew brother Emanuel that's the congregation today in person welcome everyone else who is tuned in streaming trust that something will happen today we'll just start reading with verse one in Saint John chapter one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father once again we're just so thankful for this word that you've given us Lord we're so thankful for the word that you've given us that Lord isn't just a word it's not just in print in books in text but it's a Living Word father it's a light and and it's a life it's a living breathing life and father we just thank you that this word just comes to life every single time it's on the lips of a son and daughter of God any one of those people that we just read about that chooses to believe upon you to them give you power to become the sons of God father this morning my prayer is that each and every one of us Lord could just come to that full realization about being a son or a daughter of God because Lord we believe on you if there's anybody listening today Lord Jesus that doesn't have that Revelation that just doesn't really believe upon you I pray we pray to this morning Lord that you would just open the eyes of their understanding that father you would just take away all of the unbelief and just allow them to believe in the name of Jesus Christ we just ask that you had blessed the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you you may be seated this morning it's just a wonderful thing to serve the Living God and it's difficult to know that we serve the Living God and to see what the devil does continuously as we were on our way here we were talking about how the devil has just ravaged the world how this truly is Satan's Eden and outside of this word there really is no hope to look at all of the things that are going on around we've got more technology and more ability and more means more more and more but less and less word less and less encouragement to the things of God but for those people who who actually have been called from before the foundation of the world to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that just believe on his name isn't it wonderful to think about how as he Bears witness as John Bear's witness he says name not names it's not father Son and Holy Ghost it's not titles it's it's name but anyways we can just get going on a tangent and I apologize this morning I just want to take a little time and talk about this light and and I would like to talk about being sent verse 8 he was not that light John was not that light John the Baptist was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light and we know that there's a very specific anointing with John the Baptist ministry and so I'm sure that we can all just take that and do a complete comparison a parallel with William Branham today and I just want to throw this out there if anybody's listening that maybe doesn't have the understanding of a prophet and maybe if we hear that word Prophet it makes us get a little bit nervous and and a little bit unsure because of all of the different uh fanaticism around the world that we've been able to witness why is it that that there is that fear it's because there's been doctrines of devils there's been people who have gone fanatical but the reason for it is is because they are not the true but the only way that they could do that and impersonate is that there would be a true and there would be a purpose for a prophet so imagine if we could just step back for a second many people can watch Hollywood movies and completely suspend their their cognitive thinking and allow themselves to enter into a fantasy world and just become one with it and allow the movie to just take them wherever the movie directors would allow it to go and we know we could go down a long road with that and I don't want to most if not all of it from Hollywood is from the pit of Hell and we don't want to try and and propagate that but I just want to say it this way if we can be as an unbeliever looking at the message of the hour and to hear a minister or anybody say prophet of our day and have us get weird about it just maybe try and suspend your your your cognitive thinking as you would normally with a Hollywood movie and just see if God sent a prophet to this world in this day would you want to hear what that Prophet had to say because what is a prophet a prophet is a messenger someone that has a message and you know if we break it down the word profit can mean preacher so it could just be a preacher but if there was a prophet which there was I'm not asking whether there was I know there was it's been made very Crystal Clear real to me that there was a prophet sent to this age God sent a prophet but it means more to us than that some people will just say that's enough God sent a prophet it's good I believe that that settles it but that's not why God said a prophet if that's all it is then we need a little a little checking up to do with our our our experience but if God sent a prophet to the world in any age we could step back and look at Noah's age if we are in that in that state of of of of mystery and and maybe the the the storytelling part if we just looked at Noah's day if God sent a prophet Noah and sent a message to Noah to build an ark wouldn't we want to know that message and Noah's day fast forward to our day if God sent a prophet to our day would we not want to hear what that Prophet had to say goodness sakes I I just can't get over that it's so important for us to just at least take a look at it and see if God sent a prophet what would that Prophet say to this age what would he do I could tell you what he would do and I know I'm preaching to the choir so bear with me but he would simply point to this that's all he would do his point to this he wouldn't come out with a new book he wouldn't come out with a new interpretation of an old book he wouldn't add to it and he wouldn't take away from it and he would say that if if you have any question about what I have to say in this day don't take my word for it take his word for it but just to just to go back and take a quick look here just to set a little bit of a background in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God he just takes the time to really just lay the foundation to go right back to Genesis right here and and we've gone over that a little bit and and we know what happened in the Book of Genesis in in the beginning it was God speaking into creation and God had a plan from before the foundation of the world and many times we we look at these things in our lives today and and we wonder why why do we have to experience such pain sometimes we look at other people's lives sometimes we experience it in our own lives tremendous pain pain that it feels like we'll never be able to get over or get through but remember his word said that he will always provide us a way of Escape he won't take the pain away from us but he'll take us through it he'll bring us through it out to the other side the reason that we experience all of this the reason that we're going through all of this is that God in the beginning he created a bride in the garden and and he wanted to express himself remember brother Branham said it very clearly that he wanted to express himself to his children he wanted Fellowship he wanted a family Christ is the mystery of God revealed go go back and listen to it it explains it real good he had a threefold purpose but he wanted to express himself he wanted a family he wanted to have fellowship and so what did he do he created man in his own image and male and female created he them and and both of them were in one being in a spirit being and then he created man formed Man Out of the Dust of the Earth but they were both still male and female I don't want to get too far into that but what what I'm getting at is there was a time where God's plan started to unfold and where it started to unfold was I guess in in the creation of everything but for our day to look at the transgression and all the problems that we have there was a transgression of God's law and that's where it started to happen that's where the law of the contrast started to become visible in Genesis Chapter 3 The transgression and the curse we know that the serpent beguiled Eve and the serpent beguiled Eve with one word not a theological study or or a theological handbook but one word thou shalt not surely die one word and she was beguiled but it was an atom that was beguiled in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 14 and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now we're not saying that to actually say well throw off on women some might say they're the weaker vessel that's what the word says but we're not getting into that today I'll just leave that as a hanger and uh all the married folk out there can have a discussion on the way home but we know that Adam wasn't in the transgression even though he was because Adam chose his wife Adam chose to follow his wife and because of that the entire curse started to unfold and the plan of God because God didn't just come down into the garden remember he didn't come down into the Garden of Eden after the sin happened after the transgression happened after the the the the the not eating of the fruit happened God came down into the garden when they were hiding themselves because suddenly they knew they were naked what difference would it make just out of curiosity what difference would it make if you had an apple if you were naked and you didn't know that you were naked what what difference would it make it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever they never ate an apple it wasn't fruit they ate in the garden but God came down into the garden the cool of evening to fellowship with them which he he wanted to do every single day and he didn't run around in the garden ringing his hand saying Adam Adam where are you I can't see you you're not visible to me anymore then Adam come out and and being covered in in fig leaves and aprons that they sowed together it wasn't like that he came down and said Adam what's up what on Earth have you done Adam where are you because I know you're in the transgression and you're no longer where you stood before me in perfect health now you've fallen in sin you've chosen to take that step but he knew that he would we know that in Genesis chapter 4. says that she conceived and I just want to talk about this light and this is really the comparison that I'm getting at but I I just wanted to set that background that she was in the garden they transgressed they actually came out of the garden she actually conceived again and she bear another son remember that scripture Genesis chapter 4 and then she says I have gotten a man from the Lord but that was Kane she said it about how could that be Cain was of his father the evil one I don't want to get into that discussion too far this morning but I just want to bring that out to highlight it there's there's a purpose for that the reason why it was written that way and brother Brandon brings it out very clearly that there's only one way that a human being is born is because life is given to that person and there's only one form of life she said that I've gotten a man from the Lord first John or John sorry not first John John 1 verse 9. that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world speaking about life the only way there is life is because of God because remember at the beginning in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made there's no human being made on this Earth that's not made by God not at all that's why it's so amazing when you look at what brother Branham says about babies all babies go to heaven and if you look at it maybe sometime I don't know one of the brothers if you feel inspired to uh or maybe Lord willing I'll do it if you look at the whole abortion debate it's a sensitive touchy issue boy and the only reason it is is because it's Satan's Eden but if you look at it it's for a purpose and uh yeah I'll just stop there I won't get into it too far but there's only one form of life that's given on this Earth and it comes from God you know that she was given a man and though it was from two different fathers two two boys two different Spirits one was of his father Adam and the other was of his father the devil the Natural Life that we see there it types the spiritual we know that and you know the point that I'm making with this part here in particular is that there's no eternal hell there's no eternal whatsoever outside of Zoe God's own life the only thing that's eternal is life there's no Eternal death there is an eternal separation from God but it's just that's what it is it's a separation this morning I want to get into just setting the background of of of the Gospel of John and and talking about this we're probably going to be here for a little while not today but in the future just just the life the light that was given sent into the world and that there was a man that was sent to Bear witness of it and and here we go talking about now many different different stories of of lives that were sent lives that were sent to Bear witness of that light of that life the only form of eternal life turn with me over to Acts chapter 8. Acts chapter 8. just going to focus on on this probably for the majority this morning um you know what maybe we'll just read it just for bear with me for a second yeah we might as well just start with verse one Acts chapter eight and Saul was consenting unto his death who are talking about Stephen and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles and devout man carried Stephen to his burial and made great lemon lamentation over him as for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word this is what I want to get to then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that City but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same same city use sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God looking at that is just amazing to think that people would regard a person to be the great power of God it's no different today there's people out there that look at men and exalt them to that level and it's up to those people whether they're willing to actually consent to that behavior or whether they will be like the prophet for our day that said if that's what you're going to do you're going to make me an antichrist and I'll take myself off the field until you stop it but this guy here they viewed him as the great power of God verse 11. and to him they had regard because of that long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed Philip when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done just gonna pause there at verse 13. it's interesting to look at this now this man who had Bewitched the people saw the power of God for real and decided I want to get baptized I want to become a part of this I'm used to having this kind of power but now I can see there is another Power and I I I should be a part of that I want to be a part of that I want to partake of that power and so he went through the motions he went through the steps he went to the meetings and and he got baptized but we know we'll read on a little bit here it doesn't mean anything because we've been baptized and the reason for it is is the purpose in his heart the reason he wanted to get baptized was not right we can just go on and read here verse verse 14 now when the apostles which read Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John so now it's getting serious they're seeing the move of God they're having great Miracles and and great meetings a great campaign going on the the kingdom of God is really starting to push forward so they're they're sending in the big guns verse 15 who went who sorry who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus sometimes we can get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and not see any results well we've heard it said many times we can go down wet sinner and come up go down dry sorry and come up wet be the same person and not have a change and what's the reason for it we'll get to it here but it's what's in our heart it's what's in the person's heart we can Bluff ourselves and we can Bluff other people but we can't Bluff God or Satan they're both waiting to see whose side we're going to choose and and it can't be a wishy-washy choice it's got to be all in but when it is all in I can I can testify to this when it is all in when the desire changes that's when you get the Holy Ghost it's not because you go down in water you can get the Holy Ghost before you actually get baptized with water but you will get baptized in water if you get the Holy Ghost you won't say no it's good I don't need to do it because it's a scriptural uh ordinance verse 15 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus they had great meetings they're having a great time they still hadn't seen the Holy Ghost yet verse 17 then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and when Simon saw through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost so isn't it interesting because what he's asking for is exactly what they did he's not asking for something outside of what they did it's exactly what they did but his motive is wrong you know brother Branham tells that story about that woman that says I'm ready to go down there and get dunked I want to dunk me today and he said you're not you're not ready you're you're nowhere near the condition that you need to be to approach that ordinance of the scripture we have got to have the right Spirit we've got to have the right heart if we're going to get baptized if we want to see the right results otherwise why would we get baptized if we don't want the Holy Ghost if we don't want to see that results in our life it just doesn't make any sense we wouldn't want to do it he said give me that Holy Ghost that that that that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost verse 20 but Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou Hast that thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor lot on this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive that thou art in in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity he just totally discerns him there and says you know you've got some work to do you're still just a little bit too carnal for this then answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord return to Jerusalem and preach the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans it's just amazing to see this this this chapter in in Acts and and we're all familiar with it I'm sure but the second part is really what I want to get to but it's important to underscore the first part we have to have our right motive and right objective if we're going to come before God to receive anything of him we can't expect to see anything of God if we come to him with any other thought in our heart any little bit of reservation but you know what gives us the ability today to have access to that throne I can't believe that I I sound this way now I wondered if I ever would and I'm I'm so here I can tell you what the only way that we'll ever have access to his throne today truly is through the message of the hour without the message of the hour we are false Pretenders if we don't receive the message that God's Prophet sent to the Earth in our generation then we have missed the mark we'll be just like all of the other people in this world in Noah's day who didn't get into the boat what happened to all of them somebody probably had some some some custom Yachts made they probably had some of the greatest technology some of the fastest strongest engines built in those boats but did they save them there was only one boat that was to save them and that was in God's provided plan and the same thing for today it's got to be according to God's provided plan according to the message of the hour that was sent through a Vindicated prophet and you know if you take a look at William Miriam Branham it sounds like I'm fighting this and and I don't know I just feel led to go this way just bear with me but if there's people that don't believe William Mary and Bradham could be a prophet of God if you can't believe his his words then look at his Works look at what happened in his ministry there's no man that ever lived that had a Ministry like his that went around the world seven times God vindicating his word and his man how does God vindicate his word he brings it to pass and we know there was a scripture that said that there has to be a prophet in this age there had to be a scripture fulfilled only half of it was read out of Isaiah when Jesus sat down in the temple but there had to be another part before the great and terrible day of the Lord when Philip was sent to Samaria remember they had all heard about the Messiah all of them did and I'm saying this specifically about Samaria because of the woman at the well he went up there for one purpose and that was to set one woman's heart on fire to set her soul on fire so that she would go and just tell everyone just noise it abroad in the city come and see a man who's told me the things that I have done he went by the way of Samaria so that he could do that they all heard about the Messiah so when they started to come around again and started to see this Behavior the sorcerer had always been a part of it they're all used to that but when they started to see the power of God Christ Jesus being preached in power and demonstration God vindicating his word through his men it caused them to pay attention to take notice but it was right then that Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the church but Philip he was sent down there he had a campaign to take on and you know I just love it because it was while he preached Christ unto them that the unclean spirits rose up the unclean spirits they cried with a loud voice they couldn't handle hearing the word of God being preached they couldn't handle seeing that light that light before them that we read in John and many devils devil possessed people were delivered just at the preaching of the word but many of them they had hands laid on them and the devil scrammed out of them but many were healed but it was here that he met Simon the Sorcerer in our our reading this morning we read that he met the sorcerer who had great power and great Authority by all the people they said that this man was the power of God didn't say that he had the power of God that he was the power of God what a position to have in the eyes of the people but he Bewitched the people you know God had to straighten this out just like he always straightens out the air he'll never let us go down the road in error if we are Sons and Daughters of God he'll never let his children just go down by the wayside and never hear the truth preached in love he'll make sure that everyone gets the opportunity to hear the word for their day and how does he do it he uses men he uses a man just like he uses a prophet and who is a prophet he's a man if you ever want to check a prophet someone who claims to be a prophet someone who would say that man's a prophet see what he talks about does he have some sort of weird little ISM that he mixes in with the word then you know just leave it alone you don't have to be afraid of it but what if he doesn't mix anything with the word what if he just presents the pure word then we're forced to make a decision to say wow did God actually send a prophet because the only thing he's saying is what his word says and that's the only thing a prophet will say he won't add to it and he won't take away from it but he'll send his men and his men will go and preach the truth and that's what happens in a message Church message Ministry they preach the truth they preach the message of the hour they preach the present truth the word for our day the only Escape that we have he always straightens out his error with men so Philip he begins to preach down there and as he's preaching Simon he starts to see that hold on a second the people are starting to maybe not be as interested in my Ministry and and they're looking at this other ministry that's coming along and and how can that be but it was and God Did It for a purpose so that the world could see the truth everyone was used to following a Vindicated man someone who bewitches people and and causes things to happen and we know that there's probably many signs and wonders in his ministry in the sorcerer's Ministry we don't ever want to doubt that for a second we know that in Egypt pharaohs magicians had the power to do stuff and even when Moses came and did his thing then our Prophet said you know as cheap magicians trick to destroy your stick down and turn it into a snake our guys can do that and he calls Janice and jambres and they throw down their sticks and they did the same thing that's the word that's not even what brother Bradham said but brother Branham did say it was a cheap magician's trick what I'm saying is there's things that men can do through the wrong Avenue and it's not men doing it it's Satan operating through the men brother Bradham did say that Satan can impersonate any gift of God and that's why we don't want to look at initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues we don't want to look at any gift in fact even the raising of the Dead even even anything any gift that we can think of put those aside let's talk about the word let's see if that word Falls in line with what the prophet said let's see with what the prophet says Falls in line with that word because seek ye first the kingdom of God if we can see the word ahead of us first and make the word our priority our Paramount action everything else will follow all of the gifts will follow us we're not seeking signs and wonders isn't it amazing to think though that this whole world looks after signs and wonders to see great miracles happen it's tremendous to see great miracles happen I know I've witnessed one or two it's tremendous to see great miracles happen but it's more humbling when you step back and think I have the ability to how do I have the ability to believe how do I have the ability to believe why was that the theme song for the prophet in this age only belief not not only do not not only raised from the dead or only speak in tongues or only have any of these gifts in our lives no it was only believe because that's the most fascinating thing that's the most difficult thing there is to do today is to hold our head above the fanaticism that's risen up around the message of the hour because if Satan wants to do one thing he wants to try and pervert as much of the message of the hour as he can but you know what Satan you'll never ever pervert the message of the hour you might pervert people that try and pretend to be a part of the message of the hour but the only reason that can happen is because they just don't have the message of the hour in them they're just trying to be a part of the message of the hour just like Simon wanted to be a part of the message of the hour but God sent Philip his way A man filled with the Holy Ghost and reinforcements to come and participate in the services and to straighten them out in his Doctrine to say no you're just not ready for this this is not for you but you know what we can do we can actually pray for you and trust that the Lord will actually open your eyes and that you'll repent from the sin that is actually manifesting in your life that you might be able to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and not be eternally separated from God but they were able to have a real good service and and to straighten them out according to the word for their day you know Simon learned that there was a more excellent way and he believed and was baptized but that doesn't mean anything we need to make sure our motive and objective is correct but I think it's interesting and and I'm not sure but in in in in the message if brother Branham talks further about him but in the end of this he says verse 24 then answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me pray for me because I don't want to be in this condition I don't want to remain here did the Lord save him I don't know maybe brother Bradham elaborates on this further and I'd like to maybe have discussion about it or whatever but I'm not sure if if we hear more about Simon the Sorcerer And if if he did actually have that prayer answered you know it's important to remember that God always sends a message he always sends a message in every single age he has set Messengers seven Church ages seven candlesticks seven spirits of God all of that I don't want to get too deep today I'm just going to maybe stay a little bit on the surface and forgive me for it but I just feel led to go this way but except they be sent when someone comes on their own accord look out usually they've got an agenda usually there's something going on in their life but when God sends someone that's where we need to perk up that's where we need to pay attention that's where we need to tune in and say hold on a second I need to listen to this because does it line up with the word and you know if we never read the word how will we ever know whether it's true listen to the message of the hour how will we ever know what we hear is true or false when we hear a minister get up on on on on on mainstream television what is it God TV or or Daystar programming or whatever it is they have when a man gets up there and starts to quote the message of the hour where did that inspiration come from and I believe it with all my heart I'm sure we all do as well that if God sent a prophet then it would behoove us to say that's what the prophet said that's the message from God through the prophet of this day but many times men will like to just pick and choose and take some of this really interesting stuff and make it the latest and the greatest for them to pull out of their pocket and and and plagued your eyes I'll say if it's possible to plagiarize the word of God they do it and the reason they do it is so that they can actually get money you know brother Bradham said that men will be affected by one of three things right women popularity or money and I know it for sure that any ministry that's on TV money is a very big part of it a very very big part of it another part of it is popularity and the one that usually brings them to their knees is women it's kind of interesting how they all go together and how the prophet was saying that for like another age decades before but I remember in my age seeing at least a few great Ministries on television who are afflicted by all of those that's just a total sideline that's weird I just trust the Lord is working here you know except they be sent it's not really worth much you don't want to hear my opinion you don't want to hear some man's opinion out there you don't want to hear someone plagiarize the prophet of God and just make it their own thing you want to know that that's fresh word from God through a prophet in Romans 10 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved that scripture alone is just tremendous if there's anybody that just needs a little bit of Hope today if you just call upon the name of the Lord you'll be saved that's all we need to do that's our Avenue to get into the boat how then shall they call on him who they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they hear without a prophet how would we hear if we look at all of the ages and how many Loose Ends how twisted it up all of the world has become throughout all the ages all the ministry all the men rising up and trying to make something of themselves Satan just weaving in and out having a field day with the religion of this world unless God sent a prophet to to to actually show us the true form of water baptism the true Avenue to get the Holy Ghost in our lives where would we be how would we understand the message of the hour if we didn't have the Holy Ghost in our lives we wouldn't we would just come to the place where we would be an associate member of the message of the hour and that Association card will burn up on that day when all the elements Melt With A ferv and Heat and that's not enough to save us the only thing that will save us is the token that blood sacrifice on the lentils on the doorposts of our home which is our heart and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things not judgment not a Ministry of fear unless you actually hear what brother Barry has to say you're going to burn in hell how many Ministries are out there like that unless you believe it the way that I present it to you you're not going to make it and even around the message of the hour unless you believe that Revelations 10 7 has actually happened my way you're not going to make it is terrible but remember it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected not just the elected the very elected if it were possible but when we have the Holy Ghost because we've been given the true formula of water baptism to receive the true baptism of the Holy Spirit we won't be deceived brothers and sisters we cannot be deceived because if we're deceived and that means God's deceived and if God's deceived he's not God and we're all lost it's amazing to look at it not one of us will be lost with the Holy Ghost now brother Bradham says that I know that every we can have the Holy Ghost every hour of our lives and still go to hell and we can but remember I should have brought that chart I'm going to bring that one of these days and we'll just have it um if you can just draw the circle we're all familiar with it body spirit and then Soul right in the middle the world says Body Soul Spirit brother Branham says Body Soul spirit but if you take a look at it it's actually Body Spirit and soul the soul is on the inside of the inside right you can have the Holy Ghost anointing on your body the outside Circle you can have the Holy Ghost anointing on the inside Circle of your spirit you can have great signs and wonders in your life every hour of your life but if you don't have the Holy Ghost on the inside Circle the inside of the inside that tiny little place that brother Branham talked about in the heart of a human being the Throne of God The Mercy Seat the temple of God not made by hands if we don't have the Holy Ghost right there in that place where it's supposed to be then we can go to hell that's why brothers and sisters it's so important for us to make sure that we understand that we need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins out of true repentance repent first and then be baptized so that we can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we don't want to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost sometimes I think it can be that we want to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so we could act like Simon the Sorcerer And I've got power I've got a great ministry look at all the things that happens around me all the prayers get answered when I pray no way if that's what we're looking for we're mistaken we want the Holy Ghost so we go to heaven we want the Holy Ghost so we take our Heavenly flight we go on the rapture we want the Holy Ghost so that when we go into the graveyard that that will get us out otherwise we're going to remain there we want that Blessed Assurance we're not interested in having Earthly Goods this isn't about having a great business I'm not interested in seeing great manifestations it's not about that all of that stuff follows it does follow but if we put him first if we do have the right motive and objective then we won't come before the throne scared will have the ability to come boldly Before the Throne because we know we have a pure heart and you know what saves us is the fact that we believe the fact that we're willing to just believe that's what saves us it's not nothing we can do no way let's go on and read a little more in uh in Acts chapter 8. start with verse 25. so we've had the the great campaign in Samaria where they all knew about Messiah and and Philip was there and and then the great other ministers came Peter and John came to them and and they had this tremendous uh healing campaign down there and and filling of the Holy Ghost just a a real mighty move of the Lord but then it changes a little bit right in the midst of all of this I just love this part in verse 25 and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preach the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia eunuch of great Authority Under Candace queen of Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his Chariot reading azaias the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and Philip ran hither to him and heard him read the prophet isaiahs and said unto said understand us thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept some man should guide me and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him and the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his sheer so he opened not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and Whom Shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the Earth and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee I just love this I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized so I just want to stop there if you could imagine going back to the prophet Isaias how much scripture did Philip expound to him on all the way up to water baptism because the eunuch never had any idea about water baptism here but he's he must have preached up a storm he must have covered a lot of ground in a fairly short period of time but he had the desire to get baptized this man is is sort of the different example that I wanted to get to this man had the desire for the right reasons according to the scripture he saw there was a promise for him and he knew that he could receive it it became real to him it was a revelation we'll just carry on here and they went on their way verse 36 and came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what does hinder mean to be baptized note that it was the eunuch that said that it wasn't Philip the eunuch he desired to be baptized and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and he that commanded the Chariot and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing but Philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea I feel like there's a whole entire sermon right here just in these last two verses to think about it though the eunuch he had the desire to be baptized for the right reason he wasn't looking for gain he wasn't looking for a Ministry he had a revelation in his heart that there was a scripture in this this scripture it meant something something was speaking to him out of this scripture and and what was it and how would he know unless God sent him a preacher but here we have God the angel of the Lord comes down and says you know what in the midst of all of your all of your Humanity having this great healing campaign and the spirit of God moving and and and the tremendous sermons that are being preached I want you to leave I want you to just leave I want you to follow my instructions and I want you to go all the way out into the desert for one person can you imagine that today brother Bradham brings it out real good in the message and he talks about in a few different places about what it meant to actually just leave the great campaign they've paid for all the building they've paid for all of the stuff to go and and be there for for Philip to be there maybe as the headline preacher they've they've invested a lot of time and money and here now this man of God says I I've got to go I'm being told to leave you have to just carry on without me but you know if if the other people there had the Holy Ghost which they did they don't need Philip I said Peter sorry they didn't need Philip to stay there Philip could simply go and and he did he was sent by the Lord and he followed the instruction of the Lord for one man just one man he wasn't even a Jew he was a gentile but he went for just one man imagine that and when they were come up out of the water he baptized them right and when he came up out of the water what happened but the Branham talks about it and uh it is the rising of the Sun that quickening power struck him in such a way that it whisked him 150 miles away brother Branham says just took them completely teleported him translated him to a different place geographically in time from one place to the other place and what did he do he had so much of that quickening power he just kept right on preaching his way through he didn't stop what did the eunuch do it doesn't say that the eunuch got the Holy Ghost does it just says that that quickening power took Philip out of the way took him to another place but brothers and sisters you can imagine someone with the right motive and objective having the right motive and objective what happened because he had the right motive and objective God heard His Thoughts God heard one of his Gentiles Sons saying I long to see this this this passage I long to understand what this means because there's something real significant here and because he had that desire in his heart which God put there from before the foundation of the world because he had this desire in his heart God sent him the preacher God delivered to him the need that he had in his heart and brothers and sisters it's no accident when we have the ability to see God speak to us we have the ability to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's no accident it is the power of almighty God speaking to us saying you know what it's time for you to come up hither we talked about that that doorway open in heaven in Revelations chapter 4 John had been given all of the instruction about the laodicean church age and all the different Church Ages Every Church age there was he was given all that information and and told to just take note and write it because it's got to be delivered into the future but then after all these things he looked and behold the door opened in heaven and that same voice spoke to him saying come up a little higher every single one of us when we get the desire when we get that Revelation in our hearts that we need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's an invitation to come up a little higher and it's not us going into heaven in a Rapture although that's the end result of it one way or the other it's an opportunity to realize the word of God for ourselves just like God sent to that eunuch a minister because he had that desire in his heart he wanted to learn more he knew there was more there but how could he understand it but here he is just doing his thing going his way not knowing even where to go or who to talk to but just being himself and suddenly a man just runs up to him could you imagine that being that way in your car in traffic and suddenly some man just runs up to you and says what you doing what's your reading I can hear that you're saying something that's familiar to me and I've got something that I want to tell you would you open your door and say jump in just jump in the car I got some stuff we can go for a ride and you can explain it to me and as we go we'll Fellowship around the word it's pretty amazing to see because that's what happened in his day and it could easily have been a bad guy could easily have been a robber but something spoke to him and said that's your answer just choosy this day whom you'll serve and see if the Lord won't actually reveal it to you Philip he was sent to Samaria it's just amazing to think that that angel sent him and brothers and sisters just to fast forward it today to our lives there was an angel that was sent to us to Bear witness of that light to Bear witness of that life that was from the beginning in God that was God there was something sent to us out of the Easter seal in 1965. Brother Brad I'm talking about this story notice quickly now look at Philip down there and a great Revival having a Revival where it had been darest for any man why if he'd had got a big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there was having a great Revival and the quickening power of God spoke to him and said Stephen this is Brother Brandon's words I'm just reading it verbatim he may messed up the word too he said Stephen maybe it said this you're having a great Revival but I've got one man I want you to talk to and Stephen's obedient no matter what it is how much criticism oh Stephen you can't leave people would say the prophet never made a mistake right Stephen was dead Stephen was stoned the beginning of this chapter they explained they had a great lamentation and they buried him some people would say that the prophet never made a mistake he was a man but when he said thus saith the Lord look out and Stephen's obedient no matter what it is how much criticism oh Stephen you can't leave but I can God said so and he went out into the desert and out there he found this eunuch and what happened he said has uh if if thou believest with all thine heart that Jesus is the son of God I'll baptize you and when he baptized him look he was quickened by this quickening power to leave a Revival of thousands of people to go out into the desert to one man oh that'd be against all reasons see why there's ten thousand waiting here but there's one waiting out there see and the quickening power sent him to God's provided place Hallelujah just brings to mind the story of the pool of Bethesda where they had the the churning of the waters and the man that sat there for how long was it 38 years he sat there and every time the water stirred the angel of the lord it's a thing the angel of the Lord would stir the waters once a year and every time the water stirred if you could get into the waters first you'd be healed because you got in there just in time and this man sitting there one day Jesus God Elohim that light that life eternal life took a stroll through all the people in the pool of Bethesda but he only stopped at one person brothers and sisters that has become so clear and so real to me think about it if you can look at this world and see the millions and billions of people seven point what is it eight billion people today on Earth God if you have the ability to hear his voice God who is rich in Mercy coming around walking through all the billions of people and all of them don't matter even though they do but what he's looking for is the precious fruit of the earth that one or two predestinated seeds from before the foundation of the world those are the ones that he's after those are the ones he's wanting to speak to those are the ones who are example of the eunuch where he will send a minister to bring the true word to bring the true life this morning if you're hearing this message being spoken I would strongly consider it if you haven't heard it before God maybe is calling you from before the foundation of the world to take a look at what his Prophet had to say to this age I don't want to preaching to the choir but I believe there's people tuned in that maybe just don't have the same level of revelation they might not just have the understanding we need to make sure that we're willing to just step back and just forget about all of our reasoning and all of our tradition and all of our teaching and everything that we think that we know and just say wait a second if God truly I think I could say this to anybody in the whole entire world for the most part there's some people that just don't believe in God and that's that you would never say it to them but for the most part most people in this world believe that there is some form of a God and if there is some form of a God and he had some form of a message that he wanted to get through to human beings wouldn't you want to hear it there's people that have more of a desire to hear from a stupid alien some sort of different kind of Life out there than they are willing to hear from the God who created this entire universe then they're saying only believe just believe that there's aliens that there's another life for what purpose but we've been given the keys to the kingdom we've been given eternal life because he chose us in him before the foundation of the world in John chapter 20 verse 21 then said Jesus to them peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and it's no different for us brothers and sisters because we know that it was there that he said to them receive Thee the Holy Ghost and they had to go to Jerusalem they had to go through the motions they had to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Bradham even says that his mother Mary she was one of the 120 in the upper room they all had to come exactly the same way there's no exemptions every one of us has to die out to ourselves and and and come according to the word for our day but when we do that we're given the ability to receive the Holy Ghost and many times I think it can be so easy to just just make it a common thing and and to say the Holy Ghost it's like a buzzword brothers and sisters the prophet for our day said very very few will go on to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our day very few people if you look at one in a million what brother Branham preached one in a million two million people come out of Egypt how many people went into the promised land which is a type of the Holy Ghost so if there's seven billion people I don't know what that percentage is I don't even want to try and pretend it because I'm probably not that smart on the Fly but brothers and sisters it's not very many people because if you look at it how many people out of those seven point whatever billion people believe the message of the hour how many people in that group of people would be one out of a million because that's what it is it's the smallest minute amount of people brother Bradham says it he says people will say oh but isn't there isn't there millions of people over there and he says yeah out of every single age not just from one age there's people in this world that are looking for the great cataclysm to happen where this this this this this great climax happens and Planes Trains and Automobiles crash and volcanoes erupt and and and whatever else happens and and everybody looks around and says oh it's the Rapture of the church that's not what William Branham preached that's not what the prophet for our day said he said it's going to be the secret sudden going away of the Bride it's going to be as a thief in the night according to the scripture he said there will be 500 people that'll go missing and the twinkling of an eye and the world won't even know won't even miss a Beat we need to make sure that we have the Holy Ghost in our lives for the right reasons and that reason is so that we can go back to God because we come from God not because we're looking for a campaign not because we're looking for an increase in our pay not because we're looking for a better house not because we're looking for Better Health not because all of the all the things in this world we just want to partake of it no none of it the only reason is so that we can have eternal life truly have eternal life getting into this cricketing power notice how once the Holy Ghost came on that eunuch that Philip was translated when he was baptized Philip already had that power but once he had completed his Commission he was translated remember the prophet said that once the bride gets that Revelation once the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go once we're willing to be sent and not not have reservation not be held back when we're willing to actually just preach the gospel in love we're willing to just reach out to those people around us and say have you have you got any hope for your Eternal hereafter do you do you understand what's going to happen and if people say something to you then hey you know what the only thing you can do is present the truth the only thing we can do is present the life that light that Supernatural light where there's just a tiny teeny little sliver of it in this age and you and I brothers and sisters are that light we are the living witness representation of that light of that life but that quickening power it just translated his body just changed his body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and it's awesome because what did the eunuch do the eunuch didn't get excited and wonder where he was he just went on Happily is what the word says and that's what we need to do brothers and sisters just go on Happily you know one day Peter he was sent to Cornelius in Acts chapter 10. verse 44 and Peter yet spake these words and the Holy Ghost fell on all of them which heard it that's what I'm talking about brothers and sisters the preaching of the word the speaking of the word while ye yet speak these words the Holy Ghost just falls upon people and they of the circumcision the Jews which believed they were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost can you believe it we better believe it that's the only thing we can do is just believe it only believe all things are possible verse 46 for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can a man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and remember they hadn't been baptized yet but the word just said at the speaking of his words they received the Holy Ghost and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to just tarry a few certain days God is sovereign and he will operate exactly how he'll operate but we will when we receive the word we will operate exactly the way God says in his word and his word says to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and if you do you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when you don't know it could be before it could be during it could be after but if we come according to the right formula it's going to happen all we have to do is believe all we have to do is do our part all we have to do is realize there is a message sent for us in our day and if we're willing to just follow that message and just see what happens God will bless us you know in what is the attraction on the mount now I'm going to change gears with it again we'll get into some some some Revelation here what is the strange thing that happened in 1963 we've talked about it so many times but it's just becoming more and more and more profound to me and I'm probably just going to harp on it more and more and more what is this strange thing brother Bradham says that happened on the mount in 1963 this is out of what is the attraction on the mount strongly recommend listening to it really he just takes the time to say there's so many strange things that happened in in the scriptures what is the attraction what is the attraction what is the attraction so many times so many different ways but just to narrow it right down for time's sake what's the attraction with William Miriam Branham what happened in 1963 he says what is the attraction on the mount what's this strange thing upon sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest what is that attraction on the mountain he says in the other day standing there turn the picture to the right we posted that picture a little while ago turn it right and it shows his face that's the one that was printed in the in the brown tone I'm not sure what you call that in terms of pictures but uh the picture of of the cloud in the sky and many people will see it as a cloud in the sky but remember God said to the prophet turn it right and when he did that he was able to see the the the features of a face in the cloud and and the white wig showing exactly that it was deity it wasn't Jesus though it was Jesus it was God almighty he says that the other day standing there turn the picture to the right and there's Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages the White Wagon in in Revelations chapter one if you if you read that the one that was there was that was covered in the in the golden girdle and uh he was in the in the Gown walking in the midst of the churches and the candlesticks the White Wagon showing Supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the first and the last he is the Supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirms the message of the hour of this hour he says and there shall be light about the evening time what is it all about what is it what is the attraction on the mount what happened in 1963 over sunset Mountain what really happened there brothers and sisters I honestly think this we might have a little bit of a different perception about who we are and where we are in terms of the sands of time in terms of the scripture in terms of the message of the hour if we could really grasp the second coming of the Lord because I think many people are still looking for the 60-foot Jesus many people are still looking for the banisters of Heaven to unwind and to see Jesus come down the great staircase with all the Angels maybe like Jacob's Ladder many people are looking for something different than what's actually happened take a look at the message of the hour through its entirety and see what brother Branham says about it if you're looking for a pumpkin you need to know what a pumpkin looks like oh you'll miss it when you see it and he's not talking about looking at vegetables and fruits he's talking about missing the coming of the Lord missing the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and many people will take it and say oh the message of the hour now what you're doing is you're trying to make William Branham God no no no he was a man sent from god let's go back to John and just read this now and talk about William Miriam Branham just for a second now I feel like we're going to start preaching we'll just read this quickly John chapter one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John so let's just say there was a man sent from God whose name was Bill the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe remember only believe he was not that light but many people try and make him that light many people will say because you talk about him so much you make him that light no he spoke about a light and pointed to a light he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world to try and bring truth about life eternal life and an eternal separation from God there's no Eternal death there's only one form of life and that's Zoe God's own life and that's what he's talking about here in this in this scripture brother Branham says that he's a supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirmed the message of this hour and there shall be light about the evening time what is it all about what is it I'm going to go on and read some more out of what is the attraction hopefully we'll have enough time to fit it in here he says I went up into the canyon climbed Plum up where the Eagles was flying around I was watching some deer standing there we've read this so many times brothers and sisters but I just trust that one of these times it will just break to us in such a way that it will never be the same to us ever again I I just can't express it enough I knelt down to pray and raise my hands and a sword struck my hand I looked around and thought what's that I'm not beside myself here's that sword in my hand bright shiny glistening in the sun I said now there's not people in miles of me way up here in this Canyon where could that come from isn't it amazing that brother Branham would be sent by God to actually not just bring a message to the world but to actually just go up to where there's no people well there's nobody around where he would have to work real hard he says that he had to get so hot climbing up there he had to take his shirt off in another message but in this one he says I said no there's not people in miles of me way up here in this Canyon where could that come from I Heard a Voice said that's the king's sword I said a Knights a king Knights a man with a sword he The Voice came back said not the king's sword not a king sword story but the king's sword I've said it many times that way not just a king sword but the king's sword but listen to what he says after this in this message not a king's sword but the king's sword the word of the Lord why would he put a sword in his hand why would he say this to him here's the king's sword and and it's in your hand why would he call him up there to have this Vision why would he be talking about this what is the attraction on the mount he said fear not it's only the third pull it's the Vindication of your ministry putting the word in your hand and really what this is that he's talking about is that all that Adam lost has been restored I put it back in the hand of man again gave it back to him remember pick up your pen and write I can't get away from it I'll probably just keep harping on it until it just becomes real to us trusting praying that the Lord will reveal it to us in such a way that it changes Our Lives she has thus saith the Lord because she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with it all that Adam lost has been restored that sword was put back into the hand of the man the word and where does the word come to brothers and sisters to the prophet it comes to the prophet why does it come to the prophet he said it can be given to the people so it wasn't just so that he could take it it wasn't just so that we could say you know what the word was given to the prophet and that was fine for him and his day but what about our day brothers and sisters if we receive the message of the hour then we receive the same sword we receive the same word we receive the same thus saith the Lord and you know what we have to believe that we can't go into it with fear we can't have fear perfect love the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our lives casteth out all fear how many times do you hear the apostles when we read about them like Philip and Stephen who is just about to be stoned coming up against the entire world is caving in on Stephen but what does he do he boldly preaches from Genesis to Revelation he preaches the gospel according to what the Lord had shown him every single Apostle had boldness is my point brothers and sisters William Miriam Branham he had boldness even though he was he was he was he was not treated well by this world he had boldness and the same thing with sons and daughters of God you know as many as believed on him to them gave he power to become the sons of God if we can believe that we're a son or a daughter of God what do we have to fear remember the story of the slave brother Branham tells that story of the slave in amongst all the slaves this one he wasn't beaten down and and dragon and mopen he had his chest out and his shoulders back and his chin High because he had Pride about who he was it didn't matter where he was geographically he knew who he was do we know who we are brothers and sisters I'm trying to encourage us today to just catch that Revelation that if we are truly Sons and Daughters of God if we've truly been baptized by the Holy Ghost truly in our lives we've got nothing to fear there's nothing to fear Satan will come around and try and knock on our door and we can tell him to take a hike we can tell him we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ we're not going to try and bring a strong railing accusation against him Before the Throne of mercy and grace we'll just tell him to go back to where he belongs and remind him of the scriptures that apply to him directly the promise that's in store for him very soon as soon as we get that Revelation about who we are in our day he says a king Knights a man with a sword he The Voice come back said not a king's sword but the king's sword the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third Paul it's the Vindication of your ministry at the beginning of this message brother Branham talks about prophecy and how prophecy what happens with prophecy when prophecy comes forth it's it's speaking about something that's supposed to happen and then God comes around and he vindicates it and and brother Bradham in his ministry what happened was he was making history through the prophecy as he was prophesying he was creating history and it wasn't him creating history it was God vindicating that Ministry creating the history fulfilling the prophecy that was coming forth that there should be John the Baptist on Earth again that the Elijah Ministry should go forward right to the very end and the second last stop is in William Miriam Branham to the laodicean church age but how does he confirm his word brothers and sisters he vindicates that he brings it to pass that's what brother Branham taught us he makes his word come to pass further and what is the attraction on the mount what happened what's happened up on Mount Sunset he says it again it's not the same quote he says it over and over and over at the end of it what's happened what's the attraction on the mount try and get what's going on here because if you can understand what's actually happened here we might actually look at our entire lives just a little bit differently brothers and sisters what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all the noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promise promised word again so I just want to pause for a second and talk about this I talked to a brother a while ago he said that it was God just vindicating himself with his man that's what happened that's what that cloud was and I said to him no it wasn't just a cloud no the Houston Coliseum was God vindicating himself with his man the cloud was a little bit different the cloud was way more significant so we can take this one quote quote here out of context if you go on and read the rest of it which I'm going to do now I believe it should just cause a shout in the hearts of Believers he says what what's happened on Mount Sam said God confirming his word that's what all the noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1 to 7. God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1-7 I'm probably going to have to just pick up on this quote right here and really dig into this in the future because it's so profound it's so significant that's that Mighty Angel descending with a shout coming down to earth with an open book in his hand and putting one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and declaring that there shall be time no more in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished brothers and sisters that's already happened that's history what happened up on the mount sunset Revelations 10 1-7 in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 many people out there will say well we don't know that we don't understand that there's there's got to be a greater revealing of it and it will happen somewhere out there and that's a trick of the devil to say that you know what we're looking forward to something happening and looking back to what God's already done but ignoring what's already happening in our day brothers and sisters what's happening in our day how is this word becoming real to us in our lives that's what needs to be looked at that's what I think needs to happen when we hear this type of quoting when we hear this type of preaching this type of scripture does something rise up inside us and say Amen or are we still confused about it because brother Bradham at the end of this message he says people are still confused about this they still don't understand it back in 1963 or 65 sorry in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age Luke 17 30. the day when the son of man shall be revealed many people are looking for a different day for the son of man to be revealed and you know what if they miss this day they will see the son of man revealed in Revelations 19 where he comes on a horse but all the people from this age who actually caught that revelation will be with him they're not looking to go then we're looking to go now Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and there shall arise false prophets and false Christ and show signs and wonders in so much it had deceived the elected if possible excuse me and the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled brothers and sisters don't let this puzzle you don't let this confuse you only believe if we can believe that God sent a prophet and that we can have the first and second pull activation of his ministry we can see great signs and wonders in our lives we can see healings we can see Mighty moves of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives that's all fine and good but you know what we've been talking about when I was a child I spake as a child I acted as a child I thought as a child but when that which is perfect is come you know what I put away childish things and I began to speak as a man I began to be fully mature as a Christian and understand the message of the hour it's not about signs and wonders it's not about healing that's all fine and good that follows but what we're after is the true meat of the word and that is a body change that's the understanding of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost if we wind up in the graveyard it'll get us out of there if we go the way of the sky it's God's choice one way or the other but it doesn't matter because if I've got the token if I've got the Holy Ghost then it doesn't matter to live is Christ to die is gain Hallelujah in Luke 10 Luke chapter 10 verse 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight I'm going to call the musicians and we're going to end right at noon and I just want to leave it there we're going to drill down on this I just feel so impressed to go this far think about it brothers and sisters don't let this be confusion if we are confused about the message of the hour that's Satan coming around and trying to mess our mind maybe some traditional teaching maybe some doctrinal thing maybe something that just hasn't been explained maybe something that just hasn't been revealed but let's just keep fellowshipping around this word Revelations 10 1-7 Luke 17 30 in the days when the son of man is revealed he's already been revealed he's already come from heaven he's already on Earth and we know there's been many doctrines of devils that have just gotten right into the middle of that and caused so many people to just go weird and crazy and make it something that it's not which causes the the the The Offspring of all of that becomes the yield is the word I'm thinking of the yield from all of that becomes scarecrows all over the place we can't do that because because we've seen this and and if we go this way oh we saw that and and all these things and it just becomes the devil causing fear in our lives but we have to come to the place brothers and sisters or we can snip all of those those ties that bind us and just allow us to soar into the heavenlies and just say you know what maybe I don't understand it maybe I just can't really get all of this stuff all this mysterious stuff because it's different than what I've ever heard but if we can only believe all things are possible brothers and sisters I trust that something was said today that might be encouraging to us just make sure that we understand where we stand I guess is the key we need to understand how late it really is brother Bradham said it so many times it's later than you think he was around for two years after sunset Mountain it's later than you think stand with me this morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray that as late as it is that we would still have the ability to just come unto thee Lord that you would just continue wooing us that you would continue drawing us father that not one of us would be lost Lord we know that every single person on this Earth is a life that you have created excuse me every single one of us Lord Jesus relies on the same Grace every single one of us relies on the laws that you have laid down in this universe father I pray that you would just reveal yourself to those those babes Lord that you have chosen from in you before the foundation of the world I pray Lord Jesus that the words that were spoken today would just find the mark in the hearts of your children and father if there was anything spoken that was out of turn Lord forgive me for it because I never would want to mix your word I never would want to cause confusion I would only want to point people to you Lord I only want to uplift you Lord Jesus we're not here to promote the message of the hour even though we are and we know the message of the hour is you but we're not pointing to a man named William Miriam Bradham we're pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one name under heaven whereby we can be saved and that's your name the Lord Jesus Christ we're so thankful for the Revelation that you've given us through the message of the hour we're so thankful that you are the message of the hour Lord Jesus you are just so wonderful thank you Father for calling us thank you Father for giving us the Revelation that you have thank you for answering our prayers so many times so many different ways Lord Jesus even times where we don't even lift up a prayer with our voice just like that eunuch in his Chariot thinking on these things just meditating on these things speaking your word and pondering and you sent it to him you sent the answer directly to him oh father I pray that you would just Quicken this word to us today that you would just send to us Lord Jesus that fresh Revelation one more time you yourself personally revealed to us father we just love you and we thank you we just ask that you would bless the word that was spoken be with each one today father go with us as we go our separate ways and father we just will be careful to give you the glory we pray for those who are in Lethbridge today father that you would just bring them home safely Lord that you would just anoint them to have the ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church restore brother Phil's strength today we pray be with those in Air Dream Lord Jesus father we thank you for the testimony of brother Jean Charles Lord that you have already healed him even though the the devil of cancer would be knocking on his door Lord Jesus greater is he that is in him than he that would come around through a doctor's testimony and try and declare a problem like that father we pray that you would bless the Saints in their dream Lord bless all that they do father we know that your word is greater than any one of us and your work father we don't understand sometimes the way things work we don't understand how you do things but father we just trust you we just believe you and we know that you will make everything work out everything will work out according to your will we just love you and we thank you Lord we just ask all these things in
