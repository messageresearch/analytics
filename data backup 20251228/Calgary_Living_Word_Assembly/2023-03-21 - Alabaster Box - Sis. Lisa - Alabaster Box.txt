========================================

I'm not a singer at all but I um had this song impressed on my heart this morning after Barry was speaking and um I know brother Ferron has sang it I sang this years ago so I will not do it the same just as he does but I just really felt to sing it so it's um it's a Joyful Noise tonight [Music] oh the room goes down as she made her way to Jesus stumbled through the tears that made her blind [Music] she felt such pain pain some spoken anger hurtful's whisper there's no place here for her kind [Music] still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until it last she knelt before his feet and though she spoke no words everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster and I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's Alabaster Box to kneel before him wash my feet with my tears and dry them with my head it was there the night he found when he came to my side and rubbed his love all around me I know Jesus knew the cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box [Music] I can't forget the way life used to be I was a prisoner to the sin that had me back I spent my days pouring life without measure to a little treasure box I thought I'd found until the day when Jesus came to me and healed my soul with the Wander of his time so I'm giving back to him all the praise He's Worthy I've been forgiven and that's why I love him so much much I've come to pour my praise on him [Music] to kneel before him and wash his feet with my tears and draw them with my hands it was there for the night he found me when he came to my side and wrapped his love all around me I knew Jesus knew the cost of my world in my Alabaster Box it was there the night he found me when he came to my side and round his love all around me I knew Jesus knew the cost of my oil only Jesus knows the cost of your oil in your Alabaster [Applause]
