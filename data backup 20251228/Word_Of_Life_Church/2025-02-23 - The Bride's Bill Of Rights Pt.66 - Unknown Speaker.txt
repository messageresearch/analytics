and praise and the angels of God will have to go off and circle the Earth while we're singing and this Anthem is coming up and they're singing w wow they've sung to him for Millennia they've sung to him for ages but they can't sing this song because they haven't been redeemed we're blessed today aren't we lord Jesus we love you so much we thank you for what you mean to us today Father we're so grateful that you loved us so much you came to this wicked sin evil world to be able to purchase our salvation and a privilege Lord that we could not only be saved but then in turn become your instrumentality on the earth that you could use us to help others and that Paul would said that not only have we been reconciled but we have the ministry of reconciliation then he said be you therefore or reconciled to God lord Jesus we've gathered here today that we could sing that we could pray that we could praise and worship now it comes a portion of the word and I pray that you'd help me Lord help me to be able to get out of the way Lord shut my mouth to anything that would displease you may things of Eternal value Lord be accomplished out of this service today no doubt there's folks F that are sick we pray for their healing Lord some that may be weary some that may be indifferent Lord we know brother Randy and his family are certainly still need in prayer for sister tresa's crossing over and we Rejoice for her today but it's just that empty spot that it leaves in our hearts so we pray that you'd help them not only them but others that have lost loved ones how we're waiting for that time to be gathered together Lord Lord take the service today we pray in the name of Jesus thank you Lord and the saint said amen praise the Lord praise the lord we worship you Jesus we worship you Lord Jesus thank you Father hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we worship Worship You Lord God than thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord turn wisdom if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2 we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus happy to see each one of you trust that you're doing well by the grace of God glad to see some of you back that's been sick and went able to be here we thank the Lord that you've recovered and still others that are sick flu and covid and different things like that so we certainly want to remember our brothers and sisters in prayer the Lord will just be with them and strengthen them and help them second Peter chapter 1 verse 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life I want you to notice Peter doesn't say that pertains to death but that pertains to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue now remember this is what we're called to glory and virtue not division contention troublemaking all that sort of stuff that's not who we are called us unto glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great I love the adjectives that he used to describe these exceeding which means Moun beautiful and abounding exceeding great and precious great great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this so after you've come to that part and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue let's look at this word again add meaning is so so beneficial for us I think add is Minister nourishment to supply or furnish ministered unto or assisted so beside this giving all diligence then assist add to minister to your faith virtue so in the Greek it's it says it like this in The Possession of your faith Minister virtue and then in verse six and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and even though it doesn't say sisterly it's sisterly too so don't your sisters get to thinking praise God brother Donnie sure preached on them brothers today no no it's for you too and to brotherly kindness oh my and to brotherly kindness charity so then each Grace each virture that starts and takes root and begins to grow then each one of those being assumed they become the stepping stone for the next one and then the latter in turn caps off the whole thing so Faith leads faith leads and love caps off am amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated how many can say already it's good to be in the house of the Lord sorry to some people these things might be as if though they would be impossible for a human being to ever attain to such a thing but we know that God never says anything in his word especially for his people to try to achieve to and then set an impossibility before them and them never be able to get to it and I know I'm looking at people today that have been through a lot of hard things in life a lot of you have been betrayed you've been forsaken by family friends maybe you felt isolated because of different things about you no doubt more than likely every one of us here today probably have at least one complex I mean 100 and some of you's got 200 uh we've got fears we've got phobias right uh I mean there's so many fears and phobias this week I was reading about a new one that they just diagnosed not long ago and it was the fear of catchup and I thought I feel so sorry for those poor people I mean t just wouldn't be ters without ketchup right but you think of all that Satan has done to the generation that we live in that everywhere they look they have all types of fears and phobias people are afraid of sunlight some are afraid of Starlight some are afraid of moonlight some are afraid of people some are afraid of animals some are afraid of this and that and the other and you realize that Satan is working almost like it's overtime to bring people under such oppression of demonic power and we know that the floodgates if I can say it that way or of Hell have been opened in this last day and in the midst of all of that God has designated a time that he would bring certain passages of scripture to fruition and demand that they be met by a group of of human beings on the face of the Earth so instead of making excuses for our phobias and our fears and making excuses well let me alone I've got this trauma and I've got that trauma and I've got this and that and the other and I'll never be no different I I don't think we have to live underneath the control of those things is that right for the Bible tells us God has not given to us the spirit of fear but of love and of power and of a sound mind not a confused mind not a mind that is so tore up that it doesn't even know what is right and wrong and then we know that that being before us that God makes a way by which we're able to attain to these virtues that Peter wrote about 2,000 years ago now we believe that in that Beginning church that they had these things in full manifestation though the the major focus of the virtue that God started off the foundation of that church was Faith but it was not faith alone that they had now the word faith comes from the Greek word pistus p i s t i s so it is a conviction that something is real a conviction that something is real but then Paul wrote about also in the Book of Romans that it would be from Faith to Faith so it's not like that you get Fai and then you believe there's a cross you believe there's a heaven you believe there's a hell you believe there's a God and you believe Jesus came to save you from going to hell and then you stop that's where many people do stop but there is also a face to another face to another face to another face until it Le leads us into that place to where we as individuals will be capped off at the very top of our life with what charity which is the personal presence of the Lord Jesus himself now we can't read ourself into it we cannot have all kinds of self-help books and go to this therapist and that therapist and you know go to this psychologist and this psychiatrist and this individual we get this for this and this mad for that I'm not against people getting meds for this and that and the other but I don't think any medication will ever take place of the Holy Ghost as a matter of fact Satan leads us around that medication Tree of Life I'm afraid many times that tree of knowledge rather then it it we we get a replacement for what God actually wants us to have which is that deep peace settled down inside of our soul but people you know the sad thing about it is that there's many Christians in the day and and hour that we live and they will never attain to this that we just read even though it was given 2,000 years ago and people have not focused on it because it's like well they don't really understand it maybe or they don't see it as the building blocks that God has given for his church and if you don't understand that God reveals himself to his church in a progressive way then once people come to him and they get saved and they think what more do I need what more do I need so if your child would take that same attitude whenever it was a newborn and then your baby grows and it grows and and you know physically it grows into a a young boy or a young girl but yet it never talks it never walks and is still taking a bottle here it is 8 years old taking a bottle sucking on a pacifier and it don't know how to crawl it don't know how to walk you mean it's a parent you would be okay with that you would be fine with that 5-year-old child of yours and it just lays on its belly like it did when it was 6 months old and it R rolls over on its back every now and then and then it'll kick and it's 5 years old and it's still wearing a diaper it's 5 years old it's never learned how to say mama daddy it's never learned how to say anything you parents would be okay with that you would be okay with that 5-year-old boy going into an eight-year-old boy and then a 10-year-old boy and then you send him to school and he don't know how to spell he don't even know how to speak he don't know how to write anything because you were satisfied with him being that baby why of course you wouldn't whenever you take that child to the doctor and the doctor would say well how is he so this is his first year checkup second year third year fourth year is he talking up no I can't say anything he's still laying on his back he's saying wait a minute something something yours wrong that this is not right he should be doing this and doing that why because they have a chart by which they go by well God also has one for Christianity it's called his Bible God has a chart now the sad thing about it is there are many Christians that have been saved for decades they're 20 25 30 35 40y Old Christians and they can't talk Faith talk they can't talk the Deep ER things of God and they're still just goo gooing and Jesus died on the cross and I love Jesus and Jesus loves me and don't tell me nothing about deep things of God I'm just a baby goo goo goo and it's time for you to get that pacifier out of your mouths and grow up praise the Lord now this is the way God has built his church and it's the way that he's building his individuals so it's more than just getting saved and but that is the start and it's a great start of course and salvation transforms our life and makes us such a different person and for many people you can see why that it done such a great thing in them they think why do I need anymore because it so changed me I I I saw carollyn I saw a documentary the other night and it was of an Iranian guy from Iran and he was taught since a little bitty Bor to hate Israel so he went through a little bit of his life and he was talking about that in school that every day in school they would teach them to hate Jews and to he hate Israel and oh my I mean from a little bitty guy he started growing up growing up and he hated them absolutely hated them but something began to happen and he began to change and one day the spirit of God found this younger man and he began to deal with him and he began to read in a Bible and quite an amazing phenomenal story of what the Lord had done for this man and you could hear from him talking that he didn't really understand a lot about the latter day and the latter time and all that but I was so amazed just at what salvation had done for this man now he's a pastor and he's got a church and he's trying to help others and he moved from Aran to Israel and now he's going about helping the Jews can you imagine an Iranian going about helping Jews fixing meals for them so during the time of this war he's been going around helping the wounded helping the sick and the people are looking at him like he's a spy of course not knowing what in the world has happened and I thought what a great thing that salvation is to be able to get a man that was hated from being a child to love a people and he said as he begin to read the Bible he realized that the muhammadislam and the men will remove their shirts and they will take their hands and they will take whips and they hit themsel as thousands times them thousands go around the Black Box the holy sacred side of Islam and I saw them in this documentary and their backs were nearly bleeding and their chest and their face and their heads because they're beating themselves and they're trying to make peace and trying to find something I don't have to beat myself he was beaten for me you don't have to beat yourself he was beaten for you as well is that right but yet look now this man more than likely by his speech and the way he was talking he knew nothing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew nothing about the evening light and what God has done but yet salvation was so powerful to that man and I was alarmed by what he went on to say he said in Iran there are millions of Iranians and remember Iran is actually Persian it is Persia it is not Saudi Arabia it is not cutter it is not any of the rest of them they are Persians and this man said that he began to read his Old Testament and remember it was Cyrus which was a Persian it was actually xeres that married Esther the Persians have a great tie to the Jews and it was like once this man started reading his Bible and finding out that Iran actually was Persia and finding scriptures in Jeremiah that prophesied about Persia being returned back to the Lord in the last day and this man witnessing to others and telling them we are not Iranians but we are Persians and I thought my goodness just with salvation with the power of the Cross and the power of the blood helping them to find a national identity that they are not Iranians now the Iranians went in and they took it over and the imams and ayas and all that those of you in case you don't know it whenever you will see an Ayatollah and he has a black turban around his head that means he's a direct descendant supposedly from Muhammad those who wear the white ones they are not direct descendants from Muhammad and yet they trying to change the identity of this whole nation but he said I can tell you they are getting fed up with it and he said Christianity is exploding in Iran and according to this man now he said there are millions of them that have already turned from Islam and are turning to Christianity I thought Lord are we that close to the coming of the Lord could this be part of the last call that people I'd already heard that even in Gaza that Jesus has been appearing to some of the Muslims there in the form of dreams and the form of different things and even in Gaza while the war has been going on they've been giving their heart to Jesus Christ listen Word of Life we better wake up come on somebody we need to be ready to leave this world in a moment in a twinkling of an eye by the power of God now will many of these people ever go on on to be of what the bride the elect part will be well there may be an element of them that are there I know there's some Works in Iran there are some Works in Egypt there are some Works in different parts of the world and we thank God for every one of them that are there but remember there is another work also which is in the kingdom of God and that is the work of the Cry of the foolish virgin and they will get many of them will get saved sa D but because they are not elected remember whenever Rebecca came out of the land of her father and her mother and her people and she left the land that it was not just Rebecca alone that came out but the Bible tells us her Maids came out with her they heard the same stories that elaser told Rebecca they drank from the same water and they ate from the same stored up food but when they got to work Isaac was not a one of them Maids ever married Isaac only Rebecca got Isaac well come on now now I know it makes it hard for people but remember God has a multifaceted aspect by which the kingdom of God will take in all types of people and the kingdom of heaven was liken unto a man that went out to throw a n a net into the sea and Jesus told us about the parable of the sea and the parable of the fish and they're all drawn together so is it in the kingdom of God that there is wise virgin there is foolish virgin there is 144,000 there are those that will live outside the city so if we're not careful we'll get tunnel vision and focus on us and our family and think well that's all God's interested in God is interested in every human being that can be saved on the face of the Earth well you know what if God is I am what about you so what we want to focus on today by the help of the Lord is us in our position wherever you are ordained of God to walk and the light that God has called you in for myself I can never be satisfied just being a saved person I can never be satisfied just being a person that you know reads your Bible on occasion I go to church on the occasion and I live for God whenever want to and what I don't want to well I don't live for it that that's not who I am I I can never be satisfied doing that now I've given my heart to the Lord as you know whenever I was just a young boy been preaching for over 50 years now so I have no desire somebody asked me not long ago if I was going to retire I thought what in the world would I do if I retired I'd go absolutely nuts now they ain't no way I'm at the age of retirement brother Donnie you're 68 almost 69 well don't tell me Tell God I've still got my right mind so far I've still got a lot lot of energy and as long as I have I'm going to keep on going so to me it's no time age limit has nothing to do with it I I told you the other day I've got a friend of mine up in New Brunswick brother Ivan Carr his son-in-law just sent me a picture of him this last week 95 years old at his 95th birthday and he still preaches twice a week and he's like a little fire brand well I tell you what I think we ought to do everything we can do as long God gives us the strength and the ability to do it well if that brother can do that at 95 what about some of you young men that's 25 or 18 or 17 we ought to be doing what God has called us to do and the church said now watch this is where many people you know they just get started and they never go any farther but watch how the prophet when he lays this out he said now a lot of people go up to the Altar and pray and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification come upon them and then things you have a great time you get up at the altar couting now look at what it can do a person gets saved they get Sanctified my boy them them old things a lot of them evil wicked things it just goes away from them and they feel like such a new person that they think why do I need anything else and that's where Satan deceives them and they saying I I I don't have to go any farther you're just getting started now what's in you have a great time up the altar shout and you go back and say bless God I got it no you just started to a place where you you can grow you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you've done is just laid the foundation now what is the foundation that Peter talked about faith so the foundation is If any man will come to God he must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him for by grace through faith are you saved not of yourselves lest any man should boast but it is a gift of God Paul goes on to say that God has given to every every man The Measure of Faith so here is this small Measure of Faith by which people are given as sinners now think about it if God had not given that to the unconverted heart they wouldn't even have the capability to receive him as their savior supernaturally God started moving in you before you come to that place of repentance and you start say I'm sorry for this I'm sorry for that I'm sorry for that God offered you the measure of faith that measure of faith is a very tiny small measure but it's just enough to get you saved then after you get saved if you will allow God God will continue to let Faith grow and faith will grow until it reaches and covers the first level of everything you need the getting saved faith is not enough Faith to lead you to Virtue then getting virtue on just the beginning introduction of virtue is not enough to lead you to Godly knowledge but faith wants to grow wants to start out in this small small measure and then what will it will do set like this it'll start out in the middle of the base of the pyramid and you believe oh thank you Lord I'm saved praise God God saved me I believe there's a God I believe with all of my heart there's a god well don't try to start getting for virtue yet but let your faith grow out and expand over the whole First Foundation level and then it will cover not only shall ation but healing Deliverance peace power Revelation you're laying your whole foundation with faith so your faith grows grows grows grows grows until it goes from one side of the foundation to the other your entire first layer is engulfed with faith so it grows from the tiny start out measure till it's complete coverage you understand now a lot of people they stop there so they get enough Faith to believe God they got their whole CER oh my they're just so happy they're so in love with God and the first battle comes and they say well what happened I I don't understand I felt so good for the first week I felt so wonderful now I don't understand their faith is being tried and if they'll allow it God will try their faith and let their faith expand from side to side then that faith will cover everything that they need in The Measure of Faith itself and the church said amen now watch he said it laid the foundation but you're going to build a house you pour the foundation and say boy I got her yeah you've got the foundation to build your house on but you've got to build the house now that's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about a house this Foundation First what is the foundation of Christianity he says faith in the word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start so you begin to add to this Foundation now building a house you might put up your uprights which is your walls your tube floors and so on and everything else brother wood some of the other Carpenters or contractors could tell you how to build your house but I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where God can dwell now this is what we're interested in right let me tell you you know y'all ought to be really really glad that I was not the contractor on this new church here you ought to be really really glad that I was not the one that built up these frames and these side walls and I'm the one who calls all this up here you ought to be so happy today cuz every time you come in here if I was in charge of it all I can tell you you'd be nervous and you know who'd be more nervous than you I would because I don't know the first thing about how to do that now I can finish wood I can lay stone there's certain things I can do but there's things I've got enough sense to know it's beyond my capability and that's what we need to learn ourselves about salvation we don't know how to get saved we don't know how to please God within ourself we need to commit that part to him and then let him teach us how to do what we can do ourselves and the church said so once that happens and we begin to add to the foundation now it goes on to say here you are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this welding This Together therefore the Pentecostal people has let out the Lutheran and the wesli and things and doesn't know what they're talking about you see they lived in this part of the temple that's why we're waiting for the resurrection Luther's age is waiting on us the Pentecostal age is waiting on us arenus Paul Columba they are waiting on us God having provided some better thing for us but there's a genuine part of that that keeps making that building come on I will restore saith the Lord in the evening time it shall be light that's when listen this comes Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then he will res resurrect this church being his own body in there the body the way God is expecting us as an individual now this is what God wants for every man woman boy and girl and this is what he's requiring to be in the church agent brother Donnie will everybody in our church get it I hope they do God's the only one that knows if they will or they won't but no doubt there's been people among us that have set Among Us and 's gone by and they may be there and they may not and there will be people that have set in churches all down through time but remember there is no such thing as a Holy Ghost Church by that I mean that you go to this one church and you say everybody there Saints everybody there is elect everybody there's got the Holy Ghost the prophet tells us there is no such a thing there is no such a thing and yet that's what organization tries to do they want to make everybody then that's a part of that move then that's them you know if we're not careful we do the exact same thing so everybody then that believes our ideology and our doctrine that makes them bride ain't none of us can make nobody bride God is the one who does that and God Alone now remember in this place today are people with the Holy Ghost in This Place today are people who ain't got the Holy Ghost in This Place today may be people that don't even believe in the Holy Ghost so everybody here or you say a word Word of Life Church is a Holy Ghost Church no it's not there's people in Word of Life Church who believe in the Holy Ghost and who have the Holy Ghost but just because you come here does not mean that you have the Holy Ghost you've got to be in Christ Jesus yourself you have got to have an experience young people you have got to have an experience older people that you are born again that you know that you know that you know amen amen now watch then he will bring the individuals together and we are baptized individually in to make this Collective body watch again he said see these fellas wasn't required what these fellas was now remember he's got the pyramid there and he's got the names of the church ages the names of The Messengers and then the virtues so he's he's pointing out that what was required of one wasn't required of the other but it just so happens you're living at the very tough guess what's required of you everything amen everything you say I can't do it I know you can't and I can't either I've done come to the spot I've quit trying on my own the thing ain't me trying to do this and trying to do that it's me get out of the way and surrender and let the spirit of God help you say Brother Don it's too hard I know it is he made it that way he made it that way so it would absolutely oh my deny deny us of the capability of bringing to pass God's word in our life you say it's too hard it's too hard for me too but he don't want you and I trying to be this and trying to be that he wants to commit us himself and live his own life out of us oh my that's where too many people have failed and that's What Hurts The Gospel is people seeing people that they tried to do right and wind up being a hypocrite and say well my good I know that person and they go to church you ought to see them they do this and that and the other and they lie and they cheat and they steal Don't Judge Me by somebody like that I don't lie cheat and steal neither does the body of Christ come on somebody but yet people are trying to do it and it's one of the greatest stumbling blocks that people see is somebody who goes to church that lives like a devil am woo come on Lord say Amen church amen now watch what's the requirement of us was not required in the days of arenus now he brought his church up the same way the same way then Peter says first these seven things Faith virtue see coming up knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then the love of God Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you oh my then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him listen when you and I grow into this full stature the same holy ghost that burst us will cap or finish us and when it caps us he'll cap off the ages thank you Lord God you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith we believe in speaking in tongues Here We Believe signs wonders Miracles yep we believe the supernatural power of God my goodness friend we've seen God do so many things oh it it would be it would be devastating if we didn't believe he could do such stuff we do believe that but we also want to focus not on that but focus on this being inside of us now notice when these virtues grow in as you added to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol but when we not an imaginary way proster ourselves before Living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming by the Living God makes a living man a living image the statue of God see how these virtues these building materials typed in with the church Messengers with the church ages so a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge how is it living actually because it comes from the living presence of the Living God now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in that brings the faith of Jesus Christ I don't just want my face I don't just want my virtue I have to have more than my own virtue I'm called to minister to so many people from around the world my virtue will run out before Sunday evening and today is Sunday evening yours will run out but I need a virtue that is unlimited I need a virtue when I feel like I don't have enough strengths to answer another phone call or answer another email or have another interview and I think God I can't do it my throat is so sore Lord I'm so weak from talking to people you know what it's like when you talk to people and they pulled and pulled and Pull and and you're talking to them and the spirit of God comes down in the office there and you're ministering to people in strength is leaving you don't think that Christian's only place to give out is sh in the church many of you are called not only to give out virtue and and in church alone but on your job in the place where you're at maybe to people who do not know and understand what you know and God will allow you to minister or you say you mean we're supposed to have virtue to people beyond our own belief God's Prophet said the entire world amen praise be to God hallelujah hallelujah so when you put the blood of Jesus Christ in that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge well then how can I add the faith of Jesus Christ how can I add the virtue of Jesus how can I add the knowledge of Jesus how can I add it all I can do is submit and see my need first of all and open my being and say God please please let your virtue flow out of me let your faith have you ever got to a spot that it seemed like your faith just wouldn't meet the challenge of the hour and all of a sudden something from somewhere come and your faith is just like your faith got muscles don't you understand that wasn't your faith Jesus put his own muscles on your little old puny Faith Oh Glory to God and the spirit of God was Able by that Faith to meet that need that you Haden it's the same with the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ oh my the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ and so I'm I'm just fed up with people I I I've had so much deal with people I just can't take it no more my brotherly kindness is run out on you need his anybody honest enough here today to say mine's run out with people before you ever get tired of fooding with people I mean just say that's it I'm just going to start fellowshipping with Hogs and dogs and jack rabbits and you know know uh ostriches and elephants and all that sort of thing I'm fed up with people I'm just tired of people people just churchy people lie people do this people do that and the other but remember it ain't that jack rabbit out there that you're sent to convert it ain't that ostrich it ain't that elephant it ain't this and that it's not that it's Humanity it's Humanity they're the ones that need light they're the ones that need forgiveness you can't forgive a jack rabbit my goodness you can't forgive an ostrich you've got to be able to let God man EST himself through you who you say I can't do it's totally impossible exactly right it's totally impossible for me too but it ain't totally impossible for my Jesus if my faith runs out there's been times my faith felt like I had no more left but all of a sudden I felt a surge run through me like I don't know what what was it the faith of Jesus Christ and my virtue Brothers y see like it was totally gone oh my and all of us sudden a surge don't you understand that's what wears a minister out when he's praying for people hundreds and hundreds of people you imagine brother David's holl was over I think it was IND here not long ago and had a prayer line 12500 people one man of God running through a prayer line how in the world is that even physically possible y'all know how Brother David prays M when he prays for people he gives everything he's got it's like there ain't nobody else in that pray line but that first person and he prays with everything how was he able to continue so the face of Jesus Christ led to the virtue of Jesus Christ amen oh thank you Lord thank you Lord there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues he still working on me Amen to make you what you ought to be some of you won't say it for you but I'll say it for you now let's go back again to Second Peter chapter 1 verse5 and beside this giving all diligence add to your Faith's virtue now when the prophet preaches this he starts out and he said now the first thing that you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith and you've got to be born again and it produces faith and after you get Faith this right here he spells it out Faith then you're just in position of growing and remember as we go in God we grow in our understanding Peter didn't understand at all when he first got the Holy Ghost neither to James nor Paul neither will you and I on neither did the prophets now whenever we look at the new births still confusing really to a lot of people it's sad but many teach and believe that the new births is one a sinner will come up to the Altar and they'll give their heart to God and Lord I'm sorry please save me and they say I got born again but does that match the pattern the first person to preach the do of the new births being born again under those terms born again was the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus and he preached it to him man as far as we know that never experienced it so he got to theology but never had the experience to match it so Jesus told him he must to be born again and he said how in the world me an old man can I enter the second time into my mother's woman be born again he said if I told you these Natural Things of the Earth how can I speak to you the spiritual things he said except you be born of water and of spirit you can not see or understand the kingdom of God so Jesus introduced this very odd and peculiar Doctrine in the New Testament now even the disciples as they were there and they have cast out Devils they've healed the sick they've raised the dead but they were not yet converted right According To Jesus Jesus told Peter when you are converted strengthen your brethren so they had cast out Devils heal the sick preach the gospel El as far as they knew it and all kinds of great works that they had done but they were not yet born again and they didn't get born again until the upper room experience now remember where the Prophet is during this time frame in 1962 when he preaches this that he's at that spot of thinking believing preaching it as well that the new birth is when you accept Christ as your savior but let me show you here in sort in the token in 63 when this token is on you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves for just a moment when God has G you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true every Theologian will have to admit that to be true yes sir it's the new birth now you can see why that many people are LED astray in the age we're living in and millions believe they're born again when they're not that's right they gave the Lord Jesus their heart God did something for them as I mentioned about the Iranian man a while ago and and God really did something for him you're not going to tell him that he didn't I'm not going to try to tell him that he didn't because it certainly seemed like a life a life has been changed by the power of God but they're still not born again until they get the Holy Ghost amen now what so the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ comes within you now that's every Theologian have to admit that to be true it's the new birth you're born a new of the Holy Ghost so there was three elements that came out of the body of Jesus water blood spirit yes now a person believes on the blood that's only one of them elements so by faith they believe they accepted their remittance of of sins by the blood of the Lord Jesus and I said glory to God I'm born again but now wait a minute you just nodded your head that there was three elements blood water spirit so where is the other in the new birth right of the confessions that are made around the world I came to Christ I gave Christ my life you've only entered in in even in that in a knowledge part that you've accepted the blood what about the spirit that went out of him yes what about the water in tight by the washing of the water of the word and Jesus told Nicodemus and tying the the two scriptures together that a man must be born of water and of spirit praise the Lord now think whenever people are being taught this this is one reason why they go no farther what's this in question aners I love this analogy it is so so simple yet so profound if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth require all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again that's right oh my I love this one word reply absolutely but thank God it didn't stop there I just explained that this morning on the same thing you've got to have all stages you're begotten of the spirit just like a baby's begotten in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you're not born then you're not converted you're in the procession of being converted until that time friends this is I I've told you for years and years this is a great shortcoming Even in our own ranks that people get a life that has been changed and this drops off of them and that drop off of it if you ever get sealed by the holy ghost in your soul you'll never backslide again oh I got saved and then I went back out I got saved again how many times do you get saved my goodness we got saved and resaved and re resaved and re re re re resaved no if you ever get it once and get it in the right spot you're saved forever that's the kind of eternal security the Bible teaches that's right now watch you're born then you're not converted you're in the process that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther not be given to Wes it could not be given to the age of just passed by us the Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten now in reality friends the Luther ages never produce the new birth of Ephesus Wesley never PR prod the new birth of what Acts 2 did it was a portion of the spirit like the Iranian man that got a real experience with God but it would leave Luther in that stage where he could still drink beer smoke his pipe feel no conviction you think Paul smoked the pipe wonder what wonder what brand Paul smoked their experience would have never allowed them to do such was it a portion of the spirit of God yes but did it convert their souls no you see were it not for the message of God for the day they lived in there wouldn't even be a body from Ephesus to Omega don't you understand the grace of God if only the true born again through the church Ages were allocated to being the bride there would only be that Remnant in the first age and that Remnant in the last but the life was moving up through the cornstock the life was moving up to them they had all they could get in that day remember when he preaches about the seals and he said now I'll set this box here and that'll represent the anointing that they had to work under that's all that God released in the days of Luther that's all God released in the days of Wesley that's all God released oh my to the Le to see and Pentecostal age but in the last days he's released more praise be to God that's why we will never be able to go in under the concept of what they had wow we'll be held accountable for more there's more here now there's more here word of life than just going to church and being a pretty good member that won't work [Applause] today oh my Lord Jesus they were begotten listen at the difference now the person of Christ him himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come till now we have arrived amen praise God watch if in the Samaran Church days I want to tell you exactly he talking about him making the alar calls out in his meetings and whenever he would invite the Sinners to come and he would invite them to come and receive the Holy Ghost and just to save a little bit of time he said that the Pentecostal people would think he was inviting them to come and speak in tongues and all that but notice what he said I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for this sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen question answers again if you're born a normal human being I listen this great Theologian that graduated from Harvard and from the minat University and from the Church of God University and listen how he's going to express this deep theology now if you're born a normal human being you will actually do the things a normal human being would do yes sir which lets me know a lot of the folks that apparently born in this day ain't normal human beings they ain't normal they're not doing things normal human beings do men Carol went to eat lunch yesterday and we saw this thing in the restaurant waiting on people it was born a boy but it wanted to be a girl it had long fingernails had a big old throw all stuck out everywhere acting like a girl talking like a girl but Carol said I want you to notice it said if that was a real girl it wouldn't have to put put it on I mean it was so over top trying to be a girl it's over the top trying to be a girl let you know it wasn't a girl cuz you see a girl would have just acted like an elephant no a girl would have acted like a dog a girl would have a real girl would have acted like a girl but this wanted to be a girl but it wasn't a girl but it wanted to be a girl feel bad and as I sat there and looked at it I thought yeah that's the way it is with with the many so-called Christians they try to act like one so bad they're trying to act like they're spiritual trying to act like they're holy you know what if you're a normal human being you're going to act like a normal human being you're not going to eat SLO out of the pig trough you're not going to climb a tree like a monkey and beat your chest and scream on a grape vine like tars and I did when I was a younger but only because of the influence of Television but you're going to act like a normal human being you're going to talk like one you're going to sleep like one and you're going to marry like a human being when you're born a human the natural traits of a human being will follow you you won't live in a tree and try TR to fly with your wings like a bird that isn't wouldn't be normal human being the normal actions of a human being the normal action of a human being would be to work marry have family and if you marri the right gender you can procreate of course if two men get married they can't do that or two women oh brother Donnie you're going to get a skill praise God Bring It On I say you're looking at a man today that's not called to compromise I'm not called to compromise the Le AA I'm trying to get you all out of here I'm trying to get you out of here we don't fit in this world this world is not our home I'm sick of it oh my and the Darkness is moving upon the Earth it may move upon the Earth but it ain't going to move inside the walls of this church it ain't going to move inside our lives and our homes that's natural normal human beings because you're born that now look at that all that spread of the analogy then when you're a born a Christian born of the spirit of God you naturally take up the attributes of ofr well why is it we found so much struggle why is it that people act like Christianity it's just nearly impossible is it impossible for you to eat human food I mean certain food I understand broccoli God never made that stff to eat by a human that's pig food or something it's normal y'all going to go out at your you going to eat you're going to stop at the nearest hog trough there some squirrels at my house this morning there out digging around you know you're going to do that you you humans going to dig up for a few ACR that you buried in the fall you're going to eat human food it's that hard when you get in the car oh this is so hard this is so stressful we got to go to a restaurant to eat oh no I'm about to freak out oh this is so awful you go in and you start and you look over at her and say where you want to go and she looks back at you and say where do you want to go and you look back and say it don't matter where do you want to go and then she looks back and said it don't matter and then you say what about this you know I don't like that so it does matter after all quit lying what is that normal human behavior you want me to tell you what Godly behavior is if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and people hurt you and they let you down and they disappoint you and they lie on you just as normal as it is for you to get in your car and go to a restaurant to eat as a child of God born by the Breath of God it can be just that easy for you to say father forgive them now guess the reality check is this why is it we struggle so hard with Christ attributes when human attributes are just as easy as they can be I mean it's just just like falling out of bed I mean you get up and you just fall right out well I'm a human today wow I was a tater yesterday as a carrot the day before today I'm I'm a human wow so you just do what humans do you go where humans go you like what humans like so if a man woman boy or girl is born by the breath of almighty God you see in the Book of John when Jesus had gathered there together after his resurrection and the Bible says he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost I find that absolutely overwhelming because he breathed and he said it but it didn't happen for several weeks later yes so the Breath of God was circumvented by the present circumstances cuz they was in no condition to receive the Breath of God yet so they go to the upper room and there they stay and they stay and they stay and all of a sudden there came a sound as of a rushing Mighty Wind am from Heaven what was it same breath of God that breathed on them weeks before don't you understand Church the Breath of God has been breathing brething on some of you all for years the Breath of God you've come here service after service and the Breath of God has been BR Hallelujah the Breath of God has been breathing on you receive my life let me f you let me seal you let me come into you and take over let me give you my attributes and you'll no longer struggle at the end of the service you kind of hold on a little bit lord I can't let that go I can't let that go I can't let that go and the Breath of God just goes right over you amen oh Lord God I wonder what could happen in this place today if every person who does not have the Holy Ghost but yet is ordain to receive it and the Breath of God is here oh yeah he's here if it comes by your seat today will you be able to open your soul and be a recipient of the Breath of God then when you are born of the spirit of God as you were with you were born a human and you had all these traits and characteristics for those of you that had children and grandchildren and you start watching them you can see many of them they were little bitty T90 things I remember my children my grandchildren different things about them how that they growed up I remember little Leah she used to be the biggest powder to be so little you ever seen in your life boy she didn't get what she want we had a foot stool in the living room and she'd come in like this and she'd laid down right like she'd pout and pout I mean she never throw temper fits or nothing like that there's something in her there coming out little Ash when she was a little bitty old Curly top boy she was so Brazen and bold and she was over at our house one time and she her and Grammy was coming upstairs and I had Taxidermy mounts places you know everywh and she come up there and she said Grammy I'm not afraid of nothing and I thought I'm going to fix that so I hid and whenever I hid her and Grammy come up to the tops of the step and I jumped out of there and yell like a screaming Heathen and I said to the top of her voice but there was something in her as a little child something in you as a little child and whenever we're born of the Breath of God it's not like we're immediately full born and full grown we're just in the stage of our uprights being put up and growing and formed and oh my taking on the image of God aren't you glad he's patient with us as his children some of you sitting here you've had the Holy Ghost for years and years and you know within yourself you need more of these virtues in your life is that right and that's what you want but don't let you let the devil tell you that you ain't got it and you'll never have it you need to stand your ground and say Satan you're alive fire the same God that gave me the Holy Ghost will bring me to this stature of a perfect man but you've got mistakes yes I've got them but I've also got faith and I've got virtue and I've got knowledge I've got faults but I've got promises I've got Redemption I've got forgiveness [Applause] hallelujah oh my you know your faith really it's allotted to you by the predestination of God but know the finished measure that you'll have but it really depends on how much faith is allotted to you how how high you'll be able to rise in the gospel one the nine gifts of the Spirit of course is the gift of faith I've told you before I believe myself brother Daryl that's what he has in his in his ministry I mean he prays for people and just it's just Absolut remarkable you he don't sh that much with you he don't he don't tell you really all that happens but believe me we are blessed to have such a servant of God with us and it ain't him we know that it's God sure go ahead and thank the Lord for it amen but for me I went back back to it for years the prayer and souls that are in prison now father I pray for every man woman boy and girl that should help them today to understand in the capacity that they're ordained to understand in so I have a capacity and you do and I don't want to compare myself to you or you to me or you to this one that one to that one what I want to do is compare myself according to the chart of God for my life you understand that way I can get a better perspective of where I am and where I need to be you compare lot you look in the New Testament the Bible calls rot a righteous man righteous compared to who not compared to Abraham compared to who Sodom many Christians have gathered around the Tri Cities today compare them to Sodom good people compared to the bride so you and I want to let our lives be measured by God's chart for Donnie what do you want me to be Carol told me the other day she said Donnie you're called to go through things that a lot of people will never have to go through she said I watched it for lot for years you're called to suffer you're called to have to deal with things a lot of people don't have to deal with you think is that fair people think well life ain't Fair I didn't know we was playing the game fair who designed that game called Fair anyway and maybe you're called to go through things that I'll never go through brother friend you're called to go through things that I'll never go through so if we're constant comparing ourselves to this that the other forget that God what do you want me to be I want my face to be what you've called it to be my virtue my strength when I go out Carol I go to the grocery store we go to Walmart on the occasion when we have to whenever I make my yearly visit to the mall and for the for you people that like that place come here right now let me pray for you and I see somebody crippled I see somebody sick I see somebody going you know physically there's just something in my heart brother Joel there just something in my heart I I just want to go up to and say can I pray for you I don't do it all the time of course but there's just something in my heart I can't see that I see somebody crying I see them in the hospital all the time see somebody crying and they've had bad news or whatever I just I want to go to them Lance say is there something I could say to you or is there something I could do you saying boy I wish I was like that I wish I was like that let me tell you something that comes with a great price it keeps you tore all two pieces cuz everywhere you look there's hurting people everywhere that's right do I wish I wasn't that way no I'm not going to say that cuz my father chose me for that humanly do I wish it was less yeah let me be honest and straightforward with you today I wish I was still the pastor of the Church of brother Luther's Pastor I didn't want to come here years ago it was not my desire to come here years ago and if God would have showed me this place right here I'd have probably got a butcher knife and cut my throat I said there ain't no way there no if somebody prophesied that to me I said you're anointed of the devil that's a lying Spirit on you if you would have told me a little ignoramus Kentucky hillbilly would fly all over the world and preach the gospel I'd probably said you're lying do I like it do I want to go NOP I got more invitations in the month of January for the year of 25 on over into 26 that I've had in years of my life come here come there preach here preach here come here come there and you know where I want to go nowhere I like preaching to you all I like staying right here I don't want to go nowhere but then I've got this something that I think but Lord do you want me to so what and you think oh my everything is so easy it's just so easy no I'm called to do things I don't want to do that's right is that ringing true to the rest of you all you all are going to be called to have to do things for God yes sir that you don't want to do life is not filled with pleasures and all of our choices and all the things that we want to do true yes it's not the way God makes his bread amen some are chosen by God that he will take their heart and break it he will break their heart and give them strength to endure it and they look at other Christians and they think how do they get by so easy so what do we want to be today Word of Life Brother Don what do I need to do to come here to church what what do I need to get a membership who do I see to put my name on the book we ain't got no book who do I need to talk to how to join you can talk to me I can tell you it's easy we don't join we're born in that's what we want and brother Donnie what's the ultimate what's the ultimate goal that you're trying to get us to reach every church has a has a vision I can tell you that my vision for for you and for myself is to be a house that almighty God can live in oh yeah and that people can still see God as a forgiver because not only do they they experience it of their sins but they see him forgiving through me and forgiving through you and ministering and loving how many he wants that with all your heart to do come and bow our heads God bless you Sint to love you so much heavenly father as we have our heads bowed today Lord to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken I pray Lord Jesus that you would just move across this place with your presence Lord as I see myself and I'm getting older I see different traits of my mama of my daddy I'll watch Harry and certain ways that he does and I'm sure he watches me the same way when I get to see my other siblings and I look at them and I see traits that they're picking up like our family members acting like talking like or whatever it is we don't have to study we don't have to get up every day I don't know that I've ever seen it so pronounced in a family as it is the Arnold family brother Homer Arnold's Family been around several different ones of them and just to see from one to the other his brothers and different ones and just certain things you'd see about them and think just exactly like brother Homer was do they have to study to become that do they have to take 15 years of uh education on this and that and the other it's embedded in them somehow Lord God May these things that we're talking about may they become so real to us it's a second nature for us to forgive and we know what always deal with our flesh and the thing will be which one pulls the trigger first even though we're a new creature we're still a new creation in the same old Temple and when we're faced with opposition and we're being tried which one will pull the trigger first and the flesh will always try to jump ahead of the soul and the flesh will be the one that'll want to respond first so somebody says something does something to us the flesh wants to beat the soul and the thing you're wanting us to do is let you from the soul live out of us let you Reign you to rule that's what I want Jesus I have to be honest before you and these people today I've not always done that Lord and I feel I could say for most of them they've not always done that either they've let the body the flesh the senses react and sit of waiting or some of them wear that little uh silicone bracelet on their arm wwjc or JD or what would Jesus do what would Jesus see and how would Jesus react I don't want something like got just on my arm I want it embedded in my soul oh granny to us today Lord Jesus we worship you father how many here with me today like to raise your hand say God remember me be mindful of me Lord let me have your faith your virtue your knowledge your forgiveness and I know friends been your pastor I know many of you you've you've suffered terrible things at the hand of people and you may always remember what they've done but the phenomenal thing about it is you can forgive them from your heart and yet your mind still remember this ter terrible thing that they did or said or whatever it was to you oh Hallelujah I wonder if it'd be asking too much for the choir to come back up and sing that song that they sang for us a while AG go while we're while we're praying could youall do that for us let's just raise our hands before God by doing that you're signifying God I have needs today I have needs today Lord maybe some of you sick some of you maybe need the Holy Ghost some of you are burdened about a son a daughter whatever it is some of you needing those virtues some of you may have an unforgiving spirit because people have abused you people have taken advantage of you in your life and you think I could never forgive them well maybe you can't you may be telling the truth but I believe Jesus in you can would you mind if we just take her hand lay over on the shoulder of the individual Val you there let's just offer prayer for each other today hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus father I think we've come to recognize that we're not leaving this world as a whole until every member of the bride of Christ is inner position that with the in will be a great miracle for all over the world you have got your people spread and not only will the people here the elect of God in this assembly arrive at that spot where faith will be from edge to edge in the First Foundation virtue from edge to edge on up on up on up and then the Dynamics of that church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost the prophet likened it to a tube that instead of having an old coal patch put on top of it that it's vulcanized and then you and the tube become one I read that quote the other day Lord and I typed it in as a note underneath that quote the original YouTube that's exactly what you want us to be that we become so vulcanized by the spirit of God that your own love and mercy and virtues is manifesting itself to us and we know Lord hearing these things we're going to be tried some already are being we know that we'll be tried when we hear it and we make up our mind we want this to be in our life and it's our possession our inheritance we'll be tried but let us not be alarmed and surprised Lord God let it grow in us let it mature in us maybe not be walking Miracles just because of quit cursing and quit drinking and quit running around with somebody else's wife but because we love like Jesus we forgive like Jesus oh help us Lord God God I pray we worship you father can we worship together while they sing wasn't you blessed a while ago that song thank you all for the
