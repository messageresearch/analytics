the preacher don't bring this in his briefcase or on his iPad but every service is so impacted by you folks right there if God can ever get it over to you as an individual what a great great responsibility that you have but also what a great input that you have then it would help us to not just look at the preacher well I've Got Confidence in the preacher he's preached for so long he knows how to do it and he knows all that he may know a few things he may know how to study he may know how to even put things together but he's not the the one that controls it he's not the one that controls even the way it flows and how the direction God will move it that's up to you so let's open our hearts tonight shall we amen how many come expecting the Lord to move for us tonight start out

tonight with you and want to say how much we appreciate the opportunity to be able to be here and our pastor was just down with us in in Middle Tennessee and he done outstanding just outstanding you'd certainly been proud of him the people was blessed amen but we come to another service tonight believe the Lord's going to speak to us by his word and our God never disappoints amen we want to go to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 32 tonight Deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 7 Deuteronomy 32 and 7 I just want to follow the leadership of the Lord tonight something just real simple I told brother darl I'm almost embarrassed it's so simple but sometimes God works in the Simplicity of things doesn't he amen Deuteronomy chap 32:7 remember the days of old and consider the years of many generations ask the father and he'll show thee thy elders and they will tell thee when the most high divided to the nation their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel that's right for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in the desert land aren't you thankful God can find you he found him in a desert land and in the waste of the howling Wilder Wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye verse 11 as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings look at this as an eagle stirreth up her nest to stir up to cause to move to Rouse awake to awaken I like this last one to incite movement so the Eagle's responsibility to her young is to never allow them to get to the place to where they become complacent being in the nest so what they do is she comes and she stir up the nest which means to awaken verse 12 and so did the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields he made him to suck honey out of the Rock and oil out of the flinty rock Matthew chap 24 verse 28 just one verse of scripture there for wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles be gathered together can we buy our hearts now as we just ask the Lord to bless the word father we're so thankful to be here tonight Lord in this place and we ask Lord that you would just come now that you would move Among Us Lord we know that you're mindful of every need that is in the place this building tonight and Lord we're just asking that you would come and help each one may you take your word and may you direct it to the lives of your people Lord I just believe Lord that you've just led me to go down this direction and we just want to be obedient Lord to your leadership and we pray Lord that you'd come have your way in this place tonight may your spirit may it move Among Us Lord May the anointing just flow Lord in this place as we all just yield ourselves into your presence Lord may you come have your way Lord may you help us tonight we are in such need of you once again may you come and speak to the lives and the heart of your people in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you tonight you can be seated I want to begin tonight with a statement out the message as an eagle stir up her nest and this is one of the first places where the Prophet actually deals with this type of the eagle and I'd like to speak on that tonight out out of verse 11 as an eagle sth up her nest and I want to um give you this statement as we're going to try to work toward this this evening he says the Prophet here speaking he's talking of course principally about Jacob and how that there was no other God before him he knew no other God but as he said as the eagle stirreth up her nest it's a time that when the eagle thinks that her little ones has matured enough she's got to stir up her nest and God does the same thing in his church when we have got all settled down on something then God stirs The Nest again he brought Martin Luther from Catholicism and they got so starchy that he had to stir the nest and he sent Wesley in and then Wesley got so starchy he stirred the nest and sent Pentecost in and it's I love this statement it's Nest durring time again because we've gotten settled down we know that whenever Moses is writing this at the end of of his ministry and Moses is one that had actually likened the Journey of Israel to an eagle as he tells them that God has bore them on the wings of an eagle and God here is dealing with Jacob and we know that Jacob was going to be the one which would be the top of his people of what his people was going to be named after so whenever God deals with his children which we know are the called of God the chosen of God the elect of God that God would lead him that God would separate him and that God would bring him to a place where Jacob was going to come by to to a birth to be able to actually not just have the birthright but have this great desire for what God has in store for him in his journey and God divided his inheritance as it would be with Israel he was going to divide his inheritance with Israel as he does to Israel the same thing he does to Jacob he's got to bring him to a place of re receiving his inheritance and God once he begins to deal with his people God never wanted Israel to get to the place of being settled but of course it's the nature of man he loves to be able to settle and he loves to become compl it with what God done yesterday or with what God done last week what God done 20 years ago 30 years ago and some people in Christ become settled with what God done last month but God never wants us to get to the place to where we become settled in our walk settled in our experience but he wants always our walk with God to be up today he wants our prayer life to be up today he wants our Bible time to be up today he wants our relationship to him that whenever he's going to do something you have a little insight by the leadership of God that God will actually share with you and and move upon your heart lead you in the way that you need to be led but it's only those who is wanting his will to be done in their life so whenever we get to a place in life to where we become settled down and we become comfortable with going to church comfortable being around the message comfortable having truth having profit knowing the interpretation of the scripture knowing the interpretation of the Book of Revelation look how go God has blessed us you and I can set and God has given us the understanding to the majority of the things that lays in this Bible when it comes to the Book of Revelation we don't have to wonder who the man of sin is we know who it is we don't have to wonder what's taking place under Revelation 5 Revelation 10 Revelation 11 we understand the revealing of the seals we understand the revealing of the horse riders all of those things God has blessed us with but with great Revelation and understanding complement can follow that so many times in our Christian walk we get to the place to where we settle and what God has showed us and when we become comfortable we stop reaching for more of God and hungering for more of God but the prophet tells us if you Hunger for More Of God he said that's proof that there's more of God for you to be able to receive and you realize God gets us to the place in life if you are chosen if you're called if you're elected you realize that God will get you to the place where he forces us to move and what he does is he stirs up the nest he stir up up our life and he forces us sometimes to get desperate he forces us sometimes to get on our knees and we call out and we cry out because God never wants our spiritual walk to become stagnant he never wants our spiritual walk to be something of what God did besides what God's doing right now so what God does is he moves us from one Revelation to another and he opens up the word maybe you open your Bible this morning and you read something you may have read it since you was a child but what God can do is he takes what you've looked at many times and he shines the light upon it and illuminates to you what's it do it refreshes our souls and it makes us so thankful for what God is showing us that is an upto-date experience with God but if we don't God to get us to the place to where we call out we cry out because he never wants us to become stagnant Paul said it like this that he moves us from one thing to another he moves us from Glory unto Glory unto Glory because God actually gets us to the place where he wants us to be elevated he don't want us to be from one glory and then go down and then living life a little while troubles come up and then we get a little bit down but he wants us to elevate and become higher and higher as Eagles he wants us to fly higher and higher and higher God never wants his children and he never types his children to be Earthbound people you ever notice that in the Bible that when God Likens his people unto Eagles because he wants his people to be able to soar the scripture teaches us that in many different places the scripture refers to Eagles and talks about the heights that the Eagles has to go to and it mentions the eagle more than any other bird that there is that actually he mentions Eagle 30 something times in the scripture he takes and Likens himself and his people unto an eagle Jo said it like this he says do not the eagle Mount up at thy command and maketh her nest on high and he's telling you does not the Eagle at the command of God does he not Mount up which means he opens up his wings he spreads his wings he begins to put them into action if he doesn't put them into action he can't go no high if he doesn't put them in action he's going nowhere with God but if an eagle wants to soar he's got to put his God G man has god-given ability has got to be put into action and he says does not the eagle Mount up on high at thy command and he's telling does he not Mount up which means to ascend to fly up to be lifted up and to soar Solomon tells us that we should fly and we should soar as the eagle does upon the wind he says it again like this in Proverbs 30:19 the way of an eagle in the air so it's not that he is going to lift up off the ground but there's a way that an eagle flies and what Solomon's referring to is it's different than every other bird that there is that an eagle has the ability Amen to be able to soar higher than any other bird so why does he use the eagle so much because of the ability that it can take and fly so high up in the air and not just the way not just that it flies it's the way that it flies you realize that an eagle he actually flies about 10% and he Soares about 90% about 10% he actually has to take his wings and actually work and you know they tell us that an eagle has the ability to fly somewhere around 40 m an hour when he puts his wings into action oh my so he speeds up and the more He Flops his wings the faster that he goes and the more that he understands how to use the wind currents The Soaring of the eagle uses the wind to be able to fly higher and higher and higher I Saw an Eagle not too long ago there outside our backyard and this Eagle had been pursed up in a tree and a crow had come by and whatever that eagle had done that Crow was not happy and so the crow keeps keeps attacking the eagle over and over and I watched as the eagle leaves the branch because he got tired of the crow flooding around him and crying around so he leaves the branch and he starts going higher and higher and higher I was impress ressed with how high the crow could fly but finally the eagle got so high that the crow had to turn around and go back to the earth I think tonight we can learn a lesson that God has given us the ability to fly higher than the rest of the crows of the world the buzzards and the vultures he's given an eagle the ability to fly higher than any other bird there is it's the way that the eagle flies in the air so it's the manner of the eagle he's carried by the wind up into the Heavenly Spirits he can soar in places 10,000 ft in the air that the eagle can sore and God Likens his people unto Eagles and he tells that Moses actually tells us in the book of Exodus 19 and he said you've seen what I did to the Egyptian crows and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself what's he telling you I want to let you know as the eagle I come to the nest where you was at when I seen you down in bondage and I seen you down in the mud pits I want to let you know the eagle come down to where you was at and he took you upon his wings and he bear you up you know why they couldn't do it by themselves had time went on they would have stayed right there in the mud pits but because Jehovah Eagle amen was watching over his people he come down to where they was at and he bore them on the wings of an eagle Isaiah says it like this in Isaiah 40 and 31 but they here's your favorite one but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles so God Likens his church the Eagles but let me tell you this we cannot soar by ourselves we cannot fly alone but if we wait upon the Lord if we wait upon the Lord not only will he give us the strength to be able to fly but when we become weak and we lose our strength and we lose our joy and we lose our Victory we got a promise that if I get down he will renew my strength back to me so I can mount up with wings as an eagle and over and over we could go and the scripture teaches that God Likens him and his people unto Eagles there's something about that whenever you see an eagle soaring and amazing when you're going down the road you never look outside the window go well there's a vulture and everybody oh my there's a vulture there's a crow where's that Crow at but when you say there's an eagle you got the attention of everybody in the car you know why it's a unique bird and an eagle has attributes that every other bird does not [Applause] possess Hallelujah I said they possess an attribute where they can fly higher they can go higher than than anything else that's one of the attributes that an eagle has that's the reason why a eagle never fears storms he never feels fears trouble he never fears wind because he knows if it gets too bad all he has to do is just set his wings upon upon the wind and it'll carry him up above the storm wouldn't that do good if we would understand that tonight we don't have to fear one thing all we have to do is learn how to surrender to the wind and amen and yield to the wind and allow the wind to be able to carry us up above our trouble and our problems not that we don't have them but we don't have to look at it like everybody else and we don't have to live like it like everybody else something about an eagle flying it motivates us something about an eagle s it it pulls on us it makes us it motivates us let me tell you why nobody wants to be locken into a chicken do you nobody wants to be like a chicken nobody wants to scratch around on the ground Peck around on the ground amen remember a chicken's a bird too but the prophet said I heard him say today he's an Earthbound bird I don't want to be likeing unto a chicken but let me tell you he's a bird he's got Wings he's got beaks but let me tell you a chicken does not have the attri rute in him to be able to soar he's got temporary things he's got temporary blessings he's got temporary flight he can jump up and he can jump down he can jump up and he can jump down but I don't want to just jump up and down I want to be able to soar I don't want to be a chicken that can flop around I want the ability that when trouble comes in that I can soar upon the wind the heavens is not the calling of the chicken that's not his inheritance that's not his allotment he is a bird with limited ability can I preach to you tonight no true Christian wants to be limited no believer wants to be limited we are called by God to soar Paul says it like this in Ephesians 1 and three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in barnyards and caves in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the believer's position is not in the Barnard it's not in the woods somewhere it's not in the Earthbound part of the world but it's Heavenly places in Christ Jesus notice the way that Paul says he's blessed us there's some birds that are not blessed that way there's crows that are not blessed that way vultures are not blessed the way that an eagle but if you're an eagle of God you've been blessed not with some all spiritual blessings Hallelujah we've been called in Heavenly Heights amen that's the position that God has elected us to that's the allotment of an eagle and that's the inheritance of a eagle but let's just get real tonight okay like the writer said there's an eagle on the inside of me he wants to soar upon the wind yeah but there's also a hip on me it likes to wall in the mud amen I'll say amen for you it amazes me when God calls an individual and God actually ordains a person to be an Eagle When You're called to soar let me tell you this God will not allow you to settle from what he's elected you to if that's your organization in life God's called you to be elect God will not allow you to settle for anything less remember he's talking about Jacob he said as it was with Jacob principally speaking about Jacob Jacob was not called to be a shocker Jacob was not called to be a deceiver Jacob was called to be a prince but in order to get Jacob to where he needed to be at what's God got to do God's got to stir the nest up a little bit God's got to come where Jacob is and trouble surroundings and problem surround and God finally pushes Jacob to the other side of the river where God can wrestle with him a little bit Moses was not called to be The Prince of Egypt Moses was called to be a prophet of God listen he wasn't called to be to be a man that that bind other men would change his job was not to bring servitude that's not what he's anointed to do he was called to be a chain breaker he was called to loose those are about he wasn't called to be The Prince of Egypt that would shackle man up and bind man up he was actually called to be an equal and he was called to loose those that are [Applause] bound David wasn't just called to be a Shepherd over natural sheep he was called To Be a King over Israel and I want to tell David didn't know his full allotment but God knew what it was David was called to be a king and let me say this you're called and you're chosen and God would not allow us as his church to become settled or complacent till we're looking back at what God did beside what God's doing that's been the fault of every Church age they build monuments where God wants movements at they get settled in what God did and how God move and what what's God got to do got to stir the nest up when God see him all my comes down moves among the up a great Revival breaks out what do they do they start looking back and trying to hold on we ain't got to try to take some Revival and hold on to it friends the Revival follows you you ain't got to try to lead people back to something if God's called you to be an eagle he'll send the wind that you need the sword and they'll give you the strength to be able to fly we're not here to Rally around yesterday or last year or 10 years ago or 50 years ago we're called a sar as an eagle every denomination and organization's done that and you know what it's brought deaths I said it's brought deaths but that's not our inheritance that's not our enlightment we're called to mount up with wings as an eagle we are called to be lifted up and what's God got to do to get me there stir me sometimes chickens are content with Barnyard ways Barnyard culture on Barnyard Church Barnyard Services somebody preach with me they're content with eating bugs they're content with eating fleas they're content with eating Li but you'll never find an eagle doing that we are not called to be earthbath everywhere a chicken goes he's got his vision down and he's looking now and he's focused now and he's constantly looking at what's going to come upon the Earth but not an eagle an eagle's not called to look down that's not his alignment he's called to look up he's called to look to Jesus Christ who's the same yesterday today and forever Lord if you didn't move yesterday you're going to move tomorrow he's called to look up that's what he's anointed to do it's continue to look up we're not like the buzzers that circles dead things is this all right we are not called to Circle lifeless things that's not your Enlightenment we are not called to Circle dead things are dead moov ments of yesterday God is not trying to stir us back to Catholicism or back to Luther or Wesley or even Pentecost oh no we're Eagles we got our high we got our eyes higher than all that we're not like the vulture yeah you know the vulture does he flies around looking for an easy meal on the side of the road right but we're called to soar I heard brother talking about that eagle and there never was a time that I go through Cincinnati and I see that bridge and says Cincinnati up there and you see the signs says Cincinnati Zoo that I don't think about that eagle that the prophet Saul in there and he said when he walked up to that cage he said that eagle had just about beat every feather that he had off of him you know why hallelujah it's because he said he was trying to get out of that cage I'm going to say it again an eagle was trying to get out of the cage and the prophet said he would run and he would jump and start flopping his wings trying to get out of that cage he would hit the bars and Fly Right fall right back to the ground so he was falling but he wasn't climbing he was continuing to fall because he's in the cage I said he's continuing to fall for and more why because he's limited to where he can go he can't go up to where he belongs so he just Falls and he falls and he falls back to the ground back behind the bars Prophet said he would fall back on his back and he said there was he would look up into that blue sky and he Hallelujah he would look up into that sky and he said something on the inside of him was looking into that blue sky and he said something was calling man something on the inside of him was calling him back to that blue sky oh my there was something a deep that was calling to the deep that was trying to get back to where he belonged that he'd been captured and put in a cage bound up and the cage you can't fly you can't fly if you're bound you hear me he said oh I love the way the prophet says it and then here is an eagle looking at a caged eagle and this Eagle looks at that eagle and he says if I only had a key to open up that cage he said I would let him out of that that cage oh if I only had the key to let him out in other words if I had a key I would restore him back to what he's called to do I would restore him back to where he's called to be if I had the key oh Hallelujah I want to tell you that God has sent us an eagle in this age with the key of Revelation that unloosed you out of your denomination out of your organization he opened up the prison bars of Catholicism amen and they give you the ability to fly back to where you belong at did you know that an eagle can lose his identity if he's caged up too long listen this if you cage him up too long if he's locked up too long he becomes dependent oh preach with me right here he becomes dependent on his handlers he becomes dependent on easy things he becomes dependent on what's handed to him besides what he fights for that's revealed to him he gets dependent on the easy things of life because he's just handed to him and he don't have to search and he don't have to soar and he don't have to hunt are you hearing me somebody I said he don't have to hunt and he don't have to soar and he don't have to search and he becomes dependent upon what preachers say or what man says or organization says and what's he do keeps him bound [Applause] up he don't fight no more there was an eagle that was in a zoo that had been locked up for quite some time and finally they said you know it's time to let him go so they got up that morning the handlers went down there and opened up the door and all of a sudden that eagle seen that door come open and you know what it did he hopped outside the door and when we got out there he hopped around for a little while and turned right around went right back in the cage oh my yeah he turned around and went back he looks around for a minute went right back into that cage do you know why he lost his identity he lost his identity he got used to the bars he got used to not flying he got used to Easy Come on somebody he become comfortable in the cage he become complacent in the cage and he settled for what was handed to him besides getting out and digging for a real Revelation from God's word and praying and being sincere and becomes dependent on everything that's given to him I say God help us tonight may we never get to that place may we never get so restricted may we never get so bound may we never get so comfortable that we forget what he's called us to be amen thank you Lord Do You Realize David didn't know it but he was called to be a giant slayer amen it's what he was called to be but what if David would have never went to the battle what if David would have stayed at home in the nest yeah come on come on he would have never fulfilled what God called him to be think of it think of everything that David had to go through to finally get on that Battlefield with the giant listen it would have been a lot easier just to stay home and watch Daddy's sheep look out for bears and look out for lies and and take care of the sheep can you imagine how much easier would have been David Goes Down to the battle and said when he got down there he said that Goliath's bow fell upon the wrong set of ears think of the things that David had to overcome just to get on the battlefield to soar David had to soar over some things his brothers tried to discourage him his king tried to discourage him go tried to discourage him fear tried to stop him reason tried to stop him Common Sense tried to stop him because to the human eye it looked totally impossible to be able to soar over this obstacle come on and you know what Israel was doing Israel's Army was looking at David the way that the Philistine Army was looking at David and you know what Israel was thinking poor little bitty David great big giant poor little bitty David great big giant but I want to tell that ain't the way David was looking at it David wasn't looking through Man's eyes but David had soared up into the heavens and he was looking through eagle eyes and he was looking through God's eyes and David was thinking oh my poor little giant great big God poor little GI great big God poor little goli great big God had David settled for being David Daddy's Shepherd he would have never become God's Overcomer you know why his calling was higher than that but why why would God put a boy in that kind of a danger I'll tell you why because David was just as safe on the battlefield as he was in the back field watching his daddy's sheep but when you look through chicken eyes and vulture eyes and and look through the things that are Earthbound you don't see through the eyes of God but Through The Eyes Of God this is what David's called to be oh could not be takeen the time it would fill us to speak about Moses and how he went from the Wilderness of the father-in-law's tent down to the judgments of Egypt how we could talk about Joseph he went through the security think about of Daddy's tent and now he's put into pontier prison what's God doing stirring up the nest Daniel went from a place so high to the Lion's Den look at Ruth she goes from a place place a comfort in her Homeland where she knows everybody she knows everything but what's God do God stirs The Nest up and when the old man dies now it's time to move on but I want to tell you if God's calling you to something higher he'll put a desire in you to be able to follow what he lead you to God wants you to go higher God wants us to be able to soar and if you're called to soar God will give you the nature of an eagle to soore Lord right from the very beginning of the book look God tells us I'm going to deal with my people the way that an eagle does her young it's profound the way that he deals with them you realize an eagle his eyesight is so Keen in the middle of a night he can see a rabbit move over a mile away yeah poor rabbit an eagle has than spiritual incredible vision yeah when it would be dark to every other bird and the Darkness would cause them not to be able to make out where real food is at that's not the same with an eagle they see things that other birds cannot see they believe things that other birds cannot believe what would be totally impossible for any other bird an eagle has the ability to see and believe amen do you realize that when an eagle mates he mates for life once they find their true mate the reveal word of the hour once they find their true mate it's to death do them part and in this case is you're an eagle even after death when an eagle mates it mates in the air it does a beautiful dance as it goes so high it mates in the air catch that their offspring is conceived in Heavenly places hey Glory so they come from the heavens they're born upon the Earth but after they're born on the Earth they return back to where they was conceived at am man they go back to where they're called to be at and may I say every Eagle of God is Born the same way we are conceived in Heavenly places in Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus it also makes me think if an eagle conceives several thousand feet in the air you don't have to worry about it cohabitating with a [Music] chicken right I'm just going to leave that right there for you he can't cohabitate with a buzzard or any other bird do you realize an eagle cannot be crossbreed with no other species you may cross spred a dog you may crossbreed a horse or a cow but you can never do that to an eagle in order to be able to make with the eagle you've got to get in the sphere aen where eagle soar [Applause] at they find their ma in it's for Life couldn't we learn something couldn't our young people learn something from an eagle under no circumstance should a Believer ever marry an unbeliever anybody know what you call a female eagle think about this a cow bull cow is heer deer Buck D donkey Jack Jenny chickens roosters hens but what do you call a female eagle I'm going to tell you you may never heard it but I'm going to tell you yeah you know what they call them Eagle I said they call Eagle it's Mr and Mrs eagle and God's telling his people I'm going to deal with you just like the eagle does her young think about it watch how he raises the N watch what the eagle does whenever it has young do you realize an eagle never builds its nest on the ground that's right I can say it better than that it never builds it eye level with everything else so they build it in high places or what we're talking about Heavenly places do you realize when the Eagles when it has little Eagles the eagle is born in high places therefore its sight is not like everything else it's born to view things from a certain point of view oh it sees from an elevated place and an elevated position because that's where it's born at and I'll say this when you get born again God does the same thing with you you do not view things the way that chickens do or the way that editors do or the way that lines do or Hawks you view it from an elevated Place amen I don't care what family you come out of when you get Born Again by the spirit of God you view things different you see things different things look different whenever you're born in Heavenly places Paul said it like this in Ephesians 2 and6 and he hath raised us up together he has raised us I want to tell our father has been raising us he's been raising you since the time that you hatch out upon this Earth and what's he do rais you up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen before an eagle lays its eggs there's got to be preparation before there's egg laying you know what she does she flies around looking for branches looking for sticks look looking for Thorns to build the nest out of so before the egg ever hatches Hallelujah the birth is planned amen amen thank you Lord the birth is planned and this Eagle builds a huge Nest some of them 7 feet round men Zachary's been watching some Eagles out of dor a we watched them for several months now they started just so small and now they're they're quite big and I watch as that eagle Nest it is so big and how that them eagles they got room to run around in the nest and they got room to move in the nest but you know what's odd you hardly ever see the mother in the nest she comes in she brings the food she pulls it apart she feeds her young cuz that's the word of God man shall not live by bread alone by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God beak to beak but she stays out on the branch so when the eagle builds the Nest he finds sticks and Limbs and Thorns don't miss this so the nest itself is a collection of branches and Thorns of the Eagle's journey of building this Nest so if you want to know where the mama eagles's been look what she's making the nest out of so it's a historical record of her journey making ready for this moment it's a historical record that's putting things together for the right moment and the right time and the right age that when you get here he done said you was going to come and he's already ready there's a historical record of eagles just like you sons of God just like you that he's made ready for this moment amen amen there Thorns sticks there testimonies of where she's been amen amen it's testimonies of what she's been through the thorn is a testimony of what she's overcome I'm going to say that again The Thorn is a testimony of what she's had to overcome to be able to build this Nest to lay these eggs come on somebody as she gathers the sticks and the Thorns she don't just come down and just throw them anywhere in the nest but when she lays the sticks She lays them in the right kind of order she strategically places them with the sharp ends pointed out the nest you know why she does that because if an enemy would tried to come in he's got to get past the thorns and the sharp sticks to get into the nest so it is a defense mechanism that's built into that mother Eagle to make sure that the eggs are safe in case a predator tries to get in unaware or climbeth up some other way and tries to get into the nest she protrudes the sticks on the outside so that mountain lines you realize a mountain line will not cross the Thorns Bobcats will not cross the Thorns so the eagle uses the Thorns as the protection Glory Glory Glory I said nothing gets around the Thorns the only way oh I thought about this a couple weeks ago the only way to get around the Thorns is you got to be born on the right side of the Thorns I said you got to be right Born on the right side of the thorns if you're born on the wrong side don't plan on getting into God's Nest you got to be born on the right side of the Thorns I'm talking about the Thorns that he wore that day at Calvary that made a way for every Son of God to be born again you've got to be born on the right side of the Thorns once the eagle a babies are hatched there's something that takes place that is crucial right at the birth of an eagle you realize quickly an eagle must be able to identify and bond with its mother when it's first born they actually have a term for this and it's called filio imparting listen at a biologist that watches and studies Eagles what they said about the time of the filio imparting they said a newly hatched eaglet has a lot to learn about the world around it and I say Amen the most important figures in his life are are of course the parents boy I'm feel like preaching right now come on on an eaglet must quickly be able to identifying bond with them instead of another species all right this parental recognition is known as filial imparting in Eagles fil imparting impr printing often occurs by learning to recognize the parents vocalizations so Hallelujah so an eagle learns the voice of its parents Hallelujah think about it an eagle when it is born there is a signature behind its parents voice there may be some other eagles that comes by but I want to tell you there ain't none like the mother Eagle there may be other birds that comes by but there's an imprinting upon this Eagle that it actually learns the voice oh Hallelujah remember that John tells us in St John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me no wonder Jesus says faith cometh by hearing amen amen again the biologist says birds can also imprint on their nesting site which can help them find their way back so were you Nest at uhhuh all right you might hear me were you Nest at that has a great importance on that little Eagle's life because if you Nest them in the right place under the right teaching under the right voice under the right word under the right message there will be an imparting and imprinting upon that little Eagle that when they get older they'll know how to find their way back amen they can come back to the place where they left he said the territory later on and the guide their choice and nesting sites for their own own young Proverbs 226 train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it again the biologist says in iglet grows another type of imprinting occurs Hallelujah in which they learn to identify with eagles as a species this blows my mind they have to know and come to the recognition of who they are in other words they begin to know they are an eagle they are is this incredible after around preaching rising of the sun talking about the eagle in the barnyard all of these years these biologists are saying that if you put them down there whatever they rais around imprints them they'll think that's what they are they'll think they're a chicken they'll think that's the way they got to live they'll think that's the way they got to eat so somewhere in that Eagle's life they have to know that they are an eagle so the more he's around to other Eagles come on somebody light has no fellowship with Darkness the more they are around other eagles the more he recognizes what he is he identifies with eagle ways he identifies with how an eagle flies he hears an eagle's voice he sees what an eagle is Mama's got a beak and I got a be Mama's got talents and I got talents Mama's got wings and I got wings he comes to the recognition while he's still in the nest he simply looks at Mom and Daddy says that's what I am I said you can look at other eagles you can pick up the word and look at other eagles you say that's what I am that's exactly what I am if they can SAR I can SAR if they can have faith I can have faith if they can believe I am what they [Applause] are I'm an eagle whatever he is is identified in the one that raises him every attribute that she has the eagle has amen watching these little Eagles there comes to a place in that in that nesting life at first it's such a safe place the Eagles get used to the nest they sleep in the nest everything they do they feed in the nest everything they know is Nest that's all they know is Nest until he starts growing and maturing and he starts outgrowing the environment that he started in I said sometimes you got to go higher come on we cannot stand with the same experience that we had and go back and lay the foundation Foundation again we've got to move higher God's G us Wings we got to fly there Comes A Time in that Eagle's life let me close with this they call it fledging fledging the mother Eagle knows it's dangerous if the little eaglet stays in the nest too long she knows it's a dangerous place if they stay too long or if they don't stay long enough premature fledging occurs if the nest is influenced by human activity you may hear me so it's dangerous if you get around too much humanity and looking at too much Humanity it imprints something upon you and it's a dangerous thing if you leave the nest too early and your experience ain't where it needs to be at and your prayer life ain't where it needs to be at you get in this place of fledging where you leave too early premature fledging if the eaglet gets disturbed by human activity it can cause the little Eagle to leave the nest too early and if it leaves it too early it can die anybody hear me tonight so then there's a proper season amen there's a proper season sees him that the eagle stays in the nest for a while he needs the safety of the nest right I call it the blessings of the nest but there comes a time that the Bible said that she's got to stir up the nest and when she stirs up the nest listen now the very place that was such a blessing such a wonderful thing the place of complete Security from every enemy cannot get to where it's at that place of Total Protection you real when a storm comes up and that mother Eagle sees the eaglet down there in that Nest that she actually takes her wings and spreads it over her young and she hides them from the Storm come on because the eagle can't fly yet and she knows if it can't fly that the storm's going to scare them but if the eaglet knows that Mama is watching and that the wings is over them they can take the rest in safety amen thank you Lord but the stirring of the n is the season to fly listen now it's time for the eagle to learn how to hunt on its own pray on its own believe on its own amen it can't learn this why it's still in the nest it's got to be able to fly and God is saying this about Jacob and God is saying this about Israel that he's got to come and stir up the nest listen they could not remain in Goan and be in The Inheritance at the same time so God has to send Moses now to stir the nest up amen right and now the prophet is saying this about the church think about it we can't abide here forever because our inheritance is not to be Earthbound our position is in Christ and he's letting us know it's time to fly so what's God going to do stir up the nest you know what she does she takes the sticks that was protruding outward and she turns them around to where they're sticking on the inside and the Thorns now which was covered up by the rabbit fur and covered up by the sheep skins and whatever more that's in the nest she takes and she pulls all of that out of the nest yeah that's right man Zachary seen it just the other day one of them Eagles that we watch on YouTube the decor eagles one of them loves to lay down the nest we was watching the other day whenever it got on top of a thorn and it jumps up oh Lord God have mercy it was laying there so sweet and just laying there how beautiful it was and about that time it moved a little bit and it stood up in the nest and I thought ain't that something God knows that we need to be taught to stand on our own two feet come on somebody so she pulls the fur out of the nest and stirring it up what's it reveal thistles Thorns pokes troubles trials battle after battle test after test all kinds of discouragements in life and discomforts but God knows you can handle it because if you don't you'll never learn how to stand stand on your own we'll just continue to lay around in the comfort of the nest and Lounge in it but now it's turn time to learn how to fly Slumber days is over drowsy days are finished when when the eagle stirs up the nest do you realize the mother Eagle let me clear this she does not as some people think she does not shove the Eagles out of the nest oh no that's pretty cruel actually she don't just shove them out of the nest that's not the way she does it but what she does is to get them ready to fly I love this besides bringing the food to the nest and ripping it apart and feeding the young she'll land on a branch just outside the nest a little bit and if the Little Eagles get hungry enough all right they'll have to move to go get where the good food's at come on somebody if it's on the nest we're going to be in the nest if it's out there on the limb we're going to the limb if it's at the Cliff of the rock we're going to the Cliff of the rock listen there ain't nothing more important to us than making sure that we're fed right and if we got to whatever we got to do to get where that food is and make sure that we're fed right and we're living right and we got something good and nutritious to put in our lives that's where we want to be at God knows how to get us to move he knows how to get our attention amen does he not know how to get our attention attention he reveals thorns and troubles and problems listen to this God's provided way see how God does testing God permits you sometimes to get a little worse after you're prayed for just to test you amen you know why he knows how to get the Eagles attention so he starts getting them ready some of these Eagles we've been watching I watched him today as I looked at him this morning when I woke up he was out on the edge of the nest working his wings I thought yeah you're getting ready this biologist says that iglet cannot wait to fly out of that Nest it takes everything are you hearing me to keep us on this Nest it starts stretching out its wings and figuring out it's got something to be able to fly with I watched myo this morning and she woke up you know laying sitting there on that Branch with her head turned back as they do and she turned around she's getting ready to leave and she starts screaming it was so beautiful she screamed one side and then she screamed the other and when she did those two little Eagles poked their head up you know what they started doing screaming just like Mama screaming just like Mama so whatever she's saying they're saying her voice is their voice their voice becomes synonymous one with the other let's stand our feet hallelujah praise be to God oh I love it don't you yeah think about what God does for you and I he wants to be able to hear your voice to be able to scream I loved it watching these Eagles whenever mama was coming into the nest before they ever get there you're just watching these little Eagles and you'll know she's coming because the little eaglets stand up in the nest and they start crying out and before she ever puts her feet in the nest she's already screaming to announce her approach yeah Hallelujah she's announcing her approach to the nest I hear the prophet say there comes a day when it's time to fly and she comes down and opens up her wings and those little e grabs a hold of her wings and she takes them way up in the air and when she goes so high in the air finally she knows it's time an eagle an eagle can fly 40 miles an hour but when it gets high and it starts to dive it Dives of speeds over 150 M an hour a golden eagle has been clocked at 200 M an hour in a dive and I thought ain't that's something you know why she can fly that fast because when she lets go of that little iglet and it starts flopping and turning and it's on his back as the prophet said one minute it's on the side the next minute that little iglet don't have to worry cuz Mama can fly faster than it can fall Hallelujah let's buy our hearts tonight our father can fly faster than what you can fall he's always watching you he's always looking over you oh mama takes them up on high she's constantly watching she's right there in case something happens if something would take place all she has to do is swoop down and pick them up and that's the way God does you sometimes he sees us sometimes we're falling and we're falling and we're on our back sometimes we're on our face sometimes we're on our side sometimes remember he can fly faster than what you can fall that's the kind of God that we serve we look at our lives and we wonder why we go through so much trouble some sometimes so much so many problems why is it because God knows he's teaching us that we're going to have to leave the nest and he allows things to poke up to be able to allow us to get to the place to be able to F oh God help us God help us we don't want to view things the way that man sees things we want to look at it Through The Eyes Of The Great Eagle help me to look at me through the Great Eagle ey Hallelujah than Lord Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord whenever Moses was coming to the end Moses would pin this in the word he would say it again in the book of Exodus 19 how that the Lord come and he says I bore you up on the eag E's Wings Lord we can all say tonight Lord that we've enjoyed the comfort of the nesting it's a wonderful place it was a wonderful thing but there comes a time in our life to where we've got to be able to fly Lord we're living in the closing moments of time lord it's time to be able to leave this world it's time to leave here in the Rapture oh Jesus we've been exercising These Wings like those two little Eagles in the nest we've been working them over and over day in and day out we know that it's time we know that it's the season there's a season for leaving the nest Lord God and we know that time will come whenever would be whenever you get ready for us Lord and you know exactly a Time Lord you know when it'll be I pray father May each one of us tonight may we be ready I pray Lord help us to be ready to be able to fly Lord God we're so thankful Lord as the prophet would use the little Eagle story over and over again to tie with the word that is coming this day to be able to get our attention we're thankful Lord that we've heard the eagle cry Lord thank you that we've got ears to be able to hear Lord that little Eagle heard things different than the rest of them heard I'm thankful Lord that you've given his ears to hear that we can identify bless your children I pray in Jesus name and everybody said spread your wings could you help us that brother Harry spread your wings how many wants to fly praise be to God amen so spread your could we tell him that tonight you can fly you w born for the valley no you was born to sore in the sky Hallelujah down oh drive your spirit into the ground this is what you got to do Mount up yes go oh let's just tell him as we spread our wings tonight spread your wings Lord we lift our arms to tonight we spread our wings Lord oh you are born for sin's valley though you were born to Sor the sky hallelujah or of your spirit into the ground so Mount up with we hallelujah hallelujah Hall Hallelujah do you realize an eagle goes through a stage of a molten period every year an eagle goes through a mol period and what happens is as the eagle flies in the air it gets to the place to where its wings it starts picking up dirt and oil and it starts spraying its wings and whenever the wings become sprayed it can't soar like it needs to soar so so what happens is the eagle goes down to around a valley somewhere in the Cliff of The Rock and as he goes through that mol period if his wings or his little feathers has been frayed he takes his beak and he pulls them out they say that an eagle can pull out almost 23 of its wing of its feathers and at that time they say it's such a dangerous time for that eagle because he can't fly the way that it needs to fly and it don't feed the way it's used to feeding so it's there in the valley and as it descends there in it's such a dangerous time because Predators can attack it while it's down in the valley the calcium builds up around its around its its beak its Talons begins to get soar and it swells up and it cracks open it can't fly and it can't hardly move so it just sits there in the valley but I love this because it can't feed itself other eagles that has been in the valley flies over those Eagles that are Molen and it drops rabbit and squirrel down to those are molting so that they can get SP they can get food in Du season aren't you glad that God give you that thing when you was down in the valley God sent you the thing that you needed maybe you need a little bit of spiritual vitamins May some good food maybe a good fresh kill amen an eagle never eats dead caring as far as maggots and something that's been laying around it want some fresh kill so when those other eagles knows what it's like to be there so it comes down to where they're at and it drops little pieces of food down to it and what else it does after it drops the food down from its Talons it begins to scream out words of encouragement to those who are in the valley friends that's the way it is when you come to the house of God you may get down you may get discouraged and you come in there you may not even feel like you can get there you may sit there and think you're not going to get nothing out of service about that time a servant starts dropping one piece of meat after another before long you go to eating the good things of God and strength comes back to you oh my well spread your wi [Music] [Applause] [Music] little the [Music]

[Applause] all praise the Lord praise the lord we still believe our God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same wasn't that awesome praise the Lord you see that last part that he just said is another reason why we need each other Satan loves nothing better than where an eagle is going to head into that molting time of their life and they pull away from everybody else they have no Fellowship they don't need this I don't need nobody nobody knows where you are you're in touch with nobody so when you get down there you won't receive nothing you won't receive no help you won't receive no encouragement I sad I said how sad you might as well just goad and face the facts we need one another more than we ever have in our entire life and you remember it's not God that calls you
