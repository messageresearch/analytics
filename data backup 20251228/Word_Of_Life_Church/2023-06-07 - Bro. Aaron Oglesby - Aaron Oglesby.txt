cancer he's been really really depressed I came up here and stood in for him a few weeks ago and I'll tell you he's texting me back and forth the other day and he he used to be a star quarterback in high school when we were growing up and I sent him back a text and I said you didn't lay down when you got the ball I said you fought for every yard when you had that ball and he just been laying in depression and his wife trying to get him out and do things he's just in a horrible shape and he needs prayer so I told him I said this is what you need to do you need to score a touchdown on the devil I said you scored a touchdown every time back then I said let's score a touchdown with this situation that's what the devil wants to do he wants to put a giant in front of us and make us feel like that we can't overcome that giant but like David like we're going to sing the battle's not mine it's Jesus Christ will the battle's not mine said Little David lord inside I'm in your favor we're giving it all to you oh I do not want to do I'm so glad you let me see oh you're really all that I need cause the battle's not mine I give it to you Lord is looks so tall where are the odds were just too high for the days I [Music] give it to you lord inside with a little David he stood tall and all Goliath he seems real small swing Victory poor little David because he gave the battle to the one with the record of getting things done he said the battle's not mine I give it to you oh that was not my Little David the lord inside I'm in your favor I'm giving it all to you for I do not want to do and I'm so glad to let me see oh you're really all that I need cause the battle's not mine I give it to you time let's make the devil real Madness sing his class first real little David he stood tall and though Goliath keep saying so small Sweet Victory and Rain poor little daily [Music] foreign [Applause] it's not just a good song It's a good principle whatever you're facing tonight doesn't really matter big little medium size you can bring all of your burdens to him and there's a secret cast all of your cares on him for he cares for you I remember an old song used to sing back in Pentecost years ago take your burden to the Lord and leave it there but we tend to take it and then pick it back up and take it back home don't we it's just that element about us humans it's so fearful to be able to totally trust the Lord I've never flown an airplane in my life and I'm too old to start learning now but every time I've ever been on one and got in turbulence I just have to be honest I wish I was in control I mean I just think I could do something I could be able to get us out of this mess that we're in but you know the end of that story I would have been history by now if I would have done that and it's the same way with the Lord whenever we Face things that we just think oh my goodness what in the world how is this going to out outcome going to be what's it going to do does anybody know of any battle tonight God's ever lost anybody none of us wow that'll be encouraging total silence so none of us tonight know of any battle that God has ever lost is there any one of his children that is ever forsaken no matter how wrong they were how weak they were has there ever been a time that he's not kept his word can anybody tell me of any instance God ever failed to keep his word wow there's not a governor a king a mayor a preacher a mama a daddy a nobody else that we could say that about so why is it we still get fearful but we do don't we we do and you know what he knew we would so this is why he himself experienced fear Jesus got afraid he got afraid because there's something about this flesh that gets afraid but I'm so glad that he allowed himself to be afraid so when I get afraid and you get afraid that we've got a high priest that we can go to and we can say you remember how you felt you remember how you were and you prayed to dodge the cross now I need you Lord aren't you glad we have such a king tonight God bless you we're so honored tonight brother Aaron to be back this way with us and we're just so thankful they went up to be the brother Ron this this weekend and I text him and ask him when this coming through again so we could be able to use him again so we're just so happy and so thankful so the Lord knows exactly what each of us need here tonight we want to just open our hearts and pull on the gift of God now don't worry about whether or not he studied according to what you need that really doesn't even matter here at the service Sunday morning the first 15 minutes I was totally and completely lost I had no idea where I was going where I was going I had no idea why I was going the direction I was going totally mesmerized and then after about 15 minutes something like that the Lord let me get back to where I thought I was supposed to be but you know what God has his way so no matter what you need is tonight brother Aaron mayor preached in a direction you announced it he announces Texas that oh no that ain't what I need don't worry pull him pull him in the direction that you need praise the Lord you see that's the thing that will never happen when you're listening to a tape I love tapes I listen to myself and if you don't you're doing wrong but you will never be able to pull the tape in the direction that you need to hear it never you just can't do it but a live gifted Ministry he may be preaching on the Millennium and you say I don't need the Millennium I need now I need right now I've got something I need and all of a sudden the spirit of God grabs a hold of him and he's just saying no no no no that's not my notes no I can't go that way but you have a need and God pulls you that way so whatever you need tonight let's just bring it before him open our hearts to the Lord let's just pray before our brother comes Heavenly Father we're so grateful you're that kind of a god we're asking you now Lord Jesus once again that you will just perform a miracle it is truly a miracle the prophet said one of the hardest things that you have to do is to get one mortal one human to believe another one so Lord God we're believing tonight that you are going to perform that once again you're going to take a mortal and anoint that mortal with your presence and be able to speak Words of Life words of Deliverance words of Peace whatever we need not only this visible audience but the invisible those that are sick those that are weary Lord God meet every need tonight we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said God bless you God bless you Saints it's wonderful to be with you again and just want to take the opportunity to say once again how much I appreciate brother Donnie and his ministry and how much I appreciate this congregation and many of you I've known for many many years and we've been coming to visit for many many years and we really love and appreciate you and we appreciate the friendships that we have here we appreciate your stand for the word amen and if you have your Bibles with you with you I don't want to um keep you standing long let's go ahead and turn we're going to look to Deuteronomy the seventh chapter as we get into the word and like brother Donnie said I just I pray that the Lord will take complete control and and get me out the way and allow allow him to have the preeminence in this service because we know that there's nothing that I could do or say that would benefit you in any way but when he comes and takes control when when he comes in anoints that's that's when things of Eternal value can take place amen amen so we're going to look in Deuteronomy the seventh chapter in the in the first verse and we'll read verses one two and three well actually we'll just read verses one and two right now it says in when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land wither thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before Thee the Hittites and the gergisites and the amorites and the Canaanites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites Seven Nations greater and mightier than thou and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them let's pray once again father we thank you so much for this opportunity Lord to gather with with Believers Lord and to be together but Lord what we're looking to now and asking now Lord is that you'll come and take control Lord every word Lord every thought Lord may it Lord find your perfect will and resting place tonight father Lord we're just asking that you'll not only remove me out of the way but the listeners will and allow us Lord God allow us Lord to allow the word to have an impact in our lives father we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you as you have your seats I'd like to speak to you for for a moment tonight on Total War for total victory Total War for total Victory and and what we're reading here I like how the Lord is speaking on on what he is going to do for Israel as they come into the promised land and what you'll find is he speaks very straightforward very matter-of-factly he doesn't operate in maybes he doesn't operate in in Hope so's because the difference between him and us is he doesn't have to wonder he already knows and sometimes we wonder how things are going to go and we wonder how things are going to turn out but God doesn't have to wonder he knows so because of that he can speak matter of fact and he can say when I bring you into the land and he can say and when the Lord shall deliver them before thee because this is this is how God operates when he speaks a word or when he whenever he makes a promise that word is going to come to pass it doesn't matter what he has to do it doesn't matter if he has to bankrupt Heaven move Nations bring down Empires whatever he has to do when he speaks a word it is going to come to pass we see that when he he told Abraham he said that your seed is going to sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but after that they're going to be delivered and then not only am I going to deliver them but there's a land that already belongs to them that I'm going to take them to now when you look at all that there was a lot of things that stood in the way of the Fulfillment of all of that first of all Egypt was a mighty nation and they were slaves secondly there was a Red Sea and then thirdly they were going to need food and they were going to need water and then when they got there there was Jericho there was a lot of things that made it look as if it was impossible I'm sure there's a lot of things in your life tonight that makes the situation you're facing seem impossible I'm thankful that I can tell you tonight that we serve a god of impossibilities because even though they were slaves Egypt was brought to its knees even though there was a Red Sea in the way the Red Sea was wrong back oh they were going to need food so it rained down from heaven they were going to need water so it came out of a rock the the the Jordan River rolled back and the walls of Jericho crumbled because God had said you're going to be delivered I'm going to take you through and there's a land that you're going to possess and because he said it all of those things came to pass so whatever's in your way tonight whatever you're looking at tonight oh yeah there was a Red Sea in the way absolutely but he said he looked down through Angry Eyes through the pillar of fire and the Red Sea got scared and had to move out of the way that sickness tonight in your life he's looking at it tonight through the pillar of fire through Angry Eyes that situation facing your family he's looking tonight with Angry Eyes and it's going to move out of your way as is everything else is trying to hinder the Bride of Jesus Christ from taking a Rapture he's looking tonight with Angry Eyes and it's gonna roll out the way because it will not and cannot be stop because the word has been spoken Hallelujah Hallelujah once he has spoken it it will come to pass Amen brother Branham says that when he speaks a word he has to stay with it he said it's already confirmed in heaven you know we've said it before the only place that the word of God has debated is here it's not debated in heaven they know that it is good that it's going to be the truth it's going to come to pass amen amen you say well brother Aaron my problems are really starting to stack up join the club you are not special in that regard my problems are really beginning to stack up and the odds don't look so good well that's okay because God tells them here in the opening scripture he says there are seven Nations there that are mightier than you not just Seven Nations but each and every one of these nations on their own would whoop you but by the way you're not going to fight just one of them you're going to fight all seven of them but I want you to remember something the strength of our adversary only serves to magnify the strength of our God it's a big battle brother Aaron is tough that's okay it's going to be the greatest victory that you've ever experienced in your life it's only going to serve to magnify and lift up the testimony that our God is greater our God is not here that the battle is the Lord's listen it's his tonight I can't win it you can't win it when we get to the place that we recognize our backs against the wall there's nowhere else to turn just step on over to the Tree of Life keep going tonight his bad his street is sufficient in your battle I believe that with all my heart tonight whatever you're facing whatever you're facing and as soon as he lets them know that they're seven and that it's going to be impossible for them he says and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them Thou shalt Smite them so whatever you're facing remember you've got a job to do you got a part to play in this Victory whatever you're facing today he goes on to say and when the Lord he says and the Lord shall deliver you listen he didn't bring you out to abandon you there's something that we always have to keep in mind that the same power that brought you out is the same power that's going to take you in there is a calling out and there is a taking in you may be in the wilderness today you may be struggling look for the rock look for The Rock You may be in the valley but there's water in your Valley he will sustain you he will keep you and he will take you across it's not just a calling out I'm thankful for the calling out but there's got to be a people that say I'm going in I'm not staying here I'm going in I'm going forward amen will it be easy not one inch of it not one inch of it's going to be easy I believe we all know that by now it's not going to be easy we're in a battle we're in a constant war and you're going to fight for every parcel of ground you take for every inch you gain and the Lord says little by little he's going to deliver them look sometimes you feel like you fight for a month you fight for six months you fight for a year and boy I bet I've made great progress I'm so much farther along three feet but let me tell you something that three feet was worth gaining that three feet was worth fighting for because it's three feet that the devil don't have that means I took more listen why is he after you why is he fighting because he wants the ground that you got so I'll tell you if he wants it it's worth fighting for it's a position worth holding stand there tonight say no it's mine and not only is this mine but I'm gonna take more I'm gonna possess more I'm gonna gain more ground we gotta keep me moving forward ever moving forward never giving up ground but fighting for more Ray Brown says now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on the earth just remember that you'll never have a time but when there's a punch going on all the time because you're in a battle did you ask to come to Christ to to go on a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle listen I don't want to be the bearer of bad news but the world is not getting better things are not getting better it's getting worse day by day by day and there's no turning this train around it's a runaway train and it's going down it's been prophesied to go down but that's okay because in that same prophecy there's a bride that goes up it may be going down but there's somebody elevating there's somebody Rising there's somebody gaining new heights each and every day and that's where I identify I'm not on this runaway train I'm not going down this way we got off that train it reminds me of sometimes you hear people say well yeah brother Branham was a god-called man but he got off at this point and he got off at that point I say you're exactly right and I got off with him I got off that train that was going the wrong way I got off that train that was going to a tribulation and I got over on the glory Express and it's going to take me out of here this Train's going in a Rapture this world may be running the wrong way but there's a people that's got a ticket they've got a token it's been purchased with the blood of Jesus and we'll ride this train all the way to a body change Hallelujah Hallelujah and while we're here it ain't gonna get no easier the devil's attacks aren't going away and you're going to be punched at until you're finished here but I'm not worried about it I'm not worried about it because God is a god of Total War he is a man of war and he is determined that your Victory will be won by any means necessary that's his attitude towards the battle any means necessary whatever it takes listen our God is All In he's all in but what he wants is a people that are all in not half in half out maybe this maybe that God whatever it takes whatever I gotta surrender wherever you need me to be whatever your word says I'll line up to it because I'm all in tonight I don't want this right here guiding me I don't want this right here it lead me I don't want to depend on this right here to win the battle but God I'm all in for whatever your battle plan says whatever your word says I'm all in tonight I give you everything tonight I lay it all of us I miss it I've got in trouble a lot in my life and it was always when I made decisions based off what I thought was good for me emotional irrational in the moment well this is what's best every time I've never got in trouble by letting the Lord lead me I've never gone astray letting the Lord lead me I say tonight Lord lead me where you want me maybe this job looks great maybe this college looks great but if it ain't what God wants for you it ain't great I can tell you that lean a hundred percent into him because listen I'm batting zero on decisions I've made I've been put on the bench but when I let him step up to the plate for me I'm batting a thousand every single time it works out in my favor the difference is let me tell you this because as humans there's an instinct in US of self-preservation we make a decision that's best for us in that moment God don't make decisions based off of this moment his decisions are Eternal decisions and because we're basing it off the moment we can't see beyond the moment and we're making decisions that may be right in that moment sustain us but he's making decisions for your Eternal good that's why you look at a scripture that says all things work together for good and I'm going there's no way there is no way that this is for my good but he's not looking at now he's not even looking at next week he's going to make everything work together for your Eternal good for the good of your soul so on that day on that day not this day but on that day you can look and go it was for my good it was for my good I got here because he worked it for my good amen he wants us totally committed totally surrendered from our own thoughts from our own ideas from what Mom and Daddy's ideas were he wants to where we can completely surrender to his ideas listen we get in the way of our Victory about as much as the devil does that poor devil takes a beating sometimes for stuff you did wrong well the devil and the devil and the devil will get you talking Mighty ugly about yourself because this is decisions you made you're standing in a place that you put yourself [Applause] think about it Lay Your Ideas aside lay them down and say Lord lead me let me get out of the way let my pride get out of the way let my ideas get out of the way anything contrary to the word of God let me get it out of the way so that I can have total Victory amen what do you say there at the end of our opening verse he said Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them we have to get to the place that we recognize we're not playing games that we're not pampering stuff and we're not babying stuff listen when's the last time the devil took it easy on you when's the last time he took it easy on your family when's the last time he took it easy on this church then why are we trying to make deals with the Devil we got to go in with the same attitude if I will destroy I will utterly destroy I won't leave him alive I won't give him no Grace I won't give him no mercy this ain't Church we're not playing Church This Is War this is real and tonight I'm here to destroy I'm here to tear down I'm here to have total victory in my life it's not games it's real war [Applause] [Music] it's time we quit sitting back and trying to out strategize him quit sitting back and trying to out argue him trying to out debate him trying to out thinking smiting and utterly destroy him that's what the word tells him to do here it's total war we spent some we spent way too much time learning how to live with devils instead of casting Devils out and cutting their heads off listen there ain't a message church should be out there teaching you how to cope with your pornography habit we shouldn't be teaching you how to cope with that anxiety and how to live with it I say listen it's time to go into the valley make the giant face to face and say on this day on this day your head's coming off we're not here to cope with we're here to cast out we're here to overcome we're here to defeat not make a peace treaty well if you'll leave me alone today and you'll leave me alone tomorrow no sir I don't want him to leave me alone I want him to come face me tonight and in the name of the Lord Jesus his head will come off we're not called to cope with the Enemy we're called to destroy the enemy take his head off face your time tonight Hallelujah we should be casting Spirits out getting people to the Holy Ghost where they can live an overcoming life not cope with these things amen listen Saul and his army coped with Goliath well he's in the valley again you know guys if we'll just stay up here and not bother him just you shut your tent door shut it he might think one of us want to go down there listen as we mature brother Donnie and grow in the Lord then Goliath will just leave the valley no he won't he's not going to leave the valley until somebody says I'm not here to cope with it somebody says listen Saul you may look the part you may stand up higher over everybody you may tote your Bible just right but you're a coward and you're hiding in the tent but somebody's gonna go down into the valley brother Branham said his boast fell on the wrong ears that day there was a new set of ears in the camp and there's a new set of people on the Earth today it says I won't be beat down I won't have to cope with it I won't live with it but I'm coming into the valley tonight to face it face to face I'm coming into the valley it's your Valley tell him get out of my Valley get out of my Valley I'm here to face the enemy tonight it's warm brother Brown says what we need is old-fashioned God sent heaven-born preachers who will tell the truth regardless who it hurts like John who said the ax has laid to the root of the tree and every tree that not bringeth forth good fruits is Hume down and cast Into the Fire we need preachers prophets like that who will bombard and use the judgments of God for ammunition to tear up this wicked condition that we're living in you can never rid sin by patting it on the back you can never read sin by educating people our programs has become demolished and have failed there's only one remedy for sin and that is Christ is that remedy and not Christ through intellectual confession but through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a new life and a regeneration that's the only remedy for sin only remedy for our nation it's the only remedy for our church it's the only remedy for the people Total War the new birth foreign he said there in verse 2 to utterly destroy what does destroy mean destroy means to put an end to the existence of of something by attacking it synonyms consume Crush dismantle and eradicate gut kill shatter smash wipe out this is what you are supposed to be doing to the enemy smashing wipe him out gutting good him I kind of like that one that sounds violent yep war is violent I say tonight we gut the enemy come out of here with Victory let him know I ain't backing up I ain't scared of you if there's anybody in the building tonight ought to be scared it's the devil in those Minions that showed up on the wrong night in the wrong place and their boats fell on the wrong ears I'm telling you tonight we're not taking prisoners we're not giving quarter we have come to be Victorious and take his head off hey it only takes one it only takes one and the rest to look and go if he can do it we can do it too brother Branham said they cut Philistines all day long pushed him against the wall and had them a big Slaughter I say we Slaughter some demons tonight don't make a deal don't leave here with it don't leave here with the Tormentor meeting tonight and declare war on him [Applause] it says that when he come and fought against them and taken from the people then God told him told Israel or Israel vowed to God if he would deliver the kingdom to his hands that he utterly destroyed the land and that's a type today if God will give you the spirit the Holy Spirit utterly destroy sin out of your life move on nothing can stop the church nothing can stop the church listen I understand that there's times that we're attacked to where we have to we have to defend our position where we have to hold where we have to withstand I I understand that but there's also a go and take it aspect of this battle there's a go and and take it part there's a time where you go and take the land where you go destroy the Destroyer where you go on the offensive you you don't just sit back on the defense listen I understand that we need a good defense we need to keep up the the armor and guard the door and all those things but Joshua could have had the best defensive encampment in history guarding the post sitting out there watching Jericho and stayed there and he'd have never took the land there Comes A Time of going and taking we sit back and let him launch too many Rockets over into our camp and just said hunker down bucker down boys hold hold there comes a point where we load it up and start launching Rockets back at him I am the Lord God that healeth thee by his stripes I am healed grab a hold of a rocket tonight whatever you need the joy of the Lord is your strength load it up and launch it at the enemy tonight and go on the attack and take back some of the things he's taken from you he had to move forward to possess Joshua was on the attack amen and by going on the attack that meant he made footsteps he was taken he was making footsteps and tonight you got to start making footsteps toward what it is you need start making footsteps towards your Victory listen walk in it walk on it walk through it walk wherever you gotta walk but those footsteps is possession take another step tonight make footsteps towards your lost children tonight make footsteps towards that broken marriage tonight towards a hill marriage make footsteps towards a whale body tonight take another step but it's such a far Journey you'll never get there without taking the first step and then take another step and another step and eventually you're going to step right into the victory that he called you to but you won't get it sitting still tonight you got to go forward you gotta go take it get out of the Foxhole and charge the enemy tonight Hallelujah [Applause] go get the victory what is it that David said he said this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee I saw the son of Kiss he said ah let's hang out in the tent the days of Miracles is over that says that we're just going to have to let that that that devil walk around there and there that we can't cast out depression have you seen the size of that pornography devil just listen brother just think about how much it hurt your family and um and when you think about that and relate that pain and then begin to come on Saul come on it's not time to be a sons of Kish no it's time to act like somebody that's been anointed by the prophet to go into the valley and take the enemy's head off tonight it's time to go on the attack amen it's time for deliverances in the house of God it's time for healings in the house of God it's time for your refilling in the Holy Ghost tonight hallelujah how many believes in that that you can be refilled once again Amen brother Brown said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost don't let me hinder that Lord pour it out on me tonight I need another refilling I need more courage I need more joy I need more peace I don't want to be a coward I don't want to be found hiding but tonight Lord let me declare war on the enemy let me go forward and take it tonight amen hey man Deuteronomy 12 1. I said these are the statutes and judgments which you you shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess possess it all the days that you live upon the Earth ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the Nations which you shall possess serve their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every Green Tree and you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their Groves with fire and you shall Hew down the grave and images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place now as I read that I didn't find anywhere where they made any kind of deals there were no treaties signed to where well if we give you this and you give us he said destroy them he said destroy the places they serve their gods and he said burn their Groves with fire well surely brother Aaron if we if we'll just listen to him and listen what it is they have to say and maybe we can find places where we can we can draw some things from the way they do you know and and maybe we can help you know mutually benefit one another and and you know maybe we if we would quit being so harsh about certain things and if we'd back off just a little bit then maybe we could win more in burn it burn it cast it down destroy it don't even leave their names in the place burn the thing to the ground this is total war it is reality we're not to pamper things [Applause] I kind of have a reputation we're talking a lot about history so here we go during the American Civil War there were you know there was wonderful men on both sides of that war and there were some awful men on both sides of that war but two Central characters that will be names you recognize just to compare and contrast for a moment was General Robert E Lee General William Sherman you know Robert E Lee was widely considered as one of the greatest strategists in the entire war and if not only in that war but of any war and many of his battle plans are still studied today and because of how bold they were how swift they were how daring they were and and yet General Lee was a gentleman to everyone even to his enemies and you know we look at that and we admire that because he was a good man but he was at War understand that he was he was at at War and when they invaded the north up into Pennsylvania the Army had strict instructions and this just kind of shows the kind of man that he was and they were told do not interfere with the lives of civilians at all do not damage the property of the civilians we are not at war with with the civilians we want them to see that we mean them no harm even to the point that there are stories and I understand that down through time stories become exaggerated and whatnot but there are stories of men receiving severe punishment for tearing down split rail fences so they could have firewood at night and not freeze and he would come in and the order was though not to destroy any property so even for the sake of firewood they would receive punishment and things like that and then on the other end of this spectrum is General Sherman we all know about General Sherman and I gotta I gotta admit it's kind of hard to preach a sermon where you kind of make Sherman the good guy especially in this part of the world but General Sherman other men had tried to outmaneuver the southern armies other men had had the gentleman's approach they had fought a pretty War a poetic War a war of pageantry I mean you know how it is a war where people don't weep their way to Calvary anymore a war where there's no prayer lines in a war where you don't you know you don't you know you definitely don't want somebody to shake out a bobby pin you know just the forms of a church service and we've gathered for battle but but really are we you're a pretty War a poetic War you know a war where sin isn't called out from the pulpit anymore and and this is the kind of War as it was that the union was fighting it was known as a war of conciliation a limited War it's the idea that most of the people on the enemy side really aren't our enemies you know what I mean by that like this really isn't a bad thing this is a family trait you know my daddy had a temper and it just runs in our family and this is this is how we are it's not really that big a deal I'm just turned a little bit negative it's just my nature it's not really my enemy well I have a right to be bitter they hurt me and this ain't something I need to let go of they need to fix this it's a war where you don't really recognize who the enemy is so I'll eventually grow out of this we'll eventually overwhelm the South without with our numbers and Sherman realized in all of that the war was not getting won they try to outstrategize him they tried to outmaneuver him they try to fight a pretty war and they were getting beat on every Battlefield so in 1863 he began to apply what he called the hard hand of War and he did this in central Mississippi in the Meridian campaign and for the first time Sherman would order his troops to wage a war of Destruction says here it says Sherman's goal was to make Georgia howl we are not only fighting hostile armies but a hostile people and we must make old young rich and poor feel the hard hand of War we cannot change the hearts and minds of those people of the South but we can make war so terrible and make them so sick of war that Generations will pass away before they would again appeal to it German contended that the United States and its Representatives had the right to remove and Destroy every obstacle if need be take every life every acre of land every particle of property everything that to us seems proper and that all who do not Aid are enemies and we will not account to them for our Acts that seems harsh and yet I take from that and I go perfect that is absolutely perfect it's time we destroy whatever we have to destroy act however we have to act listen he says we don't have to give account to people for how we conduct this War I think it's time we quit worrying about how people think or worry about how we conduct our church services I'm not here to worry about it being pretty I ain't here to worry about it offending somebody I ain't worried if you think it's out of order I'm here to win I'm here to be victorious we will do whatever it takes if somebody's got to run to get free run I don't care whatever you got to do win win win sermons and I don't care about all that stuff we've Church ordered long enough and the battle ain't getting won he said let's tear it up tear it up if it's in the way of your Victory burn it down if it's in the way of your joy burn it down if it's in the way of the Holy Ghost Burn It Down sometimes things get in our way there was a lot of people in the way of those four men trying to get somebody to Jesus and they couldn't get in so they tore the roof off the place they took Sherman's tactics we're gonna do whatever we got to do and tear up whatever we gotta tear up but we're gonna win we're gonna get to Jesus we're gonna push through it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks I am here to win Hallelujah we got to get the attitude that we're here to win he was no longer concerned with people's feelings and what they thought proper sometimes I think we've Church our church ordered the Holy Spirit right out of some services he was concerned with winning brother Brown says God help us to get out of order once in a while the Trump you know some I don't know brother Donnie maybe this is a seed that we can all just spit out and that's okay if it is but he's mostly preaching to Pentecostal people the people that we think didn't have no church order that was a you know a little out of control a lot of wildfire and he's telling them God help us to get out of order once in a while what would he say to us he says the trouble of it is you got too much order I bet it cost us get out of order I hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved [Music] [Applause] that's what Sherman did he got out of order this wasn't how you were supposed to fight a war I'm not worried about what everything has done and how everybody thinks we should operate if it stands in the way of Victory we're going to burn it down that's exactly how Sherman begin to just fight we got to get to that place any idea any ISM any division any family thing we've held on to for so long that we think is so important if it's hindering you or your family get rid of it tonight get rid of it because it's not worth losing the battle it's not worth it do you think right now if Sherman can stand here he would care what his reputation was he'd say I won I'm sorry you hate me but I won I'm sorry I burned everything now listen I look right at the Devil and say you can hate me all you want but I'm winning I'm winning you can look at me and say well you're a little fanatical okay but I'm winning I'm taking a Rapture and maybe you don't gotta act like me that's fine but I'm gonna do whatever I gotta do to win it's total war for total victory all right Deuteronomy 2016. but of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth wow anything that has stood on your inheritance notice they had stood on the inheritance that they were going to possess anything that has stood on your inheritance spare none of it anything that has tried to stop you anything that has tried to hinder you or or made you think that you couldn't have it spare none of it don't spare anything verse 17 but Thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the Hittites and the amorites and the Canaanites the parasites the hivites the jebusites as the Lord thy God had commanded thee brother Brown says listen destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you he'll do it bring back the old-fashioned meetings in the thing and oh leave Delilah alone leave the world alone in that thing that Woos you off into little things you shouldn't the little things troubles come up in the church and you won't stand correction because you don't have to you can drop off to another church and things like that in the early days when a man when a man didn't cope up with the word of God they packed him out dead I thank God for every single church we got there's a quote where brother Brown says something to the forgive me I'm paraphrase that there's um booze joints on every corner we need to put a church on every corner I'm thankful for every Church there is but it's also created a situation to where oh he stepped on my toes well I can go to this church and he stepped on my toes here so I can go to this church and you create a whole generation of of message rabbits because they're Church Hoppers that's all they want to do and hop from this church and hop to that church and you know what they teach their kids you don't have to be corrected you don't have to let the word correct you you don't have to believe the man of God's anointed you don't have to believe none of that if he hurts your feelings just quit just give up just move somewhere where they won't hurt your feelings I don't know maybe that's not something you deal with here but it was just it is in the quote so we preached it for a second he says if in the old days if a man didn't cope up with the word of God they packed him out dead bring us back to Pentecost not Hollywood Showmanship but a wholehearted turn to God is what we need once more Lord oh once more he says in another place let me say this friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you now we're going to turn this a little bit for a moment because people love this statement they love oh yeah destroy your enemy before it destroys you they get behind that people will rally behind that statement they have no problem with it but what they have a problem with is recognizing the enemy oh yeah destroy your enemy destroy your enemy look in the mirror you got to be able to recognize your enemy and so they toy with things that they should be destroying they toy with pride they toy with unbelief they toy with complexes they toy with unforgiveness they toy with bitterness they toy with Rebellion not recognizing that those things aren't to be toyed with they are the enemy and they want to destroy you they want to kill you they want to rob you they want to see you miss the Rapture that's what they're doing if the people refuse to recognize the enemy and that's the thing about Total War is it recognizes the uncomfortable enemies Sherman was willing to look at the people oh and say they're the enemy well Sherman what have they done they raise cattle that feeds the army these railroad tracks takes the cattle to the Army and we are listen everybody wants to say yeah destroy the devil destroy the devil destroy the Devil because it's obvious listen you got two great enemies the devil and you and it's debatable which one's the worst [Applause] [Music] it is a tight race sometimes on Mondays I think it's me it's a tight race who's your worst enemy the devil or yourself but Total War recognizes the uncomfortable enemies it recognizes that little Devils grow up to be big Devils that little attitudes grow up to be big attitudes that a little Rebellion turns into a lot of rebellion that I can do away with that word turns into I can do away with that sermon and then you step off on a slippery slope and all of a sudden how did I get here you didn't deal with the uncomfortable enemies in your life you didn't deal with the root of bitterness you didn't deal with your pride you didn't deal with family Cycles you didn't deal with you oh the devil the devil the devil deal with yourself deal with the Enemy recognize it tonight he says after a while when Joshua took the land God told him utterly destroy everything there is don't leave nothing why could you imagine some of them Israelite women picking up a little baby oh isn't this cute look at it ain't even got teeth yet Joshua said kill it the mother said oh I'm a mother I can't kill a baby Josh Joshua said hand it here I'll kill it hand it here why it might look cute now but it'll grow up and be just like his daddy you can't baby sin it's got to be handled not with gloves on but bare-handed well I don't understand why that's so wrong brother Aaron I don't understand why I'm not allowed to have an opinion why is it that that even really matters why did Brother Branham have to say it that way well you know that's just the way I am and I I don't think oh boy well I don't understand oh boy well you know I think if we now we're getting into the uncomfortable enemies we're getting to the place that we don't really like to talk about you see everybody wants to kill the devil because he's the obvious enemy that's just obvious everybody believes the quote destroy your enemy before it destroys you but how many of us like to really identify where the enemy is and so because it can't be uh it can't be us that'll be or it's got to be brother Donnie it's got to be those mean Deacons or people really fall off the rails and it's got to be brother Louie's fault because the devil ain't gonna never let you aim the gun at you so what do you do you aiming at everybody else it must be them it must be their fault they're the reason and them and this and this and because you're so busy firing your weapons out there you never one time get them trained where they should be trained and that's on the devil and on and on your flesh this right here this right here has got to be dealt with this right here has got to be put under the blood this right here has got to come under the token this right here is your enemy the flesh oh we like to just let that outlet go up yep flesh is Miami you should see how my wife talked to me the other day now I ain't talking about your wife or your husband or your kids they're not your enemy little soul-searching a little bit of honesty so others become the problem but you got to apply Total War to you Brett Brown said God said utterly destroy the thing amen hallelujah what we need today he stops and says you're a baby and you around with a whole lot of things you ought to be destroying there's a lot of people would not have liked him for a pastor you're a baby and you're sissying around with a lot of things you ought to be destroying there's a reason that God demands that they all be killed because anything you don't deal with tonight will face you in the morning anything you don't deal with now is gonna come back around and try to destroy you at a later time you're gonna have to face it sooner or later so it's bad and as morbid as it may sound I'd rather deal with it when it's little I'd rather deal with it when it's a baby I'd rather deal with that bitterness now than let it get all wrapped up in my heart to where I can't hardly get it out of there because it stayed there for years kill it tonight kill it tonight let it go tonight surrender it tonight walk away from it tonight declare war on it tonight [Applause] we're going to look at this for a little bit in Samuel as we begin to pull this down first Samuel 15. and we're going to go through this chapter Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken now unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalek did to Israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and women infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass this is Total War General Sherman had nothing on this but this is what it takes to bring about total victory without Total War there is not total Victory going into verse 4 and Saul gathered the people together and numbered them and tell them two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah and Saul came to the city of amalek and laid weight in the in the valley I'ma skip down to verse seven and Saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest Ash to sure that is over against Egypt and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive uh oh everything was going so good everything was lining up so perfect but we have an uh oh and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword how is it that in the middle of Deliverance in the middle of victory in the middle of a mighty move of God we stop and let the enemy Escape why is it that we let the enemy live it's because we don't think it matters it's because we think there's value in it you think there's value in your opinion you think there's value in your ideas and so you put it there up against the word even though the word says get rid of it even though the word says destroyed because you value it you won't kill it verse 9. but Saul and the people spared a gag and the best of the sheep and of The Oxen and of the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they destroyed utterly well yeah it's vile and refuse we can see where that needs to die of course we don't need to do those things of course not absolutely destroy that I see where that's wrong but listen all of it was a link back every last one of it was a link back to the enemy's claim on the land if one was still alive they could say we had it first this was ours first it may have been years ago but I have a claim here I lived here before you did that's why you got to destroy your ideas that's why you got to destroy your thoughts because all of it is a link back to the curse all of it is a link back to this flesh right here that tries to lay a claim on your soul and so if you don't lay it down when you lose that ugly temper or you say things you shouldn't there's a link back and he says see I was here first I had you first I say the night wipe out every claim deal with every claim on the land this body has a claim on it it was not his first it was God's first it was laid out here before the world was ever in existence all the elements were here and one day it will resurrect it will not be a replacement it will be a resurrection because God had a claim on it first but you've got to wipe out all the other things that already linked back to the curse wipe those things out that attitude that rebelliousness that unforgiveness it's all a link back verse 10. then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and have not performed my Commandments and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night notice Saul did a lot of what God told him to do oh I feel like there's a lot of us we've done a lot of what God has told us to do but look at how God looks at it failure to do any of it was a failure in all of it we better quit judging ourselves based off the public school system grading scale 94 that's an a God says f you failed 98 I'm doing really good now listen all of us have fallen short we're talking about intentional disobedience I see it and I go no 98 is good enough there better be an effort to be 100 on every last bit of it and if you happen to fall short then plead the blood with all your heart plead the blood Lord maybe I stumbled maybe I fell I see it there Lord I'm fighting for it and I plead the blood for every shortcoming I have but an intentional disregard for the word in the least is a complete failure I want you go with me to verse 12 and when Saul rose up Samuel rose up early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him now notice the self-righteousness of Saul blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandments of the Lord wow that is a total contradiction to what the word just said about Saul Saul's standing there oh absolutely I'm I'm born again I've got the new birth I'm I'm doing exactly what the word tells me to do each I mean yeah okay so Wednesdays ain't that big a deal but I come by on Sundays every time I can oh no no no no we're we're living a good life I would hate for you to see my movie collection but other than that man we are Christians Saul says look what I've done look at how it prospers listen your Prosperity has nothing to do with whether or not you're living right brother Brandon would tell us that the hardships of life don't always mean somebody is out of the will of God and he said the blessings of life don't mean that you're in the will of God and we get so proud look what I built look at this business look how God prospers me and yet you're snared out of the house of God and you're going to sit there and say God did that God kept you out of the house of God you are so blessed that he kept you on vacation 49 weeks out of the year but those three times you were here oh it was good I'm leaving in the morning he says look how it prospers I've done what God Said do listen do not get to the end of the line and point to what you've done it won't be enough I promise you don't get to that place and point to well I'm a Believer I accepted the message I'm a Believer I've said this before and I'll congratulate you as well if you're a Believer congratulations you've reached the level of the devil y'all are standing on the same level he's a believer and he trembles he's got some of us at least he's got some respect and fear understanding the power of it some of us have done away with the power we're denying the power thereof I say don't stay with I'm a Believer say I'm a Believer and then go further I'm a Believer and I've been born again I'm a Believer and I'm fighting I'm a Believer and I'm pressing I'm a Believer and I'm leaving everything in this world behind yes I'm a Believer but that's not where I'm stopping I'm going on I'm going further I'm fighting for more yes I'm a Believer I thank God you're a Believer but there's so much more go attain it tonight declare war tonight [Music] we can't get to the place where we're like Saul and we'll argue with the word and we can look into the Bible listen there's no debate on whether or not there has to be a new birth you can look in the Bible the first Doctrine Jesus preaches a man must be born again or he will no wise enter into the kingdom of God look at look at what the prophet says in 1964 what's the matter today with the people a new birth they're all they all Dodge it they don't like it oh they have substituted something for the New Birth come up and believe and that's all you have to do the devil believes himself and you know he's not born again there's a new birth there's something that goes with it and it's kind of unfitting and untasting to the world we can't Dodge the New Birth Church we can't Dodge the new birth and we've got to start recognizing who the enemy is and be willing to die out to self you must go to the upper room for your self verse 14. and Samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears in the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and Saul said they they it can't be me it can't be me it's they they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed still trying to defend his actions still trying to deflect blame listen self-righteous folk Ain't Much on accepting blame they don't too much like like blank folks that have a a religious spirit on them they don't like to see the error of their ways it's always going to be they it's always going to be they and when you can't admit fault then you can never be delivered verse 16. then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night and he said unto him say on and Samuel said when thou was little and not on site West thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then does thou not obey the voice of the Lord but this fly open the spool and it's evil in the sight of the Lord notice how God interprets his actions so much different than the way Saul interprets his actions and Saul said unto Samuel listen he's standing in the face of the prophet now maybe not in person but on tape and on books you can look right into the face of the prophet into into the word of God he looks right in the face of the prophet and says yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought a gag the king of the amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites he has gotten so lifted up himself and is so has such an inability to recognize self as the enemy to where he values his opinion over what the prophet has just said to him lip to ear the prophet said this and he says no you're wrong I did what God told me to do I have obeyed the Lord that's just your opinion brother Donnie that is just your opinion I have done all that God has told me and commanded me to do verse 21 but the people took the spool sheep and oxen and chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal interesting there Suddenly It's thy God said the Lord our God Saul couldn't line up to the word he just kept making excuses kept making excuses quit making excuses tonight and line up to what the word says to light up to declare Total War on anything that is standing in your way listen I had to declare war on who I was I say none of this self-righteously I was a scum of the earth not good person oh surely surely I was and I sat and raised up on the church pew raised up in a message Church in a mighty good church and I was lost and I was filthy and I had my own ideas and I had to declare war on who I was and recognize what you've learned and what you know means nothing and only then then and only then could I truly be saved and filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I realized Aaron Oglesby had nothing of value to offer the Lord Jesus my opinions needed to Die My attitudes needed to Die My Rebellion needed to die so that he could live in me and until you get to that point you won't have total Victory I had to recognize it and dine out to self isn't easy dying out yourself hurts but it's something that we all must do I've recognized the enemy I see where it's at and now I want to lay that life down so that a better life a greater life a holy life a righteous life an eternal life can come and dwell on the inside of me I had to declare war on me I could have laid back as a crutch and say well my daddy said this and my parents didn't have a good relationship and I was hurt here and I was scarred there none of it mattered lay it down lay it down tonight say Lord I'm yours you take me you mold me you show me the truth and then when he shows it to you be willing to walk in it well I see that that I see it right there but Mom and Daddy said I see it right there but the church I was raised in says can you declare war on that tonight inside with the word of God can you side with what this is can you march under these marching orders right here [Applause] verse 22. and Samuel said hath the Lord has great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams now I'm gonna stop just a minute and deal with this if you know me at all you know I love freedom of worship you know I love it when the people get loose and the spirit gets free and people run and they jump and they shout and they speak I love all that stuff but I'm gonna tell you right now he would much rather you live a clean holy Sanctified Pure Life and be somebody that don't do those things then be a runner all over this place with sin in your life I just thought we'd hit that for just a second yes he wants your worship yes he desires it yes he wants pure Pentecostal worship just like at the beginning but he wants pure worship from clean vessels he wants the worshiper to come from an overcoming Victorious Life so I'm all for that I support it I'll never take your jump or your shout or your dad's from you matter of fact I'll throw gas on the fire when you're doing it I love it but let that same drink you give him on Sunday be the drink that he gets out of your life on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday oh we love to give him worship on Sunday then Monday he's at the well waiting going they were sure fired up yesterday where are they at on Monday morning to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken in the fat of rams verse 23 for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King and we're going to skip down to verse 32 as we wrap this up then said Samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and they get came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is passed this word delicately here says he came in a stately manner treading lightly but in a stately manner to let him know I am a king I I'm the king that has ruled over your life but surely surely you can forget about all that depression that I put on you surely you can forget about the hardship that I brought into your home and the anxiety and the trouble you've had sleeping and and surely you can forget about all that stuff and and we can let bygones be bygones and he says tonight don't declare war on me tonight it's okay I'll back off for a little bit surely all that stuff is is behind us I know I've hurt you I know but all that's in the past now just let me live one more day let me live one more day and Samuel said as thy swore sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hude a gag in pieces before the Lord in gilgal I'm telling you tonight the Lord will give you total Victory when you're willing to declare Total War if you're willing to draw your sword tonight and Hew that thing that's bothering you into pieces cut it up destroy it burn it tear it down be done with it leave it in the past and walk away from it don't leave it here and pick it up in the morning don't leave it here and try to carry it again cut it to Pieces tonight destroy it tear it up leave none of it behind make it unrecognizable quit identifying with it that's not your depression it's not your anxiety it's not a pet quit petting the thing well my depression it's not your depression that's not who you are you're a daughter of God you're a Son of God you're not called depression you're not called anxiety you're not called cancer or sickness you're a son or daughter of the Living God your name was on the book of the lamb before the foundation of the world quit answering to depression good answer into anxiety cut it up tonight deal with it tonight declare war on it tonight Hallelujah will you stand with me musicians could come we're going to look at Esther 3 as we close this whatever and wherever you've stopped short deal with it tonight don't let it linger another day because it will return to fight you it will come to fight you don't procrastinate don't hesitate to do all that the word tells you to do don't have mercy on the devil even for a moment bitterness has ate you up deal with it tonight unforgiveness is in your heart let it go tonight if you have a critical spirit deal with it tonight lay it down tonight we find Haman over in Esther is a this is incredible to me and I know we don't always put thus saith the Lord or stock into Jewish histories and Jewish writings but I found this incredible you know we find Haman over in Esther as a direct descendant of the amalekites that Saul was supposed to destroy and he even carries the name of their King agang verse 1 of chapter 3 and Esther says and after these things did King of hazarus promote Haman the son of hamaditha the agagite Jewish writings say that the leniency shown by Saul to King agag actually made it possible for Haman to appear because he had been had he been killed one day sooner one day sooner or the day he was supposed to be killed the great Peril which the Jews had to undergo at the hands of Haman would have been averted because it was in that time frame of one day that agag's lineage lineage was able to continue and led directly to Haman that one day let me live one day let me live one more day but you don't have to be a Saul today you don't have to be a saw regardless of where you find yourself you can be a Mordecai you can be a mordecai today because the Bible would tell us in Esther 2 and 5 that Mordecai was a descendant of Kish so not only do we have a descendant of a guy but once again we have one of Saul's or kesh's Descendants on the scene and God gives Mordecai the opportunity to be a cycle breaker he says listen tonight your Daddy might have failed your mama might have failed Daddy might not have took his head off mama night night her declared war what she is supposed to but tonight I'm giving you the opportunity you can deal with it you can fight it you can say It Ends Tonight my children won't deal with this the psycho won't continue but tonight we're gonna hang him from the hollows tonight we're gonna pour our sword and chop him to pieces because the cycle ends here it will not carry on tonight we deal with it tonight we declare war tonight there's freedom in the house of God you do not have to walk out of here with the same Spirit hanging on you that you walked in here with tonight leave it here declare war and Total War will bring you Absolute Total Victory God bless you tonight Saints I'm sure that God spoke to every one of us tonight one way or another no matter where you find yourself as our brothers so brought it to us in such an open wonderful way and we can see as the prophet told us our greatest enemy is ourself but no one looking around now just you and the Lord may the Lord be able to deal with each of us begin with me Lord all the way back to the nurseries upstairs to the sound booth to those that are in their living room maybe in their bedroom they're sick they can even get up but may the spirit of God deal with each of us under the sound of his word tonight that we will not only be just people who believe and people who worship and people who love God but people of War apparently the Lord's wanting to get this over to us brother Daryl just a couple of Wednesday nights ago spoke about war so the Lord wants us to hear it and to be ready we don't want our enemy to destroy us remember those quotes that he quoted there tonight was taken from where brother Brandon was preaching about Samson destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you both of those were from the sermons about Samson Samson did not destroy his enemy but his enemy almost annihilated him had not had been for the grace of God it would destroyed him so may the Lord help us that we can be able to look at ourselves now don't think about your wife don't think about your brother don't think about the pastor or someone else who you think has hindered you but think about you Heavenly Father we are grateful tonight for your word Lord we don't want to be the type of people that will bring a pitchfork to church and we will throw this and that the other well I wish so-and-so was there tonight and so and so sure needed that and more he sure preached on this person and that person Lord God we want to apply the word to our hearts Our lives our souls our minds and especially our flesh for we know Lord that it is a battle and it will be as you so vividly described it to us tonight until this body is changed but we believe that we can live a life that will bring this flesh subject to the word of God and it truly will be a battle because the soul being converted Wars every day against the flesh which is not but it can be dominant he didn't know neither do these people know but just sit and study him last night and one of our rights and I'll deal with Lord willing on Sunday will be the right to reign and before Lord I was going to deal with us reigning with you I was going to deal with basilio which is Satan wanting to reign in our flesh let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body basilio which means to be king so the Bible was speaking to people that were saved Christians but Satan still want to be king of our flesh oh Jesus we bring ourselves to you tonight Lord our ideas our opinions our scars our shortcomings our hurt feelings all those things Lord many of these folks laid down cigarettes years ago and it ain't bothered them since but there'll be many people that will be took to Hell by bitterness that had smoked never smoked a cigarette and we know that bitterness and resentment and sarcastic we know the prophet himself told his church he said pray for me because I have developed such a critical spirit I criticize this I criticize that it was not something he was proud of he wanted deliverance from it oh Jesus may we be able to look at ourselves tonight father not the way Saul did how blind he was to think that he was following your will so perfectly and yet he would not take what the prophet said he felt led or he was convinced or he had a some type of feeling or something and he took it directly over what the prophet's message was dear God help us tonight father I don't believe you've sent this word Lord for the church at sinking Creek I don't believe you sent this word tonight for brother Ron Spencer's Church you sent it for our church I wish this person and that person another person would have been here but I was here and I heard you speak to me and Lord I pray each one here tonight would say father help me Lord we raise our hands in your presence Lord oh Jesus it's not my brother it's not my sister but it's me O Lord help us I pray tonight Heavenly Father oh lord it's not that many of these people are living loose sinful lives but you're calling us to a higher place and remember every time you've done something when the prophet's wall you would say I tell him to consecrate himself a little more before the Angels come down he said consecrate yourself separate yourself from these men so you we hear not a call that we've got to get saved not a call that we've got to all be re-baptized we hear a call for a deeper walk we believe there's greater things that lay before us father and we don't think we can go into those greater things walking on this plane Where We Are Tonight We must come closer oh Jesus don't pass Us by tonight father we've heard your word now we need your spirit to Quicken it to us we need your spirit to touch us Lord so as Fanny Crosby said it so many many years ago while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by so Jesus I make it personal to you tonight Don't Pass Me By our Lord oh savior savior here are my humble cry help me that I can recognize my enemy father oh dear God that we will declare Total War the majority of the people in the South that mention the name Sherman they still don't like him to this day he's not very well thought of by Renity many of the authors in the South do destroyed much of their buildings much of their architecture and this and that but these very mention of his name brought a paralyzing fear among the people may it be said about us whenever the Devils mention our names may it be a paralyzing fear that shakes through hell Hallelujah not only because we are out to get them but we know who our greatest enemy is our self I wonder how brother Brandon would feel whenever we idolize his greatest enemy many of the message people idolize the Flesh of brother Branham and he declared that flesh to be his greatest enemy greater than epilepsy greater than denominationalism himself and yet many of us idolize that enemy it's no wonder then we idolize ourself help us I pray father to declare Total War it would be hard to kill the little malachite baby it would be hard to kill in those days a little jebusite we'd found it on the side of the road and it was crying its mother was dead its father was dead our human compassion which we find out is against the will of God many times would have picked it up we would have snuck it home against the message of the hour and we would have babied it and pampered it and raised it as our own and every day would have been against the will of God help us father maybe we've took a little jebusite here and a little ammo right there and a little hittite here and a little high bite there Lord God In The Name of Jesus May the spirit of God help each of us father to drag out our swords and start killing our enemies granted Lord God how many wants to be remembered tonight before the Lord that's your desire God help me to kill my enemy before my enemy kills me oh Hallelujah remember reading in the Book of Joshua when Joshua was getting ready to depart now and they still had not taken their land they still had not moved in and there was a move it's been several years since I read it and I don't remember if it was the tribe but Benjamin or if it was the tribe of Joseph when the Manasseh tribe but the Bible says that they let this certain group of people live and they didn't kill them and then it was like a plague that started among every other tribe and they did not kill them and they did not kill them and they did not kill them so it was a move among the whole entire message that they begin to let these enemies live and before long they begin to worship their gods their children began to worship their gods and then you find in the days of Nehemiah that the people spake in the language half of ashdod and half of Hebrews so they made their own language and it was a language of the hybrid to words that they merged it together oh God help us help us Lord how many thanks God tonight for the sermon we appreciate it you believe God spoke to your heart
