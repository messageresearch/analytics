remembers brother Homer blanken been dealing with cancer and they went to the doctor today to get another chemotherapy treatment and they checked his blood and all the stats and things and said you don't even need it as a matter of fact it looks like you've never even had cancer [Applause] that's my redeemer Hallelujah I'm glad we're serving a living God I personally but have a hard time serving an idol when you when you have a hard time serving a God that your wife was in their wiping the furniture off one day and she knocked your God off from the floor and broke his ear off broke his nose off he'd have to get a nose job at a you know a god repair shop oh I'm so glad we're serving a living resurrected Lord praise the Lord and it a privilege for us to be gathered together again tonight in the house of God we're going to pray I wonder how many he has a need to request on your heart tonight also I'd like to mention to you about Eric I know that you've been praying for and she's been running a fever since Sunday and they had to give her two units of platelets and still running a fever got up to a little over 102. they've done all kinds of tests trying to find it couldn't find it until this morning I did another test and then this afternoon I got the result of that test and it was MRSA many of you know what MRSA is and they called it a superbug I just kind of laughed and I read that meaning because I thought what's a Super Bug compared to a super god and a super church and a super race and a super hour that we're living in so thank the Lord they finally got her in a room this evening right before we came to church so we want you to be remembering her if you will then the Lord will just move forward and give the doctors wisdom to be able to know how to how to deal with it when sister Donna of Suson sent this testimony about brother Homer to Carol before church I told her I said Senator Erica that'll be an encouragement to her so she sent it to her and said you may be next praise the lord well that's what we're waiting for isn't it and your name praise the Lord so we're not just concerned about Erica of course I'm not just concerned about brother Homer we're concerned about your needs and your children and whatever that you have need of in your life so let's approach him tonight and ask him to help us as we look into the word as well Heavenly Father we're so thankful to you that we could be here in this place once again Lord Jesus we just love you so much this brother Dave said a while ago Lord we bring our petitions before you and our requests and our desires and you've told us to Lord you even told us by the mouth of your Prophet to ask for great things and many of them so we don't feel like that we're wearing you out by constantly bringing our needs and the closer we get to the end of the way it seems like the more needs and requests that we have but it also gives us opportunities to believe you for the supernatural we've seen you do so much Among Us it would be a sin for us to disbelief so we're asking tonight in the name of Jesus that should move for the needs of your children we thank you so much for that testimony about brother Homer Lord God thank you Father Lord we're just so grateful and appreciative that you move for our brother we're just thanking you for it right now Lord Jesus we'll just give you praise now Lord we have these other needs and requests that are unanswered yet but faith says there are already ours so we claim it we believe it as if though they're in our possession now we're asking Lord that you'll be mindful of Erica we're asking Lord that you be mindful of all the needs and the requests of your children that had a hand uplifted those that were streaming the service and many many needs and desires we pray father that you would just help us or that we can believe with all of our hearts now as we Endeavor to look into your word I pray that you should help me move me aside Lord that I can be able to just be an instrument is it we're a microphone that you can take in your hands and speak the words of Life Through Me in Jesus name amen First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. while you're turning that I want to say this to you before we read I have desired to eat this supper with you I have desired to eat this supper with you I've had this in preparation for several weeks and I had brother Daryl to speak of course a member of the Aaron it's been Wednesday night that I wasn't here going to brother David's and I said something that's been on my heart and I believe that it'll be a benefit to us you say why'd you call that supper well it's the bride's supper we feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man we realize why everybody can feed on this message it makes them sick at their stomach but it's right exactly what we need now let's let's read for a foundation from the master builder Paul First Corinthians 3 11. for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is now remember the Bible for the most part is written in the masculine gender now I know that that is so upsetting to the age that we're living but this is my reply to you get over it we don't have a queen James Bible we have a King James and our Bible is written in pronouns and if they don't like it lump it I don't care I've already woke in the resurrection that's why I'm not part of the woke because I've already woke up praise the Lord so every man is not just the masculine gender of course at all but it's men and women boys and girls listen in verse 14 and if any man's word abide which he has built thereon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by far so works and salvation are two different things and God bless his words you may be seated how many believes it works are important what you do for God what you do for others how you serve the Lord I realized that because of this Grace where that people so talk about Grace many of them don't even understand it anyway but they have so abused the word grace and when you talk about works and things that you've got to do many people don't even like to go that way because they get it confused in their mind what if I have to do anything that that makes the cross of not a fact no it's two separate things you see grace is what he did for me works is what I do for him so there's nothing we can ever do to be able to buy our Salvation to buy a ticket to Heaven there's nothing we can ever do never accumulate enough goodness enough works enough things so where we could ever repay him God is not doing a loan service to where God's going to loan us salvation and then God's going to charge us so much interest and then we pay the loan back it is a gift to you you'll never have to pay back for your salvation but that does not exclude works that we do and those Works can include so many things now for some it will be what they will do for other people it will be what they do for the church it will be what they do for the work of God in the sense of monetary some will never have a lot of money or they would be able to support books printing books building churches buying Bibles they would just never be able to do that but maybe they would be able to help someone that would be sick and they would think well maybe I could help prepare their family a meal maybe I would be able to do something like that it would be so small it wouldn't be small if they don't have any other means it's a big thing so the thing I've found in studying about works is that works are as different as the people who will do them and one of the worst things we can do is to try to to make people our example and say well I like what brother Dave did I think I'll try that not what you need to do is ask God God what do you want me to do what have you put in my hands and what have you made me able to do I love the way that brother Branham deals with the Simplicity even of the Gospel calls and how the God would deal with people when they ask him in question answers about people knowing their position and what they're called to do and he said well what I do he said I look at the person and I see what they're claiming they're called to be and then I look at that individual and see if they have what they say they claim they're called to do because he said God will work with his creature in the way that he made him now he said say that a man says that he's called to be a pastor and yet that man is a flighty type of a person he said God will never make a man and like that a pastor so his very makeup and his gift testifies against the call that he claims that he has so a person that claims are called to do this and that and the other Whatever It Is God will gift each of us in what we claim we're called to do so if a person tries and they try and they try and they try and they can never succeed and what they think God has called them to do it's probably a good chance they're not called to do what they think they're called to do so more than likely they're called to do something else but it may not be exactly their choice to do it oh you see there's the problem because a lot of times we have our own choice of what we want to do and it's not always what God wants us to do but God will gift us and make us in such a way that it will be complementary to the type of call that we have now you watch a man and whenever that man claims he's called to be an evangelist he's called to travel around the world and you watch him whenever he Parks his car at the med center and he goes in to pray for somebody he comes out he goes to the entire parking lot blowing everybody's horn trying to find exactly where his car is he has no sense of direction more than likely he's not an evangelist why he don't know his way around he can't get nowhere so he you know God gives an individual and the way they're called to do it oh people say well I'm called to do this for God and I'm called but it's killing me that don't make no sense to me if God has called you to do something and you're always so beat down with what God has called you to do it's probably time you need to re-look at your calling not saying your load won't get heavy and it will not be difficult but it makes no sense to me that God calls us to do something and drives us crazy batty while we're doing it I mean that don't even make any sense to me because of you God will call us and God will equip us and what it will do is it will make the common people around you be mesmerized by the way God has called you that within itself is a testimony that you are called because they have a little bit of an inclination as far as what you deal with and they have a little bit of insight of the burden that you bear and yet they see you dealing with they say how on the world does she do that how in the world does he do that well it's because they're called and they're gifted to do it now each of our works when we stand before God and I don't want you to think now tonight that I'm just speaking to the adults and our church only because every one of our young people are going to stand before the Lord Jesus and you're not going to stand there with your mom and daddy you're not going to stand out with your youth leader you're not even going to stand there with your pastor and we will all stand there as a group and then the Lord will call our name all right Word of Life Church everyone that attended come forward I'm going to reward you all at one time it will be an individual now every young person sitting here tonight you do not need to squander your use you do not need to waste your use but you need to go to God while you're a young man or a young woman and find out now God what do you want me to be I have no regrets but brother Donnie you will you give so much of your years to God I only wish I could have give more give my heart to him when I was 12. started preaching when I was 18. ask me if I have any regrets I'll answer you before you do not one the only regret I've got is I've failed him so many times along the way I do not regret giving God my teens my twenties my thirties my forties my fifties and the better part of my 60s and if I have 70s I'm going to give him that too but I'm so glad that I did not waste my teens and my 20s and my 30s and my 40s and then God finally get through my thick head that I was called to preach and then may start out in my 50s can you imagine how much time but I would have wasted can you imagine how many years brother Tim Pruitt would have wasted if he would have waited till he become 40 or 50 years old and should have started preaching when he was a teenager I'm so grateful that God has got people that realize you don't have to wait to be a 50 year old man or a 40 year old woman before you can find what God wants you to do works are something that the Lamb of God will reward each of us for now remember works and reward coincide together not salvation Salvation is set totally alone and this is why that a person actually that are saved and there will no doubt be millions of them that will fall in that category and their Works will be burned they will have no record whatsoever that they've hardly done anything for God because what they did they built upon the foundation Jesus Christ a denominational image that was not even true they built upon it an image of stubble an image of wood an image of hay but it was not the apostolic image of what the original Doctrine from the apostles so they stand before God and the fire will try their work and they baptize all these people and titles every bit of will be burned up they spent years in seminary the whole thing be consumed they was loyal to a denomination yet many of them will be saved not bragged but saved as by fire purging time trying time this is why the foolish Virgin Goes Through the tribulation period to be purged remember that in the seventh seal page 575 or silver three full purpose of the six seal three-fold purpose of the seven seal and it was The Sixth Seal was to purge the Earth to purge the foolish virgin and to purge 144 000. the reason the bride does not go through that time is because she's purged under the fullness of the atonement of Jesus Christ and she accepted not only what he done on Calvary but she's fully accepting what he's doing right here tonight which is the unfolding of his mystery but works are totally different than a person being saved now lot was a saved man y'all agree with that God saved him sent the Angels down there they drug him out he was saved but what kind of reward did he get wind up sleeping with his daughters having children by them and of course there was nothing but a thorn and the side to Abraham's seed for all of those years nothing but a sworn and yet we realized was a lot bright he was not he was a penny and Abraham of course excelled a hundred times over beyond what lot could ever do but God saved the man so be careful whenever you condemning some of these people out here because only God knows really wherever one of them will stand so if I ask you I'd be good to him because if I'd be the only goodness ever really see with me in Titus Chapter 3 Verse 8. this is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain careful to maintain good works now here's a man who preached Grace like none of the rest of the Apostles in the New Testament but this man also wanted the church to be adorned with good works he didn't just want them to start with good works but he wanted them to maintain good works listen to this which I believed in God might be careful so he wanted them to be careful so they didn't just start out doing good works and that they become slack and say well you know I don't know what to do I don't know what I can do I I just try to go to church and live my own life and just mind my own business and stay away from everybody else that's the exact opposite of what the gospel calls us to do now notice what what the word you're good I found this is amazing as I was looking at this good it's beautiful handsome excellent imminent Choice precious useful suitable commendable admirable excellent in its nature and characteristics that's what he uses to destroy describe rather works so he wants us to maintain things that are beautiful things that are handsome things that have attributes that testify of the goodness of God let me just say what a brother Donnie how am I going to know well this is what you can do you can judge the works that you do judge the treatment that you give to everybody Sinners Saints what you think of bride what you think are foolish virgin or however you want to categorize them and then run those Works through this description and see if it describes it as beautiful and good good and handsome and attractive to God's Divine Purpose judge your attitude toward those you go to church with well somebody's going to say Amen or just look at me now notice he said that we might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto man now notice he jumps down from that verse down to verse 14. he apparently wants them and us to be able to get this let ours also learn to maintain good works why in the world would he repeat this word for word again now I want you to notice the way that he puts this in here that it's not something that the Holy Ghost will automatically rain down on the people and once you get the Holy Ghost that works are just automatically rained down on your life and you never have to put forth any effort but notice the word that he used here that let ours also learn so how you going to learn how you're going to learn by being preached to you're going to learn by reading you're going to be learning by listening to tapes going to Bible study going to use meeting someone like that so that we can learn to maintain good works how many wants to maintain good works now this is the way we do it let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful so I want you to notice now that Paul links on fruitfulness was not very many good works so there again don't just think now that I'm preaching to the adults and those that's 30 and above but I want every one of you young people that are here tonight I want you to sing as well about the works that you do and how you treat your fellow young people and how that whenever you go to a youth camp that you are representing me you are representing our church you are representing first and foremost the Lord Jesus himself your treatment there your treatment here your treatment when you go to school your treatment on the job your treatment even when you're playing ball over here or when you're in the music room whatever you do doing there is a record book I went to God that every one of us would realize that there is what the Old Testament calls a book of remembrance that is being written so our attitudes our Behavior our treatment of one another the things that we say about one another behind one another's backs uh oh I can see this is going to be one of them Services where amens is going to be like hence teeth and as you know hens don't have no teeth so I'm hoping y'all ain't a bunch of hens here tonight I hope there's at least three or four Eagles okay at least heifer doesn't all right praise the Lord I'm preach them so you know it is something that God wants us to realize so in when our book of remembrance is opened up before the Lord now it's not your salvation but it is the book that God is going to reward you brother bear going to reward you brother Rob going to reward you by the keys so it will not be well I believe I believe I believe you suffer not careful we will think saying that covers absolutely everything but here was a man who who preached belief which is the Greek word pistus that's the word that it comes from and another word from that pistol law but it was all about belief believing but yet he also taught that there was works that must be done and The Works would not just start when you got saved but they must be maintained I'm as familiar with the word maintained it's where we get the word maintenance from so like you're buying a car and then you get your little manual out most of us don't even read that thing we thought in the back of the car and forget it but our little light built inside of our car it will tell us when it's time to get an oil change now you can override that if you want to and keep on driving that thing for another 40 000 miles on that oil if it makes it that far but it's up to you if you wish to waste your money for that then go ahead and do it but I can tell you what's going to happen to your rods and your pistons and your crankshaft that sludge were built up inside of there and over time than rod bearings they're going to start building up grit and all kinds of things around there every time you start your engine and drive that car to Walmart you're just like taking abrasive substance on the inside of your crankshaft and it's going to just keep right on the hone in that little crank of yours right away or you can take it down to Jiffy Lube or somewhere else and get maintenance done you see this is what the layer to see and Christians don't like they don't like Jiffy Lube preachers oh no they want preachers to just they want polished preachers they want buffing preachers but buff me real light now buddy buff me real life just give me a little massage would you I'm going to drag out the 80 grit tonight if any of us got any rust I'm going to take it down to the bone if you've got any debris and any buildup I'm dragging out the buffing pool I'm dragging out the big grinder well grind me Lord if I need grinding that's the way I look at it but you see it requires maintenance and we know that way our our building here our conditions I'm sure you've seen this gigantic units that we've got here we've got a maintenance contract so they can come in and check it and check the free on and check this and check that what's that going to do it's going to save us in the long run so they'll be able to tell us you need this you need to do that every so many hours or whatever and it's the same way with Christians it does US good to be able to look back and say okay so what am I doing what am I doing with my life what am I doing what's my time and you may not realize it now but you real as you get older one of the most precious things that you have is time time oh yeah the older you get the more you realize you've wasted a lot of it too but the older you get it's like you're saying okay Lord what can I do it's what time I have left I want to delegate that time I've got a family I've got a wife I've got children I've got grandchildren I've got this and that and the other and I'm only one man I've only got 24 hours in the day I can only do 3 million 985 332 things in one day but it seems like I need to do 13 million 975 318 things in one day and when I lay down at night sometimes my mind is still trying to catch up anybody else on the same page you say how in the world can you do it and if we're not careful we'll get so busy with life and so busy with things that do not have eternal value at all and we will let those things which are really the most important will put them off prayer reading our Bible ministering to the saints of God taking time to pick up your phone and just text somebody hey I was thinking about you how you doing today I just want you to know I'm praying for you you realize that text might change somebody's life that text might actually transform somebody's life to let them know that Jesus put them on your heart that will do a whole lot more good don't get mad at me now then you standing out there on the course and you're trying to do a little part of this and part of that and power something else and you're trying to do a hole in one I can give you a good hole in one obey the Holy Ghost that's a hole in one every time that'll absolutely transform people's lives now notice that Paul goes on now in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 and I find this so astounding it's a very unusual uh word play that he uses here he said let us consider one another let us consider one another now friend this is why you've heard me preach against you for years and years why did this move among the message is that people just stay home and they don't go to church and they don't fellowship and they don't be around the saints of God tell me please how you're going to fulfill this verse let us consider one another and I want you to notice he's not advising them now to be a busybody and to have your nose stuck in everybody else's business but he's saying that they should be interested in one another if you see and notice that somebody hasn't been in church for a service or two or sometimes we go on a trip and we're gone but you know what it shouldn't just be the Deacon's responsibility or my responsibility to stand up here for the first 15 minutes and try to go through the role and count okay to see somebody who's normally sits right there uh brother uh somebody help me I knew that's over there that shouldn't just be my place but if you're used to sitting by them and you've noticed you know what they've not been to church in a service or do I think I'm just going to call them hey you doing okay just why I missed you in church you you'd never know sometimes what that does to somebody to encourage them well brother Donnie that's the Deacon's face and word the message say that yeah the Bible tells you let us consider let us consider one another let us consider one another you see we're not we're not intended as children of God to be selfish and so self-centered and about us and our family and I my ideas in my mind me and mine God never made us that way what if your hand took that idea what if your hand your right hand developed that selfish idea tonight and it decides it is sick and tired of being attached to that right horn second I am so fed up my whole life I've been on this right arm I've never got to be the head I've never got to go to the belly I wish I'd done out to belly all my when you be strange looking if you had a hand right there brother Homer Longoria said he wished his mouth was right here that way he could sit right at the table and just pull it right into his mouth but he'd be very strange looking fellow wouldn't he so what if your arm or your fingers or something said you know what I'm tired of this I've never got to move around in the body I've never got to explore I don't even know anything else about the body I've been here my whole life I'm glad you've been there little fella and I'm really glad you've been there boy you ever get a cut on that finger or that thumb and it's right there in the Main Avenue you use that thing every day and you don't even realize how much you use that thing until you touch that sore place I'll tell you that's why they've got a lot of the message we've got a lot of Sword placed Christians oh oh what you mean oh the fetus oh okay well I guess you're attended the wrong service because I didn't bring Band-Aids I brought a machete help us Lord that's exactly right but notice Paul the body have a consideration of each other what is it it's a mutual consideration you young people you realize what you ought to be to each other you should not be a thorn in each other's side but you should want to watch for your young brothers and your sisters a camaraderie to wear that you're so in love with each other that you don't even have to talk to them to where you just feel something's not right they're going through a hard time something's not right they need something oh Lord what is it Lord what a church we'd have at this place if every member of the body would take that on them the Lord what can I do what can I do to benefit Word of Life what can I do to help the young people the young brothers that are bearing burdens and going through this and that and the other somebody say Amen so we consider ourselves our house our financial situation of course our children we consider so much about us but what about our fellow brothers and sisters you see true Christianity brings us beyond our own nose some folks can see just maybe that far out or you want to do you want to go to church I didn't like Sunday's service I don't think we'll go back I didn't want to either also you think it's all about you you coming to church is not all about what you get and what you think and how you think the service ought to go oh Jesus well I'm kind of hoping I'll get to still be the pastor here for the dedication service but who knows I may be walking after this tonight huh now I want you to notice that Paul is saying that we must be taught or trained now I know every person in your thinks that they have just given birth with all their children to next to Gabriel and Michael and wormwood and Raphael and Ariel and all the rest of the owls but let me just correct you you gave birth to a hybrid mongrel that was born between Satan and Eve which that makes me mad well I'm sorry I didn't realize you got mad at brother Branham because brother Branham said every one of us that are born are born between Satan and Eve they've been raised in the message church I ain't got one thing to do with it they've got to be taught at home as well as behind the pulpit [Applause] Amen brother Donnie you see if we make this emphasis on our children that they themselves say I'm sure there's some of you after the service will say I didn't enjoy that supper well I've had a few suppers I've got that in Joe myself I'm kind of enjoying this supper tonight I think it's really good I think it's really lean yeah cut a lot of the calories and a lot of the Wahoos and this and that and the other out let's just get right down where the rubber meets the road what do you say let's just get right down where Christianity real bold Christianity and let's let the Lord just mold in us and shaping us broad material you see if we place the value and the importance in the hearts of our children this is not just the Sunday school teacher's responsibility or the youth leaders but more so the mother and father then it's not like oh sure some children are born more considerate than others but there are none none that are born as considerate as the Bible requires it you see the new birth changes everything about us what I'm reading to you tonight is not attainable by any of our births but I'm a preacher's kid I don't care if you're a moron's kid you're still got to have the Holy Ghost God not take a moron's kid made more out of another preacher's kid it's almost he's got the idea but that's God I'm a PK I was born in the field I cut my teeth on the pit we're not talking about where you cut your teeth we're talking about when you got the Holy Ghost and when the spirit of God was able to instill something in you to help you as a young man say Lord when I walk before you that day I want to walk up like this empty-handed young Brothers wouldn't it be awesome if the Lord Jesus come tonight or in the morning now your record in your book won't have near as many pages no doubt as mine because I've lived longer than you but wouldn't it be awesome if it comes this week or next week and you stand before the Lord and in your short life that God's given you you have page after page after page not gossiping text because believe it or not there's no reward for them oh wow Oh you mean there's no reward for none of that Tick Tock stuff you better spend more time Tick Tock in the things that matter instead of on tick tock y'all know about Instagram and you know about Facebook I think we need to spend more of our time with our face in his book well praise the Lord think about it friends do you think you're going to be rewarded for all the time you spent on Pinterest now I'm not against you doing that as long as you keep everything in Balance but remember your time your time is one of your most sacred commodities brother random said he never stole anything in his life that he knew of except he stole time from God let me just venture out and say here tonight there's probably every person in this building is a thief including the man preaching to you a thief of money of somebody else's wife time of the time God gave me the time that God has given you also I've got years of my life you don't know that you don't know that you'll live till tomorrow oh so we must train we must teach we must pray we must break out the final ground and the hearts of our children let me say this is why I so appreciate the desired of some of the older ones here too be able to be leaders to the youth don't we appreciate that ones that don't have an agenda let me say this also how much I appreciate every sermon every bit of time that brother West spent preaching studying whatever more to benefit our use I appreciate every young man that comes here the visiting ministers that we've been having to benefit our youth don't you I appreciate mother Rob I appreciate mother Joe I appreciate the sisters that come and prepare the meals that's right go ahead and give them a hand clap that takes from their time but can you imagine when brother Rob stands before God and him and Sister Sarah walked before the Lord and the book is opened and the Lord sees every phone call every text every meeting when he didn't really feel like coming but he came anyway brother Joe the same way these young ministers that come in here and preach to us and they stand before the Lord and they might have thought well it sure didn't seem like nothing happens but this person got healed that when God delivered this one got delivered that when God delivered and there they stand before God and say Lord I remember that service it sure seem like it was awful hard it didn't seem like there's nothing happened God said come look at it from my perspective this one God saved this one got the Holy Ghost this one got healed this one got delivered you thought you didn't do anything oh no oh my god notice Paul goes on to say let us consider one another to provoke what an unusual word that he chooses to use here not generally especially on the English language the way we look at provoke it's generally not very good whenever I say somebody provoked me I don't mean they tickle me made me laugh I don't mean they make me feel good generally they start up something in me that I don't like in me oh y'all said no look at me like a bunch of angels ain't you who's this word because you're up to really get them roused but not to anger read with me let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works wow so every one of us have a reputation either you're a complainer a grumbler a liar a gossiper a sad face the life of the party or no party conservative every one of us have a reputation and sometimes it's multifaceted you understand right so depending on the mood you're in where you are so this certain aspect of your personality will come out in certain times and then other times you're known by this because of what you're going through but every one of us are going to answer to the Lord for what we do with the way that God has saved us and the position that God's given us so we will either provoke people to anger we will provoke them when we get around them I mean we stir up one mess after another some people are known by that let me tell you why though that way as adults they started out that way as kids and nobody ever had enough nerve to tell them you need to change what's this Heir said on brother Jackie well that's the truth and if we think well it's just the way we are what we need to be changed if we provoke people to anger we provoke people to being upset maybe we really need to check our provoking power thank you Jesus let us consider one another to provoke unto love and two good works wow now good works not for justification of salvation but in order to be of a benefit to the body wow wouldn't that be something to have that testimony that people say about you every time I get around him I'm just so low he'll get up on that piano he'll go to play on that thing it just seemed like it lifts my spirit he may be lower than you are but God's gifted him same with brother Larry and the rest of these musicians are gifted you think these brothers are always on the mountain when they get up here sometimes they're probably so low they feel like not even getting up on the organ or the guitar the piano whatever it is but they get up here and they are faithful service after service they'll give up their worship time they give up their time to set by their family why so it can benefit you so they can create an atmosphere so the word of God can come further do we appreciate that so what do these brothers do what do the song leaders do they are provoking you to Good Works here's one of them I shall not be I shall not be moved that's a whole lot better for the song leader than I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved I want you to notice the very next verse in your Bible sometimes Carol will come to me maybe on Friday or Saturday sometimes even Thursday and she'll say what tape are you listening to I just want to kind of be in tune with what you're going to preach or can you give me some scriptures of what you're going to kind of preach on so I can just kind of be ready so yesterday we were sitting at the house and I opened up this and I started sharing some of these with her I want you to listen now to this this verse again verse 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works and the very next verse is this one not forsaking the assembling ah wow you mean so we go from provoking one another to good works and the very next verse is the importance of going to church just be honest with me to any of how I have near as much trouble going to Walmart as you come into church and it amazing how all hell will break loose and you go to go to church and it seemed like every devil in hell will push you to Walmart go to Walmart go to Walmart go to Walmart go to Walmart they know somebody's going to Dent your new car and it's going to work on your temper when you get there they know you're going to see this person and that person and you're going to go right for that parking spot and you head in there and somebody goes right right in front of you say you sorry thing I was fixing uh-huh so you mean after good works yeah don't you understand going to church it's a great work so after good works and Paul says not forsaking listen friends at the meaning of this word leave abandon dessert leave in straights leave helpless selling people forsake the ascending of themselves I'm not talking about folks that are sick folks that live so far that can't make it on Wednesday night or you understand what I'm talking about but people that just don't see the value of it or they just say I don't need to go to church I'll stay home and play tapes I hear straight from the horse's mouth shame on you for referring to our Prophet as a horse so when they forsake to go to church this is the way God looks at it they leave they abandon they desert they leave in strengths they leave helpless wow totally abandoned this is the way God looks at people that develops this attitude and it is rampant all over the message then what about those that promote it and say this is the way of the end time oh we're not even supposed to go to church no more we're all supposed to gather around 12 o'clock and we're all supposed to listen to the same tape are we really well let's see if that's what the Bible teaches and if it doesn't you're a false prophet forsaking not the assembling of ourselves yeah now let's see if this means spiritual let's see if it means all streaming at the same time this is the word Paul used Gathering Together assembling together a gathering together in oh so you and your home you and yours you and yours you and yours I'm sorry you cannot fulfill that scripture by doing so so you are disobeying God's original word [Applause] provoke good good it discourages people from the first basic understanding of being Christians that they assemble together in Christ Jesus now I want you to notice the next verse after that one after we're taught about going to church listen to the very next verse for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins wow so you mean I took good works then we go into how we're going to be able to fulfill these good works we've got to be in a body we've got to assemble ourselves together then we've got to go to church and then we've got to be an influence one upon the other and if you look at this how that Paul says it about exhorting it's ministering to each other you cannot do that if a person closest to you is 500 miles down the road streaming if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth notice Paul does not say you've received the truth but you receive the knowledge of it so you knew it was right but you never really received the truth I don't want just the knowledge of it I want the truth I wanted so much that my life lives what I profess I believe oh my praise the Lord there remain us no more sacrifice for sins and the church said notice again in James 2 26. for as the body without the spirit is dead so face without works is dead also so it's like brother random praying for the little boy who was club-footed in South Africa one of the worst he ever saw feet all twisted one leg shorter than the other he prayed for him that night the next day he met his father down on the street there I actually stood on that street several years ago went to the place where brother Branham stayed so I walked up and down that street where the meetings were I wondered whether that little boy was where his daddy stood you know just reminiscing in your mind brother random sees that little boy's Daddy fixing to go by his little boy a pair of shoes now what was he doing putting his face into expression by his works so he tells us Abraham done the same thing him and Sarah went to the doctor and said Doctor my wife is going to have a baby and he said you were this hundred-year-old man and his 90 year old wife and he said they got the bird eye which y'all know what bird eye is you don't know some of you do some of you don't all right birdot was the name they call cloth diapers in the 50s and the 60s I just solved a great mystery for many of you so the bird eye was the diaper so Abraham and Sarah went into the Toys R Us and all the babies are us stuff and they bought up diapers and pacifiers and all these things imagine going there and just kind of you know waddling around their stuff and said oh is this for your great great great great great great great grandchildren say no this is for our boy oh your boy what did you where is he well we ain't got him yet but we're expecting him any day hey honey that's not going to the dog let's say Lord have mercy for those things y'all stand right here we'll call 9-1-1 what size jacket do you wear oh the prophet said he went into the doctor's office and said the doctor running Plum out of the office well you know what's kind of similar today that the prophet said the doctor can sit and tell you there is no hope there's nothing else we can do but he said if God drops that in your heart you can set right thing life in the doctor's face why because the same face that was in Abraham is in you and the doctors say prepare your funeral and you say no sir I'm looking at a cruise into Norway express my face have you got your casket picked out nobody got an address because me and my husband's flying to Arizona but you don't understand this is terminal I know I've got to go from the terminal from Atlanta and then I'm going to fly to Salt Lake I know there's a terminal there but I'm going to be all right talk don't worry about no you don't understand there's never been anybody ever healed of this oh y'all remember reading that in the Bible uh let me say what was his name Lazarus oh yeah I remember him now and they could say nobody has ever been raised historically there's not one record facts there's not one record of a man that had been raised four days after his death not one man or a woman after the No sell it that they ever got up again facts facts was it was totally impossible facts was his body was rotten but the truth was the resurrection and the life stood there and he said lies rise come forth so what are we going to believe what God said I want the doctor said I want your mistakes say Hallelujah [Applause] praise the Lord how many wants good works not provoke to anger young people adults older people how we ought to judge everything we do we ought to judge our effect on people wouldn't it be awful to have to stand before the Lord and he was known as a troublemaker in Earth and you stand there and there's a record of you causing this man trouble that woman trouble this young person trouble this person trouble you put this into a horrible burden you put this one through that and this one through that and there's a whole book of all kinds of nothing but chaos that you caused oh but mama will come to my rescue Mama might rescue you now but mama won't be able to erase that book daddy will not be able to separate so now Lord Jesus I'll tell you what that run in my family no will everyone have to stand there before the Lord I could fall back on well that's a Reagan way well that's a shout way that's a McGillicuddy that's this and that and the other but God's going to say down there I thought she was born again I'll talk to you about a new nature praise the Lord how many once a book a book not a page not a paragraph but a book of works that have pleased the Lord not free rewards say oh I'm doing this now I'm going to work and working working work so I'll have this gigantic encyclopedia boy no your motive is done it right you want to do it because Jesus has given you an ability to help an ability to influence in the right way an influence to say things that'll encourage people and you want to do it because he gave you that ability I don't know that I'll ever forget it Carol and I said many years ago down in Kentucky where we lived and a little single wide trailer sitting on the front porch that would built on it on a swing that I'd put there just talking about the Lord and his Mercy just talking about what the Lord might want us to do for him and of course we didn't know but we just sat there and talked and prayed a little and just said Lord whatever you'd like for us to do we we'd be glad to do it if you want us to help people Lord you put the money in their hands if you want us to reach out to people we'll do this and that we we don't know I remember I'm sitting there she's sitting there nobody knew Donnie Reagan nobody knew me nobody knew her if he would have showed me that I was going to travel all over the world you got to be kidding me the people from Happy top said Donnie Reagan is going to Africa Donnie Reagan is going to India Donnie Reagan ain't that Don and Betty's boy you got to be kidding me that boy ain't even hardly been out of habitat only place he went to from Happy top to Wendy and then from there to Parnell and back he's going to go around the world he's going to preach the gospel in all these different nations not the Donnie Reagan I know I agree it wasn't the Donnie Reagan they knew it was another one who would have ever thought Daryl Ward Daryl Ward's going to travel everywhere and preach he's going to pray for people around the world all kinds of Miracles are going to follow Daryl Ward but you see if we can put ourselves into the hands of the master if time would Tarry there might be a young man standing here today that'll be a preacher that'll take this message and sweep it around the world brother Donnie what maybe my son Maybe but if he don't do that maybe he'll encourage one of his little buddies maybe they'll grow up a little farther and they'll they'll come to a spot where they're just going through such hell they don't know what the answer is and he'll text his little buddy one day hey I was reading my Bible and I thought about you and just come on my heart are you okay no I'm going through terrible terrible things listen children don't think that your children are free from this our government as local our federal government is promoting this transgender saying trying to convince our kids that they're born boys and they should be girls and this and that and the other if the devil is doing that to the kids out there what do we need to do instill in our kids godliness Holiness righteousness Purity not selfishness not self-centeredness Christ different states I heard it yesterday are trying to start Sanctuary places to worry that if your child a minor wants to be a transgender or changed and you won't let them the government will take them from you and place them in that Sanctuary state and let them be changed well the Lord's got a sanctuary State too but it ain't that much of perversion it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ so young people you can be set free from the world and it's Darkness out here and come to this sanctuary in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah and what do you think a lot of those transgender kids are going to do they're going to try to make more kids like them come on they're going to try to convince them why Satan broke into God's program of spreading the gospel so what do you do you get two or three people that are eat up with this transgender deal or it started out as a minority but look how much it's grown in the last few years look around us look how many men you see but dresses on friends don't be blind what is it it's influence what if the devil learned that influence where the hell out of it from he learned it from God and he thought that's a great idea but if the devil can influence with the power of Darkness what about the power of the Gospel don't take for granted that your children know that when they're smacked on One Cheek to turn the other what you need to take for granted is they're born with that rebellion in them that if somebody smacks them they will smack them back we take too much for granted you take for granted that everything they look at on their phone is Gospel oriented you might be surprised I hear it all the time and my travels around the world for things that folks find out about their kids and the parents are totally blown away why they never ask they never inquired and they never even looked at their kids phones and they trust them to the High Heavens I wonder what's the matter with us our kids are as lost as they can be until they are filled with the Holy Ghost raised in a message Q does not make them holy it does not make them righteous they are born lost oh my we need to spend more time around our family bible I think more time instead of assuming they understand the Ten Commandments assuming they understand all the Divine principles of this and that why don't you ask them sometime why don't you ask them to tell you the Ten Commandments oh Lord some of these young men about to pass out right now brother we assume they know we assume they do this really well maybe we should assume they've got to be taught and trained not only from here I'll preached some twice a week brother our brother Joe has them a couple times a week every other week rather how much time do you have them oh goodness well believe it or not I love you [Applause] praise the Lord praise the Lord what about it young man young sisters when you stand before Jesus that day and he opens up your book and the ghosts are looking down through what's there don't you want to flood it with helps to the body to the Saints but I'm not a preacher don't have to be but you just want your life so full of good things but remember not only is there a record of good things but every argument that you've caused every fuss that you've caused every person that you've won at and you've picked at them I know what that's like my whole life in school I was picked at I was ridiculed I was laughed at I was made fun of I've told you before boys would bring pornographic magazines to school and I put my hands over my eyes like this and they'd throw me down on the floor and they'd take their fingers and pry my eyes open and stick it in front of my eyes I was called Moses I was called Daniel I was called Jeremiah my response to them was I'd rather be called that than Lucifer which is what I call them I can still remember my first couple years of school standing I can remember it like yesterday standing on the playground at Wayne County Elementary School wishing somebody would talk to me because we were so poor I had ragged shoes my britches had holes in them before it was in style now your kids pay 75 dollars for a bunch of Levi's where they got a shotgun blow holes in them well my that's the way mine was before it was in style so it's poor always wanted somebody to like me my whole life I've been rejected I come to the message I thought boy I found some real friends here huh little did I know my biggest rejection would be here so you know what I know that feeling I don't want none of our kids to feel that way I don't want none of our adults to feel that way but brother Donnie we're poor and we don't fit in the church whoever treats you bad you let me know who they are and I'll pray for them oh you thought I was going to take my belts off didn't you listen friend we ought to make everybody feel welcome I don't care what their skin color is I don't care how much they make a year if we ever get to that place I'll sell this building and we'll move to a storefront we don't never want to have that attitude remember the Bible says the common people heard him gladly do you realize the Lord Jesus would have been the type of person that most people would have shunned he had one change of clothes Jesus didn't pack around the suitcase and a whole whole Chariot full of clothes he had one change he would have been so poor most of us would have been felt comfortable being around him don't treat people bad because they don't have what you have because keep in mind Jesus was that way one day one day some disciples come and said Lord where you live at he said the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have missed but the son of man don't even own a house I don't even have a place to lay my head can you imagine here for 30 years homeless homeless so he stayed with Lazarus Mary Martha he stayed here he stayed there he stayed there he never had a house so you realize what some of our attitudes would do we would have looked down on the Lord Jesus and said well he don't make what I make look at his car Jesus never had a car or a chariot or a horse he never owned a horse he never owned a buggy a donkey he had to borrow a donkey to fulfill scripture he had to borrow a tomb to fulfill scripture he was so poor he had to borrow borrow borrow so many of the financial counselors of our day their Doctrine is false because it don't meet with the Lord Jesus on life and I wonder how we would treat him well I'll tell you how we would but by the way we treat his kids because brother random says the way you treat your brothers and sisters that's the way you treat Jesus so if you treat anybody bad or ill because their skin color their clothes are in a different Financial bracket than you then you're treating Jesus that same way and we get an air stick up our nose the prophet said if it rained and drowned you and what are you anyway six foot 165 pound of dirt some of you five foot 280 still a big pile of dirt this more dirt friends were nothing where do we get this tell you We inherited it from our births between Satan and Eve arrogance our pride who I dread more I know the first words is going to come out of her mouth when we get back on that office she'll walk back in and I'll be sitting her nose my bottom lip hung down about the bottom of my shoes she'll walk over at the desk and put her arm on my shoulder don't you let the devil beat you down now we needed that don't you let the devil beat you down Hallelujah it's about it Lord God forgive us Jesus I pray if I have ever treated one of your children in an eel way please forgive me if I have ever looked down on one if I've ever had the wrong attitude Lord please forgive me we do not profess to be a perfect people we profess to have a perfect sacrifice but we do want to be an obedient people so when we see we're wrong we ask you to forgive us so Lord I pray that you'd begin with me help me Lord that how many ever days I've got left in this life Lord Jesus and I'll use my time wisely Lord God I ask you for these sheep that you've put into my charge help them Lord help the young the middle age the elders to realize the allotment of time that we have it's precious they may not believe it now but it's worth more than their money what would the richest people in the world laying at the point of death and give everything they own for another hour of life because when it all said and done which is worse the most life or money life or wealth life will went out every time Lord May our young people realize they don't need to wait till the 30 or 40 to have a character that is so represent representative of Christ help them to realize everything they do Lord if they put a stumbling block in front of someone's way if they say something to push down instead of lifting up if they say something to embarrass or humiliate that was actually recorded in a book in heaven no wonder your Prophet told us if we cannot say something good about people we should not say anything at all so in other words most of us should do a whole lot less talking would be a whole lot better people but we tend to think if it runs through our crazy head we better say it which is totally contrary to the Bible the Bible says be swift to hear and slow to speak I'm glad I don't think everything that goes through this knucklehead of mine help us God give us wisdom oh no wonder your Bible says a word fitly spoken it's like apples of gold in pictures of silver there's a little brief sentence to an individual could encourage them one of criticism or sarcasm can discourage them to what they feel like there's no need to even go on I pray God there's none of them on my book Lord if they are I Repent tonight if there's any Lord God statements that are made to any of your children around the world that's discouraged or disheartened I ask you to forgive me Lord let what's written in my book be that I encouraged I lifted up oh I might had to whoop them a little bit make them feel a little bad but in return it'll make them feel better I want you granted Lord I wonder when no one looking around how many would say that tonight Lord if there's anything on my book that I I've done against anybody if I discourage and criticize and had sarcasm and Lord would you please forgive me don't don't make me meet that Lord anybody just raise hand to God God bless your Saints oh my goodness bless your heart those of you out there streaming to Lord I know this ain't deep but oh Jesus I think it goes down to where we are we want to be better people father Lord God we want to live in a way that you can use us Lord and trust us I believe there's great times laying in front of us Lord but I believe that you're calling for us to step higher get closer Lord and no matter how close we think we are to you we can pretty well judge that by the way we treat our brothers and sisters so your Prophet went on to say that you call men to preach the gospel and the way that people respect that man of God is the way they respect you so if people disrespect a god-called man they're disrespecting you but it's not just limited to the preacher but Lord we're members of one another help us Lord I pray you'd go through the many pages of the book of my life Lord if there's anything you find there dear God that needs to be taken care of if I need to speak to anybody if I need to call somebody up let me know Lord let me know oh Jesus May you search every heart in this place tonight I know it seems unusual Lord a couple of services this way but I'm going to follow your leading Lord I know from the service Sunday the text the emails the phone calls all the things that I got it was definitely you Lord for whatever reason you pull us right back that way again tonight so lord it's for a reason I'm one of them I believe Lord oh Jesus we love you we worship you I just lay my book before you it'll be too late to try to erase any of that stuff then Lord when I woke up there before you I can't grab that book and say Lord could I have a few minutes please could I could I take care of a few things nope Lord God I want him taken care of tonight and Lord I Want to Love or I want to understand more I want to be a a more yielded Christian so I don't add any new junk into them pages let me fill the rest of the pages of my life with good things Mercy kindness forgiveness encouraging Works encouraging words words to provoke words to help granted Lord God can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord and just however you wish to say it me too Lord me too Lord take care of anything in my pages Dear God just tell them in your way friends oh my let us walk out of this place tonight with a brand new desire a brand new determination whatever word think about what you say think about the way you treat people you're saying well I want to get back at them and remember when you do that that is recorded in heaven and if you do not fix that that's going to meet you at that day and then how are you going to answer before the Lord did oh my God searches tonight Lord Jesus praise the Lord search the hearts of our kids father search the hearts of our young men our young sisters we want them to be so sensitive before you we want them to love you with such a fervent passion and desire Lord God help them I pray to realize Lord the treatment of each other and their love
