come up Sunday morning so I had to text him Sunday morning and told him I couldn't make it some things come up and I said well I'll uh see what happens and he text me and said can you come this week so I told him I could do that so appreciate the opportunity to be able to come don't get nervous all this ain't going to be used ain't going to be used I just got some things I want to say today wow people start getting nervous brother har wow but God's good ain't he it's good to be with you again to get see all of you again today how many believes that when you come on this Earth there's a purpose that you're here your purpose isn't just to come to Word of Life and sit on that Pew that's a part of it my purpose isn't just to come and preach at Life Tabernacle and Anderson every individual person has a purpose and a reason so I could say it this way every single person has an assignment the question is who fulfills their assignment I'm sure at times we all fulfill a part of that assignment and I'm sure at times it I miss my assignment but I'm so glad when I do miss my assignment I don't fulfill it what God wants me to I'm so grateful that he don't throw me away amen aren't you grateful for that so I want to speak on a subject today and I spoke on the kingdom versus mind World years ago at Happy Valley several times and one of my last sermons at Happy Valley was Kingdom versus mind World on the sound power of sound so I want to look at Kingdom versus mind world because the kingdom of God I'm talking about that versus the Mind world if Satan can stop you from fulfilling what God has intended you to fulfill he'll do everything in his he'll use everything in his arsenic to stop you everything he can he'll try to break you but by God's grace we may fail him but he's there amen I may fall but we got to keep getting up is that right so I want to look at Kingdom versus mind World On Assignment On Assignment now how many believes that you're here this morning at Word of Life own assignment a bunch of you are rest of y'all what about y'all I said that last part because I am 99.9% brother Donnie would have said that same thing every one of us should be here this morning on assignment you agree with that I want to go to Jeremiah 1 4 and 5 but before I go to Jeremiah you turn to Jeremiah 1 14 and5 I want to read a scripture here I want to show you something just just uh just a few seconds of time if we while you're turning there the Bible says in Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places where where now a lot of people doesn't think brother Harry it matters the world doesn't think it matters oh we just happened to come up this Earth and we're just floating here from this time to this world through the this we go from this church to that church maybe this home to that home you know I'm just up on this journey float through to the end of time oh no no no no that's not even scripture amen and they just float through this thing saying it doesn't even matter most people thinks I've talked to people where they say well all it really matters is the end because if you look at you look at football and baseball and NASCAR and all of that they only worry about the last lap I've seen people actually lead the whole the whole race and then on the last lap the second man jumps in front and wins the race that's right well it don't matter all that matters is the end but let me ask you this question if I could that is so far from the truth it I might understand the terminology that they're using but notice this I believe on on the word assignment and I'll show it to you in Scripture that your destiny is determined by your beginning just think of it now don't don't don't don't throw me out yet it's been it's been a while since I've been here so I still believe your destiny is determined by your beginning listen carefully brother brand made the statement said you'll never be the word at the end unless you were a thought in the beginning you'll never be the word at the end so the beginning does matter where I was in the beginning matters he just didn't get up one morning and yawn and stretch one so I think I'll just write brother Harry down today well oh you know today is such and such I think I'm just going to ride over uh you you know Brother Louie down today I I like him he's a good guy I'll just write his name no no no no we was in the very thoughts of the king of kings so my destiny has a had something to do with my with my my my beginning a end had something to do with my beginning where I was in the beginning so I come here and he places me and he places you up on an assignment that you and I are supposed to fulfill when Paul teaches us here in Ephesians 1:3 and I got it all the way to 110 and I won't read it the same time and you can read it later Ephesians 1:2 all the way to 10 Paul actually tells us here where our blessings lay and notice the scriptures here here he invites you and I to go back into eternity to see who we are he invites me and invites you to go back with him into eternity so this morning if I could I'd like to invite you as brother manam made said this in a message one morning he said I want to invite you so this morning I want to invite you to take a trip if you would go will you go with me Jeremiah 1:4 then you can have your seats then the word of the Lord came unto me saying this is such powerful scripture before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before the thou comest from out of the womb I sanctify thee and conjunction I ordain thee to be a prophet unto the nations may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word as you're seated this morning so the word formed me means to be fashioned means to be framed of divine activity listen carefully of individuals to be pre-ordained of a Divine Purpose to be predetermined to be formed so before I formed you he says in the belly I knew thee now these scriptures are so so powerful if we could just look at it and see it before thou comest out of the womb i s ified thee and conjunction I ordained thee to be a prophet so before he ever knew me he did this do you do you agree with that now watch this scripture as I can as I bring it to you just a few minutes of time this morning oh my so God's people upon the Earth were put on Earth for a purpose God actually gave each individual I don't care how old you are I don't care how young you are each person this morning sets in this building is here on an assignment now I'm sure you and I fail our assignment many times if you go to school and your teacher gives you an assignment you're going to have and you don't do that assignment you're going to get in trouble I know cuz I never done mine so kids don't do what I did if they gave me assignment Tim you need to go home and do this if it got done I was going to go see my cousin get her to do it for me I hated school didn't like it one bit didn't go half the time all I done was hunted and fished I'm not saying that's what y'all should do matter of fact if y'all do it your mom and daddy ought to beat you listen to this statement so if your teacher gives you a an assignment for you to do at home and you go home and you do everything else don't expect to pass don't expect to get into college not going to happen let me inject this here there was a poll taken and listen to this very carefully there was a poll taken in America 70% of people in America said they live their lives un deeply unsatisfied 70% of Americans said they live their lives deeply that's the words they used deeply unsatisfied now think about that seven out of 10 people are unsatisfied brother Rob that's sad and we wonder why we have a state of depression in America we wonder why we have the problems we got in America when seven out of 10 people you meet every day are deeply unsatisfied with their life they don't know where to go they don't know what where to turn to they don't know what to say they don't know what to do they don't know nothing you know why because seven out of those 10 people hasn't got in touch with God to find out what their assignment was upon this Earth you're not here just to fill a bu PL you're not here just to come and clap your hands there's a specific assignment that God has given his children and the world don't know nothing about it sure the world has assignments sure that they they feel like they have something a lot of Christians in in denomination Realms feel like they have something that they are put on this Earth to do there's nothing wrong with that but think about the seven out of 10 that lives deeply unsatisfied the richest nation in the world and they're unsatisfied they can't seem to find a happiness I know wealthy wealthy folks that are sadder than every than I am got money coming out their ears that's right and unsatisfied go buy anything they want all kind of stuff and they're still unsatisfied why because they don't know why they are [Applause] here oh my when we realize that we're God's children and he put us on this Earth for a reason then he just don't put you here just to be here he don't put you here just for just just I just put Tim on the Earth and I just put Harry there and I just put Rob there and I just put this in here there has to be an assignment that you are here for there's got to be something that he's placed me here for I can take you from Genesis to Revelations and show you assignment at her assignment at assignment that God has placed the men of God in the Old Testament down through the New Testament he gave them assignments upon the Earth so if I can find that assignment then my life would be totally different if that seven out of 10 could find a hope and find a something that that that satisfies them they could find that part of Hope brother John and find something that gives them some some kind of Hope in their life then they would move them from that seven and put them in that other category children and kids of the world people that that they go to school and all this they don't have no hope 70% said they can't find a purpose on Earth but just think of that 70% if they could find a purpose on Earth while they're here how it would change the world it would turn this world upside down there's a reason the teacher gives you an assignment there's a reason the teacher gives you something to take home and do she's trying to learn you something and teach you something she don't give it to you just to just to be giving it to you she's giving it to you because there's something she wants you to learn there's something she what is she doing she's trying to get you ready for the journey that when you get out of school or get out of the college day you're moving into different era and the stage of your life then you then got to understand I know young people don't get this far A lot of times this is why it's so neat before the Holy Ghost right you and I cannot find our assignment without the Holy Ghost it's impossible for you to have where you want in this journey without the Holy Ghost and the sad part about it message churches that we believe that's in this message teach that you don't need the Holy Ghost no more we don't need him in the church no more what's happened to these ministers on now Hallelujah if we can get it figured out if our young people can get it fire figured out if our Elder people and our our middle age if we can get it figured out now Jeremiah was a major prophet so this verse of scripture is so powerful but notice this before Jeremiah ever got to Earth every before he was born he was already known of God that's right I love this part right here notice this before Jeremiah ever got to this part now the word Saint a formed watch this to be fashioned of divine creation to be pre-ordained to be predetermined to be formed to have a Divine Purpose so he knew Jeremiah before he formed him he Sanctified him before he before he was born he ordained him to be a prophet all before he ever stepped upon the Earth so before I ever showed upon earth oh I love this now before I ever showed up on the earth he knew me amen that's right W Hallelujah before I ever showed up on the birthing table he knew me before I ever came from my mother's womb he knew me it's one of the greatest debates in America today even in the last election three weeks ago that's right one of the greatest debates is when when in our country is when does Life Begin I like this you agree that's one of the greatest debates that's all that's all and I don't preach on politics I don't care if you're a Libertarian I don't care if you're a leftist I don't care if you're a rtis I don't care if you're a a a a a republican I don't care if you're a Democrat God can save all of you greatest debate in our country is when life does begin but my life didn't begin on the earth my life began [Applause] there well it it it it begins uh in 3 weeks after the mother and father has a union or in one month or in two months or three months hogwash H beginning [Music] Glory I just didn't H Hasley show up here on Earth so if that's the case then God must have a purpose for me God don't have to figure out something out what he's going to do oh my goodness Tim just showed up on the earth I got to go find something for him to do oh my goodness I didn't know I didn't know brother Harry was going to show up on Earth and boom bam there he is now I don't know what I'm going to do God knew before he ever showed up on Earth God knew Jeremiah before he was ever born on the birthing table he knew he he Sanctified him think of the word Sanctified he birthed him he Sanctified him he ordained him before he ever came on the earth to be a prophet of almighty God so because my life begin in heaven I am here oh I love this so my life began in heaven I'm here this morning you're here this morning to have a continuation of your life that was there upon this Earth and let's just be honest it don't matter how you got here the main thing is you're here that's right it don't matter how you come to church this morning whether you rode a ebike or rode a regular bike a walk it doesn't matter how you got here you're here that's all it matters well I drove my Cadillac Escalade I drove my too my my Tahoe and I drove this doesn't matter the ma the thing of it is you're here it's the same way you upon the Earth it doesn't matter how you got here well my mom and daddy didn't want to have me and I'm a mistake it doesn't matter God Don't Make Mistakes don't tell me God didn't know that wasn't going to happen I don't believe that nonsense if he's God he's God if he's omnipotent and he knows all things and he knows all things then there's a reason for you to be here so in other words you are different I am different God's people are different we're supposed to be different we're not supposed to blend with the world I'm not supposed to blend with the world think about people in the world that's been given assignments that is not God's people they're not God's people but they've been given assignments there are people all on the planet that will fulfill the assignment that is not of God that's right Judas fulfilled an assignment so is so for 30 pieces of silver because he fulfilled assignment look at the characters look at the assignment down through the Bible there's a man reading the book of Isaiah one time and his name was Phillip and and and philli was assigned to go on a mission B tells the story how he just come out of convention instead he goes out there and God just moves upon him and gives him inspiration we find Philip 15 miles somewhere else talking to the unic what's he doing he's fulfilling an assignment Peter had an assignment brother bam had a great assignment look at Jacob there in Genesis 49 notice the scripture if you read it he's dying notice what he does he pulls his feet up watch this carefully he pulls his feet up go read Genesis 49 he pulls his feet up into the bed and he begin to give up the ghost the Bible tells us he be to line up the borders where every tribe would be in the land this is what the spir scripture is talking about but you read that scripture they never did get there until this day we're talking about when Jacob was on Earth he pulls his feet up sets them on the table and the Bible says he gives up The Ghost and he begins to speak he's lining up the borders where the tribes of Israel was actually going to be and they never did get that until this day it took 5,000 years for this to take place God don't forget his assignment God didn't forget it because when Jacob he stood there doing this and saying these great things God didn't forget it it took year 5,000 years for it to happen notice the angel of God meet brother bam that there this is what's so striking on May the 7th 1946 to commission him to take the word to the Gentile now notice watch this what an assignment that God had placed on brother brandham yes sir but because he was a prophet doesn't mean you don't have something you've been assigned something these men and women that play this music they're assigned something they're here for a purpose it matters about these music musicians amen amen this goes just as much as the rest of it comes together amen you take these guys here and these guys here away and see what [Music] happens oh my it matters that you're sitting right there this morning it matters that you're sitting in each one of these PE seats this morning it matters that I'm standing on this platform this morning God knew I'd be here that in his mind brother Donnie just fulfilled it last Sunday when he called me but it was in the mind of God then glory to God why because he brought us here for our purpose the same night of May the 7th 1946 when brother Brandon was talking about this notice the scripture here Israel was on her way to her Homeland 5,000 years later Israel was on her way the pro God had the prophet up on the mountain giving him a commission Israel's on her trip notice she becomes a nation 1948 has her flag has her money God never did forget that assignment that Jacob spoke even in the scriptures Corin Dayan fulfilled an assignment pilot fulfilled an assignment the Bible says there's some who's Born To Be A rabate to fulfill their assignment that's one scripture I don't want to fulfill some people the Bible says the born to believe to Born to believe a lie and be down why they're fulfilling their assignment but I believe this morning that I'm here to fulfill his assignment amen I believe I've been placed on this Earth to fulfill his assignment I don't want to be of that 70% my ears don't get mad at my eyes cuz my ears can't see the members of your body has an assignment so my ears don't get mad at my eyes because my ears can't see and my eyes can see my eyes fulfilling the assignment that God ordained them to fulfill am I have a pen on my desk that it's made to write with but the other stuff on my desk don't get mad at the pen because I picked a pen up and right with a pen my left hand don't get mad at my right hand they're each assigned what God assigned them to do my glasses is made that I'm able to see better so the pen don't get mad at my glasses because my glasses helps me see and my pen can't help me see my pen has been assigned to write my glasses have been assigned to help me see it all works together amen each each part of the member of of the body has been allotted upon this Earth That's What Makes You differ God don't need anybody's permission to do it well I'll ask so and so and I'll ask this one to see what he thinks God don't care what nobody thinks it's in his mind he did what he thought was best amen so what you and I have to do is embrace the assignment that God has give me well brother T I just don't like M let me just be honest with you I'd rather I can't play the G guar I can't sing I can't preach I don't feel like I can do anything I'd rather lay that guitar down and quit strumming it I'd give anything if I could play that organ right there but I ain't mad at Harry cuz he can play where' you at oh I started playing at home something we got one like this so I started getting off the guitar just letting somebody else sing and me just get over there and play that but I'm not mad at him cuz he can play I'm not mad at brother Larry or the sister that played this morning that they can play this I'm not mad cuz these guys can play all this stuff I can't do none of it man I still get to I'd give anything to play that thing but I'm not mad because he can play and I can't I do wish you to give me a little bit more Talent my dad could pick up anything on this pull pit and then you can add banjo and mandlin and all these other stuff and stack on my dad can start there and walk every one of them and pick them up first time and start playing like he played all his life I said my goodness what did I do that I didn't get that I mean my dad plays like brother Harry my dad gets off of that comes over here and gets on this jumps on the guitar I mean he just jumps on everything my oldest son brother Justin got the same Talent it skipped me Justin can get on that Ste guitar and just wear it out get on the piano get on the organ get on everything thing up here and just wear it out and I just stand on and look at him I'm not mad at him that he can do that probably a little jealous but embrace the assignment that God has allotted you to have so I try to embrace me playing the guitar which I can't I try to embrace I didn't want to sing this morning I said y'all sing so now I am trying to embrace the organ I need you a couple hours at of church today if Heaven is behind you that's all you need if the Creator if the kingdom is behind you it's all you need now notice let's get into some of this If Heaven's behind you in your assignment you will not blend with the world heard a minister to other day talking about blending in we need to blend in with this and and blend in with this and I don't think you need to blend with the world I don't think you need to be mean to them I don't think you need to be hateful to the people that that don't believe this message that's the problem now with this message if you don't agree with me and I don't agree with you you know you don't dress exactly like I think you need to dress and if you don't wear your hair exactly of M I don't care it ain't my business that's why brother bam said when you get them to Jesus Christ let him clean it if brother Donnie or me cleans the people they they ain't going to stay that's right but if we can find the the right assignment that God's allotted for me to have not blending him with the world but yet be that part of the assignment that can help and help coach that person maybe give them some leadway here and there let them know about Jesus Christ let them know about this I have a guy works with me he's 33 he come to my company when he was 14 maybe 15 dad kicked him out of his house didn't have no reason and uh work with a roofing crew and if you ever work with a roofing crew they probably I don't mean this no bad to roof and Cru cuz I'm a roofer myself roofers they are about the slouch people there is and I I don't mean that bad cuz I'm a roofer myself but I mean just no life this man this young boy didn't so he worked with this crew and they was all I mean it was just pure awful so he gets hurt one day 14 years ago he falls off of a ladder backer on one of our jobs messes his neck and his back up so he's out for three months they put him on light duty they put him back in in the shop and said won't you just do light light duty so I'm in there working one day and I need somebody to hold something so I just said hey I didn't know who he was didn't know his name didn't know about him I said hey come here and hold this so he started holding out well from that time on he stayed with me he's been with me 14 15 years now oh just me him and Tony now if you see this guy we call him tattoo boy he's eat up with tattoos but I'm going to tell you what he lay down his life for me 6 months ago we started going to church his family calls me and says I am so grateful for you and Tony that you got him away from who he was hanging around and said he has become a different person it's took me 15 years to get him in church now he's not in my church but he's in church he actually is pretty he everybody calls him my son he looks just like my youngest son Steven the one that plays the bass when he comes here everybody thinks he's my son but I'm going to tell you this guy is phenomenal would do anything for me instead of just throwing him away like I could have because he didn't look like me he didn't dress like me but I embraced this young boy that had no reason was kicked out at 15 or 16 didn't finish school or nothing now I wouldn't get rid of him if somebody calls wantan him I tell him to leave him alone I will fight you over this boy amen oh my so I didn't I I don't blend in just fulfill the word when children of God are fulfilling the word you are on that assignment you as a child of God don't lose your identity don't blend in to the spot especially young people don't blend in to where you lose your identity blending in trying to make somebody else happy remember young people you've got an assignment amen you're a child of God don't lose your identity embrace the assignment that God has given you to each one of you now watch the word formed actually in the Hebrew it is derived from the process of a Potter and the clay so we're made out of the Dust of the earth is that right God said before I put you in the earth before I put you on the wheel before I put you in the spin and started making your body before male and female came together he said I knew you this word actually means to know or to be instructed to be revealed or to be declared to know and this is what I love here to know by experience in other words there is a known by knowledge and there is a known by experience there is a known by knowledge and a known by experience if I had an orange this morning and I had it in my hand and I took a big old bite of it and I begin to tell you man this thing is Juicy man this thing is so good I know it's good because I'm experiencing it you know it's good because of knowledge because when I eat an orange the juice runs down my elbow you would say man that thing must be good Tim's getting all in that thing juices everywhere but you wouldn't know how good it is right oh my but when I experience how good it is then I can tell you the taste is something else so God saiding I just didn't know you by knowledge come on I just don't know you Word of Life by knowledge I know you Word of Life by experience I had an experience with you before you ever got here amen amen I already knew you my experience so I was here listen to this so I was here before I was here I'll say it again I was here before I was here because brother Jim I have an Heavenly experience and my heavenly existence before I showed up on the Earth was there so now I've been placed upon the Earth let me say it this way when Jesus mentions this in the Kingdom there in the scriptures and he speaks of being lost notice this because I believe that we existed in heaven and we had the kingdom there this is why it's Kingdom versus the Mind world so if this is true listen carefully and I been lost means we were there at one time Jesus speaks of The Parables the coin lost the sun lost different Parables the boy was a son before he ever left home The Boy comes to his dad and says hey I want uh give me all that you owe me well here's $300,000 this is your part of the inheritance and he goes out and he wastes it on the Bible says rotness living now he he now at this time has got away from the assment that God has called him to do the other boy is at home and he's fulfilling everything his daddy wants he's doing this he's staying right true with his daddy he's mad at his daddy cuz he got to stay at home to get his $300,000 and his his brother got $300,000 cuz he left went out and just spent it and lived any way he wanted to but the boy was a son before he ever did that amen amen God didn't throw him away the daddy didn't throw him away the Bible says that when the boy found out and realized who he was and what he was doing he was in a pig pin and he was eating with the pig pin of the husk of the Hogs and he come the Bible says he came to himself what did he do he run back home the daddy seen him and said go get the fatted cave get the ring get the everything ready we're going to have a celebration why because he's coming [Applause] back oh if I had time to preach on the word on the two letters r e so before I put you on the earth in a body I already knew you by experience before I was here I was here so I existed in heaven I had a part of the Kingdom I am a part of the Kingdom I was one time there so how can how can listen this how can I lose something that never was mine you can't lose something if he ain't never been yours the sun was lost the was lost it's something that we formerly had so we had it in heaven but once we entered the Earth we lost it I was in my right position in heaven when I was under the kingdom but when I entered into the Earth something happened and I lost it by the Garden of Eden experience I tell everybody we're not going back to a you know you hear people say boy I can't wait one day we're going to step back into the garden of even why we've got to go further than that sin was there sin was there that's time we got to go Sister Janet before there was time so it's something that we formerly had God already owned me so it come to the Earth and got all mixed up and all messed up you see what is doing he's bringing a Redemption the word re e oh if we could lay it down I'm fix to preach on it next Sunday at my place Jesus now brings it down to the Earth my kingdom come listen my will be done in earth as it is in heaven the greatest prayer ever prayed my will notice this my kingdom come my will be done in earth as it was in heaven why because that's where I was I was there he knew me there he experienced me there the kingdom is the spirit of God coming down to live inside of you you agree is there a literal kingdom yes there's going to be a kingdom but the kingdom now is God taking up residence inside of you so we live out the word on Earth as it was in heaven that's your assignment you live out the word on Earth as you did in heaven I had that in heaven but the fall of Man made me lose that notice the Bible say there's two trees in the garden one of them was life we know the other was knowledge good evil some of it was good some of it was bad knowledge some of it was bad knowledge some of it was good knowledge because if you look at the if you if if you look at knowledge if if you know something by knowledge that's totally different than knowing it by experience it's got to be by experience God didn't know me only by knowledge he known me be be by the experience that he had with me there so if I lost my keys or I lost my wallet it had to been mine in the first place in order for me to lose it right I think I said it at Happy Valley one time there it's difference in being created and being made made the word made means to be formed means The Potter's will he takes the clay and begins to form it into a body that's not created that's made notice the scriptures and blessed be the Goda of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ so according to this verse that I just read I don't have needs let that sink in according to this verse in Ephesians 1:3 you don't have needs listen boy I got some big eyes looking now listen to the scripture blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings so according to that verse I don't have needs everything's fulfilled so God ain't the problem I'm the problem brother Tim we have needs on this Earth that's why you got to come to church and get in that real that he supplies that need he's already supplied brother Ram told us he done did it that's right the scripture in Ephesians 1 three tells us he's done did it with all spiritual blessings not one not two not just some with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ he's already met my needs the problem is brother Rob they're in another dimension so I've got to find some way to get in that Dimension to pull out the need that I've got brother M tells us over and over everything you need is already in you even the Rapture where in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus notice this according to as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made means highly favored means exerting his holy influence on you turns them to Christ gives them Christian V virtues this is what the word made means gives them Christian virtues the spiritual condition of one governed by the power of a divine grace means the token so everything I need so before I give you a body I had already created you before I give you a body I had already experienced you now I can't get all this out in one service today I've preached four I've preached eight services at home so in heaven I had the kingdom then I lost it when I came to Earth now he's got to bring the kingdom down so he brings it down notice his prayer that my will be done in on Earth as it is in heaven so now his Kingdom's here where is his kingdom I'm looking at his kingdom so in this Kingdom there's assignments that he's placed for each one of us to do in this Kingdom now will there be a kingdom sure there's going to be a kingdom but this morning we're looking at the Kingdom so he now brings the kingdoms down where was you prior of this you was in his mind you was in his thinking you are predestinated to be here so your life was not just random on the earth he was assigning you with an assignment upon the Earth you are a continuation from Heaven on the earth that you will go back not up on a Cloud Nine somewhere not on a cloud 10 somewhere you only move 10 to 15 20 ft maybe we know that how by God sending a revelated prophet in the end time not just his words but he tied it with scripture so before you were born the word born here means wound wo m b e d so your life started in heaven not with your mother and father so before I put you on the Potter's will and made you a body or formed you a body I had already experienced you CU you were chosen in Christ when before the foundation of the world that's before Genesis so am my assignment upon this Earth he had already put his hands on me and marked me and set me aside before I ever showed up here this morning yes before you young people ever showed up at school or homeschooled whatever y'all go or wherever you go before you ever showed up whatever you do he already had placed his hands upon you and formed you and knew you and Sanctified you listen to the word here be before I wound you watch I Sanctified you means to become holy we know that sanctification sanctification brother Jim he just saves us sets us aside for service a holy life is that true but let's just be right before I close let's look at it in another Avenue that be all right it means to prepare are to dedicate just let me come out and say it this way actually the word Sanctified here in the scriptures that Jeremiah uses we know it's to be holy we believe in that I believe in Holiness y'all believe in Holiness but here's the thing with with with with being sanctification people believe that I watch How I say this the problem is church people is made Holiness is getting everything right bear with me now don't throw me out yet just bear with me well message people's done this too Pentecostal people's done this Holiness people's done this well Holiness is just getting everything right well if that's the case ain't none of us that's right there's got to be another version that's right not saying that we all live filthy lives I don't believe any of you in here desire to do that but if we go by that then we we're not holy right sanctification is a part of Holiness sure it is we can show you scripture all day long in it but let's look at it's like I told my church let's look at it in another Avenue then their eyes get this big around now listen carefully holy don't mean that you and I get everything right every day that's right boy I'm you you've heard boy he lives so holy go to work with him boy you know old brother so and so sister and so oh my they live so holy do you go home with them do you go to work with them do you see them going down the road when they're when the when when they're just chewing that person in front of them out that's right I don't want they just need to get out of my way I just got somewhere to go so you don't see that side of them now that don't mean that person's not living right it don't mean they're not saved it don't mean they're not full of the Holy Ghost it don't mean they're not converted it don't mean they're not born again get that out of your mind but look at the scripture that that that Jeremiah uses here's the thing if you and I can get everything right every day all the time we don't need Jesus Christ and we don't need this message and we don't even need to be here Harry play a song and let's go home and forget it but what y'all here for what y'all here for cuz you don't get everything right that's right well Tim why you hear cuz I don't get everything right amen get in front of me when I'm in a hurry and I know you ain't supposed to do it but I'll sit down on a horn in a minute you do that too God bless you man for being honest my wife says what you doing that for I said I've got somewhere to go if if if you and I were holy every day all the time everywhere we went then we wouldn't need Jesus Christ this morning you want to know what the word holy you want to know what this actually means Sanctified in this verse of scripture separate listen separate and other now right now it don't make no sense none of y'all does it separate and other stay with me for a second cuz if you don't get this part it's going to be hard to get the other part cuz I preached eight services on this so now I got to come back eight more times to finish this so before I put you on the potter's wheel I already had an experience with you I'm going through it quickly now you had the kingdom you were chosen in Christ before I ever said let there be light there you was before I put the clay in the womb and come forth to be fruitful I Sanctified you now I'm going explain what other it is now hold on so look at the place he put you so before I did all of that I put you in a place where you need to embrace your separateness and otherness you say that ain't words it is in my vocabulary so I have to embrace my separateness now all of y'all go home and look at up and see if that's real words won't you I don't know if it's real words or not it just sound fine to me so I just use it so I embrace my separateness and my otherness I'll explain it and that's it's so hard to do because most people can't pay the price of other the price of other means being alone unless you compromise the price of other listen means being alone so people will compromise to have friends one of the greatest needs of humanity is needing somebody is that true how many people compromise what they actually believe to have friends that's right so I want to be accepted then I've got to compromise to be accepted so to be accepted that means I've got to become like them hold on hold on but here's the thing you don't know their assignment you're only you're only have to fulfill your assignment not their assignment that's right you don't know what their assignment is if their assignment isn't from God you don't need them in your life I'm talking about far as compromising I'm not saying you can't have friends if I be if I didn't have friends in the world I wouldn't have no friends most of the people hang around cuz I work so much they ain't even in the message but see what I have to do is not compromise I have to embrace the other why because it separates me which that's what the word Sanctified means in other words Jeremiah I have separated you from what everybody else was oh my so if their assignment isn't from God then it is of another spirit and that's where so many folks assignment is in a mess because people of that will mess up your assignment you know down deep in your heart what God's leading you and what God's got you to do in your life at times I'm I know you don't know every time and I don't neither and no man does that's Humanity but there's times in your life that you pray and you seek the will of God and God will you'll know which way to go but yet you'll find yourself going another way to please somebody else so don't compromise your other part because that part is the Holy Ghost don't compromise that part because of the world this why you are different notice the scripture Jesus said you are the salt of the earth and he said the salt that loses its saltiness is only good for the dung Heap now that's Jesus's own words I didn't say that so if he put you on the earth there's a reason and a purpose and assignment he sprinkled you with salt and if that salt don't make you different then you're no good to him if salt don't make me different then I'm no good to him I'm here to be around somebody to help make them thirsty so if I can feed them a little salt I know when you get when you eat a lot of salt you want to just drink water water and Pepsi and cola and all that stuff is that right believe me I put salt salt salt salt I put salt on I don't taste my food without salt it's it ain't food is no good without salt period everybody sits down at the table and say you ain't going to taste it first no cuz I know it's no good not till I put salt on it that's just the truth my wife says Tim you going to have a heart attack I mean I'll put salt that's what Jesus done to us he just sprinkled salt all over y'all now you make somebody else thirsty by the salt in your life so you don't you you be separate you be different but yet there's something about you that draws them in there's a there's a atmosphere and a spirit about you that pulls that person inise the Lord that you can make them salty thank you Lord that you're able to fulfill your assignment notice this Sanctified to be different now this is the word that Jeremiah uses to be separate to be aart from other there's not but two Spirits look at the word ordained to give or to bestow to entrust to set an appointment are an assignment so Jeremiah before any of this ever happened I knew you I have set you aside I've set you separateness I've set you over here you're different you're not a part of that and I have Sanctified you I have made you I have formed you I have ordained you and the word here means to give and assignment Jeremiah I didn't bring you to the Earth that you'd be like the world Jeremiah I didn't bring you here for you to be like so and so's Church Timber dad I didn't bring you down here that you can make your church like so and so's church and you could be like this and your people be like this I brought you here to set you aside right I brought you to the Earth to be different from all all this I brought you to be a Praying people a worshiping people and people set aside from other people to give an assignment notice in Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship means assignment created in Christ Jesus unto good works notice created in Christ Jesus under good works which God has ordained there's that word again that we should that we should walk in them so I'm born in the earth he wound me in the Earth but before he ever did that he knew me there and sent me here to have an assignment to worship to praise amen so when did he prep prepare you before you got here that you should walk in them we go through Seasons but the season was there before you got to the season he tells he tells uh where's my scripture I won't read all that scripture there but he tells he tells Moses before I before behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which I have prepared I've done been there you're going there but I've done been there before you that you going to walk in them so before I'm closing be by the time the stars were hung I like this by the time the stars were hung everything that they needed to be there to support them was already there before the vegetation come upon this Earth every on on the ground everything was there to support the vegitation before the cattle was there everything the cattle needed was there to support it by the time we got here God knew what we needed to support us when we would get here he would knew that you would need a Sabbath age messenger he knew you would believe seven Church ages he knew you would go back and you would understand and you would see a lot of that and bring it up but he said I've got to have them one they've got to have somebody to support them they need something in their life in this Leto sin Church age that's going to be different than that it's going to be greater than that so before all of that he has prepared a prop Prophet to come on the scene the Bible says God ordered my footsteps he prepared my days so you step from season into another season into another season and before you step into those Seasons God's done prepared those Seasons that you're going to step into wow he knows you're G to step in that season praise the Lord so what you need in that season he's done put it there to support you he's not going to leave you that's right thank you Jes I know it feels like he's a million miles away from us many times but his word don't lie I'll be there I'll be in you I'll be with you in you even even in you to the end why I've already been there I've done experienced you I know who you are amen amen Lord understand when I say this we come to church all the time boy we need God to move this morning we need God to move oh God moved God's done moved the problem is he needs to move me amen you understand what I'm saying oh God move this morning God move before you ever got here that's right now God needs to move me in the right position that I know he moved [Applause] hear all these preachers say all time boy boy we hope God just moves this morning especially you big p you big Pentecostal maybe he'll move this morning and he'll jump down here on the floor and he'll shout and he'll do this oh God come move and speak in tongues this morning oh God Dance Let Us dance and let us move Lord move this morning why he's done moved he needs to move me I need to lay claims on what he's did for me he's prepared it for me I'm in the season of man estation the assignment that God has set for me I need to lay claim on it yes sir what Tim I don't know how to fulfill my assignment musicians come I don't know how to fulfill how do I know when I'm fulfilling my assignment now keep in mind I can't preach and say what I said at home cuz we'll be here for five weeks so I'm having to in and take out just listen brother Timothy how do I know when I'm fulfilling the right assignment for me I'm glad y'all asked that if I would have come out here this morning brother Harry with a fishing rod y'all knew where I was going watch him doing oh he's going fishing if I come on the pull pit with a with with with a rifle what where's tell he's he's he's going deer hunting why you'd know the season that I'm in oh my Bo if we could see this if I was to come out here with a surfboard and come out here with all that You' say well Tim's going surfing today that's one thing you never catch me with a surf board cuz I'd be dead why it would be the season fart so you see me in the season that I'm in I'm preaching the revealed word it's the season it's the manifesting time of that season that's right so if you see me preaching reveal word you know I'm preaching the season that we have been taught through the scriptures and through the prophet yes if you see me laying on hands what am I doing I'm in the season some people don't believe in laying on hands that's perfectly fine I'm not that a heal to die on to me some people needs that brother Harry I'm going to tell you when I'm sick I want everybody to touch me I don't like being sick cuz I know if I don't have the faith to just take it myself I'm going to walk by and I'll let every all of you just touch me bless him Lord bless him Lord touch him Lord he needs it Lord I do that's the season friends we're in the season that we need to cut that giant head off it's time to fulfill the assignment that God's called me for and called you for when you go hunting way out y somewhere El and bear and all that you get what you put in for tags you hear the terminology that these people use when they say well how'd you do a good friend of mine he he goes all over the world hunting he's a good friend of mine but I really don't like him because he don't get me to go with him so he'll called me and send me pictures of this and send me pictures of elk a m deer last week a bear this week a big he went out South Dakota the other day and got a off of the reservation and uh uh got a got a one of those big old Bison one him big he kills everything he'll say man I tagged out I tagged out I tagged out you know what we need to do we need to tag out on the devil we need to get rid of him that's what they call it I tagged out we need to tag out on the devil we're in the season fart we're not in Luther's day we're not in Wesley's days and hold your ters and put your seat belt on we're not even I don't know if I need to go ahead and say the other rest of it or not I'll whisper to you how about that we're not back in those days we're in a greater season we're in a greater season Lord we have a different message the assignment for Luther and Wesley is totally different than the assignment of brother bham the assignment for Baptist Methodist Church of God nothing wrong with them I got a lot of friends and all of that their assignment is totally different than yours let me tell you something you're responsible for what you hear right every service you come through them doors you're responsible for it notice in Joshua 1:1 after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant's dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou all the people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness of the Lebanon even to the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before you all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto the people shalt thou divide an inheritance of the land which I swear un to their fathers to give them oh my goodness he puts Moses on this assignment and let me say this before I close Moses had to get them out of Egypt before he could get Egypt out of them Moses had to get them out of Egypt before he could get Egypt out of them you see a man drowning you got to get the man out of the water before you get the water out of the man as long as they was in Egypt their assignment was fulfilling in Egypt they done everything that Egypt wanted the Pharaoh wanted but God come to a time where they cried and cried for deliver and God said these people are mine we know the whole story but we forget it often brother Harry these people are mine why did Philippians 2:5 say let this mind that was in Christ be also in you all not WR to be equal with God because he wanted to change our thinking got change my thinking he's got to change all y'all's thinking yes sir oh God what a promise listen friends Satan ain't afraid of the promise he's afraid of the manifestation of the promise brother John you can quote the promise all day long but now start manifesting the promise that's right what God promis God promise god promise manifest the promise right then Satan gets scared why because that's a part of the assignment that God give you manifest the promise it's in you you're the kingdom God help us you love him today he's good to us ay notice Deuteronomy 2:1 my this is so powerful Moses is in line to be the next king that's his assignment but God changes the whole mission ah when Moses was coexisting with Egypt they didn't have no problem with him why because he was basically compromising with them he wasn't being that other but when God said now it's time he goes out there and kills an Egyptian tries to do it all himself throws him off the mountain they take him put him on the back outa desert throws a stick with him God's changing his whole assignment around now he's been with Egypt now he's going against Egypt go against the devil and see what happens go against him quit walking beside him quit giving him room in your house quit giving him a bedroom see what he does to you that means you're moving into a different manifestation of your life yes and when he come against the enemy brother Harry his battle begin when his assignment changed notice Deuteronomy 1 then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me we can pass Mount Syria many days and the Lord spake unto me saying you have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward I feel like that's where we're at it's time to move and commanded thou the people saying ye are pass through this coast of your brethren children of Esau which dwell in seir and they are afraid of you take you good and heed unto yourselves therefore rise up and take your journey pass over the river Amron before I've given you the hand in thy hand shaon the Amorite the king of heshbon and his land began to possess it and contend look notice their assignments changing they're tired of living in the same condition so they're changing their mindsets changing in their assignments changing notice what he says tells them to do in his land and begin to possess it and conjunction contend with him in battle in other words to cause to Strife to stir up to excite to engage to war wage war wage war on the devil let don't let him keep Waging War on you telling you you don't know who you are don't let him keep Waging War on you and say y you're not a real Christian you you you wasn't holy yesterday when you fuss that man out up y

shaon and his land before thee begin to possess it now that thou mayest inherit the land it's going to take some fighting Word of Life it's going to take some wage Ward but we're just we're we're all
