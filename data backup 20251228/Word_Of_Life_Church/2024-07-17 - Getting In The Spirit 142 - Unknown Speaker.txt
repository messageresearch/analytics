the right place if you got wet wood we'll take care of that too we get some long winded preachers in you're and blow you wood dry oh praise the Lord how many's happy to be in church on Wednesday night amen I love to go to church absolutely love to go to church I like going to church even when I ain't preaching I like hearing the word when I ain't preaching which is very rare I get to do that but I really enjoy it I just love going to church you know you've seen a lot of preachers they're Wilding a buck they're preaching and when they ain't preaching they're As Dead As a hammer so I realized a long time ago a lot of preachers don't get turned around with the word but they get turned on by when they're preaching the word which seems really strange to me I think we ought to the word ought to just bless us whether we're in our church or in a visiting church or at a youth camp or when you're at home listening to a tape praise the Lord I think the word of God ought to excite us and get us ready to leave this world we're living in an awful time a dark time a dreadful time a pitiful time a sad time a wretched time a dark time but we're living in the greatest hour a person could ever live to be a child of God because the events that have been longed for and waited for for thousands of years are within our reach we are that close Amen to the resurrection amen that close to the WRA rure that close to so many great things happening amen God bless you well how y'all doing that was my little warm-up sermon y'all didn't like it very well but I guess I'll try another one then praise the lord lord weling tomorrow night we'll be um having question answers meal be provided brother Joe told me at 6:00 for those that for our youth those of you that want to stream remember that service will begin at 7 let's turn tonight if you would to 1 Corinthians chap 15 verse 47 the first man is of the earth earthy the first man is of the Earth Earth it now Paul is not speaking about the order of the creation of the soul of Adam but he's speaking about Adam Adam is the Hebrew word that God gave to man which means red he's out of the earth so Paul says the first man is of the earth earthy isn't it amazing that he doesn't say Earthly but earthy earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven course he knows the Lord Jesus as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy everybody I see here tonight is earthy right the man you're looking at in the Pulpit is earthy but I hope there's another part about all of us that is Heavenly as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy which is what causes us all of our problems and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly as we have borne the image of the earth everybody look this way this jacket right here and this suit they're made out of a pattern of course they pile layer on top of layer on top of layer Caroline I used to work at a garment Factory in Kentucky before I went fulltime so I worked in the shipping Department which was right next door to the cutting department so they had these gigantic long tables and them guys would take them rolls of fabric and go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth uh Karen Harry's wife brother used to work in that department where they lay it all out then they would take these gigantic long patterns and sometimes the layers of fabric it's unbelievable how high they would make them so then they had the Cutters so they'd lay out these big long patterns and all the Cutters would do is go in there if they can follow the line they'd take them sharp knives big old blades about that long and they would go through and cut all of that out then they would have people that would bundle it up so this is j3 this is J2 this is J10 this is J1 then they would take it in buggies big old buggies and take it over to the ladies department for them to start sewing so they would start putting it all together now they would have random of course sizes they made ladies pajamas Women's and Children's they would have pajamas they would have gowns they would have house coats but you know they didn't have one that would say for people they didn't measure them this way so we'll make one for women that are 5T tall and then we'll make another one for women that are 6 foot tall and then we'll make one for women that are in between that 5 and 1/2 ft tall so they would have small medium and large now in that whenever them women would buy that from Alden from Spiegel from all these different places that garment would take on the image of the person who put it on no doubt this suit made in China no telling how many men wound up with the exact same suit that I got but yet that suit will take the shape of the person who's wearing it now let's say it this way if I was some what of a larger composition was that a nice way of saying that or what so then this coat would not do like this well you could wrap it way around this way but it might take more of this shape okay so instead of my little skinny arms and it was a guy that was big Brony Guy what's that jacket going to do it's going to to take on his image so if it was a guy like brother Paul quite a bit taller than I am and he would have on my pants he would go around looking like this why same suit taken on the image of the person it goes on so our lord Jesus had to come to the Earth and take on an earthy image now as we have born I read this to you last time we looked at this where to Bear constantly of clothing or garments so as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God I remind you again he didn't say flesh and Bones Jesus after his resurrection said a spirit hasth not Flesh and Bones as you see me have but Jesus in his new body did not have blood we will not live off of blood in the glorified body now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption how many in your Earthly house tonight has needs desires petitions before the Lord let's take them to him Lord Jesus how grateful we are that we could gather here tonight father it's such a privilege and also an honor for us to be gathered together we know also our responsibility for we are going to give an account for our opportunity Lord God we believe that church is not a routine it's not a ritual it's an awesome thing by which we have been made partakers of and because it is so awesome anything that you give us it is so awesome also has a great responsibility with it then we will answer for how we treat that awesome gift that you've given to us so we want to look at it that way that every time we come to church every time we come to the house of God that we know that it's not only a blessing not only a privilege not only an honor but also a responsibility so every service that we participate in we will give an account for that service for those services that we could have have attended and we just decided not to little do people know they will also give account of those I pray that you would help each of us to realize what an awesome thing it is to be the children of God speak to us tonight from your word father in the name of Jesus we ask it and the church said amen the church said amen yeah okay I think I'll go ahead and preach to you then that other one sound like a Church of Christ you can be seated God bless you praise the Lord let's revisit the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus now before we go into this tonight in Corinthians I know we've talked about a little lot and many of you have read about it a lot and you've heard it preached a lot read with me in Matthew 27 45 now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now with both Luke and Matthew the the Greek word that they use here for land is not a regional word that would have been applicable to Israel only but it's very unique the word that they use was like the whole earth the entirety of the mass of the earth now listen to that carefully again from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land until the night hour so they kept time a lot different from us so around 6:00 in the morning would have been the first hour so the sixth hour then would have been noon the 9th hour would have been 3:00 in the afternoon so about the 9th hour Jesus cried with a loud voice a loud voice Eli Eli L saai that is to say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me so from 12:00 as we would say it today till 3:00 there was this darkness that was over the entire Earth seemed quite unusual now it was indicating that there was a far greater extent of the darkness than just in a local scenario it was a Darkness that the entire Earth had experienced it was not a local phenomenon it was not even a an eclipse now they had eclipses of course before this but as most of you know those eclipses only last for a few minutes and the Passover this is the Passover time and Passover was always held in the time of the full moon which an eclipse at the lunar calendar could not happen in a full moon cycle so God is doing something that is very very rare and he's making the heavens test testify of a supernatural phenomena so the longest Eclipse would be no more than two to three minutes so whatever is going on happened for 3 hours so the reason that the darkness prevailed upon the Earth is because the Sun is failing to shine now think of what the sun is so the sun I found this very interesting the reason for this Darkness was the Sun's light was failing the sun itself is but a vast nuclear fire a sustained and continued reaction in which the Sun's mass is being reduced at a rate of four million tons per second now listen this nuclear fire that is happening on the surface of the Sun so the Sun's mass is being reduced at a rate of 4 million tons per second so that is over 14 billion tons an hour this is how much the mass of the Sun is being consumed in order to give us the light and the warmth and the Rays that comes from the Sun so in an hour 14 billion tons of the Sun's mass is being consumed so God halted the reaction for three hours of the son's Mass being consumed so while the son of righteousness is hanging on the cross God would not let the son project its light to the Earth for three hours it hung in shame and humiliation tulan said this in the same hour too the light of day was withdrawn when the son at the very time was in his Meridian Blaze those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ no doubt thought it was an eclipse you yourselves have the account of the world portant still in your archives now tertian what he had done he had appealed and written to proculus which was a Roman senator now listen I've got a reasoning going this way the Lord God is going to have this written and validated in the historical records so this was not known just by Christians but it was known by the Roman government amen now listen so tertullian appealed to proculus a Roman Senator and it is certain tertian would not have made such an appeal to the Roman records had it not been true I found this next one just as overwhelming Pontius Pilate sent the following report to Tiberius emperor of Rome and when he had been crucified there was Darkness over the whole Earth the Sun oh my having been completely hidden and the heaven appearing dark so that the Stars appeared but had at the same time their brightness darkened as i s suppose your reverence is not ignorant of because in all the world they lighted lamps from the sixth hour until the evening and the Moon being like blood did not Shine the whole night yet she happened to be at the full now I find it amazing how that God will correlate certain things when he wants them known and Records to be kept about them and yet he can also allow something that we would think would be very similar to it and he would allow it to be a secret so it all depends on the orchestrator himself and how that he will lay out the program of his word now what man does man will look at something that God has done and then he will take his own mind and look at prophetic things and think well if God did this this certain certain way right here then if God is going to do something else then God has to do it exactly the same way cuz we just we just know that's the way he'll do it no we're guessing that's the way he will do it but sometimes he will take something though it looks very similar and he will do it in a complete complet different way now notice Jesus hanging now on the cross and again Matthew 27:15 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost he cried with a loud voice and yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the Temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened I want you to look at this word Graves Seer grave or tomb any visible object for preserving or recalling the memory of any person or sing now most of them did not have graves in the way that we do today but they were buried in sepers which would be a hollowed out place in Solid Rock or it could be above the ground or in the ground but still they chose Rock I want you notice how this order of events happens so Jesus cries with a loud voice and what he does he gives up The Ghost and whenever he did that the earth started shaking now remember the darkness is still upon the Earth friends it must have been a terrifying time now remember 3 hours of Darkness had been upon the Earth the stars come out now remember this is not only in the gospels but it's also in the Roman records and in the historic record of tulian which is only one of the ones that I could have read to you tonight now God wanted it to be recorded in history Now watch how that Matthew says it and it's it's a little bit tricky you got to be careful in the way that you read it and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection but I want you to notice what took place in in verse 53 when he shouted with a loud voice and then the sepers open now to you and I we're thinking well you know that' go out turn they'd have to dig them up no no that that wasn't the way they buried them so say they were buried in a stone separer and they would roll a rock round ones I've been there and seen them they still have them thousands of years old and whenever the Lord Jesus cried with a loud voice and the Darkness as at the last phase of the darkness and he cries with a loud voice yields up the ghost then what's the order of events then an earthquake takes place and when it does the gantic rocks that are blocking the doorways of the sepers they start rolling open but those Saints whose bodies were there did not get up right then now we know that Abraham Isaac Jacob many of the Old Testament Saints were part of that number but I want you to think with me tonight no doubt there had been some who had accepted the Messianic promise under the ministry of the Lord Jesus right then and there were probably people that had just been dead for a day or two or a week or a month or a year so how would these people have known historically that there was truly a resurrection and they saw their loved ones appear so they did not have a picture of Abraham or Isaac or Jacob or Joseph are none of the Patriarchs so they could have stood right by him you know in a market or whereever they would have never even known that it was Abraham how were they going to know that their loved ones had actually raised up because there was some elect that would have passed just recently so they had took their mama out there put her in the seple they took their daddy their brother their child or whatever more and whenever the resurrection took place they looked and there was mama now remember this all coincides their Resurrection answered to the need of the day listen their Resurrection answered for the need of the day now the Lord Jesus shout Was Heard by many many people the great cry from the cross Was Heard by many people these de head that got up was seen by many people but yet there's no historical record that anybody other than the elect ever saw the Lord Jesus after his resurrection that's right an't that amazing so in the resurrection he did not appear in the city and let other people see him but who did he allow to witness that resurrection and speak on his behalf his believing children now watch in Matthew 27:53 and they came out of the graves after his resurrection you see the order of God would have been broken had they got up before he got up so what God did was God through the shout now remember he had a loud voice what was it a shout so he let force a loud voice a shout amen and whenever he shouted then the the tomb started opening up but no bodies come out so the doors started opening but they could not come out amen until he come out first now watch and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared un to many now remember this Resurrection fit for the need of the day now hang on with me you know I'm laying a foundation for something that is not the need in our day ours is a total secret you see this is where people get it wrong they're looking at this one and they're thinking well the Rapture for the bride the resurrection all that for the bride it'll be exactly the way it was there no no it won't actually because our need for the day is not so it'll be written down by the Roman government or our government or any other government it's Romeo and Juliet it's a love story it's not going to be written down for people to read it for 2,000 years there ain't going to be nobody here that's going to need to read it amen now watch with me in John 12:4 what the Lord Jesus said about himself verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone now watch how he speaks of his own identity and he does not call himself the sheath he does not call himself the sheath he does not talk about himself in the multiplied form but the single form and he calls himself the corn not the corns but the corn of wheat praise the Lord I know you're quiet you're listening that's all right verily verily I say unto you except a singular corn singular of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth singular alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now watch here is the process by which he's going to multiply by himself and that is through death so he went down in the single form but when he raises it will be in the multiplied form praise be to God Read With Me Now Leviticus 2310 speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye be com into the land which I given to you listen closely and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheath which was a tenth of an OM but in a modern day terms it would be about the size of two liter so think 2 lit Coke there you go so 2 lit now I want you to think of how many stalks that it would take now so here you're going to have a bun so say about this bigger ramp there's not going to be one grain that's going to be able to do that so what are they doing they're Gathering the mature ones and they're going to bring this and when they bring it to the priest it's going to be about this size right here 2 L bottle and they're going to bring that to the priest now then you shall bring a sheath so in this sheath is not one One Singular grain so he didn't say whenever you bring it bring a corn of wheat just pick up one little tiny grain and bring that one little tiny grain and give it to the priest but he will say whenever you bring it I want you to bring a whole handful and then I want the priest to wave that whole handful before the congregation because this is the deposit this is the deposit that the rest of the the field is coming into the maturity then ye shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheath not the single grain but the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath shall the priest wave it so on the marrow after the Sabbath so they're going to have seven sabbaths and then the tomorrow which will be the day after the Sabbath which is of course going to be on day 50 7 time 7 49 so they'll have seven sabbaths and the Jubilee feasts and all that coming down through there now it says after that you're going to have what is going to be called Pentecost and on the tomorrow after the Sabbath 7 * 749 so one more day added to that which is 50 now you know the word Pentecost means 50 right so when the day of Pentecost was fully come so on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall take this whole bundle and he's going to wave it before the Lord and He Shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the marrow after the Sabbath notice after to the Sabbath shall the priest wave it and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheath and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord so a sheath what does it do it implies plurality not Singularity not one but the sheath signifies more than one so the sheath implies par ity so it was a corn of wheat that's going to go down they're going to take him off the cross they're going to put his body in the ground but the rolled stones are already signifying the voice of the Resurrection has spoken so when the corn of wheat goes into the earth now watch then when he raises up what actually happens when he gets up he goes down of course into paradise and by this spiritual translation his Spirit goes into the hands of God he goes down into paradise and down into hell he takes the keys away from the devil then he goes over in next door to Paradise where Abraham and Isaac and all the saints of God were and he empties out paradise and then he begins to CL say come on children let's go back up on the earth and the prophet said Abraham said Lord would you mind if we would stop up there for a little bit I'd like to just kind of walk around the city and see what it looks like you mind if we make what the prophet called a Whistle Stop he said yeah that's fine cuz I'm going to stop and spend a few days with my disciples so when the Lord Jesus appears on the earth and he also joined in that can you imagine all that Mary and Martha and you know Peter and John went up there and you remember the story on the resurrection morning but all they noticed and we have no record there the rest of them even saw it but yet here Matthew which I find totally amazing that Mark never mentioned this Luke never mentioned this John never mentioned this and yet according to your Bible you're not even supposed to believe in without two or three Witnesses and Matthew is the only witness show me where Mark said this show me where John said it well come on don't get Qui said there looking at me apparently the apostles must have deemed Matthew such a believable witness now was Matthew the only one that saw them was Matthew the only one that gathered all this information together I don't know and if I needed to know the answer would be there perform it the way I look at it Matthew's word is enough for me well if I'm going to believe that when Paul never Vindicated it nor Mark never Vindicated it nor John never Vindicated I have no problem that God could raise up a prophet in the last day and say things that denominations don't go along with and preachers don't go along with because if Matthew could write something that no nobody else ever said none of the other writers even mentioned it in their scripture and we hold on to it do we not and Matthew was not a prophet Matthew was not a great man like Paul was but Matthew was a scribe but I'm so glad Matthew wrote it down I'll tell you one thing when God gets ready to do something the devil is not going to stop him and the church said amen and the Lord Jesus when he raises from the dead then out of those Graves come the dead Saints and they enter into their glorified bodies now unlike what the rest of the dead now remember Jesus raised several Dead when he were here but he raised them and gave them a temporary Resurrection every one of them people that he raised from the dead they all died twice they die again twice so they had to go right back to the grave but these are being raised from the dead to never have to die again and what did they do they entered in with him don't you understand it's part of the mystery of you and I in the last day that we enter in with him our head done raised from the dead but not only our head but human beings like us that believe the word of God we already have an account according to Matthew that they raised and entered in with him what was it God not only raised the head but God raised the Old Testament elect body and they entered in with him at the sheath waving testifying and prophesying Donnie your day is coming Fred your day is coming Paul your day is coming because God wrote it in their lives and God wanted it written down God wanted eyewitnesses but our Resurrection he slips down as a thief in the night and as Romeo leaned his ladder up against Juliet's window and climbed up the ladder Julia juliad wake up Julia it's Romeo are you ready to go sweetheart wait a minute let me tell my mama shh no no no no it's a seven seal sh it's silence to them they don't understand it they look right at it but they just can't see it sh so what do you want me to do you want me to go down and and and ask my daddy's permission what do you want me to do you want me to wake the whole house no sweetheart just come out the window with me just come out the window with me now want you to notice the Lord Jesus when he raises from the dead and he allows his children of the Old Testament to take on a visible form and there's sister so and so she died just a week ago that was a young boy that died just a month ago that was another person that Sav died uh you know a year and a half ago and that they had heard Jesus preach and they believed with all their heart they was included in the resurrection so year they raised up from the dead and they were seen by many can you imagine having that testimony and you're the mom and dad and you say you know what me and me and husband was sitting there eating breakfast and in walked our boy in walked our boy raised from the dead what are you talking about woman I'm telling you it was the truth it was here we actually had him to sit down there and he actually took some of that we had some honeycomb and we had some cheese and we had some bread don't you know he picked that up and ate it well where's he at where's he at I don't know he was here for a few days and we just seen him walk in the wall he walked straight through the wall and we was just our fellowship and all of a sudden he just disappeared you imagine what the people thought about them poor old things they've lost their mind the loss of that son has drove them insane they did poor things you know we need to but then they heard somebody else in the city saw their old grandma but grandma wasn't old no longer and somebody else saw their daddy and somebody else saw their uncle and then all of a sudden they appeared and then you know that they they they disappear and how in the world is it that Matthew of an event like this Matthew was the only one that wrote about it now don't tell me you Scholars here tonight are going to believe it just because one person said it you sorry Hypocrites i't talking about you all now bless God I won't take what the prophet said without two or three Witnesses well if you don't do Matthew the same way you're a liar and you're a hypocrite wo well Glory do we believe it on what basis an anointed man of God that was that where did he get his information from Brother Phillip I don't know I looked I couldn't find one spec of History I couldn't find what Pontius pilot said it I couldn't find where this one said it or that one said it all I know is Matthew said they got up and they appeared unto many I don't mind telling you they didn't appear to everybody but they appeared unto many in our resurrection and Rapture that we are looking for when our loved ones raised up they will not appear to everybody but I believe I'm one of them that they will appear too Hallelujah why they are coming to bring a message message to us and what are we going to do we're going to enter in with them because we are making up the last day sheath our head will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and we're going to be CAU up to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the [Applause] Lord so you imagine they're all just sitting there and they're really perplexed and they're trying to understand what in the world is going on where we're living in Peculiar times and Thomas Miss service what says on Wednesday night Thomas wasn't to church on Wednesday night and wouldn't you know it Jesus showed up that's what he does you know if you have church on Sunday morning Sunday evening you know what every time it is Jesus is always going to be there cuz he said he would so Thomas wasn't at church he wasn't at the assembly but yet the Lord Jesus loved him so much and you know they said now Thomas we've seen him I'm telling you what we've seen him said I will not believe I'm telling you one thing until I can touch them holes in his hand and in his side I will not believe and the Lord Jesus just appears all hell Thomas come and handle me feel me oh what did Thomas say oh my my my second god of the trinitarian godhead my second person what did Thomas say my Lord and my God hallelujah my Lord and my God blessed are th Thomas because you have seen and ly but more blessed are those who have never seen and yet they believe you are blessed tonight Word of Life we never saw his hand we never saw his body yet we believe with all of our souls do we [Applause] not I wonder how it must feel the kind as we sat in our modern terminology to hang out with somebody and a glorified body you sit there and eat they eat with you but you sat down you're getting sleep in and you fellowshipped you know for hours and you're just you're nodding off and they're just sitting our all bug ey looking at you said ain't you sleepy I don't need to sleep they ain't drunk no Red Bull neither they got a hold of a red blood out of the Lamb of God hallelujah hallelujah oh can you imagine hanging out with glorified bodies and somehow they get the message from The resurrector Today is going up day wonder where they were when Jesus went up while the rest of the Apostles didn't see them where were they you see God can make people visible when he wants and makes him disappear when he wants you call me crazy if you want to it won't be the first time I've been called that I believe the Lord in the resurrection could let your loved ones appear to you in Walmart you're walking down through there you go through your grocery list I told her the other day I said tell you one thing inflation keeps rising up she had a grocery list laying on the counter at home and you know pretty good size piece of paper I told her I said the price of groceries and everything keeps going up we're going to start putting our grocery list on one of them posted things you know about that bigger Square about all you can afford to buy but you imagine going down through there and you're looking for your syrup and you're looking for your buttermilk and you're looking for this and that and the other somebody Taps you on the shoulder and it's your mama it's your daddy it's your grandpa it's your wife Lance you're going down through wh you're going down through loav like I was today rushing under there grabbing this grabbing that all of a sudden you bump into somebody and your hand just kind of goes through them and say Lord have mercy it's on the move is on it's around or somewhere everybody else stand there looking at you saying what in the world's wrong with them and you saying King you see them can't you hear them oh yeah I want to be so in touch with that Heavenly realm when they appear my eyes will pick them up my ears will pick them up because I am part of that last day sheath Hallelujah you cannot leave here without [Applause] me so watch Paul now to Ephesians 4:8 he quotes this from Psalms wherefore he sayth when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive praise God he led captivity captive so he went and captured Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all those you know that were elected for that resurrection and he captured them I'm so glad he's captured me already has he captured your heart you see that's where a lot of folks are missing it they just say well I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I don't understand how y'all feel you're just a bunch of Fanatics no it's not just that we're Fanatics he captured us he captured our heart he captured our desires he captured our our motives our objective we think about him we pray about him we pray about what we live we pray about where we go to church we pray about all kinds of things in life is that right why because we are prisoners of love people feel sorry for us oh them people can't do this and they can't do that it's not that we can't do it it's that we don't want to do it it's because our hearts we're not held by chains we're not held by holding you over a spell come on somebody we have been captured by the love of God I could drink if I wanted to I could smoke if I wanted to but why in the world what I want to do that the Lord Jesus captured my heart and my [Applause] soul Hallelujah so he led you're talking about amazing the way Paul places this and quoting David wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended which is but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all the heavens that he might fill all things now listen at the gifts and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers won't you notice who gave them and the original Greek and the language of that it was written in the he is very emphatic as a matter of fact it says he and he alone as the ascended head of humanity he gave Oh Glory instead of set or appointed he gave who what Ministry gifts you see it's not just that God called a preacher and God put just a gift in the preacher notice the writing of the word but actually the gifts are the men Glory they themselves are the gift from God to the church you see the people who despise the prophet and his message and they make it as if though it's an option well you all are going to heaven but they think some of us may I guess you know it's amazing how these people that leave the message they Embrace every denomination that there is and exclude us and they're supposed to be so inclusive sound like a bunch of Democrats to me I mean they're supposed to have so much love and so much accepting of everybody and they'll call this man brother and that man brother and that man brother except for the message preachers and they don't even call them brother they say they're a bunch of devils and going to hell and they have so much love for everybody except us they include the gays they include everything in the world except for us and they put us out well in one way that's a good sign because that means the shock is pulling away from the seed and I know we don't want to hear it but we've had shock around our message from any year but the Lord is letting the shock pull away so the bride can lay in the presence of the son and get ripe oh come on children let's have church tonight God wants to bring us into his presence so we can ripen and get ready to leave this world [Applause] you know this this is so sad in one way that the people that refuse the gifts that the Lord Jesus gave to them yes sir I said I don't need no Pastor I don't need no Evangel I don't need no teacher bless God I got all I need I got the tapes we see it's not that you're reject rejecting me it's not that you're rejecting brother Daryl the Lord Jesus placed these gifts in the body so you're saying to Jesus I don't want it keep your old fivefold Ministry Jesus I got tapes you don't even believe them tapes well come on don't get quiet on me now I thought you folks believe in going to church at least some of you you see it's not while they heard down his Fe it ain't hurting my feelings the Lord Jesus gave the body these what gifts but those gifts might minister to them sure friends he could have give us anything that he wanted to he don't you think he would give us the very best that he had to get us from here to there what if all preachers is bad and all preachers is wrong and all preachers are false why in the world would the Lord Jesus give such a thing to his body I guarantee you there some bad ones there's some ugly ones there's some on that left the word but that don't change God's word if God said he would give it God will give it and it's up to God to bring it to pass oh Hallelujah notice verse 12 so this is why I gave these gifts for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry singular only one now I'm the only preacher in Donnie Reagan's Ministry but I'm not the only minister in the ministry of this church I'm not the only minister in the ministry of the Bride I'm the only preacher in Donnie Reagan's Ministry but God's given us other ministers and our assist family and God's given us other old you say Oh Glory to God I go to church and I believe in going to church yeah but a lot of you just want to hear your pastor preach all the time and then you stick out your finger at them other people oh they won't hear a pastor they won't hear well some of you don't want hear an evangelist the same word that said pastor also said an Evangel well I'll tell you one thing them evangelists preach so simple and they preach this I'll tell you one thing when the prophet of God was going to preach them seal and he preached that sermon about God hiding himself he didn't say God hid himself in depth and revealed himself in mystery but God hid himself in Simplicity and revealed himself in the same when we get so big for our britches that we think we can't hear a simple sermon we need to hit the altar well come on somebody I don't care how much we think we know we want our hearts to be open to the very simplest thing that God would say Oh Glory for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till notice not till the tapes start to become duplicated but the books are printed till we all come in the unity of the face and the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man notice it's not plural you see we're not trying to become reganit pites Spencer ites whatever ites you want to be called by there's only one perfect man that's Christ Jesus so if you settle to be a reaganite you're settling way short of Ephesians 4:13 unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature so God pulled out his measureing tape and God measured Christ Jesus and he said this is the perfect man yes s he wasn't measuring his biceps he wasn't measuring the size of his legs he wasn't measuring how much Jesus could bench press he wasn't measuring you know how much pressure he had on his jaws and how much he could do all that but he measured him by character by full fillment of the word you see a man is not measured by how wealth he is a man is not measured by what he's accomplish I'll tell you one thing I started out a poor fell and I picked myself up by my own bootstraps and now I'm a millionaire and I turned into this and that and the other every bit of that is as lost as lost can be if you don't know Jesus the prophet said A man was measured by the bag in his knees how much time he spent before God In Prayer why is it we don't like those quotes we like to impress people by what we know oh we quote this and quote that and quote something else as if we're trying to win some type of something another you want a ribbon you want a star or what I don't know about you when God puts the measuring tape on me I want it to match the Lord Jesus that's the measure of the stature now in Corinthians whenever Paul wrote about the gifts of the Spirit in Corinthians the gifts are spiritual enablement that gifts the people not just Ministry but the people to be able to do certain things but the gifts in Ephesians are not a gift of the spirit but it's actually men so the Lord God gave to the first age Paul Peter James John on and on and on we could go that gift embedded in them now watch again in Matthew 27:53 and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many that there might be undeniable undeniable witnesses that corruption had bowed at the feet of the Resurrection can you imagine Abraham had gone beyond dust yeah Abraham had gone beyond dust you couldn't have found a bone of that man you couldn't have found a tooth you couldn't have found a hair you couldn't have found nothing he had gone beyond that and yet Abraham and Sarah stood there on the earth as a young man and a young woman glory to God hallelujah but the Lord Jesus himself did not witness of this Resurrection to the other people now you realize it won't be Jesus that'll come into your house the morning of the Rapture his feet will never touch the Earth again unto Revelation 19 how are we going to know the resurrection is on the f diminish part of the wave sheath the bride the bride the bride will appear in our homes and when we see her we know she's up because the head sent her glory be to God hallelujah now remember they will not be seen by everybody else they will not appear to everyone else it will not appear in the Washington newspaper in the New York Times there will not be YouTube videos and Instagram and Tik Tok and you know people go by the cemetery and oh my went by this cemetery and there was holes in the ground everywhere what the resurrection is on no wrong time y'all are just as puzzle this time as you was last time when I said this amen you see to prove his power over death knowing that this is the foundation or the beginning of the Gospel he wanted eyewitnesses but to prove he's at the end of the Myster history in the last days he says don't tell nobody their Resurrection matchs the need of the day to prove his power over deaths our Resurrection will match the need of the day to prove the Rapture is a secret listen to this and sudden secret going away we're looking for that secret sudden appearing of the Lord the Lord knows how people are and if he G gave every prophecy in such a meticulous way and people could read it like a newspaper some people would wait until the day before the Rapture and then they get ready Oh Glory to God hallelujah here I come so even sometimes prophecy is left you ever wonder why whenever brother brandham saw the woman and he wasn't sure if it was a woman ruling America or if it was the church wonder why some of the prophecies are left vague ersy ersy people look for something oh my where they can be able to pinpoint pinpoint but you know what pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man if the Lord don't come for another hundred years I ain't got a promise that I'll live to walk through that door when I get done preaching I want to live every day as if though it is my last day I'm not waiting for this prophecy to come to pass I'm not waiting for a woman president I ain't waiting for nothing myself I want to live Hallelujah I want to torment the devil I want to do everything I can for the kingdom of God I'll never have this day right here I'll never have this day again you will never have this day again don't live it with regrets but do everything you can this day for the Lord Jesus Oh My for there's something in the air a message of the holy spirit that tells us the coming is at end the sermon call look there that bride is looking to the coming of the Lord Jesus which that secret secret coming of Christ shall come and catch away his bride in the night like a book I read of Romeo and Julet at one time how it come with a latter and got his bride out among them that's what Jesus will come someday looking for that one oh my that is not looking to his Creeds but looking to Christ waiting for him to come with his heart centered they come blood relation like Isaac and Rebecca on blood relation that's what we have to come blood relation to Christ through the sacrifice let me close with this one and remember the coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away so a coming is actually a going they'll never know it when it happens our Resurrection must match the word of this day people think airplanes are crash everywhere cars are crash everywhere that happens on elegant Highway about every day now all gray-haired women with blue streets going down the H I think Lord have mercy I wish I had that button on my car where I could wide my wheels and go up over the top of them and scare the liver out of them I don't know why in the world every person in car County Gets behind you whenever you're getting ready to go somewhere don't sit there and look at me like a bunch of angels you know exactly what I'm talking about and they're thinking oh my this is going to happen and that's going to happen everybody's going to know it no they won't hardly nobody will know it it'll just be a bunch of people gone sir missing our Resurrection must match this day people will go to the graveyard oh I know Sister Stone's on know and they'll go there not one Speck of dirt that they notice listen friends when that happens Erica's grave will be left the same you know why she ain't there no way brother J May over our sistera no these Saints has passed from us they're not there it's just the old coat they're not there all the Earth contains those chemicals and the Lord Jesus speaks a shout a voice a trumpet he simply speaks and the Rapture takes place but if our bodies don't obey him now never he says don't do this don't do that don't do that don't do that What Makes Us believe we will recognize his voice when he said come away my love Hallelujah amen and remember the coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away he'll come and take her like a thief in the night and to think that if somebody all of a sudden there's members of our family gone and you're left behind again now look you know the coming of the Lord is going to be a secret coming there'll be be two in the bed I'll take one and leave one can you imagine if you're not filled with the Holy Ghost and your wife or your husband is and you look over in the night and they're gone and you think oh she just gone to the bathroom or he's gone to the bathroom want to get want to get a drink of water and you go back to sleep and you wake up in the morning the house shoes are there the robe is there you're running frantically through the house looking searching looking for their phone I know they wouldn't leave their phone behind they're glued to that iPhone but you find out their iPhone ain't there I mean there you can do all that search for my iPhone all you want to I won't be a one of them found up there it'll be left where you plugged it up the night before and then my brother sister what are you going to do then going to call Brother Daryl going to call me going to call one of the other preacher oh God I I know if it's happen brother Don will be gone oh Lord have mercy what am I going to do it will be that real someday a mom and daddy that played around with God and you played and played well I I think brother Donnie's just an old man and he's just worried and he just just trying he'd been preaching this for years and years and you know how he is I mean he just just Hammers and Hammers and you know just like he thinks the Lord's coming today I do you mean you all didn't look for him today I did hey I look for him ever since I got saved and I don't mind telling you the more brothers and sisters and Saints I've got on the other side after my daughter went on the other side heaven's got more sweeter to me than it ever was before I don't mind telling you I got more on that other side pulling me I told somebody not long ago I'll tell you one thing the more we keep losing we're getting more over there than we got left so the only the things going to happen is the rapture is going to take place and the Lord said come on children come on it's time for you to go home come on Juliet and what are we going to do we're going to be waved with our lord Jesus over this generation and we're going to Say byebye Goodbye World goodbye don't look for me CU I'll be gone because we followed his word our rapture will match the Prophecies of the day just all of a sudden you're standing there Your Love ones appear and a sweep goes over you your skin your hair your eyeballs your muscles your s you and he takes all the blood out of your body one moment you're a mortal and the next moment eternal life in a human body glory to God I never preach about it that I don't think about the dream that brother Ron Peterson had and I know I've shared it with you so many times because it it just so blesses my heart just a dream so I'll tell it it's a dream it was like the Rapture took place and there was thousand thousands times thousands of people and we was all gathered around the Lord Jesus and he was kind of in the middle of us all and we started praising him and praising him and the more we praised him the higher he got so it's like our Praises was just lifting him Higher and Higher and the higher he got the more we praised him until he just got up above us and there he was and we was all this worshiping and praising and he was looking down on us all oh Hallelujah I believe it'll be something like that one of these days we'll be come up missing on this Earth gathered together in another dimension we shall be changed stand Harvest Time the secret coming of the Lord Jesus shall be taken away and the rest of them go right along right ahead preaching just like it was in the days of Noah glory to God we got it Hallelujah sealed to their death you imagine friends so there'll be people sitting at home and they'll push play glory to God I'm hearing the voice of God and the bride's done gone does it make any difference to God whether you deny Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 oh well brother Donnie some people need a preacher but I don't I agree with you most goats don't but sheep do I said sheep do I pastured a few goats in my life I've got a few Ram places in my side and a few Ram places in my belly and few Ram places in my head trying to change goats but I've done realize a long time ago I might as well just commit them sorry outfits to go on to God and go ahead and keep on preaching to the Sheep I ain't going to spend all my my time counting my ram horn marks dealing with goats when I've got sheep to preach to that's my responsibility so you know what I'm going to study for sheep I'm going to love sheep I'm going to talk sheep talk and one of these days I'm going to go flying away with sheep and a sheep

you're holding anything against I'm telling you we better make things right don't let nothing come between you and God don't let no root of bitterness toward God or toward anybody else grow in your heart but brother Donnie this person hurt me so bad I'll tell you one thing I can never do it yes you can if you'll allow Jesus to help you with it it don't mean that you and that person may be the

Lord help me that I'll not give human love confus or the love of God and think I love him so much I can't tell them the truth that's not the love of God lord Jesus we need you father would you mind just laying your hand maybe over on the shoulder of the person standing by you if you don't feel comfortable by the person standing near you if you want to move out of your seat maybe a brother to a brother instead of a brother to a sister can we just offer a word of prayer think of it friends is there anybody that you wouldn't want to see going the Rapture if there is there something wrong with your heart tonight well I'll tell you one thing if I know so and so was gone I wouldn't even want to go you need to come to this altar you need to ask God to take that out of your heart is there anybody in this building tonight that is sinless is there anybody in this building tonight that is not needed forgiveness and mercy from the love of God who are we to say that God cannot give Mercy to this person that person or another person God forbid that I would be the individual that would try to stand between somebody and mercy somebody and the cross somebody and someone wanting to go to church and I would stand between them and say no you don't deserve mercy God have mercy on us oh Jesus help us help us Lord Lord we're living in a time when our nation has fallen so far Lord that a a man would try Tri to assassinate our former president which is really sad but the sadness don't stop there because we have many so-called Americans talking about how sad they are that the attempted assassination did not go through I've seen one after another after another after another today on YouTube rock stars famous people people saying they wish he would have killed him and I saw pre-tribulation anointing is moving on the people that selectively they don't care if these people are killed or those people are killed and they don't realize it's the pre-tribulation anointing that's moving on them so just because a person would differ with them and their politics it would be okay to kill them Lord It's the tribulation anointing that's already here that it won't be hard for the people to want to chase down the foolish virgin or the 144,000 because they're Jews that anointing is already here Lord as I saw some of those things today I just felt there was such a sad heart thinking that these are Americans the these are people that say they love our nation our country and yet sad because another mortal lived and the bullet grazed his ear and didn't go into his head and kill him I I I wouldn't want that to my worst enemy I don't know of a mortal that I would want such a thing to happen to that's what makes me so happy tonight Lord that no doubt without you and my heart I would feel like a lot of the rest of these leot of sins do murder resides in their soul a lot of these people that have left the message they would be so tickled if I got killed and a car wreck going home tonight they would be so tickled if brother Tim PR died or some other these message preachers would die they would send one another great salutations they would be so happy and they say they're free free from what free from a conscience I'm afraid Lord Jesus help us Lord the Judgment of God is on the earth people can hate and justify their hatred they could rejoice in death and murder Lord God thank you tonight thank you thank you that you have saved us we would be just like that if you didn't live in our hearts thank you tonight Lord Jesus oh Father Purge us oh we believe that we are answering in this last day of that wave sheath spiritually it's already happened the token life is being waved from Nation to Nation to Nation to gather the bride in our soul we passed from Death unto life and we're waiting for our body to catch up with our Revelation father if there's one year tonight without the Holy Ghost may this be the night they get it if there's one that needs to move higher Lord May tonight be the night if there's one that's toying with a besetting sin may they realize Lord the hour is late we must move higher we must be more sincere we must realize we are the last actors on the scene we have the playright in our hands the last scenes of the father's drama are being played out by the Gentile bride before long the last words will be said in the scene the last actors will do their part the curtains will be pulled and the sign will come up the end the door of Mercy will be closed the blood will be lifted off The Mercy Seat Romeo will come and

every life every heart every soul Grant it Lord Jesus Grant it Lord we can know that we have passed from Death un life because we live our lives for others and we would live not for those who just are

breaking of the blood cell break over their soul tonight May their thinking move Beyond just the chemistry of the blood May the Revelation strike their soul may they see the chemistry it was thought to be in the days of Wesley in the earlier days of Pentecost it was thought to be the chemistry of the blood but your Prophet tells us the token in this day is the holy spirit your own personal life

family with people that he works with but he wanted to share it he said with his church family ain't that wonderful that's what we are we're we're not just a church but we're a family let's just agree together now remember our lord Jesus suffered that cat of nine tals on his back so they tie pieces of metal glass and they pick out one of the most browny strong Roman soldiers in the legion and he stands there and whips Jesus and when he does he tears shreds of Flesh from his back back as it goes all the way down his body why for decoration for our brother's healing for yours Lord Jesus we bring our brother before you tonight and we bring our token with our prayers father you see what the doctors have told our brother and yet more him our eyes and things to be done and they're going to try to look and see what they can do and we thank you for everything they can do but we know many times they just have to say we really don't know what to do and the prophet told us we go to a doctor and we do what the doctor tells us he said but sometimes the doctor don't know and when you've been to the doctor and he doesn't give you a good thing then we go to Jesus so Jesus we're coming to you tonight Lord God I believe right now you can be able to remove these things off of each of these vertebrae in his body you are the one who made the vertebrae vertebrae in a human skeleton was designed by you so you are the designer the Creator so you can certainly heal him tonight I stand Here In Your stead to represent you you told me as you told other God call men lay your hands on the sick the
