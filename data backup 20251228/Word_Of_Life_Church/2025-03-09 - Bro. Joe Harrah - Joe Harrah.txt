she's coming but I don't know if she's here yet so y'all might just have to hear me amen I didn't get a response out of that but I don't guess they want to hear me when you you was talking about the world famous I knew who he was talking about and that was the queen that was her the final voice of the final age is that of the wife the bride and so that's what I prefer is to hear her sing other than me so just getting old and worn out I guess and I think about that so many times the prophet he was in his early 50s talking about being old 52 53 being at 54 I feel like he does now so um my I don't forgot see I already forgot what I was going to sing amen if you get tired of this oh well it speaks a very very true reality that this word that we're hearing is not just words that we're hearing it's words that we're hearing in order that we can become that very thing that we're hearing and if you're here today and you think I just can't do this just open yourself up and be like it was with Mary and she said be it unto me and she kept those words she didn't say anything to anybody but there was a life taking place with in her and the evidence brought forth one day it come forth one day and they begin to talk about it yeah they're going to talk about you when the realities of what's in you comes out and is birthed shut up brother Joel she was a virgin bride to be and one night as she lay [Music] quietly the spirit of the Lord overshadowed [Music] her and said that you'll con see a child that sin cannot defile and she said be it unto me according to thy world and she kept these s and Ponder them deep within her heart she believed in God when he said that something new was going to start now if this word could be for in Mary then I believe it can be formed in you and me the same word that came to her cuz we are the Virgin bride today but through the blood of calary and in this time of Darkness we have [Music] come received a Vindicated word that we all have heard and I can see it being formed in you and me [Applause] because we've kept these things and Ponder them deep within our hearts we stayed with this word never once I'm felt desirous to depart I'm talking about within our soul see now if this word could [Music] be Mary then I believe it can be born in you and me because I'll keep these things this precious word and ponder it deep deep within my heart I'll stay with this word never once I'm feel desirous to I Love You Lord depart now if this word could be born and then I believe it can be born in you and me now if this word could be born in name Mary then I believe it can be born in you and [Music] me is she here my wife is she here amen she's here honey is she okay I don't is okay amen all hell the queen see the thing is y'all don't

morning Father Lord I've stared at these notes so they just all run together Lord and then you keep reminding me it's not about what I've wrote down lord but it's it's about what you speak Lord help

for the for the other sick ones for Jude Lord there's so much sickness it going around Lord I pray that you would give healing in our body Lord we thank you for in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles um we'll turn to Book of Job real quick and we read Job 1 start at chap at verse eight then we'll turn to Acts 19 hopefully this should go really quick I should have you out by the buffet at Golden Corral you can get you some of the go the chocolate fountain before they run out at 12:30 so let's read Job 1 and8 and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant servant job that there is none like him in their earth a perfect and an upright man one that fearth God andth evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do job fear God for not hast thou Hast not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath done on every side that thou H has blessed the work of his hands his substance is increased in the land this is Satan testifying what God had done for job but put forth thy hand now and touch all the he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only unto upon him put not uh that forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord Acts 19 we're going to start at verse 13 a very familiar scripture then certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth there were seven sons of ska a Jew chief of the priest which did so when the evil spirit said in said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of that house naked and wounded you could be seated may the Lord add blessings to his word the title I give this this morning thank you might alarm you or baffle you a minute hopefully we can get past that but title I gave you this morning is a proper introduction to Hell job had a proper introduction to Hell these men didn't and I believe every son and daughter of God will have a proper introduction to hell it's it's all about knowing who you are and knowing who you have in you and brother brandom said the God who is rich in Mercy now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world I said I'm not saying these this to mix up Doctrine but but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and this scare that you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are sons of God you were always the sons of God before God Can Make It introduce you to hell you have to know him first and that was the deal with with with job and we'll get into job here a little bit you know there's there these sons of ska they they was trying to cast out a demon in the name of the Lord Jesus and they didn't even know who he was they didn't have the proper introduction to Christ that they should have had you know we you say well we see people that you know there's there's people that we hear that you know some got called some got some sent some just took up their Bibles and went we and you've got people that that are trying to handle this word that never had a proper introduction right to God you have to have a proper introduction to God before you have a proper introduction to hell amen Satan needs to know who you are and and he didn't know these guys you're talking to me about Jesus Christ and you I I don't know who you are I know who he is I spent 40 days with him yeah I spent 40 days in in the wilderness tempting this guy and couldn't do anything and then you're telling me you're casting out in his name I know the power he has and you don't have it if you have it you'll have the fruits oh yeah you know that that's the the thing that you know we we want to do we want to you know we get people that just want to throw all these these quotes in your face they want to battle you with quotes or or debate you with scripture and all that and they don't even know what they're talking about you got people that put put religious posts and and all these things on on their social media all the time and they don't live it it's CU they've never had a proper introduction and and you know I know it sounds strange I don't want to be introduced the devil I do I do I want him to know who I am and it's not me it's not me it it it's when brother Brandon I was listening to my wife was listening this morning to the Deep call the brother brand was talking about the Deep call to the Deep there has to be a deep to respond so it's not you that the devil knows it's not you that's being introduced he's being reintroduced to the god of Heaven every every time this this old man dies we we talk about the old old man ding we kill the old man and we we go down in the water we grave we come up a new man Satan's getting a reintroduction to God when you get filled with the Holy Ghost this is a reintroduction here he is again over here God here's God every every time that Satan pokes his head up he's seeing God in a new person he's seeing a new man everywhere he looks and those times are getting fewer and fewer it's going to be long before the last when the last person is finally introduced to hell we're getting out of here every morning that you get up it's to be a fresh introduction to the devil here I come again I'm here again I'm not going to let you beat me down with with with every everything that hell can offer and that's that's what he tried to do to job you know job's problem there for a little bit we'll get into it here in a little bit more but the deal with job was job didn't fully understand what was happening and sometimes we don't fully understand we don't understand we try to look at through Through The Eyes of Flesh so many times we try to look at what's happening in our life and we don't understand that God is just doing what he did to job have you considered so and so have you considered so and so you know we when we look at it the eyes of the flesh we we have to take in the scripture that the Bible says he's a worthy adversary yeah and he is worthy adversary you and your flesh can do nothing with him right but but whenever you get the Holy Ghost and you let the holy ghost in your life start living through you the scripture that tells us when one day we'll look at him and say is this the guy is this the guy that I was introduced to that that that ws so much havoc in my life caused me so much chaos and and and I thought all my my world had fallen apart and this is what God had introduce me to and I let that little bitty imp take over my life come on right sir a proper introduction helps you to realize who you are in Christ first then you could say bring on Hell Bring It On yeah there shouldn't be a a son and daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost in here today that hell don't know all about you on they they tremble hell trembles when you get up in the morning they have to fight you for another day they have to fight another losing battle with you every day do you realize when when you approach every day filled with the Holy Ghost hell's losing you're scoring more points than hell hell's losing yeah and then we give in to these these little things in our life we give in wow we give into bitterness we give into to gossip we give into not reading our Bible not praying hell starts scoring more points and then that scripture comes back into view he's a worthy adversary I don't ever ever fulfill that scripture in my life he's a worthy adversary because if it's not me fighting the battle right when God introduces you to Satan he's saying Satan look at me look at me not look at so and so here so and so there God said look this is me righten this is me he by Grace brother B say is by his grace he became you that you could become him you know there's absolutely zero anything you have to do in your life to overcome the devil zero nothing it's it's like it's like that you decided that you're your basketball team got into the to the the championship you're in the NC you're in the high school championship and the coach said you're going to sit today we got Michael Jordan today yeah I don't know how it get any better than that we got Michael Jordan today we you go you ain't go hey the game is over they're probably going to [Music] Forfeit That's what Satan feels like doing every morning when you wake up never mind God never mind I I can't fight it today come on that's the way he ought to view every one of our Lives when we get up in the morning Satan I'm here to reintroduce myself to you I'm going to introduce myself to you but before you could even do that right you know brother Brandon we brother brandom always said when this bride recognizes who she is we'll get out of here the reason why we can't in introduce ourselves to to hell every morning we get up or in the middle of the day or at the end of the night is because we forget it doesn't make you any less bride it doesn't make you any less child of God but Humanity kicks in so many times then we forget who we are yes sir we forget what God made us we forget the value that he's placed in our life that's why we don't feel like reintroducing oursel to the devil cuz we don't see no value in oursel we don't see what God sees in US you have so much value that when God had that picture of you in his mind before the foundation of the world that one picture of you held so much value with God he said I'll never rest till that that thought of you becomes a reality to me amen yes that's the value look look look over everything that's happened when God said let there be light it was because he had an urge inside of him to get to you he had something built up inside of you when when that thought of you came to his mind brother Brenham said he's never lost that picture of you you look at yourself you get up in the morning you look at yourself and you begin to think Lord I don't see how you see anything in me come on come on I don't see I don't see how I can go and and face the day face the devil will face hell for with everything that's in my life I don't I don't see it's it's because you don't understand who you are yet you you don't know who you are yet and and God when God had that vision of you when he had that picture of you God said I'll die to get it I'll die to get it and I've said it here before we read the scripture and the Bible says no greater love has any man that that would lay down his life for his brother we've seen that over the years many you know the the those that went and served and and went over and died so you could have freedom in this country we we've heard of guys stepping and people stepping in front of bullets for other people and you know how what kind of love is that that's you you can't surpass that but man cannot understand the love that God had for you tell me one father in here that would kill your only son any child of yours for somebody else one father I wouldn't there's there's nobody in here would say I would I would take the life of my child so you could be free we wouldn't do that that that doesn't live inside of man to do that and God went God's love went so far above man's love and that's the value he puts in you this is you know we we look at job you know why we always said why did job you know job didn't understand what God was doing job had no idea why you know I've I've sacrificed everything that's that's what we look at so much in our life we think why is God putting this on me I've been living right I've been reading my Bible been praying I've been paying my tithes I've been giving offerings I'm supporting the the ministry I pray for my Pastor I pray for the sick why is God doing this to me why why is he doing this to my life why do I have cancer why is my my children falling [Music] away why is my husband backslid why is my wife backslid God why are you doing this to me I'm trying to live right that's the attitude that job took towards God I don't understand yeah and the prophet went on to say the go job be to accuse God wrongly yeah we've all done it yes we have we've all done it job is is is is sitting there he the grass dies the spring it comes back yeah we we we look the flowers die in the spring they come back and the the leaves of the trees fall off in the spring they come come back that's why I really believe God gave brother lenel that inspiration with that song there'll be another spring because job didn't have that Revelation brother lenel job didn't have it because job said when I die I can't come back I can't come back but he didn't realize he had an introduction coming God wasn't trying joob God wasn't trying to see what job would do God had already told Satan there's none like him there's none like him if your kid was Michael Jordan would you show him to everybody wow if your kid was Tom Brady would you show him to everybody that's all God was doing right that's all God was doing this is my trophy this is the greatest thing I have Satan let me introduce you to it let me show you what I got so when you're going through your battles your struggles with your besetting sins things in your life and you Lord I fought this thing for years lord I can't get over it I I can't get over this come on and there's times in your life that we we we look at the things in our life and you're there's no way you'd want to fight a b you think oh I'm so spiritually weak right now there's no way I could fight a battle if God gave it to me and yet you get one anyway it's because you don't see in yourself what God sees that's right you don't see in yourself you don't see the value you have in yourself that God sees the future home I've jumped around I apologize this was happened this morning so brother brandham said if you are the bride the bride is part of the husband the only place you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband you are you can't recognize being bride you have to recognize your position it's like a wife when a man and woman they they come up here and they get married and they they do their V and they walk out he takes on her name or she Tak sorry hope I ain't happening oh my nowadays you never know you never know but she takes on his name right and they turn around and they are introduced this is a new introduction for her right they are introduced as Mrs so and so with his last name with his first name and this is in introduction so when everybody sees her now from now on she sees him they see her they see him they're one they are one and and sometimes when they're newly mared sometimes she might forget she feels out of check or writes a letter writes a signature she might write her old name she might do things that she did before she got married and as far as the way she does things the food she likes maybe with the food he likes and it's so many different things she has a readjusting to do in her life but they have been introduced she has been introduced with his name right yeah now she is a reflection of his testimony yeah am are you given the proper testimony of your husband come on now on now come on now you've done being introduced as Miss Jesus Christ this has been a a new introduction for you for many of you some of you have had this introduction 40 years ago are you still doing things you've done with your maiden name come on or do you continuously remember this introduction good when you were introduced this Miss Jesus Christ that introduction should all never leave your heart because you are a reflection on him remember that when you put your little post up on social media on on straightening people out on this and straightening people out on that quotes that you put up and you you people read those quotes and you're like there ain't no way that person put that up there yeah come on preach make sure your life matches what you're quoting make sure your life matches the scriptures that you're putting on Facebook knowing God and God knowing you is wonderful but it's got to be a revelation understanding what you have in you when you've been introduced with his name in thy house brother brandom said well you talk about Jupiter and Mars and these stars that you see now well my think about 100 light travels about 186,000 mies per second and0 M 20 million years by one second 186,000 and break it down to 120 million years then what do you got that's smile said makes you us just feel like see he said now then beyond that there's just as many Moons and stars that's the power the power that it took for God to create that lives in you that same power do we realize it do we understand our human Minds can't really comprehend that CU we know we're not going to go out and speak these things and create create galaxies and create universes and we're going to go step out in onto one of these planets and go create on we want to sometimes this world gets so bad you Lord break that law apart please let me create one little planet for my for no more oh good because you live in a world we live in a world that's just so toxic but you know God chose you right chose you to be in this part of this world at this time that's right it doesn't matter how toxic it gets how bad the politics gets how bad the inflation prices and all that gets God chose you this in leosa from the foundation of the world he knew you would be here he knew you could overcome in this time and that's the value that he placed in you because it's not you anyway that is one of the things we forget more than anything it's not us anyway you know when when I was when I was back back here while ago brother Mike walls come back there and I was like I don't what I don't know how this is gonna turn out and he said well it ain't you anyway it ain't you anyway and I needed that I needed that because I was told at 9:00 this morning so it's not me it's it's not me you you can look all you want and and I you know I never mind I'm going to skip that but I didn't I didn't ask for this I I didn't ask for a calling in my life I told Brother Terry Horn one time I said brother Terry if God if God was to come come to me and say Joe my son that was your last sermon you don't have to preach anymore I would be the happiest man on the face of the Earth happy brother Terry brother Terry said Joe brother Joe that would just be too easy it'd be too easy there's no battles in that brother Jackie there's no battles in that we don't choose pick and choose what God wants us to do that's true back to job and brother brandham said then Jesus came and called there was a man one time named job one of the oldest prophets in the bible he was a great man he loved the Lord he done all he knowed to do and Satan desired to sift him he said to God one day God said to him rather where where Where Have You Been Satan you know the thing that really astounds me about that is God was was wanting Satan to come to him to give job to him where you been I got something for you job didn't come to God I mean Satan didn't come to God and said hey you've got to give me job wow think about that God said hey where you been I've been waiting on you I've been waiting on you I've got somebody that's you know you know what what Satan said I've seen your trophy Cas you got a lock on it you've got a lock on it you've got a big wall built a brick wall built around him because he's your favorite I haven't even thought about taking him you see that's when God allows Satan in your life the most when you think that you're just up here walking on cloud n you're reading every morning reading your Bible you're listening to tapes every day hey the devil does too he comes to church more than any of us he's faithful every service he comes Sunday morning Wednesday if he ain't here on Sunday morning he goes over to Hickory on Sunday night he's everywhere he's faithful he comes to the youth services he comes to the question and answers he'll even show up your breakfast es right every Gathering you have if there are Sons and Daughters gathered there he will be there guess what Satan will be at the Fall Festival this year everywhere everywhere why you are what he wants you are what he wants he wants God's prized possession and that is you amen when you got filled with the Holy Ghost God made a proper introduction you think you know I was reading this this morning you know Adam didn't have the proper introduction that job had no wow and God allowed it because if if if Adam had the proper introduction and how we've been hearing on on Wednesday nights if if how it was supposed to come forth by Spoken Word we' have never been reading about job right we would have never read about job and we would have never read about all these attributes God allowed Adam to to not have the proper introduction with Satan but he was in God's image Adam was in God's image right yeah but God let him make his own choice because God knew I've got other attributes that I want to put in people in 2025 I have attributes in me that if Adam don't fall if Adam doesn't fall I've got attributes that no one will ever know about yeah no one will ever know these attributes that I have Adam wasn't deceived but we he chose he chose to go with his wife his wife was deceived she never had a proper introduction she met Satan not on the grounds that God allowed God God allowed it to happen but that wasn't the way God had purposed everything to be spoken word spoken word spoken word spoken word but God said I've got so much in me that I want to give in you that God's got attributes that he put in you that he didn't put in the early church because you're fighting new battles you're fighting things that they they didn't have you know they they had to meet Satan on the grounds that God gave them the next Church age they had to meet Satan on the grounds that God gave him there and every age has to meet Satan on the grounds that God gives him and God gives every age a proper introduction to hell he says have you considered my servant job there was none like him in the earth he is a perfect man says sure you give him everything do everything for him certainly he's a great man but let me have him one time I'll change the tune I'll make him curse you to your face you can't do it that's his confidence in a Believer he has that much confidence in you it doesn't matter and God knows that if you've got the Holy Ghost his life in you right Jesus told him said I'll never leave you comfortless I go away but I'll come back and I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world was that to everybody was that was that was like we said last time you know God God's last move wasn't the CR cross it was for for many it was for Millions the cross many stopped at the cross some of them will never have the proper introduction to hell that you got cuz God said I got so much to show you past the cross I've got so much on the other side of the cross for this bride I'm going to move rather quickly here so you know that God never God never asked job job listen Satan's going to be up here in a little bit and um I need y'all to meet I need but don't worry I've got faith in you I've equipped you for everything that you need you know I'm going to let him do some stuff you know brother Steve Nome didn't God didn't say brother Steve I'm going to give you cancer but don't worry he already knew what was in inside brother Steve yeah amen God don't have to warn you that that you're going to get tested tomorrow he don't have to warn you that you're going to get cancer next week come on he don't have to warn you that because he already knows what's in you am he introductions have already been made you you've already met hell you and you've you've seen the how you've overcome you've seen your brothers and sisters overcome hell day after day day after day you know there's no big battles and small small battles when it comes to God there's there's a headache here and the God has to struggle a little bit over here if somebody's got leprosy God doesn't look at it that way God God looks at it and says healing is the children's bread Take and Eat I've given to you for that it it it's there's no big things and little things in God's eyes cuz God can do everything God can do anything and and sometimes we categorize the problems in our life by their severity right that's human nature run to the doctor you should brother benam said God uses doctors yes to use that that think that he don't I've got a quote for you brother brandom said to pray for your nurses and doctors because if you don't one day God's going to ask you why you didn't wow so this is just things that God's put in our life to when you get that proper introduction you don't have to be scared you don't have to worry God will never put anything in your life that he won't equip you with faith first that's true God will equip you with faith before you go through anything because God will not send you into a battle defenseless it's not your battle anyway right right you I preached that some years ago the battle is not yours you know in in when the prophet came to to Jehoshaphat say you stand right here you stay right here everything you see before you be gone tomorrow you've already met the enemy before you've already had proper introductions you know what they're capable of Yeah by faith you stand here and you let God take care of it yes so God didn't allow job to be part of that conversation but job had value you have value I have value everybody has value in God's eyes and and sometimes that is diminished by our problem the value we have in our life when we look at our life is diminished by our circumstances it's diminished by our symptoms in our life yeah we don't understand our un when we don't understand something it clouds Faith many times it clouds faith and and all we could see circumstances and symptoms pain suffering grief it blurs Faith so many times but look at the value you have this is why God wants to introduce you to hell so why would he introduce you to the devil in Matthew 10:27 says what I tell you in darkness speak you in light what you hear in the ear that preach upon the housetops fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul for fear him which is able to destroy both soul and the body in hell yeah if you haven't had the proper introduction you f feel that scripture right are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear you not therefore you are of more value than many SP and Luke Luke brings it back up and Luke says are not five sparrows sold for two farlings and not one of them is forgotten before God but even the very hairs of your head are numbered fear not therefore you are more value than many sparrows you have value with God yes from the very beginning Adam had value God has placed value on everything he has made the Bible tells us when he said let there be light God said it was good everything he made it was good but when he came to man he made man he said he's very good it's very good God placed value in everything that he made but the highest value he placed is when he created you everything I made was good but this is very good why because he knew I've got to live in that yeah I'm going to move in there I'm going to take over this creation that I see that's very good God like we've been here in the the in the Garden of Eden God could have said you know what this Garden that I've made I could just live here this is great this is good this is this is good but then when he created man that's where he wanted to live that's where he placed value you know sometimes I wonder if we we understand if God would allow us one time to see the value that he has in us you know I studying this I thought of Queen Esther you know when Queen Esther you look at her people her people were were the Jews and they were the most hated in the land and somehow she ended up in the king's court King uh hazus was going to to pick a wife and it just so happened she was the chosen one she never really realized when she had to come before the king for a petition she hadn't had full introductions with him yet and she would she had a need in her life and and as as I as I tell this I want to understand sometimes we find ourselves here she had a need in her life and she had not had the the proper instructions with introduction with the king and the people around her was telling us you better be careful when you go in there you be careful you have to come down with bowed before him you have to gravel up to him and if he doesn't reach his scepter out to you he could kill you if you come before him she didn't she was already pronounced the queen she still didn't have full understanding of who she was so Queen Esther goes and she wants an audience with the King and when she's the door is open she gets on her hands and knees and she she gravels up to the king keeps her head down does not look at him and I thought you know if if Ester had really understood how much this King felt about her yeah she would have done exactly what the scripture tells us to do right to come boldly Before the Throne come on let your petition be known yes so when Esther goes up there and she's gring you know this is not a proper introduction between you and God come on now this is not way God expects you to come before him you have a petition anything you have need of what did a hasus tell her anything you need of I'll give you half the kingdom he didn't expect her to gravel we we sometimes we feel we say I feel Unworthy of asking God for this Unworthy of asking God for that God wants to give it to you more than what you want it that's his desire for you God God desires to give but we feel like so many times that you know God's a foreign person to us sometimes God God's on another level he's on a big cloud up here and you know I can't reach that high I'm just a little nobody yeah if if you got that mindset you need to go back to all them affirmations that brother Donnie did at the old church and understand who you really are on you have to understand that when when you come before God God God wants to give it to you more than you want it we don't we don't gravel we don't fall apart you come before God boldly father I need this how many here would go up to your dad and say Dad I need 20 bucks my dad still thinks I owe him a bunch cuz I did that a lot lot Dad I need 20 bucks Dad I need gas in my car Dad I need this Dad I need I need a new pair of shoes God expects you to come to him with the same concept God I need this yeah I'm in this spot right here I don't know any way out of it but I need this amen why you have had proper intructions with God yes I didn't call my dad um Mr Hera all my life I didn't call my mom Mrs Hera we've had for introductions right that's good he's your father wow that's our problem we go through life not knowing who our father is not knowing who your father and Satan comes against you you can't Point him to your father cuz you don't know who he is come on good preaching good go ahead the problem that you got if you're a son and daughter of God and I've said it here a 100 times if there's you have you you're going through a trial you're going through a test God has allowed it right if you have the Holy Ghost God has allowed it and most of the time it's because he's trying to show Satan how perfect you are oh yeah I hope they don't stumble you any it's getting the new birth yeah like I said when I was born you know after a while I understand who my dad was I understood who my mother was you'll never be able to face Satan without a new birth that's right right you can't we're going back to the scripture he's a worthy adversary without a new ver without a new birth you're stuck on he's a worthy adversary when you get the new birth what does he say anything anything you ask anything you have need of you have the power in you that the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against amen amen know as I was studying this I looked at the woman at the well this is I'm going to take a tangent I always do that and we'll get back to it but the woman at the well you know there's a lot of people that can probably put their life right there with the woman at the well but brandom said now what did this putting the old scripture with the experience Jesus was given to her talking about the woman to well what did it do it made the Messiah quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning and it redeemed her brought her back when she seen the expressed scripture manifest of Jehovah what he was is what he is she understood she got a proper introduction but the way this this happened Jesus was already there waiting on her you'll never be introduced to God by going out searching for him it's not you searching we've been told over and over God searched for you and God found you and and that was Jesus was waiting on her to come and he gave her a proper introduction she said I he tells her I've got water I've got water that you if you drink it you'll never thirst again he was talking about himself this is how he introduced himself to her I have water that you'll never if you drink you'll never thirst again where is this water I want some of that where is this water she thought he there was a whale somewhere there was he was the whale yeah she came from a a country that believed in signs and wonders she never asked him for one right yes she never asked him for proof she never said show me this and I'll believe you she took what she heard and introduced it to the city oh yeah and the city was saved you know so many times we want to we want to see we want proof we do we're like Gideon you know the deal with Gideon Gideon was like you know an angel came to him you got an angel standing there telling you oh get in you body man of Valor God wants you to do this this and this he wasn't a in in in Man's eyes he wasn't he was a wheat farmer right and he understood that he be to look at what he really was in in and through human eyes Gideon be to look at this is what I really am and and he be to look at that and he said I don't I don't see this then I'm going to put a fleece before the Lord if an angel come and told me something God said I think I believe him yeah but he says I'm going to put a fleece before the Lord and if the if if the Dew is on the fleece and the ground is dry then I know it was God next morning it happens and Gideon said that's final right no I need another sign if tomorrow if the fleece is dry and the ground is wet then I'll believe it we do that so many times oh yeah human nature we begin to look at ourselves what what would God see this God's want me to go do this wanting to do that sometimes God will put put it on your heart to go talk to a brother or sister and you think I don't understand that I I don't understand why God would want me to do that I I can't do that and and sometimes we hold back yes doing things that God is is pushing us to do allowing us to do and we we look at ourselves we look at our own abilities yeah and God said that ain't what I want you to look at right I want you to go introduce me to them introduce them to me because without that first they're getting ready to be introduced to hell and they'll they'll not know how to fight it it all come down to predestination if you're predestinated predestin you know a lot of people stumble over predes destination if you're predestinated and it does it doesn't matter what what you go through you're going to come out of it predestination will pull you out of it you might have to go through it several times you might have to to to fight that same battle for years I I've known people that have come to me and said pray for me over this I'm you know I'm struggling with this struggling with that you know two three years later they still they come I'm I'm struggling with you know if you're child son and daughter of God you're going to come through it yeah that's right you know I I don't understand why you know there's a lot of things that happen in our lives we don't understand I don't understand why some people battle some of the same things for for 20 years I don't understand it God does God understands I'm not judging on that right because all our battles are different right and God has a set point in time yes that when you come through that battle he's going to finally show you off when you've come conquered that that's what job did job had conquered it then he said look here's Satan he's perfect you know what I I like the most about job about the whole story of job and I don't mean sound like a broken record but he he's my favorite character in The Bible the thing that I love the most about job is when job started thinking God when job started saying I know my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms devour this flesh I know I'll still see him right and then job said I know that the last chapter job says I know that he is God and he can do all things yet at this moment job is still in the middle of his trial job is still covered in boils job is still lost everything job is still sitting on his Ash Heap and he's given God glory amen he finally understood God's in uction he finally understood what God was W to do it ain't about me it's job understood it ain't about me it's about God that's what you got to understand in your life when you're going through something in your life this is about God Amen God said I the footsteps of a righteous man are order of the Lord everything you go through will give him glory it's not about you struggling from day to day and I know that's tough I know that's hard it's not about the struggles you go through it's about God getting Glory through your strugg it's about it's about when you get to the point when you don't know where else to go The Darkest Hour the doctor's report is his worst it's ever been the cancer spread here it's done this you you've got heart failure the doctors sent you home don't know what this to do that's when God gets Glory [Applause] am it ain't so much about you going to the doctor and well you know what it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller that's God too it's all God Amen it's all God but God says when it gets the darkest when it gets the worst in your life I might hey satan where you been I got somebody I want to introduce you to I got somebody you're introduce you to and Devil's going to look at them and say they're so low they're so low they can't even hardly pray anymore God says that's right where I want them that's right this this is the perfect time for you to meet them because I know what they're made of I know the value in them amen we we we we spend so much energy so much time focusing on our problems we so much energy focusing on our circumstances our symptoms in our life focusing on we see Satan pulling our kids out in the world we focus on that instead of focusing God saying I'm working on a testimony for that young man am I'm working on a testimony for that young girl GL why because they have an introduction you might look at them and say they've already been introduced to hell not properly about not properly not the way God wants him to cuz when God gives them a new birth yes Satan's not going to recognize them amen Satan's not going to recognize him when your son and your daughter your husband and your wife get filled with the Holy Ghost Satan will look at them like he's never seen them the truth this is a new battle amen this this is something that they got to go through you know they're going to have to get to the point it's it's between them and God you know I told a church in in Virginia here a few weeks ago you know we we got so many times we got parents fighting their kids battles right your kids go through something parents are all over it hands all over it and God might allow that yeah God might allow that battle for them and you're messing it up they need Bolding as much as you do they need shaping as much as you do and you you try to fix it why it's human nature it's human nature moms and dads they want to do that but there has to be a proper introduction for them as Dell it's an individual walk it's a body move and if they're part of the body they'll come [Music] in but you can't put them in you can't you can't put them in and tell them listen this is what you need to do and you got to H hover over them make sure they're reading the Bible make sure that it don't work that way that's between them and God a lot of the times you'll drive your kids further away cuz you're trying to fight the battle that God gave them right I hope that's that that you understand that I don't mean to step on parents toes but so while I'm here let's stand together while I'm here I want all hell to know who I am I want hell to know who I am don't don't don't try to ride run and hide from hell don't try to run and hide from Satan cuz you're not showing him yourself right that's right you're not showing him who you are when you got the new birth you want to see him that new life you want to show Satan who that new life is inside you just like God wants to show you off you ought to want to show God off God's desire for you is that you see yourself as he sees you with all the things we got going in our lives it's it's hard to do that it's it's hard for us to see oursel like God sees us yeah that that's human nature but if you could see yourself in the in the world and you say God it's not me it's you use me how you want to use me do with me whatever you have whatever you want to do with me God use me but don't let it be me let's bow our heads I know this has been short and chopped up and I apologize for that but I pray that if something was said to somebody that would touch someone this morning amen God's faithful yes he is as our sister was singing his faithfulness is great amen it's never lacking you have a need in your heart you have a need in your life you not taking away you have in the Holy Ghost but you might you might say Joe I I want I want Satan to know who I am don't look at it at it through the Through The Eyes Of Man to say you know hey I want me in Satan to know each other it ain't that you want Satan to know the god that's in you that's right so you if you anybody in here would got that on their heart say make that a revelation to me make that a revelation that I want hell to understand I'm a son and daughter of God and no matter you want want to get to the point where you you finally understand like job did God is showing you off because he's so proud of you that ought to be every one of our desires is God is my life to the point where you can show me off is is my my life to the point that makes you proud you know sometimes within an hour that we wake up in the morning we some many times we feel like we've already done something wrong we we we think there's no way God's proud of me because because this that's the age we live in and God said quit looking at that look at my life and you there's a deep calling to the deep and if you have a desire for god brother brandom said there has to be something inside of you to respond to that let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful for you this morning amen Lord you as brother Jimmy bab told me one time when I told him I chop these sermons up he said brother the Joe we can't eat them until they're chopped up anyway so Lord I pray that if there's some pieces in there that would help somebody Lord that somebody would be able to pull theirself up a little higher Lord our desire this tonight not only to that you know who we are we want hell to know who we are in you touch each knee touch each heart you see every desire here Lord this morning I pray father that you would meet every need heal every sick Lord and when we're going through trials we're going through tests Lord I I pray that you give us understanding father that it's you showing us off properly Lord and not to focus on so much the circumstances the the things that that happen Lord but help us look to you that was in your word you said Look To Me Lord help us to do that meet every need here father we we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen can we sing He Knows My Name whichever one y'all want
