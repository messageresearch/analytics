========================================

a couple of scriptures here um Isaiah chapter 59 we want to read from the 19th to the 21st verse very familiar to you I'm sure Isaiah 59 verse 19- 21 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun for when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from the transgressions and Jacob sath the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth noow the mouth of thy seed noow the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from henceforth and forever more I also want to read Revelations the 12th chapter and the 11th verse I believe it is now of course if you're um reading here uh in the Revelation 12th chapter you're reading about a great battle going on in heaven between angels and then all of a sudden an Angelic battle becomes a human battle in the 11th verse it said and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death we ask the Lord to bless his words you may be seated this morning I want to just take a few minutes today and speak to you on this when the enemy uh comes like a flood when the enemy comes in like a flood I um I think of the I think of the the promise of scripture I'm I'm always when I read the Bible I read the Bible with promise I I I'm I'm one that believes that if there is something in scripture and God makes a promise about something I want to know what the promises are uh that's where we gain our strength in our life is in the promises of the word of God and and there's actually two things happening here in Isaiah 59 he actually says that when the enemy comes in like a flood then he says the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against us so there's two things he's talking about he's talking about how the enemy is coming and then what the Lord's going to do right uh if we're not careful many times we get stuck on the enemy coming and we look at that a great deal but we never want to forget that the enemy coming is only a proof that God is doing something in that time if you can if you can see the enemy's doing something then God is doing something in that moment of time it's just trying to identify what he is doing at that time uh when the enemy comes like a flood the prophet of God in the second Miracle will say this he said I'll raise a standard up against it and I believe the enemy is Dashing and God's here to raise up the standard now if we read this scripture in Isaiah 59 and we think about it as something in the days of Isaiah that's one thing but we know that Isaiah was writing about uh the day that we're actually living in and I think it's amazing when you start identifying that some of these scriptures are specific for the time that you're living in and Isaiah 59 is specifically speaking about your day it's it's it was written for this day when the spirit comes like a flood that God would then raise up a standard against him now uh when you when you when you think about this it's actually things that Isaiah wrote but also Paul wrote about them as well for when the enemy shall come in like a flood now we think about it when the enemy if you notice that it doesn't say if the enemy comes like a flood it says when the enemy comes like a flood so it's not so much of a suggestion that that that if this would happen that God's going to do something but rather he's telling you directly that the enemy is coming like a flood so there's an actual direct scripture that is telling you about the coming of the enemy now the prophet of God is going to identify that the believe the enemy is Dashing now now if you go back in the book of Thessalonians and read 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and you can read Apostle Paul would also be talking about this same period of time some of the things that Paul is speaking about about the Antichrist coming about the enemy approaching he's actually identifies it specifically Thessalonians 2 and veres 1-2 you can read the entire thing but notice what he'll say we beseech you Brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering unto him now we're not going to preach a sermon on that but you that study the message of the hour you understand that's the message of the hour the shout is the Gathering unto Christ and and Paul is predicting the same writer of first Thessalonians 4 is also the same writer of 2 Thessalonians 2 and instead of saying the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout he's saying you'll be gathered unto the Lord Jesus and that you shouldn't be shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as the the day of Christ is at hand he said let no man deceive you by any means for the day shall not come except there cometh Falling Away first and the man of sin shall be revealed the son of predition who exalteth himself above all that is called God now just just want to just want to make a mention here how many knows what the prophet said about that that shall exalt himself above all that is called the word of God brother Ram said the word of God all that is called the all that is called God is 1 John chapter 1 for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so brother Ram says what is happening is is in the end time that that Satan will exalt himself above the Vindicated word of the age amen above all that is called God and he'll sit there and show that himself he is God and remember not when I was yet with you I told you these things and now what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time the Antichrist now shall be revealed in his time how many knows when that was brother BR said when the first seal opened is when the Paul is talking about when the first seal opened now the mystery of iniquity doeth already work and who now will lth will let until he be taken out of the way that the wicked shall be revealed the seventh verse for the mystery of iniquity doeth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way now that sounds like a a rhyme or a parable but it's not only he will let until he be taken out of the way there's actually two he's there right he will let until he be taken out of the way now the prophet teaches us that the tribulation period cannot come up on the earth as long as the bride is on the Earth because God will not let the tribulation strike his bride you know the bride of Christ will never go through the tribulation right amen so she she so it can't strike it so God is the one that lets until he be taken out of the way now it's amazing because the church is a feminis and designation right but in the scripture it's now calling you a he instead of a she because there's a marriage of the Lamb that is taking place in the bride and Paul himself is saying at the time of the revealing of the the man of sin the church will be identified as a he and listen to this when the when the devil is coming like a flood am me you already been married to the one that'll take you off of the earth before the enemy can attack listen friend the devil ain't sneaking up on God Amen Paul was telling you all the way back there that there's a day coming amen there's a there's a sin coming there's a there's a flood coming but don't worry the one that can raise you up amen has already been marri to the one and he won't allow it to happen until until she be taken out of the way until he be taken out of the way in second Timothy chapter 3 now that goes real deep amen I don't have time but it goes real deep when when he looks at you he's not looking at you then is he he's looking at he's looking at your representation your repres presentation is not you it's Christ who's in heaven amen and watch this this doesn't happen in just any day but he's talking about the end time and second second Timothy chapter 3 Paul again writing to Timothy this I know this also that in the last days perilous time shall come amen when the enemy shall come like a flood when's that latter days in the latter days perilous times shall come amen was Paul writing about his day he said he wasn't he said in the latter days in the last days that perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of of of their own selves now I want you to watch I want you to watch the scripture be the lovers of their own selves have you ever seen a day like it today lovers of their own self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those are good traitors heady highminded lovers the pleasures more than the lovers of God having a form of godliness but deny the power thereof this is the sort that led uh that led captivity silly women made L now we counted what about 25 things there Paul is just naming one after the other what what I'm not just trying to read you something I'm trying to show you there's a flood amen one or two of these things would have existed in other ages he's telling you there's a flood of unbelief in the last days and all these things are coming at the same time and you think now when you're looking at this in you could begin to kind of get a little bit concerned but notice what he says ever learning these will be ever learning but they'll never come to the knowledge of the truth and as Janice and jambers withstood Moses so do these resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but watch the scripture but they shall not proceed no further Hallelujah for their Folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs was also now look Janice members was was made manifest their Folly was made manifest and Israel didn't follow them so they did impersonate they'd come as far as they could come but they couldn't go no further do you see that there is a limit to how far the devil can go there's a limit to how much he can do with the church amen listen amen when when the devil went to job uh to God about job what did he do he asked him amen and God said you can touch him but don't touch his flesh and then he come back and said you can touch his flesh just don't take his life what was it it was showing amen that there's a limit on the devil of what he can do to the Church of the Living God God limits the devil the devil tell you he do anything he wants well you know he can't do anything he wants we have a Heavenly Father amen who is The Shepherd of the sheep F amen and if there's anything come your way God has already made a provision for you to overcome whatever the devil can throw at you amen I'm talking about a God that said when the enemy comes like a flood just don't fear little bride the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against that devil amen 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 8 Peter talks about it be sober be dilligent your adversary the devil as a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devire now whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished among your brother that are in the world Amen now look's what he says amen your adversary the devil as a roaring line now if it was just your adversary that's one thing amen but you know that the Old Testament promised that if you obey the voice of the Angel he said your adversary will be my adversary now I I tell you that's a powerful thing when you when you look at if it's just you fighting the devil well that's one thing amen but but he said your adversary is his adversary now this contest is not between you and the devil this contest is between God and the devil it's up to you to be on which side of contest you're on amen amen I thank God today I'm on The Winning Side it ain't what I can do it's what God is done and the contest has already been won that day at Calvary he said it's finished then can I say this morning that the seven seal finishes it the devil is finished when the enemy comes like a flood now I'll tell you if any man here I don't know when he's coming when the enemy becomes like a flood I I think we can say it's right now don't you now and you got to be real careful cuz I'm fixing to pull you into something here amen and I'm not I'm not trying to trick you but I want you to see something cuz I got a lot of people saying to me brother Wayne when that short work comes brother Wayne when the Thunders are released when the Seven Seals when when the bride goes into her Ministry when this great climax comes when this great Rapture when this great Revelation when this great Revival comes do you see the mentality is saying amen that's what God's going to do but they're putting it off in the future somewhere amen but if we could only stop and see that the enemy is already here amen and when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of the Lord is already on the scene raising a standard up against him amen when the enemy comes like a flood amen the prophet of God said I'll raise a standard and I believe the enemies a dashing yeah amen that's 1951 1962 brother Bram said the greatest battle ever fought when the enemy comes like a flood as he's coming today yeah so he puts the scripture of Isaiah 59 as a current scripture as he's coming today so that are in prison now 1963 brother man said it's a midnight hour it's a midnight hour right Matthew 25 what's it say midnight at midnight A Cry came now notice brother Ram reflects this to an American history lesson about minute man who were in the days of the Revolutionary War when Paul Riv remember he's a minute man he was ready and he jumped on his horse and he went riding through the streets and we all remember what he said the enemy is coming the British is coming the British is coming but brother randam and souls in prison said I am a Paul rever to you in the Midnight Hour I bet he was riding a white horse what you been he was riding a horse amen and he said this he said I'm not telling you he's coming I'm telling you he's here amen I'm not here today telling you the enemy's coming church I'm saying the enemy is here the enemy is here amen the enemy is all over he's everywhere but if that be true about the devil amen then I can tell you that God is here and his angels are here and the Revival of God is here when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall raise a standard Hallelujah I tell you evil Spirits are working in people everywhere you can look around you don't have to be a a good reader just sit down at Walmart sometime neology pouring itself out amen evil spirits that's true working in the people listen hell has been turned loose brother Brom a a prophet of the age announced all hell turns loose in Junction of time he said when all hell turns loose yeah then all Heaven turns loose also and he ties that together when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of God will raise a standard and these two forces has always showed up at the junction we're at the junction of time and Satan has come with all of his angels and the devil is attack him with all of his angels but at the same time according to Daniel 12 that Michael would stand up for the people of God them that were found written in the book amen listen I know you think there's a battle going on Amen but I want you to know that the great one has stood up and he's toen your side in this battle when the enemy comes now now you you know the thing about it is we can start putting a number on this because in Revelations the 9th chapter the scripture actually numbers your enemy right I know you can say it's a great multitude but Revelations the 9th chapter said there was 200,000,000 demons in Revelation 9 said there was an angel fell from heaven who had the key the bottomless pit how many knows who that was it was the devil it's Lucifer right and he released hell from beneath and it filled the Earth as a smoke amen everything has been affected by it Revelations the n9th chapter and it's 200,000,000 Chargers and brother said not 200,000,000 Horsemen they're not all the world he said there 200,000 demons there spirits and the spirits of persecution now we saw them attack the Jews didn't we we saw them shoot them with bullets we saw them burn them with with gas we saw gas Chambers we saw Mass graes we saw persecution like nothing before now why did they persecute them because they were Jews they might have been the best character the greatest people but something inside the German something inside the Italian wanted to destroy that Jewish seed right where did that come from well you can read in the Bible in Genesis the 3rd Chapter and God said there shall be enity between the woman seed and the serpent seed it'll always be there and youve seen it when Abel was killed and you've seen it when Joseph was attacked brother B said why did Joseph's Brethren jump on him in the field he said it was the devil trying to get it that Covenant he was trying to get it that seed that's why that Judas killed Jesus it was the same thing they're trying to kill that word but brother you'll never kill that word you'll never you'll never overcome the word because the word has the power of Resurrection it'll raise itself up from the [Applause] dead ah think about it turn loose on those Jews 200,000 demons go to the Feast of trumpets and you'll find out brother Mar says it's there now now many people and and I don't want to get deep in doctor you got a pastor but I do want to say this many people actually get into the ideas now that those 200,000 demons that will cause tribulation in America they'll cause tribulation it's coming to the foolish virgin amen and they try to start applying that to the bride of Christ amen and and I understand that there is spiritual persecution going on right now I get that I get we're persecuted but not forsaken right amen the persecution of that is there amen but the persecution that you have is only the molding of your character it has nothing to do with the purging of your soul because a man that's born again his soul has been purged in the blood of the Lamb of almighty God and there is now no more sin in that man yes sir listen the church is not going to go through that persecution the blood of Jesus perfects the bride that's a quote the blood now now if you're if you're a student of the message and you have people read you and they say well what about these quotes and this but but in the Feast of trumpets 1964 brother bam turns a corner yeah in his teaching concerning what the church will go through and he changes it after that Feast of the trumpet sermon and said the trumpets are to the Jews but the spiritual revelation of the seals were coming for the bride amen is that right so what puts you in the Rapture is the force of God it's not the force of nature persecution now brother Bram says see of course after the seals are open brother bram's going to turn around in the second seal and he's going to tell you very clearly here's my Revelation go in the second seal here's my Revelation he sees it change from White Horse to Red Horse and he says it's Satan again he says it's the devil again in another form so watch The Devil again in just another form so when Satan comes in like a flood it's not it's not that he's a different devil right he's just taking different forms amen now y'all y'all y'all are students enough to know that there's three three connections that he's going to make political power demonic power and religious power that's what he's after all three of those conquering to conquer and he's going to he's going to hit them three phases right there and he's going to lead the whole world into an Armageddon through those three religious demonic amen and political that's where it's going we're going to see it happen and they're going to they're going to lead it but before that can happen the Bible said that he would come as a thief in the night and there would be a Rapture of a bride Hallelujah and she wouldn't be she wouldn't be going there now now if you think about this tonight then or this morning 200,000 demons is against the bride of Christ there spiritual attack it's a persecution and I just have to be very clear here sometimes people will say well I'd go down that church except for Samuel or I'd go down that church except for uh for the song leader I don't like the Deacon or something you know many times that's only a spirit that's against the spiritual genan seeds of Christ sometimes you're looking for a reason and really there is not really maybe a reason but there's a spirit on the person that's right is what the main thing is that's what's happening is it's a spirit now I don't I I I don't have time to get there so you forgive me for not having time to dig into that but I will say this to you sometimes you look for a reason why there's a contention and the only reason is is that there's a spiritual blessing on the individual uh I I've I've had to learn that hard through life and I don't mean that I just mean sometimes I've spent years trying to maybe make somebody like me to only realize they don't like me because I'm a Christian right and I and I corrected everything and I you know almost bow to the person trying to make amends with them and to only realize they don't want aend they want to persecute they want to hurt they want to destroy but it's the spirit of the age that we're in amen and the only thing you can do is just serve the Lord just serve the Lord with all your heart amen now notice this because amen I I I hate to say this to you this way but hell's going to be against you you won't have to do anything you won't have to start any wars this is an old Feud they hated your daddy they hated your grandpa's they hated everything in your spiritual genealogy and the devil's going to hate you he hates everything you stand for he hates everything that you are amen that Jesus himself said in Matthew the 16th chapter he said it like this he said the Gates of Hell will be against you amen the Gates of Hell will be against you amen do you know this the gates of hell is not today it's not against that Jesus Christ even was a Son of God it wasn't against it's not against Paul it's not against Peter it's not against James the gates of hell is against the word made flesh today I hope I hope I didn't lose you in that last thought I hope you're with me amen the show the Gates of Hell will be against it do you see that it's a it's a spirit that's against the church amen and the prophet of God said see It'll be against the spiritual revealed word it'll be against the spiritual revealed word amen what is it it's the revelation of the word in its season in Matthew the 16th chapter it'll be against the revelation of the word in its season do you can I can I can I can I maybe take some pressure off and saying this EP fisan chapter 6 verse 10 to vers 13 Paul said this wrestle we doing this this war that we're having is not against flesh and blood it's not against flesh and blood it's against principalities and powers and darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places that's why he said to you take on the whole armor of God do you know right now you're in a battle now I don't have to tell you that you know that it's a spiritual battle more pressure than there's ever been on the end of age see but he says Paul says to take on the whole armor of God that you'll be able to withstand the devil in the evil day in the evil day that's your day that's the day you're living William brandom a prophet of God announc to this generation that Satan is the God of this age he announced to you you are living in Satan's Eden you see he's announcing he's letting you know this is the evil day if it's the evil day then we've got to take on the whole armor of God we got to know who the enemy is and we got to know what our armor is amen you say who's the enemy it's a battle the prophet of God said you got to know your enemy and you got to know your armor your armor is the word and your enemy is anything that reasons against the word anything that reasons against the word now you got to know your enemy by his attacks amen amen watch that the enemy will attack when anyone or any Spirit or any any person tries to disagree with the word of God that's your enemy you see and it might even be a person you love very dearly but if it's a voice of a person who's disagreeing or reasoning with a word that's the Enemy talking to you now I know sometimes we have a hard time Discerning that because if it's our family of course we want to just lean with them amen but there's a difference between between Divine love and compassionate love or or FAL love in a family sometimes family is wrong that's true amen sometimes they are and when it comes between the word and family you take your stand with the word can I can I preach to you a minute amen I want you to see that anything that disagrees with the word is your enemy now we have a hard time Discerning that at times and we think well we'll we'll we'll lean this way or we'll lean that way but a true bride got to stay with that word now I'll show you how Jesus did it and Matthew the 16th chapter I always thought it was amazing poor Peter he was on a roller coaster he starts out a as as Simon the son and then and and and when he gets a question who do you think I am he said thou Christ and he gets a name change and goes from Simon to Peter which is the Rock and then he he puts out an idea that Jesus being de he can't suffer on the cross Peter don't know how to understand how that deity could suffer he don't get it so he he's going to condemn the Lord and the Bible says he rebuke the Lord but the word had sent Jesus for the sake of the cross and Jesus looked at a man he just called The Rock and said you're the devil right he said you get behind me you offend me you see what he did he discerned the thing that was working on Peter Peter was a man who was a jean seek from the beginning but even when he said something that was off of the word the Lord rebuked what he was saying well glory to God we got to put on a shout and shoes this morning that means the word can rebuke you it doesn't mean you're a serpent seed it means you're correctable by the word of God when the enemy comes like a flood God will send the word to correct you thank God thank God thank God that the word can be controversial to our thoughts and our patterns and our ideas if it wasn't for the word we'd still be in the shook oh Lord I done think about think about this I I've been overseas brother Samuel and I I preached a big meet one time in India they wanted me to speak it it was a denominational meeting it was about 10 or 15 different denominations the guy put it together I don't know how many people there's a lot of people amen that it was a big call seeum inter denominational and the brother the guy that want me to preach it was supposed to be a message guy I I don't know where he was kind of felt like maybe he should have went to the upper room like Peter I don't know but but he got me in the back and he said look brother Wayne he said want you to preach he said but don't mention serpent seed don't mention Oneness of the godhead our baptism he said don't mention uh Malachi 4 or Elijah told me all these things he wanted me to mention did not mention and I looked at him kind of kind of chuckled I said well brother I sound like you need to preach instead of me he said no no I can't he said if you if I if you don't go out there and preach I'm going to be in big trouble I said well I I I'll do it okay I'll do it he said well I'm going to translate I said oh no you won't translate for me I said give me another translator there was a guy with me and they said they said brother Wayne he's the one that invited you I said well then he can preach but if he wants me to preach I got to preach what the word of God says this isn't a suggestion this is the word of God this is the age we're living in this brother Wayne what you do I'll tell you what I did I went out there and I started with serpent seed and I took it to the Oneness of the godhead and then I told him we knew that because of Malachi 4 and Elijah you say that was kind of contct it wasn't amen what it was was a word of God was bringing correction to a devil that was trying to suppress the word of God and any demon that don't want you to preach this message ain't nothing but a demon out of hell this message didn't come just to be contrary it came to put the bride in rapturing faith to give us an overcoming power now when I was done with that meeting you know what I did I I opened up the Altar and said anybody that want to know more about the truth I'm talking about stand to your feet and come down front right now and the whole Auditorium emptied out and the spirit of God people were fallen out demons were being cast off people were getting baptized the Holy Ghost the brother come to me and said brother Wayne I'm so sorry that I spoke to you that way he said God knew that I didn't have the courage to do it and sent you here to teach me a lesson that if a man will have courage in the word of God that the word of God can do a great work in the people listen we need some men and women amen that has courage for this message that is able to stand against every devil Hall well glory to God Amen you can't defend yourself without this word amen now Satan his success has been in reasoning has been in reasoning the word that's his success that's where he gets his success and Satan's eatting brother bam said he's had a marvelous success carrying out his threats by explaining away in every age the value of God's promised word for that age so you see you you see the enemy is to explain away the armor is the word I love this quote taking on the whole armor brother B said the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a word behind it yesall the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a word behind it so we're not fortified by doctor's degree or even by intellectual education amen but we are fortified with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove the word of God is truth amen isn't it amazing to prove the word of God is truth now putting on the whole armor brother R explains it of how God gives you your armor this is how he explains it he's going to tie together the armor of the Church of Ephesians 6 with Isaiah 59 of what Paul says when the enemy or when Isaiah says the enemy will come God will raise a standard or he will give you the Armor of your age now just like the word in the beginning it was a spoken word the second time it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the third time it become a part of us with the Holy Ghost dwelling in us now God coming into man see first the word was spoke and the enemy tore it down then the word was made flesh he crucified it but now there's a difference in the word now brother sister that's a powerful statement coming from a prophet there's a difference in the word now you all know the quotes don't you where brother B says see this age is different he said this doesn't represent amen the upper room he said he said the the Pentecostal is represented that again this age is different and some people has taken that to mean that there's no more baptism of the spirit there's no more gifts of the Spirit there's no more grace there that that we've moved beyond the manifestation of the spirit in the church but the prophet is saying here in putting on the all armor the difference is watch what he says it is the word has become the church and the church is the word see the difference in this age there are scriptures for this age and the church has become those scriptures it's not just something in the Bible this morning it's your life that is being lived out in the age that you're living in all of God was poured into Christ and all of Christ was poured into the church you see what it is then God then God raises a standard and here's what he does he doesn't change the word he raises the standard by making the word real right you see in Isaiah he said behold a virgin shall conceive that was the word but when Mary accepted it it became more positive by coming into a virgin and that word saved the whole world after it come into the woman do you see this same man until this word comes from the Bible into the church it's not manifest yet but this morning this bride is the reality of the things that was written in the Bible in other words you are the standard of God in the age you're living in the devil can't take over because you're here the devil can't take over your family because you're here the devil can't take over the church because you're here you've got a right this morning to press back every de denomination idea until the spirit of God is released in the in the heart and the life W God took the word and poured it into the church I shall pour out my Spirit sayith the Lord in the last days with former and lighter rain shall it come oh think about it this ain't something coming to us the latter rain is rapturing Faith this message is the rapturing faith Hallelujah brother when you get to thinking about it amen what a what a time to live amen this is not then an intellectual word is your protection well get behind the word get behind the word it's not an intellectual word we're looking for that's not what we're after brother B says it'll have to be God's manifestation of the word in flesh God's spirit spoken word am brother a spirit spoken word hallelujah God Elohim takes his own word and speaks it and it comes back into the church God's spirit spoken word the word of God will raise a standard the word will be more manifested Hallelujah now that's God raising he's raising for years I wonder Isaiah 59 we I preached it as the flag and and that's a good that's a good standard that's a good way to see it we raised the flag but brother brandom says to raise the standard is to make the word more real see see what's going on is he makes it more positive now when Satan comes like a flood now I don't want to take any more time in that when Satan comes like a flood I believe we could say Isaiah 59 is today yeah amen amen amen Sunday morning amen after all this we've seen amen it's today is that right amen notice this Isaiah 59 now watch watch watch the what the first of this I don't know if y'all y'all May y'all may study this deeply uh it was years I never really caught what this next the first part of this are always when the enemy comes like a flood but I went back and reread this and I I had a good time with this part and so shall they that fear the name of the Lord from the West I got to look at that and I thought wait a minute when Isaiah wrote that that wasn't even a thought of America this Western Civilization wasn't even thought about but them that fear the name of the Lord how many knows what the name of the Lord is right it's the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God in your age that's why brother brandom says in the first seal that it wouldn't be until the Thunders that a new name would be revealed is that right in other words that's why you hear people say Jesus Jesus Jesus and they don't get nothing it's just like Elijah's Showdown on Mount carel you see brother B said they do a lot of holling but they don't get nothing Matthew 25 same thing right five foolish five wise amen they're they're wise and foolish virgins the difference is one gets something right right but what did they have in their vessels they were full of oil they got from the word of the age them that fear the name of the Lord now watch from the West and his glory from the rising of the son now I'm not going to take a long time but I do want to say that Willam brandom said the reason he went to Tucson was to meet with them seven angels right right he had to go west to meet with seven angels to get the revelation of the Seven Seals now that's not just a man preaching some ideas that is for fulfilling Revelations the 10th chapter amen Revelations 10 cannot be fulfilled at any other time in history but this day this scripture watch what brother B teaches us he teaches what's the attraction on the mountain Mount Sunset right Mount Sunset the setting of the Sun in the west brother man said I went West he said to meet with the angels and they brought me back and I preach the Seven Seals can I can I take some Liberty here and they brought me back and I preach the seven SE I hear a lot of people talking about return Ministry I believe in return Ministry I believe brother Ram went to Tucson got the message and returned back and preached the Seven Seals you said what about the tent what is the tent other than the revelation of the word in the age you're living here amen I tell you what he done he went and met with them seven angels and where where did he come from y'all y'all ask yourself where did Brother Ram come back from to preach these seals came from the West come on he came from the West I hear a lot of people brother Wayne he's going to come out of the West riding that white horse what do you think he was doing for the last three years of his ministry it was all coming from the West Hallelujah from the West when did you ever hear anybody preach a message called it is the rising of the sun amen here he is coming from the West preaching the rising of the sun the sun amen them that fear the name of the Lord where's he getting that amen Isaiah Malachi says the same thing for them that fear the name of the Lord shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings not just a healing campaign but a Rapture a body change an anointing amen I tell you this morning I want you to know it's a good news the gospel is the good news it's the good news to you the Sun is up now brother said they stay stay they said one birds and he said then there's some bigger Birds he said but now that third's Angels yes sir that third pull is Angels is that right oh church amen there's some big there's some big doctrinal differences around the world and I know it's not here amen but a lot of people thinks that when brother Brandon preached them seals that he gave that book amen that he actually has that book and at sometime a prophet will come back and call the resurrection by that book but do you know that after the seventh angel in Revelation chapter 10 that book is offered to somebody else amen after the seventh angel in Revelation 5 John couldn't touch the book couldn't look at the book but after the seventh chapter of the revelations 10 the angel said come here and get the book John come and take the book John let me ask you who can take it I'll tell you who can take it is Abraham SE can take it Abraham SE can take the word of God we got a representation of kinsman redeemer who has redeemed every right of the church to take the book back in our hands our weapon has been returned to the church not outside the prde but he said take it and eat it bring it into your body not just the message you are the message of the hour with indicated word of God has come into the church another move is coming Hallelujah when the spirit of the Lord shall have another move Not Another Not Another Ministry of brother brandom but the life that he represented will come into the bride of Christ and manifest the word in the age we're living in another move another ride oh I know it makes people M these statements but it's just truth anyhow amen he said I'll ride the trail again he's doing it he's doing it cuz it's not William brandom riding it friends it was Jesus Christ it was the ministry of it you some brother prove that in the scripture okay David stood there and said my God my God Thou forsaken me and my bones they stare at me and my tongue cling to my mouth and they thought he was talking about David but David wasn't talking of himself Christ was prophesying through David of his own Ministry and I'll tell you today brother randam was a prophet of God and God was prophesying through that man what God was going to do in a bride it's not going the ministry didn't stop the ministry continues but it's not the ministry of William brandom it is the ministry of Jesus [Applause] Christ not to do away with brother Randon that's what they want you to hang up on the man the man the man so they can show you the faults of a man we all know he's a man but he was also a prophet and if God can use a man like that what can he do with you Hallelujah hallu Glory Hallelujah now you you got to understand scriptures clearly the prayer of a righteous man aileth much so what is a righteous man then perfect man without sin without trouble but but James finished it thank God he did he said in a man liken under passion Elijah shut up the Heavens yes let you know it's a man of passion righteous man is not a man without mistakes it's a man under the blood now now see it's another move brother B said see The Same Spirit sa the Lutheran Sanctified the Methodist baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen in signs of his time brother B said the church is going to constantly get minority but greater power see as a pyramid God will raise the standard see It'll Get it'll get more in minority but it's going to greater power so there might not be as many in it but the ones that remain in it we see a greater power in it do you know that we've actually left the Pentecostal age and moved into the headstone of Christ direct quote signs of a time brother BR said we lift the Pentecostal age we are now coming like a pyramid now not a now but I mean like a pyramid there's got to be a Ministry in the church True Church of the Living God where the headstone comes the ministry of Christ will fit right together perfectly right together perfectly watch this amen the the spirit of the Lord watch what he's going to do the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard amen now the Perfection what's it going to do it's going to move from Luther to Wesley to Pentecost he said then it'll move into the Perfection of the son of man when the husband and and the wife will be the selfs persons Hallelujah can you imagine that you're represented in heaven as Christ wonderful now to see it in the Bible I I love biblical truth right when the spirit of the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard raise Ephesians chapter 4 for the perfecting the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body till we all come in the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stat of the fullness of Christ what's he saying when the enemy comes God will raise the standard to a perfect stature of Christ you're going to be in The Headstone see what he's saying leaving the principles and the doctrines and going to Perfection right amen do you know according to Hebrews chapter 11 all of the great Saints that's live for the last 2,000 years cannot be made perfect Without You amen the measure cannot be full when the measure is full that's perfect right amen it's perfectly full when the church becomes full of the baptism of the spirit not just in a measure but when the fullness of that which is Christ comes into the church she's at the top now watch watch watch the scripture go back to Isaiah 59 and let's read again and and let's read here in the uh let's let's watch this next verse in the 20th verse When the Spirit of the Lord shall raise us standard against him watch that 20th verse look what he's going to do see when the spirit of the Lord shall raise a standard so the enemy comes God does something what what he's going to do and the Redeemer now who is the Redeemer that's Elohim right that's Elohim or Christ it's God coming in the flesh of Jesus and he redeemed us but Our Redeemer Lives right right Our Redeemer Lives now watch the Redeemer shall come to Zion right how many knows who Zion is Zion is not a place over there in Israel brother man said when you see Zion in the scripture that is the bride see when the enemy comes Christ shall come to the bride he'll come right into the Bride Watch the next verse watch the 21st verse read the scripture it's beautiful reading as for me this is my Covenant with them now we're going to go to a covenant isn't that beautiful because abrahamic Covenant is Christ do y'all know Christ was given as a covenant to you real shortly let's just break it down he was given as a covenant remember brother Bram said a covenant is a beast he said laid between two people I make a promise you make a promise then we kill the Beast and split the body you take half I take half brother Bram said God did this with Abraham in Genesis 15 but the Covenant was Christ God laid Jesus between me and you killed him at Calvary and tore the body and brother bam says God took the Corporal body to Heaven he said and gave you the spirit out of it then God's covenant with you is the spirit that was in Jesus Christ do you see then why you can never get in Covenant with God through education or through learning or through church membership your Covenant is his Spirit now when the enemy comes like a flood God by his Covenant shall come into the church my Lord y do y'all like prophecy do you love you love prophecy I love prophecy watch Psalms 102 read uh 13 to vers 16 amen no we we come to have a little church let's read this prophecy for Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time of favor to time to favor her the set time has come I know I've read this to you but I want to want to just use it for a moment thou shall have mercy upon Zion for the set time has come for the servant shall take pleasure in her Stone so the Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord heathens right Gentiles in the west will'll fear the name of the Lord and all of the kings of the Earth are glory for when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory look at this when when enemy comes like a FL I'm going to build the church I'm going to raise a standard I'm going to build it up to the catstone and when the catstone comes it'll be Christ himself amen do you see that's the that's the capping of the church is when Christ himself comes upon the church amen it's written in Peter he said I'll lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone amen now you say well preacher how far have we come well in this journey in this journey of the church how far have we come we come through Lutheran we've come through Wesley and we've come through Pentecost but look what Paul says in Hebrews 12 but ye in the 22nd verse he said but ye are come unto Mount Zion that's how far you've come you've come you've left you've left the time of Moses and tradition you've left the church age of of legal and law and and churchianity and you've left the Pentecostal age you've come to the bride of Christ and to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem amen watch this unto the innumerable company of angels 200,000 demons can't number the Angels amen but to the general assembly of the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven amen now now y'all y'all have to y'all have to as you read the scripture you have to think about this and I as a message preacher sometimes I think about this and I think look look at what Paul says the the age that I'm preaching the message the time that I've come we've come to Zion where there's a number of company of Angels at a junction of time angels have filled the air filled the atmospheres and I'm preaching to the Church of the firstborn see not the Pentecostals to the Church of the firstborn there's a difference in the days in the days of Pentecost the Church of the firstborn was in the upper room the Pentecostals were in the traditions of Pentecost amen look at the same time they were on the Earth but the Holy Ghost was in the upper room they had been raised up in the presence of God hallelujah now think of this because brother Randon says that their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life do you know how Peter knew his name was there brother B said when Jesus came to him said who do you say that I am he said I say th the Christ the son of the Living God brother said the light struck the name and proved that his name was on the Lamb's Book amen the little woman at the well when the Messiah sign passed over her and she said I say that thou art the Christ brother B says it brues her names there you see what he's saying he's saying you're recognizing the age you're living in is the true reality of the Jean seed that's on the inside of you listen I think it's powerful that I get to preach to people that I know their name is already written in the Lamb's Book of Life glory amen it's prophesying like Joshua prophesied in his day he knew the children of God would inherit that land and today when I'm preaching to you I'm not thinking that maybe somebody some sometimes going to go there but I know there's somebody who's going to inherit the very promises that I'm talking about this morning what is it it's it's it's come to the place it's come to the place where we are ministering to people who are having their names written in the lamb Book of Life that's why it's not always just a Salvation message you're hearing it's why it's not always always see this is end time evangelism it's adoption time it's honing time it's polishing off the off the ministry of the church to Perfection wonderful God I don't want this to choke you but the prophet of God said what is it it's Elohim back in the bride praise God how far has it come that's it it's Elohim back in the bride amen can I say it the way brother Ram said invisible Union the same Jesus in Bride form amen amen we see him coming down and living among his people what is it now watch this I'm going to finish in this area right here let's look at this next verse of Isaiah 59 I want you to watch what happens and go back to Isaiah 59 and look at the verses here 19 I think it's 21 see he shall come and this is my Covenant with him sayith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth though out of the mouth of thy seed out of the mouth of the seed seed sayith the Lord from hence forth and forever more now now watch what he's saying the spirit of the Lord is going to raise his standard and look at his standard now he's going to make the word more real so scripture that are actually for your Day scriptures like of Isaiah 5 59 Revelations 10 Luke 17 Malachi 4 these scriptures are going to be manifest at the same time the enemy comes like a flood but there won't be something that's just abstract from you but as he tells John you're actually taking the revelations and eating them in spiritual food and bringing them into your life this is the Covenant that he made that they will will actually be put in you now years ago I was preaching on the certain sound and the uncertain sound and in the certain sound message brother Bram will say something he'll say he'll say now there's a certain sound and he says if you repent and be baptized you shall receive the Holy Ghost so he said You shall do you see that you shall knock and it shall be open it's a certain sound if you do this happens and I got to studying the shallel bees of scripture if you like to study scripture that's pretty good shall be this shall be this shall be and and I I read Revelation 10 differently than I ever read it before because it actually says in Revelations 10 if John would take the book the first says take the book eat the book and watch the promise it shall be in thy mouth right so it's not just that he's going to eat something but by the eating of it it will actually be in his mouth the weapon that will destroy the Devil is naivy even in in thy mouth what watch this you actually have Atomic Warfare amen I I I know brother B said that when those scarecrows or when those when those crows fly over and he said you can't keep them from Landing you remember he said you can't keep them passing over said a farmer standing out there and crows fly over and he said a man run in got a shotgun started shooting at him he said he said what's that about he said well I can't keep the crows from flying he said but I can't keep them from Landing right right but man said that's like thoughts evil thoughts that come to your mind he said you can't keep them from passing he said but you can keep them from Landing you take the shotgun of scripture right but I thought it was amazing because when I started studying that I found that later brother B begins to say in the greatest battle ever fought he said we don't have a little 22 all right can I can I propose this to you we don't even have a shotgun he said but the bride has thus sayith the Lord and thus sayith the Lord is an adom Bond amen you don't you don't only can just get rid of them you can totally obliterate every thought that comes amen because you are having a possession of the word of God in this age do you see what it is ask for me God says ask for me in other words youen I know who you are I know your problems I know your issues I know your situations but ask for me this is my Covenant God made a covenant with you that's not about you it's not about your abilities it's not amen it's not according to what you can what you cannot do he said Abraham I have already blessed you come on Church we're not under any Covenant we're under an abrahamic Covenant and God said he's already did this for you watch this Covenant when it comes upon the church he's already said now as for me I make this Covenant with you in other words God made this as for me he says now you're going to be who you are you got the issues you got but can you imagine that God can claim you it don't matter where you're setting what situation you've done amen because we can come up with 100 reasons why that we can't defeat the Devil but God said that's for me now this is my Covenant Amen in other words I'm going to give you Christ and I made a covenant with Christ and when he comes into the church Christ will be in the bride and watch and he shall not depart out of thy mouth then this morning the spoken word will be given to the Bride of Jesus Christ no wonder Mark the 11th chapter said if you say under this mountain be thou moved and cast up it shall be done as you have asked it that's not just to any age but when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of the Lord would come into the church and by the spoken word amen oh Church of the Living God hallelujah amen I don't know sometimes if we know who we are now can I can I tie can I tie scripture with something brother BR said in patma Vision brother B said Don't Fear Little Flock I'm with you amen he's talking about Jesus and he says all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure we need to preach a meeting on that don't we I've come not to bring fear and failure but of Love courage and ability amen all power is given unto me and it's yours to use hallah you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail brother B knew what he was talking about Isaiah 59 is the Covenant of the church that if you speak the word of God it will not fail watch this it's an abrahamic Covenant amen you said well brother Wayne is it to everybody it's to them that can take it amen who's it to everybody no it's to them that can take it amen to the saints were are at Ephesus do you see the ones that can take it in John he could take it the bride they can take it they can take the word you see they can take the land they can take their possession because it's the spoken word it's the Covenant of God with him now now if you'll notice this this is how Isaiah 59 becomes Revelations the 12th chapter Now read the 11th verse of the 12th chapter with this in mind we're looking at end time battles amen but we're talking about Isaiah 59 Isaiah saw this time Paul saw this time Timothy saw this time Willam brandom saw this time and more importantly God saw this time thank you Lord now in Revelation the 12th chapter it's moving from Angelic battles to human battles now do you think that God doesn't understand your human battles your human troubles he sees their trouble yes but watch what he says here in Revelation the 12th chapter and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and love not their lives unto death now watch what he says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony now I'm that guy that ask who are they right I got to ask it who are they now the Bible if you go back in the scriptures in Hebrews 11 it says they cannot be made perfect without us so you got to know who you are and what scripture in Hebrews 11 they are speaking about the ones down Through the Ages but when he says can't be made perfect without us it's speaking about the end time people us but when he comes to Revelations 12 and he said they overcame who's he talking about who's that they they're talking about that's not just anybody but there's somebody there it's not just a figment of imagination I remember when I was studying this I I went to it and I got to think about my childhood when I was growing up and I got to think about when I was a kid I remember having friends they can I say it openly I guess they were pot smokers and and and and and they were some paranoid guys man they were you been around people like that they sometimes they just get very paranoid over nothing you know and you can always tell when you come up to a house if somebody's a little bit using drugs and things cuz they're they're blinds they they all broke right in the middle where they they lift them up and look out side cuz anybody pulls up it's the cops I'm sure it's the cops out there you know and I remember as a kid being with some of my friends and they were always looking at the blind saying they're out there right they're out there and you go look in the window and they ain't nothing but trees out there but in their mind the trees are full of the cops and you drive down the road with them they they're back there they and you always like who are they who are they but it's in their mind that's all it's just somebody in their mind but when when God had John write this scripture they and he said they shall overcome that wasn't just in God's mind he wasn't some imaginary somebody he had somebody in his mind and they are you they are us amen you're in the Bible they shall overcome what does that mean throw down conquer destroy put underfoot you're not just going to make it you're not just going to crawl in you're not just going to barely get there you are going to conquer amen put underfoot every demon power in the age you're living in well glory to God Amen think about it think about the age this is this is not a bride just going to barely get in this message amen she's going to go home in the [Music] Victory and they overcame him the enemy that's raising up right right him the enemy that's raised it up the Antichrist Spirit do you see that not the devil with horns on it the spirit of the Antichrist that's revealed in this day they overcame him the devil and how did they do it by the blood of the Lamb amen I I know I don't have time to preach but I want to put it in your mind the blood of the Lamb that doesn't say the blood of a lamb and how many lambs had been sacrificed in the time of John thousands of lambs but he didn't say a l he said the lamb then there was something in his mind that the blood of the only begotten Son of God who wasn't the blood of a man he wasn't the blood of a Jew he wasn't the blood of a gentile but amen the Bible said that Mary conceived likewise that when the angel came to her and said thou had been favored of God remember and she said be it unto me according to Thy word brother Ram said what came into her amen was both egg and and life it was both male and female oh that was a creation in the womb of Mary friends that was a creation of almighty God in the wom that was not just the blood of any man it was the blood of almighty God Amen the DNA of God was in Jesus Christ GL Hallelujah I enjoy preaching to y'all y'all like to preach the Creator y'all y'all ever notice that's right when the name of God changed yeah right when the name of God changed was when the word of Isaiah was interpreted and manifested the name changed to Jesus isn't that isn't that beautiful went from Jehovah to Jesus being Jehovah has become Our Savior when male and female were created in the womb and come forth in life it was a manifestation of Jesus Oh My amen what happened in the beginning when God created and he created male and female in the beginning God did it and changed his name from Elohim to Jehovah and now he's changing it from Jehovah to Jesus ah Mary was impregnated with a word made manifest it was in her life the Creator the Conqueror the Overcomer was in her womb and her testimony to her friends was I have conceived of a virgin birth amen the prophet of God said when the first time that she told Elizabeth that story that Elizabeth believed her amen Mary's first convert was Elizabeth the first convert of Jesus Christ was Elizabeth amen John the Baptist converted his own mother from the womb amen Elizabeth Elizabeth believed the words of Mary you know why she believed it and she said Mary when you begin to testify the word of your testimony when you begin to testify to me she said my baby that's in my womb has been laying there without lie for 6 months but when you said the name Jesus that baby leaked up with in me oh John had his first convert right there the thing that is in Mary is the Lamb of [Applause] God glory amen I got all my shout and shoes amen the lamb the blood of the Lamb that saves the sin of the world the one that can conquer the hell death and the grave was the word of Isaiah coming into the man estation Hallelujah and it was in Mary and look she testified amen amen I often I often thought it was amazing where she done her testifying that she done it right down there at the house of the priest she would have got killed for that had it not been a virgin birth right she wasn't fear she didn't fear for her life because she knew her testimony was true had that not been a true testimony the priest who was responsible to kill her for adultery was the one she testified to but he had to judge it was a virgin birth and because of the conversion inside of John's mother the prophet of God said oh if it could bring a baby alive in the womb of a mother what should the name of Jesus Christ do to the Church of the Living God God ain't gave us another name this morning it's still the name of Jesus Christ this message isn't another name it's the name of Christ manifested it's not Jesus outside it's Jesus inside Hall hallu I feel the breezes of Calvary blowing across the church this morning and holy ghost power with reality of Truth the blood of the Lamb the lamb now you got to imagine something here The Blood blood of the Lamb Hallelujah and watch and by the word of their testimony then people in the end times going to have a word they're going to have a message to testify about but I want you to notice what Mary wasn't scared of she wasn't scared of that testimony yes she run down to the house of the man that would kill her for that testimony and gave it because she didn't have no fear I love how the end of this scripture read I love how it says in they love not their lives under death yes yes I love how it says that because the people that's doing this testifying ain't scared of dying right you know what they're doing they're winning this battle because they're fighting like dead men you ain't never had a fight on your hands until you fight somebody who thinks they're already dead they're fighting like somebody who has nothing to preserve they don't have nothing to gain they don't have nothing if if they die in the battle what difference does it make you see they're fighting with everything that's on the inside of them I pray God give us some men and women this morning amen that's not scared of the devil they're not scared of the testimony they're not scared of somebody making fun of them amen they're not scared of the teasing and the and the ridicule of this message but they're going to fight like people who have already died and gave their life for Jesus Christ Hallelujah my they love not their lives and they overcame prise god listen I I I know I know this morning that the devil has told you everything yeah I know he tells you every kind of lie and every kind of situation about your birth and who you are and where you came from but you know brother brandom said when God created me we and Bram I was before the foundation of the world and my spirit was conscious wasn't I wasn't conscious of anything he said he said but wait a minute Jesus told the disciples he knew them before the foundation of the world and PA said he chose us before the foundation of the world and brother R said some part of me or Orman Neville the rest of us all here Jesus Christ uh that that was in Christ before the world began can I can I just change names here amen now there was some part of me can I put my name in there there's some part of you there's some part of brother Samuel brother Brian Zachariah Karissa there's some part there's some part of you that was in God before the foundation of the world Amen I mean listen to that there's some part of you that was there and brother ROM ties together John 17 with Ephesians 1 and said here's the analysis of this I think the people today that are possessed with the spirit a part of those Angelic spirits that turned off of God never fa at the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven so you resisted that lie there you're resisting that lie here and how are you resisting by the spirit of God that dwells in the church yes amen now God makes a covenant this is my Covenant my word shall be in thy mouth hallu you'll speak the word I'll perform it it'll be an atom bomb when you speak it'll be a spirit of word that will destroy the enemy it'll destroy the things that around you why Christ speak brother B will say it like this the Holy Spirit has one message just speak the word and go forward that's right don't cry there's the word speak it and move forward that's thus sayith the Lord that's the message of the Holy Ghost that's the message of the Holy Ghost until you speak the word you can't go forward right Moses is at the Red Sea until he speaks the word he can't go forward right the church cannot go forward until the word is spoken see until you speak the word you can't go forward until you say Satan get out of my way I'm a redeemed Son of God you can't go forward because you're worried about your past you're worried about the troubles you're worried about the situ ations you worried about but speak the word of God and just begin to move forward don't let that devil move you so brother way but but I'm waiting on the short work I'm waiting on this brother B said the move is on amen that's th sayith the Lord we are more than conquerors in him that loved us I can do all things through Christ has strengthened us amen you start putting that kind of thing in your mouth I can do all things anything that says you can't is a lie amen amen right right it's a lie right amen blessing I often often I think every time I preach anymore I get to thinking about it I like I like to get the whole congregation to help me preach I I like get get everybody turn to somebody and say hey the devil's a liar Li the devil's a liar Li you know he's a liar from the beginning you know how you do you know how to know when the devil's lying to you when he's talking to you hallelujah amen cuz even if he's using the word he's going to twist it when he gets done amen it's going to twist it that you can't and you'll never and you won't be able to but the Bible said we are more than conquerors through Christ who loved us I can do all things amen that if you speak the word if you speak the word of God this is not just written for Paul it's not just written for Abraham this is written for every seed of God in this generation there it is his Spirit his life is exactly what the word is this is exactly Jesus the word and when the spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lip it is the same as deity speaking prise Lord he's a preacher you just don't know me very well you don't know my life can I can I read you a quote brother B says it like this concerning the same thing he said catch that the word comes into you if the holy spirit is in there it's as live as soon as it comes in and every promise is true therefore if you say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart because what you are deity speaking Hallelujah Lord praise God you believe it whatever you say shall come to pass if you will not doubt it right watch this now if you can get all the world breed out of you right now think about that all the world bread out of you how you going to do that let the Holy Spirit make you how you going to get the world bread out of you now think about that because there's some things that se seems to be undoable right right hybrid hybrid burst hybrid religion hybrid see the hybridization of seed right brother said that's the problem remember with the mule and with the the donkey amen that's the problem that's the problem with the mule right right the mule is the hybrid between a donkey and a horse you can't how how do you fix that but brother Bram says but watch the church got bred into by unbelief and doctrines down Through the Ages he said but the Holy Ghost comes to breathe the church back sir you see what he's doing he's coming to breed it back to breathe out now how you going to do it but by the Holy Ghost now think about it remember every every donkey can be redeemed there's a blood for a donkey but not for a mule right not for the hybrid there's no blood you can say you're under the blood but as long as it's mixed it's not under the blood amen you see then hybrid religion has no Authority or no power to exercise the spoken word of God but to them that have come under the blood and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost has got a new birth come on Church watch this it's a new birth he's talking about amen Lord now I I know I know that one of the big things in the message of the hour has been uh somebody that's illegitimate born whether they could even go in the Rapture and I thank God that brother bradam actually answered that question to Sister Mary Dalton and I'm sure you've read it here the people but he read that quote to Sister Mary Dalton I think Jim Dalton's mother asked brother random the question about the illegitimate birth and brother Bram wrote her a letter back and said sister dalon she said all of our births are illegitimate that through through the fall of Adam we're all hibrid in our birth and we're all illegitimate in our birth and we become legitimate Sons through the new birth amen amen is't that beautiful legitimate Sons and Daughters by the new birth in other words the new birth breaths out the call the New Birth dismisses the sexual desire the new birth it destroys it see if you can get it bred out Hallelujah you can get that baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll breed out that now I told you that to say this you think about you think about Samson in his day of War right and Samson's coming across the mountains and and and he's got a thousand Philistines on him and he finds the Jawbone of a donkey right come on church was no mu bone he picked up is a Jawbone of a donkey it don't say a donkey in the Bible I'm saying that for you young people amen but he picked up a a a Jawbone of a purebred animal right and he took that Jawbone and beat down a thousand Philistines listen church amen if you can get the world prad out of you and get to a full born son of God you can take the Jawbone amen of a pure blad son or daughter of God and you can beat that a thousand Philistines it's the Jawbone of the church why did mo why did Samson find a Jawbone it was representing that there's coming a bride that by the spirit of the word that's coming out of her mouth she'll destroy every devil that's in front of her I don't know if you know it but the most powerful weapon you possess is the power of the spoken word of God you are not a defeated people you are not a defeated Church the spirit of the enemy is coming like a flood but God has raised a standard against it won't you stand to your feet with me this morning it's time to take a Jawbone and go destroying some devils this morning don't don't let your confession become negative don't let your confession don't don't let the devil do it to you don't let the devil destroy you don't let the things that are around you get you I tell you this morning when the the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will come into the church amen and by the power of the spoken word will manifest that word through that blood listen you're I I I get to study in thoughts and I get get in them get lost in them and I get to study about your enemy your adversary it's pretty amazing if if you ever just start studying your enemy right because you're going to come down to a point and brother man's going to say your enemy your adversary is just a bluff you're going to come to that point and you're going to say he's a defeated being right and he's just able to hold you because of the reasoning away the value of the word that you possess this morning friends listen he's a liar right amen your birth get a new one get a new one one new birth right can breed all the coal out of you make you a legitimate son make you a legitimate daughter you're sitting here with a new birth today you're legitimate and being legitimate you know what that means your heir to every promise in the book entitled to hold the Lamb's Book of Life amen Samson had a Jawbone you got the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah in your mouth when that white horse rider come and he had the word of God written upon him what the Bible say and the sword was where what was his sword was it on his side it was coming out of his mouth right where's the sword at this morning in the Church of the Living God it's not on the side of the church the sword is in the mouth it's the word of the Lord hallelujah Glory the spirit of Truth Listen I know there might be an enemy standing in front of of you this morning but God has raised you he's raised you from the place of the Enemy being above you and he's put the enemy beneath you he's raised you how high how high have you come you ever ask yourself how high am I sitting you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ on the throne of God with every enemy beneath you this morning oh I think it's time to exercise our rights amen I think it's time to put that enemy beneath you but Satan I'm not going to give you no room this morning let your confession let your take that Jawbone take that Jawbone and destroy that devil let's bow our hearts father God we we bow our hearts this morning we lift our hands if there ever was a time lord the enemy has come we see it identif ified whatever other people are looking for I don't know but a prophet a seir has identified the enemy Among Us The Watchman on

you know real edification in the church is not is not good words real edification is the spirit revealed word amen and it comes to lift up and identify the real son and daughter of God on the inside that's where our Dominion is at recognizing who we are in him and to recognize he's our big brother amen amen we we are one with Christ Jesus amen don't you love him oh my what a what a precious time that we are living in sad for the world but a very precious time for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're closer we're closer am we're closer I just appreciate how the spirit of God just taking it and identifying not putting promises out there that it keeps people looking way out there I remember one time I was fellowshipping with with a brother and he wanted to sit down and and ask me certain there was questions that and we sat down for about three or four hours at a restaurant and there were certain things and we begin to deal with that on the latter rain and when I begin to just working just right right through the the scriptures and the message and the brother himself he said I see that he said the way he said that I've heard it preached he said is that it's something in the future I said I said but see when you when you when you identify as something in the future you miss the blessing that's in that which is taking place right now because we don't need it in the future we need the latter rain right now that's what matures Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's what that what moves Upon Our Life to bring forth Sons and Daughters of God and we mature and we grow closer to him I'm just so grateful that God in this hour he has fulfilled his promise evening light in this hour amen that book the book has been taken amen and now that book itself that has been taken is placed within the heart of the believer we're looking in the scripture and not seeing things of the past but we're seeing what God did in the past that he's doing it right now it was wrote it was lived in Prophecy for this hour amen don't you love him I tell you that it's it's exciting and you see it that this this we're living in this time of where God would bring Sons and Daughters of God back to where it was in Eden where it's words word born spoken word sons that speak the word not under the authority of a of a blood of bulls and goats which Moses did but he had that Authority cuz God gave him that Authority but when God has given us this Authority that comes under the blood of Jesus Christ there's not a devil that can stand before that word that's spoken by a son and daughter of God my my we could get to preaching here but God is good is't he he I tell you I really appreciate brother Wayne coming and I just God using him letting getting out of the way and letting God use him amen amen amen this is this is that secret food that brother Ram he spoke of he said that gift in my life God will come down and he said there's got to be a gift in your life to be able to receive it and he said when those gifts go to operating one to another so you can bypass people but yet when that gift when that connection is operating right there that's a secret food amen amen it's it's food it sustains us it gives us strength amen this is a living reality amen I just I just love the Lord and I know you do too and we want to just continue to pray for brother Wayne and sister chissa even as God would just continue to direct them into the different uh places even I know where they would go and and to minister and we just so just so appreciate brother Wayne thank you for taking the sacrifice to be here thank you chrisa God bless you thank you amen sister Bethany don't ever come back here and not sing again we love you but that was a friendly gesture amen God bless you let's just
