[Music] [Music] is [Music] our God oh [Music] [Applause] we'll see his love God Hallelujah oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah our lives are a testimony of just how great he is you know when we think back to what Adam and what they had in the Garden of Eden or Adam could speak to the storm could move the tree and all of those things had to do with what was the best position if you we think about it it had nothing to do with when Adam spoke that this tree be plucked up and moved over here it had nothing to do with being agitated being bothered being frustrated because sin hadn't entered yet so it brings us back into that place threw him by the blood of Jesus Christ where the Holy Spirit comes to bring that rest in our life that the things that we speak to and situations in our life are not out of frustration because God won't hear that it's not out of anxiousness it's recognizing this is a need and it's a hindrance to him and that's what our lives are here for it's for him that's our whole purpose is for him so just as the same God that provided the RAM on the mountain there was a need the same God that brought forth squirrels in this hour it was for a need and it's the same way in our lives even here this morning even as the words going forth the word is being spoken over our life and then our hearts in agreement with that word it just takes that voice that's coming forth and then as we amen and it echoes it so be it Lord and we're speaking not out of frustration we're speaking out of in Harmony and unity with the mind of Christ and the same God that brought squirrels where there was actually impossible for squirrels to come out of these things I think Alberta Ram said that he said I'll call for this he said I'll make this so radical in the sense that squirrels don't come out of this particular bush you know to me as I've said this is more than squirrels what I look at that is how many would right off and did write off my life right off your life and say a Son of God coming out of hair a daughter of God coming out of there but God made a testimony in this hour that the word when it goes forth the word will bring forth after its own kind amen and I'm I'm glad to be a witness of that aren't you and then just so appreciated amen the songs this morning the special I believe God has something special for us amen and so we just want to turn our attention here in just a moment to the word I want to remind you this coming week the Lord willing this coming Thursday evening brother Daryl Ward will be here ministering for us at that time and so we just want to come expecting a man and just looking through What the Lord Has for us there and also want to continue to remember it wasn't wrote as a prayer request but brother Joshua you haven't seen him here a few Services brother Joshua he had to have surgery last week to remove uh the um the way they calls them the nails that were put in there to cause that leg to grow where the bone would form around it then they had to go back in and remove that because everything is right where it needs to be so he's doing really well a little bit of pain there in the hip from where they had to go in right there but he's doing well with that so we want to continue to remember our brother in prayer also for sister Sharon his wife that God God will just make a way I told her I told him this I said look I look forward to the text every text that you send me I look forward to either the text or the phone call that it's she's passed and I I said you know to me I know what they've said in regarding immigration over there I said but when brother Benny Perry was here in that January before in the middle of his service I said a testimony was given for a similar situation and how God moved those papers forward God is still God you know sometimes in our Humanity we can become very frustrated with the things that we see around us but only remember that's a test and we have to go through that you were never going to get to a spot to where all the a feeling of frustration doesn't come but remember overcoming is recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks and then recognizing that God in you is greater and has already overcome that thing I think we all could fellowship and say God help me to recognize that part more in the simple everyday moments of our lives so we want to continue to remember that in prayer uh also this evening Lord willing the fire pit Fellowship here at about 6 PM we'll start that and uh if you could just make sure you bring your chairs to set in and also any non-perishable food or items and if you need help on what to bring I can tell you Sunday is a special day for me not only do I get to go to the house of the Lord but special day where I eat special things sometimes so if you need any help with that I'd be happy if you don't feel led in a certain way let me lead you and what to bring but we we just so enjoy being able to get together and fellowship and I think it's a privilege to be able to have Brother David and sister Jeannie Hoover here with us it's first time for them being with us but um his brother David makes his way forward Brother David is just he and sister Genie had just become good friends to us here over the few years that we have actually been to know one another and I just so I just so loved them dearly and I'm glad that brother Hoover has taken time out of the vacation and the time when he heard he was coming I said you're not going to sit yeah I want you to minister and so we just want to pull on the gift of God some of this maybe brother Hoover will share but brother Hoover's grandmother was the nanny that brother Brandon brought into the home to care for the home and I thought I don't want to steal his Thunder because he has a ton of testimonies and stories so maybe tonight if they're able to be at the fire pit I mean there's so much that that many different testimonies are just wonderful to go into but I thought it was tremendous how when brother when brother Branham took his grandmother around and showed her as brother Hoover related it he pointed out to her the different duties within the home and then what would be done and then he took her and he showed her he said you see that post out there in the yard out there in the back and she said yes he said don't ever let the children go near that he said because I made a promise to those Hornets I'd never disturb him again it's pretty powerful isn't it I made a promise to those Hornets I'd never disturb them again I tell you God is God isn't he he's a living God that's that's what this message brought to you and I it lifted God out of History and brought God to a present tense God in our lives a god a word that we can handle a word that we can touch a word that lives inside of us I'm glad about that aren't you so I told Brother David all along I said look we're we're family you're at home and just I said we just we're simple people we just love the Lord we love the word just just preach however God leads you testimonies he wants to share but I tell you I love Brother David and so appreciate him and I know we're going to be blessed this morning amen do you love the Lord amen let's just sing that could we sing a little course let go and let God have his wonderful way as brother as we invite Brother David amen [Music] let go and live let God is Wonder ful way [Music] and let God [Music] [Music] is all thank you Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] your night today [Music] his way [Music] thank you brother Samuel greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a name that is above every name a name that brought life to my soul one day just so happy to be here this morning thank you musicians well I was telling brother Samuel back in the office I don't know where when I've ever walked into a place and just felt like I was at home and I've never been here but we have been together before [Applause] so you're not strangers to me and uh I am not supposed to joke in the Pulpit but I just want to share this with you um you know what folks from I live in Indiana now I'm originally from Elizabethtown Kentucky but I live in Indiana now and you know what folks from Indiana and Ohio call people from Kentucky and West Virginia right Mom and Dad Grandma and Grandpa because we all have Roots there's a little bit of hillbilly in us that's probably why I feel at home I'm you know not insulting you I don't mean it that way but I just feel at home there's there's places that you go you know yeah I've walked into houses and they've told me to take my shoes off before okay I've walked into places and they suggested that I take my shoes off but I just feel like I'm in one of those places this morning where I can just kick my shoes off and I can be at home and uh y'all will understand and I want to uh I want to say thanks to brother Paul this morning for this atmosphere that has been created uh it's amazing to to watch this young man and he was down at our place last weekend and I'm standing at the back of the of the sanctuary with one of the other deacons and he's up there singing a song and uh power of the Holy Spirit fell and I just looked over it at uh the other Deacon that was standing there next to me and I said have you ever seen anybody that was doing exactly what they were supposed to do and that's just how I feel about your brother Paul he's been in my dorm at camp and he survived that and uh I've had him and his brother in my dormant camp and I survived that so uh we're uh we're just happy to be here I'm just getting I'm just getting settled just give me give me a little bit of time here I bring ingredients from brother Nathan and the Saints back home sister Rebecca and all of their family and if we could well we we just like to make the brownings part of our congregation in New Albany that's uh probably not going to happen but when they when they come come to see us it's just we just like we've been acquainted all of our life I do have to share this with you before we go to the word a few years ago at camp I I used to go to the camp in Ohio uh year after year after year and I took a break and during that break they moved from Ohio to Indiana and I had not been to the Indiana camp for probably the first five years that they had it in Indiana so I showed up one year Lord laid it on my heart said you need to be back at Camp I said Lord I'm too old these kids can't relate to me I'm an old guy and they're not going to understand me they're going to laugh at me and all that he said you need to go so I went and so I'm sitting there in the sanctuary that morning and they said we're going to have brother Samuel Browning preach and uh you know I didn't know brother Samuel Browning from anybody you know and I'm looking around trying to figure out which one he was and finally he came in the back door and and uh I think I helped him with some water or a man or a cough drop or something and uh he got up there to preach and I did what you all are doing to me right now you're like who is this guy and where is he from and what's he all about and everything and so uh he took his text and he began to preach and uh after after church I text brother Nathan and I said you need to have Samuel Browning come preach for us and he said who is Samuel Browning I said you don't have to worry about who he is you just need to have him come preach for us and so the next year at Camp he and brother Nathan got to meet each other and uh it's history I also walked out of that same service I was telling him this last night I walked out of that same service and I always call Sister Genie every night after I get the young men settled down and everybody is prove that they're going to be quiet for the rest of the night and I always go outside and text her and or call her rather and uh we talk and so I went outside that night and I said man you should have been here brother Samuel Browning preached and she said who is Samuel Browning I said I can tell you this he's laid before the Lord he's been with Jesus and I don't know if it was the first time that he ever preached but it was one of the first few times I'm sitting there and you know at Camp whenever you're up to a one two o'clock in the morning handling the preacher's kids that you have in your dorm I'm a preacher's kid so I can speak uh sometimes when it gets real nice and quiet in the sanctuary you know you your your mind goes somewhere and so my mind had drifted just a little bit and all of a sudden I heard a man say Elijah was the canvas that God used to paint Elisha a picture of what he looked like folks I can't tell you how that thundered in my soul I come up out of my seat and I'm like wow and ever since then brother Samuel's been one of my favorite preachers he's he's he's probably the favorite but he's definitely in the top three and so to me I stand back there listening to him and I think he got a hold of my notes but I I would like this morning just to tag him and say you're it and let me sit down here and listen but he wouldn't hear to that uh I had determined I was going to sneak in after service started this morning we're supposed to be on vacation and I promised my wife one of the few times in our life that we're going to take a vacation and it doesn't involve preaching because she has seen quite a bit of the United States but it's always been we're on our way to go somewhere and preach and and then we have to get back home for work so we Have No Agenda we have nothing planned after right now and so I was just going to sneak in this morning and brother Samuel was going to be up here taking his text and I was just going to sit back there and enjoy but I started to go to a Brother's church one time and found out that I didn't know the time of the service and I would have showed up and no one would have been there so I thought I'm not going to do that so I asked him the other weekend whenever he was down I said Windows your services and uh being a pastor he picked up on it and he goes when are you coming by I said well I don't know for sure yet he goes well be ready to preach when you come by so anyway aren't you happy in the Lord this morning [Applause] if you'd like to stand with us and turn in your Bibles to Psalms the 34th chapter we'll read a portion of scripture there just good to be in the presence of the Lord to realize that he has already kept his word because he said if we would gather together in his name he would be here and he's definitely here Psalms the 34th chapter very familiar portion of scripture I the adversary was bugging me this morning and telling me that I should went down another path with what the Lord laid on my heart and things and so we're on our way to church and sister Genie starts singing the song that's out of this scripture right here she had she asked me I I don't ever tell her what I'm going to preach on I did give her the title this morning but I didn't tell her any of the background and she started singing out of this Psalm right here and I just said okay devil what about that what about that and then then the sister got up here and sang the special and I'm like okay Lord that's two and then brother Samuel gets a prayer okay Lord there's three Witnesses so I believe that we're in the right channel this morning Psalms 34 says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles let's bow our heads and our hearts to him Lord Jesus we have come into your house this morning Lord and there's one thought on our mind and that's to lift you up and to exalt you Heavenly Father there's no way that we can over exalt you there's no way that we can over emphasize what you've done in our lives but Lord your Prophet told us if we had nothing else to say just tell them how your candle got lit Lord I've watched that around the world every single time that you tell somebody how your candle got that you have an effect in their lives so we're coming this morning Lord not to talk about David Hoover not to talk about brother Branham but to talk about the God that's in David Hoover and the god that's in William Branham and Lord we believe that if we exalt you and if we lift you up if we magnify you that you'll be pleased I just asked now Lord you would take these words that's going to come from my lips Lord that you would just settle them in the hearts of the people you took a stone one day Lord from David's sling and you magnified it you took control of that stone Lord and you killed a giant with it Lord these words that I'm going to say I ask that you would take them even if I stumble around with them and I don't get them all right Lord that you'll take them and settle them in the hearts of the Believers and you'll feed them Lord and whenever we walk from this place Lord we'll be richer we'll be more blessed we'll be closer to you than we were when we walked in because we didn't come to see what anybody was going to wear we didn't come to see how good somebody could preach or how good somebody could sing we came for one purpose Lord we came to lift you up and Lord that's what we want to do when we leave now you have your way in the hearts and the lives of people this morning and we'll give you praise and glory in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated just like to concentrate on the third verse for a few moments this morning and if you'll excuse me in the third verse the Bible says David says through the inspiration o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together if you look up the definition of magnify this morning you'll find according to Merriam-Webster dictionary that it says to extol to laud to cause to be helped in Greater esteem or respect to increase in significance to enlarge in fact or appearance to cause to be held in Greater esteem or respect to increase in significance to enlarge in fact or appearance brother Branham says an attempt meeting in Cleveland Ohio in 1950 a message called it shall be even as it was told me he's praying before he speaks and he says may signs and wonders be done tonight to Magnify Him who we love for we ask it in his name amen in Jonesboro Arkansas in 1953 on a message called we have found him come and see now we've gathered here tonight for no other purpose but to magnify thee and to get Sinners to seek thee and call upon thee while they can that perhaps you may have mercy upon them to save them from sin that's our first motive now for those of you that are like me in the congregation that's the end of the quote but I'm going to tell you his second motive was the healing service that was getting ready to happen because I would be sitting there wondering well that was his first motive what's the second you know so I just answered that for you but to think that the prophet of God stood in Jonesboro Arkansas and if I'm not mistaken Jonesboro is the place I believe it was prior to 53 but Jonesborough is the place where he said now we're going to pray for every sick person here we're not going to leave the platform until everybody is prayed for and he took his meals on the platform and he took a nap on the platform and he got back up and continued the prayer line but to think that a human being stood and said we're not going to stop until every person is prayed for now he did learn a lesson through that but just to think eight days on the platform they say eight days and he prayed until they were all prayed for because there was a burden on his heart but yet in prayer line after prayer line someone would come up and he'd say now I see I see that you're not a Christian if the Lord would touch you 'd want to serve him wouldn't you because his first motive was that Soul amen because even the little boy in Finland I was listening to the testimony about the little boy in Finland that was raised from the dead that little boy in Finland I don't know but he he's probably passed away by now or he will someday okay but the soul that's eternal and that's our concern this morning that's why we're here this morning is to talk to you about your soul I'd like to just title this for the next few moments Larger than Life Larger than Life and my purpose this morning is not to impress you I did not come to impress you I did not come to entertain you you may laugh at some of the things I share with you you may you may think well you know we heard a lot about brother Hoover this morning I I hope that's not the case you'll hear something about my my grandmother you'll hear things about brother Branham but we're not here to lift up myself my grandmother brother Branham we're here to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ and the reason that it's important that you understand that is because we have a tendency we put brother Branham on a pedestal up here okay and he does he he did have a very high office okay but he's not our savior okay he didn't die for you the the blood of brother Branham will not cleanse you and free you from sin okay but he came to magnify God used him as a magnifying glass so that you could look through his life and you could look through testimonies about his life and you could see Jesus in a clear and a bigger way because we cannot make Jesus big enough we don't have the words to describe it we don't have the vocabulary to say how big my God is okay but if I can share a little a little something about what he did in my life then you can be sitting there going through a trial going through a test going through I don't have any idea what you're going through okay you all look like Saints to me you look like everybody here is ready for the Rapture and we could just go right now but also know from experience that there's some there's some people facing some things you have some mountains in your life and I'm here to tell you I serve a God that moves mountains [Applause] I serve a God who heals diseases I serve a God who is still the very same Jesus that he was when he walked to shores of Galilee but as I was testifying to brother Samuel last night the the the service where the Lord filled me with the Holy Ghost the title of the message was a present tense Jesus and brother brother Ed Hunter a senior who was preaching brought it out that I didn't need a Jesus in a manger at that particular moment I didn't need a Jesus walk in the shores of Galilee at that particular time I didn't need even a Jesus that was hanging on the cross at that particular time what I was in need of that morning and what you might be in need of this morning is you need a Jesus that's present tense in your life in your soul right now and Jesus does not have a body on this Earth at the present moment as far as a physical Corporal body he doesn't have any hands he doesn't have any feet on this earth right now in a body like he had on the shores of Galilee but he does have a set of hands right here in this young man he's got feet right here in this brother right here and whenever you get up and you go visit someone in a hospital or someone in a in a assisted living facility or whenever you get up and you go to Walmart or you go to Meyer or wherever you go whenever you go to school Jesus is walking in your shoes Jesus is speaking through your lips you just have to yield to him we have our ideas we have our our our our goals and our ambitions but that Hall has to be laid aside now I'm not telling you not to have goals I'm not telling you not to have hopes and dreams I'm just telling you to make sure that your hopes and your dreams and your goals and your agenda and whatever it is that you're wanting to achieve in life I want I want you to make sure it lines up with God's word because if it's opposite of God's word it's not gonna it's not gonna progress but if it's lined up with the word of God Supernatural things will happen through you you say I'm not a preacher you don't have to be a preacher brother Branham said the housewife the housewife can be used of God to minister and I've seen that happen the factory worker can be used of God to minister you may never walk onto the factory floor with a Bible in your hand and to stand there and take a text and begin to minister but that life one of the I'm off my notes but this is where he's going so I'm going with him all right one of these days when we're standing there at the final judgment and people in Ohio say Lord I never heard nobody ever told me I never went to church you have to exempt me he's going to pick out one of you all maybe one of these young people that's in school maybe one of you folks that that go to work every day and he's going to say would you come here did you ever see this lady right here walking to Walmart did you ever bump into her when you were getting your groceries did you ever wonder why she had that dress on did you ever wonder why she didn't have her hair cut did you ever wonder why that man never told a dirty joke anytime you were around him did you ever wonder why your neighbor disappeared every Sunday morning and was gone for two or three hours well yeah I knew there was something different about him that was my witness that was my testimony to you to Leo to see you that was my testimony that there was a real God amen all right let me see if I can get back here so brother Branham tells us he said you need to find yourself a character in the Bible and you need to you need to model yourself or or pattern your life like that that person did so I have two characters that I love to preach about one is David for obvious reasons my mom got to name all the girls there was three girls before I was born she got to name all the girls dad got to name me and so he named me David Paul and David has always been somebody special to me but I just want to look at it this morning maybe you haven't ever looked at it in this way but David the Bible says he was a ready fellow brother Branham said you know he he wasn't really much to look at I know they have sculptors of him and things like that but he he wasn't uh he wasn't a a model of a man okay he's a little runt his daddy didn't even think he was worth bringing to the to the uh to the anointing ceremony for King nobody looked at him and said now there's the Future King they looked at Saul and they said now that that's a king but they didn't look that way at David but God did so David had heard about Jehovah all of his life he was raised in the right atmosphere he was raised in a home where Jehovah was talked about he'd been taught about Jehovah okay and one day he was out there tending the Sheep minded his own business okay probably staying away from his brother so they wouldn't bully on him and beat him up and things and a lion comes up and supernaturally God Came Upon him and took care of that lion and a little bit later there was a bear now we've all heard that story I'm not going to preach all that story again but I want you to look at it and realize that in David's life he had heard about Jehovah he'd been taught about Jehovah he had even seen Jehovah move in his life but the reason that David had to go through those experiences is because God knew from the beginning when David was just an infant in his mommy's arms God said that's a giant slayer now you might have looked in the mirror this morning I tell people all the time you cannot trust your feelings and your emotions I look in the mirror and I think oh my Lord who in the world but my mom would love me but you see my feelings and emotions lie to me because as soon as I turn away from that mirror and I walk in the room where sister Genie is she goes you are so handsome and I know she wouldn't lie to me [Applause] so don't trust your emotions or your feelings this morning don't trust what man says about you look at what God says and God gave us 66 books plus 1200 tapes of his opinion about us and I want to take what he says and if he says I'm a giant slayer then I'm going to fulfill that promise that's been said about me amen so you may not have a really good family history you may not have the testimony that somebody else has but God has brought you through things up to this point and as I'm I tell sister Jeannie all the time she'll she'll say why are we going through this what have we done which let me just say that's one of the biggest lies that denominations ever put across and unfortunately there's people in the message that still believe this they think when something goes wrong that it's God punishing them God will chastise his children if they get out of line but everything that happens to you is not saying you've been bad I'm turning my love off no God loves me just as much this moment as he's ever loved me and he loves me just as much right now as he will ever love me I can't do anything for God not to love me okay I've got three boys they're all living in the world right now none of them are following Jesus Christ that does not mean I don't love them I'm grieved I'm disappointed but if one of them calls and says Dad I need I'm there I can't turn that love off they're part of me and I'm part of God almighty and therefore when I get in trouble sometimes I get chastised but when I get in trouble when Satan comes to me and starts feeding me his lies I just have to remember that Jesus Christ loves me period and his one Minister came and said and there's nothing you can do about it you can't get him to unlove you I don't know who this is for but somebody's pulling down this pathway okay so David went through experiences to get him prepared to do what God's purpose was in his life and David was setting one day and he remembered some of these things that he had been through is this supposed to be closer or further away closer okay because that's I'm I'm I'm getting feedback on that right there okay I apologize so David is setting one day and he has a pen in hand and inspiration begins to hit and he says these words o magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together David was remembering the experiences that he had come through now just to prove the point I was making just a moment ago David committed a horrible sin we all know that and God put it in the Bible not for us to belittle David or look down on David but y'all are pulling I I can't say with my notes did you ever notice that's looking to see if he had a cross and oh you've got a cross right here you know what this is this is a plus sign think about it this is a plus sign Abraham sinned okay in the Old Testament just stay with me this is going somewhere Abraham sinned but in the New Testament after Calvary Paul testified and said he staggered not at the promises of God through him believed so can I come down here all right so here's your life we'll start your life over here here's your life before Calvary minus minus negative negative negative but you're coming to Calvary someday some of you have already been there some of you are coming to Calvary once you're at Calvary God takes every negative that's ever been in your life and turns it positive for me [Applause] David sinned in the Old Testament no record of it in the in the New Testament Abraham sinned in the Old Testament no record of it in the New Testament in your former life you sinned no record of it in heaven today today no record on it Satan goes before the father to accuse you and God looks at him and says what are you talking about hey I've got video I've got text messages I've got a record of what he said what she said what they did what they said about somebody else and God looks and says that's what my record shows Glory but one day David did come into a place where he had an encounter with Christ and he found out now just think about this bear with me for a minute David found out Jehovah God that he had heard about that he had been taught about he found out Jehovah was larger than life he found out Jehovah was big enough to handle any issue that came up and he testified to Saul and he said the God to help me with the lion the god that helped me with the bear what is this uncircumcised Philistine to him all right my other favorite character is Paul the Apostle I'll take somebody from Old Testament I'll take somebody from the New Testament Saul of Tarsus heard about Jehovah now think about this prior to the Divine the word made flesh okay so there went my legalism that I brought with me from Pentecost okay God I've been a good boy sure you have attaboy that's good has nothing to do with your salvation Oh you mean I can go do anything I want no I didn't say that I didn't excuse sin I didn't say make Grace a disgrace I'm just saying all of your works all of your good deeds doesn't add up to anything if there's not a love behind it if there's not something where you realize Jesus I remember when I was in that state I remember when I was in that condition and light struck my path I've never been the same something changed down on the inside you see I spent 27 years I'm getting ahead of myself but I spent 27 years of my life being the best Pentecostal preacher's kid I could be and I failed I failed because he wasn't interested in another good Pentecostal preacher's kid he wanted me he didn't want my list of achievements he didn't want my list of good works he didn't want all the things that I would want to tell somebody to impress them didn't mean anything to him but when I surrendered and said Lord Jesus I'm in a horrible mess I've made a I've made a mess out of things and I can't get myself out he came on the scene all right let's get back to Paul Saul of Tarsus at the time he was taught he knew the scriptures he knew Moses quotes better than you and I would ever know them he knew him as good as any Pharisee ever knew him just like I told you I've got three boys that are out there you know running from the Lord brother Billy Paul asked me one day he said How's your sons I said they're all on their way to Calvary brother Billy Paul he said don't ever change that testimony brother Hoover don't you ever confess anything other than that so you know these eyes see him going that direction but down inside of here because of the word I see them headed towards Calvary [Applause] they're Hoovers they come by it honest all right it's in their DNA to take the Hard Road okay to go the roundabout way they got to figure it out for themselves they think why would I listen to Dad look at the mistakes he's made why would I listen you know dad all I did was I asked you a question and it turns into a sermon an hour later you know none of y'all can relate to that I understand so Saul Saul had all the knowledge that a man could muster but one day as I was listening to a message and brother random says I can see a man with a cross on his back I hear the Thump Thump Thump Thump as it hits the cobblestones as he goes out the Damascus gate okay so in my way of putting two and two together and coming up with four when Paul won Saul of Tarsus left Jerusalem with letters in his pocket to persecute the church and headed to Damascus he went right past Calvary now I don't know what his opinion of of Calvary was at that time he probably looked over and said yeah that's where they hung that guy that they think is the messiah but I know better I've been taught by Gamel I've I've heard about Jehovah all my life I've got this down I've got this figured out but you see Calvary after Jesus Christ died there Calvary was not a geographical location Calvary is a place where Jesus Christ and you meet and it becomes real to you what happened at Calvary and that it's personal it's not history anymore it's personal it's a live event and Paul little de Paul know that that Pillar of Fire that he had studied he'd examined it from every angle of how Moses encountered that Pillar of Fire And how that Pillar of Fire followed him through the Wilderness and led them and everything he knew all about the the pillar of Fire but he had never met the pillar of fire but one day he encountered Jehovah and with all of his book learning everything that he had Paul looks up from the dust of the Damascus Road and he goes who are you Lord you know the last thing Paul was expecting that Pillar of Fire to say I am Jesus wait a minute Lord wait a minute gamalia said the Pharisees say the scribes and and the and the learning men we all say this no Paul I am Jesus and you have been persecuting me and immediately he said Lord what would you have me to do and of course God had a prescription for him and so he sent Saul of Tarsus down to a street called straight and then this is the amazing thing and this is this is where David Hoover probably struggles the most okay I received Grace one day I'll tell you a little bit about how am I doing on time I received Grace one day and then the adversary comes along and if he can't get me to deny Grace if he can't get me to deny Jesus Christ he'll push me the other way and he'll make me want to be so special that you have to deserve the grace that I got freely because you don't fit my bill of goods you haven't met all the qualifications that I feel like that you should meet and so the Lord speaks to ananias and says I need you to go down here there's a there's a fellow that I've called his name is Saul of Tarsus and I need you to go down and pray for him and ananias initially he says um excuse me Lord I know I received the Holy Ghost I know that you're alive but possibly there's some things that slip by you that you don't know about this guy by the name of solar Tarsus now I know none of you that I'm talking to have ever felt that way about another person but one of the marks of the new of the New Testament the early church Having the Holy Ghost is the fact that when Saul of Tarsus changed his name to Paul when God changed his name to Paul and he comes back and he says God did something in my life brother Samuel could I get up in your pulpit and testify about it brother Samuel let him in the early church they let this guy killed some of their Kinfolk and they brought him to the pulpit and said testify to us brother that takes the Holy Ghost you can't fake that believe me I know because I've been tested on it I'm still being tested on it sometimes that guy that guy I remember him from Pentecost that guy's got the he got a revelation of the message he didn't get it from me because I didn't think he was worth the time yes God can call whoever he wants to and he called Saul of Tarsus and he said he's a chosen vessel because God looked at Saul of Tarsus from the beginning and said that's my first age messenger and no one in Jerusalem had that one figured out no one so counsel all you want to together study it out but it's all in there in that Damascus dust he realized maybe Jehovah is bigger than what I even thought he was maybe he's more glorious than what I thought he was there's a there's a fella in southern Indiana he came he he started dating this girl she was living in sin at the time she wasn't serving the lord but her grandfather was pastor at the Branham Tabernacle years ago so she knew about the truth but she couldn't live it and uh they fell in love and uh she would tell him all these stories testimonies but to him it was stories and uh he would sit there and he'd say Vicky I I don't think that you would lie to me but I just don't think God works like that I I don't think that he's really concerned about my everyday life and the the decisions I make on a daily basis and she tried to convince him but he couldn't understand it so they bought a little piece of property and uh they had a they had a intense discussion one night and they went to bed and she was frustrated because he just wouldn't give his heart to the Lord he didn't he didn't see what she was seeing and he went to bed mad because he felt like she was trying to just push him into it and cram it down his throat and the last thing that he said was it's okay if you want to believe that you go to church you do whatever you want to but I just don't think God act operates that way he doesn't act like that so the next day he goes to work he worked in the Quarry he goes to work well first of all he plowed he had plowed the garden that evening getting ready to plant he had plowed the garden and so the next day he comes home from his job at the Quarry and she had taken the kids somewhere shopping or over somebody's house visiting and it was just him at home and so he walks down to his garden and as he walks down to the Garden he notices in the garden there's a cross of fresh dirt that looked like somebody had just tilled it over that day the rest of the garden in the whole garden plot it was a rectangle and there's fresh dirt real Brown and the rest of it was light tan where the sun had dried it out and he stood there and he looked at it and he said how did that happen because he realized he hadn't put a pattern in the dirt when he plowed the garden the day before he just tilled the whole thing over but there it was right before him and he said as I stood there and looked at it he said a little small voice inside brother Hoover said yes Todd I do work like that and I'm that important I want to be that important in your life I want to be God of the little things as well as the big things he surrendered his heart to Jesus Christ you may not have a garden tilling story you may not have some of these other testimonies but God wants to be real I I don't know which person I'm speaking to this morning but God wants to be that real in your life I don't care if you're the youngest person here or the oldest person here I don't care if you just soak it up and believe everything that you hear about the message or if you're one of those people like from Missouri that say I got to see it to believe it you got to prove it to me God Is that real and he's that interested in every detail of your life so Saul of Tarsus found out that Jehovah was magnified in Jesus Christ think about this before he met Jesus Christ on the Damascus Road he is a Pharisee of the Pharisees as touching the law he was lacking nothing now turn in your Bibles with me if you would to First Corinthians second chapter and let's see what the most learned man of that day had to say after he met Jesus on the Damascus Road in the pillar of Fire he says and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness Pharisee of the Pharisees doesn't sound weak does it I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God what a contrast what a contrast my dad always say always would say God knocked Paul off of his high horse that day and brought him down to Damascus dust to let him know Paul without me you're nothing so that brings us to another character and I'm going to ask you for the next few moments if you'll just forgive any personal pronouns but I just want to relate to you what Jesus Christ did for me because the same Jesus Christ that lives and beats inside of this breast right here wants to do that in your life this is not anything new I didn't come to bring you some new revelation okay I didn't come to tell you something that brother Samuel's not preached to you before I just come to magnify Jesus Christ [Applause] to let you know he wants to be large Larger than Life David David thought that he was doing everything that he was supposed to do out there taking care of the sheep but God had a larger agenda he had a larger purpose in David's life and he got that through to David Paul had an agenda but God had a bigger purpose I think it was you did you but he or brother Jack this week said something that had never realized talking about Esther that Queen was not the highest office that God had for Esther in the natural life in the Kingdom Esther was as high as a woman could go but she wasn't done yet God had a higher calling for her he wanted her to be a savior of her people so David was content to be a Shepherd boy but God said no there's something else I need for you there's something else I've got planned for you David I don't know what he's got planned for you I just came to Sheffield this morning to tell you whatever you're trying to do through your efforts whatever you're trying to achieve outside of Jesus Christ that's all well and good but God's Got A Higher Calling he's got a higher purpose in your life he's got he's got a reality that maybe you haven't even experienced yet but he's here to tell you this morning open your eyes listen I've got something bigger I've got something larger than what your life will ever amount to that I want to do in you so with that let me just share as much of this as I can in the time that I have one of the earliest memories I have is waking up on the back pew in a Pentecostal Church in Elizabethtown Kentucky and we were in a fellowship meeting with a black congregation because we were in the South they had their church we had our church and there's a reason I'm saying that just don't judge me on that yet and I remember they were having a victory march and the tambourine was going but what woke me up was the black brother that had the saxophone that come in the victory march he played the saxophone in the middle of the victory march he didn't stay up on the platform and right about the time that he got to the Pew that I was asleep on he was anointed to play it in a very loud Manner and I come awake and people's dancing and being slain in the spirit around me so what I'm telling you that for is because from the time I can remember anything it was church now I was born December the 23rd 1957. and uh you give me the signal if I go too long to you on this I was born December the 23rd 1957. I was I was the fourth of four children three girls and I was the only boy and I was mistreated by my sisters all my life no all my life if if my father was still living and he was here this morning and he was in the Pulpit at some time during his ministering this morning he would say David Paul stand up and I would stand up and everybody would look at me and I wanted to shrink I was I was an introvert okay I was very shy I had buck teeth all my life and then when I was in like the fourth grade I got glasses so then I became the buck tooth you know four-eyed kid in the class my mom put me in school before I turned five because the law said if I was going to turn five by the end of the year I could I could be enrolled in school so I wasn't even five years old when I first started school in August that year so I was always the youngest and the smallest boy in the class but back to my birth a few months actually a few weeks after I was born actually my mom had to lay in the bed on her back for the last six months of her pregnancy with me to keep from excuse me to keep from losing me so my ten-year-old sister at the time did all the laundry did all the cooking did all the dishes did everything so that my mom wouldn't lose me so whenever I came into the world as my sisters like to say David was special okay but Mom noticed a few weeks after I was born that when she went to change my diaper she would take you know grab me around the ankles and she would lift me to change my diaper but I did not Bend at the knees and that nor did I bend at the waist okay my body was mostly stiff she also noticed that whenever she moved her hand back and forth in front of my face or whenever there was any loud noise or anything I didn't react to it and so she took me to the doctor and the old country doctor that for years took payment and eggs and chickens and hams and things like that he said Lenora you've worried about this kid for the last six months take him home and enjoy him there's nothing wrong with him and she said Doctor I believe that there is something wrong and she explained to him what was going on he said Lenora your paranoid take him home and enjoy him well I didn't get any better so she kept going back to him and so when I was about four months four or five months old he said look I'm going to send you to a specialist in Louisville and I'm just I'm doing this just to give you peace of mind and shut you up and you know she'd known him all of his life and and all her life and so you know he could speak to her in that way and he wasn't being rude or anything he was trying to get her to quit being afraid of things and so she took me to the specialist in Louisville and two weeks later she had an appointment with the old country doctor again Dr brought her in the office and sat down and he said Lenore you're not going to like what I'm going to tell you but I've always told you the truth and I'm going to tell you the truth today your son has muscular dystrophy he will never walk he will never talk probably he will never run or play he also has a goiter in his throat that right now is the size of a full-grown man's Adam apple and if he's not operated on by the time that he's nine months old he will choke to death which is probably going to be the best thing that can happen to him I can imagine you can imagine a mom hearing this he said also when we did the break when they did the brain scan on him he has spots on his brain that have not that had did not develop in your womb and so he's never going to know you as mom he's never going to be able to give you love and things like that and he'll probably live at the very most until he's 12 years old or so and then he'll pass away which will be the the grace of God in your life well obviously my mom was shaken by that she comes home and she tells my dad and my dad said what any Pentecostal pastor full of the Holy Ghost should have said he said that's a lie and we're not going to believe that we're going to believe that he's healed and so from that point forward again I'm four or five months old at the time from that point forward every single service visiting Minister my dad preaching no matter what at the end of the service David Paul was taken forward and anointed and prayed for and nothing changed and a visiting Minister come into town one night and he got up to preach and he preached on I'm looking for someone to believe and he just kept repeating that time and time again until at the end of the service he was like he had invaded into a little song and he was singing I'm looking for someone to believe and so Mom says that the Holy Spirit told her take David Paul forward and she said Lord I've taken him so many times the people are worn out with it they're sick and tired of this kid being prayed for and he said I said taking forward and that continued and the preacher kept on singing and after a few minutes mom said Lord I'm getting ready to step out we was in a little storefront building just would probably see maybe 50 people in there she said Lord I'm going up there I'm going to have this this brother pray for him but you're gonna have to help me I need something to Anchor my faith to I know it's not an all in signs and wonders but I need to see something to prove to me that I can tie my face to and so she comes forward and as she comes forward the preacher comes down out of the pulpit holds his hands out like this and she lays me over into the preacher's hands and the minute that I'm leading to the preacher's hands she saw me swallow and the goiter disappeared now that was in May of 1958 the next morning my family had a two-week vacation and they went from Kentucky to Florida and back to that point I had never been able to hold anything on my stomach except for apple soup applesauce and fruit juice my mother's milk any other milk I threw it up immediately so they took off no interstates in those days so they took off to Florida and every little town that they would come to whenever they got hungry and they would stop my mom would buy whatever brand of milk was sold in that town and all the way to Florida and all the way back home I drink every brand of milk that she could buy and never threw up a bit of it now whenever whenever the doctor in Louisville examined me I weighed an ounce less than I did when I was born in December and Mom said that my ankles and my wrist were just a barely a little bit bigger than what her thumb was around they got back from Florida on that two-week vacation and the neighbor lady across the street that helped my mom with me because my mom was really stressed because of this child that she had she comes over to welcome the family back home and I'm laying on the couch while they're unpacking and getting everything out of the car and Mrs Hall looks at that looks at me laying on a couch and says who's this baby here and Mom says that's David Paul she goes that's not David Paul David Paul's sick mom said not anymore Jesus healed him foreign six weeks later my grandfather on my mom's side passed away and my mom went to buy an outfit for me to wear to the to the funeral service and she had to get a size 18 month old outfit for a six-month-old so that it would fit around my wrist and my and my ankles because I had gained that much weight that's a story it's not a made-up story it's the truth it's a testimony but to me from a time that I was old enough to hear my dad say David Paul stand up for years I hated my dad doing that because invariably after church when I walked outside one of the grandmas would drive me and say you're so cute you're a little miracle baby I didn't like that brother Samuel I didn't like the fact that the kids would you know we'd I go out to run and play with the kids after service and they go are you a miracle baby you know kids can be cruel but anyway so I grew to resent that and it was just a story so my grandmother as brother Samuel told you she was hired in I guess it would have been late 54 early 55 she was introduced to brother Branham by brother and sister Beeler and brother Branham was looking for a nanny he had the two girls at home and he wanted his sister Branham to travel with him and so they were looking for a nanny so he he interviewed my grandmother and hired her right on the spot in his brother Samuel told you brother Brown says on the tapes this is this is something that really means something to me when I when I listened to the message brother Branham says if I was to hire myself out to a man the first thing I would do is I would go to him and I would say what's expected of me and so when he hired my grandmother he walked her through every room of the house and he said in this room this is where we do this this is what I expect you to do one of the things was if the phone rings I expect you to get to the phone before I can get to it because you have to be a buffer it wasn't that he didn't want to be in contact with the people but he had to limit him himself because of the strain of the people if someone knocks on the door you need to get to the door before I have to go get it and then you come and tell myself or sister Branham who's at the door and things like that and so she did that incidentally I think I've told Brother Samuel this one day well let me finish that first so he walks her through the house and then as brother Samuel told you very accurately brother Branham obligated my grandmother to keep his word to a group of hornets that's how much his word meant he wasn't playing he wasn't trying to build some Ministry or or build a kingdom or anything he was simply serving God every single day of his life and he helped my grandmother in obligation to his words to a group of hornets now that might not mean anything to you but to me I can pick up a book a spoken word book or I can play a tape and those words carry value because I realize how much value they meant to brother Branham all right so back to the back to the front door of the Branham home so brother Branham goes to Chicago to a meeting and he gets to Chicago and the brother comes to him the man that organized the meeting he comes to him and he says brother Branham I got I I got something I got to tell you he said there's some ministers here and they have a check I've seen the check they have a check and it's going to sponsor our next meeting president said well that's wonderful brother he said there's just one thing these brothers are trinitarian and they don't want to hear anything about Jesus name baptism he said you got to promise me you will not mention Jesus name baptism in the Pulpit tonight brother Brown said I can't do that brother he said brother Branham you don't understand the check is in their pocket and if you mention Jesus name it's off just don't go down that road about Jesus name tonight brother Birmingham said brother I cannot do that it's not in my notes but if the Holy Spirit takes me that direction I'm doing what he says and the brother looks at brother Branham and says I'm sorry brother Branham I cannot let you in the Pulpit tonight and he turns and he goes out to the platform brother Branham is standing behind the curtain and the brother walks up to the microphone and says we regret to inform you that brother Branham will not be here to minister tonight his brother doc Branham is Gravely ill in Jeffersonville and he's had to return to Jeffersonville there's a bald light bald-faced lie and they put another man in the pulpit and he preaches and brother Branham and brother Billy Paul come back to Jeffersonville after the service well brother Branham relates to Sister meaty and my grandmother what took place and by the way I told that testimony for years and the first time I told it to brother Nathan Bryant he goes brother Hoover I said what you know I thought he was going to prove me wrong or something he said you realize what brother Branham did there I said what he said all he had to do was pull that curtain back and expose that man but the character of Christ couldn't do that that's pretty impressive right there but the rest of the story is about four weeks three or four weeks later that man from Chicago knocks on the front door of the Branham home and my grandmother doing her Duty goes to the front door and opens it and there stands brother so and so on the front porch of the home and my grandmother was raised in the south okay and I know that some of you all were not originally from Ohio so you'll probably understand this you didn't leave somebody standing at your front door in the South you invite them in okay you make them feel at home like brother Samuel did for sister Jeannie and I yesterday all right granny leaves him standing on the front porch and goes and and she finds sister random and she says brother so and so standing at the front door and sister Branham said I'll tell Bill and she goes to brother Branham and she says bill brother so and so is at the front door and brother Branham says bring amen and so they go get him and they bring him in and they set him down and he and brother Branham are talking and in the middle of them talking sister Mita walks by and he says meet him aren't you going to offer the brother anything to eat or drink while he's here he's a guest in our home and so she goes and gets him something to eat and she goes and gets him a drink and she brings it back and she serves it to him and he and brother Branham finished their conversation and they plan another meeting now I tell you this because I want you to understand what the Holy Ghost can do I know I have the Holy Ghost and I love brother Samuel but if brother Samuel had come to me back there and said look I need to see your notes I want to make sure you're not going to cover anything controversial today and by all means stay off this subject because there's somebody in the congregation that's battling that right now I probably wouldn't feel comfortable ever preaching for brother Samuel again okay just I'm being transparent for the random plans of meeting with him stands up hugs the brother's neck and says I believe this is going to be one of the greatest meetings we've ever had brother I'm looking forward to it with all my heart walks the brother out to his vehicle in the driveway waves goodbye to him comes back in the house and these are my grandmother's words and sister Branham is standing there when he comes through the door and she's got both hands on her hips like this and she says Bill Branham after what that man did to you and your ministry in Chicago and you bring him in our house serving our food and our drinks and plan another meeting with him and my grandmother heard brother Branham look at his wife and say meaty if God don't hold it against him neither can I [Applause] I'll just put this in I told him that this when we did the tour I want my Holy Ghost to do that and I'm going to be honest enough with you to let you know sometimes it doesn't go that far but he's still working on it so sister Brandon came to my grandmother one day and she said sister Hoover I I hate to ask this but I need you to do me a favor and my grandmother said whatever sister Branham you know what am I doing that's not pleased she said it's not that she said I need you to eat in the kitchen and my grandmother said well I'll I'll be happy if that's if that's what you need but is there something I've done wrong that makes you she said no it's not anything you've done wrong sister Hoover she said but when we're sitting at the kitchen table and the kids are getting ready to go to school that's their only time for Bill to be dead to him and she said I know that you don't mean anything by it but you asked Bill a question and the next thing we know we're in church and she said if you just let the kids have time with him as Dad that would really be nice and my grandmother said that they would all gather at the table before she moved to the kitchen they would all gather at the table and breakfast would be there and they'd bow their heads for prayer now my grandmother was old time Pentecost okay she had she had the real stuff okay she had a real experience with Jesus Christ and there was no put on to my grandmother okay she said they would bow their heads and brother Branham would say Lord Jesus and she said it would be like there'd just be a dump of the Holy Spirit come into that dining room around that table and her way again her words but she said it was like when he said Lord Jesus the Lord said what is it he would come down present what do you need what can I do for you and my grandmother would get the holy spirit all over her and she'd began to shout and then she would want to ask some question about the scripture or something like that and so she had to move into the kitchen so that the family could have family time so brother Branham would come home brother random would come home from meetings and he would testify to him that he would say there was a there was a man that came in the prayer line and he had a cancer on his jaw he said it was probably big as a softball and he said and this is important for you to understand granny said he always talked about the prayer line in the third person it was never I said I did it was always and the Lord Jesus spoke to him and the Lord Jesus healed him and he would talk about that cancer falling off the man's face and laying on the floor at his feet and he would testify and then he would lock himself in the bathroom and he would fight those demons Billy Paul tells a testimony about how he used to have to drive his dad around the hills of Southern Indiana and he said he would be driving him around and he would still be saying Lord touch my brother Lord Lord Heal my sister and brother Billy would have to drive him around until he come down out of that that fog of the Holy Spirit so he would be fighting those demons and granny said he would be in the bathroom sometimes a day or two now eight-year-old David Hoover thinks if my dad locks himself in a bathroom for two days there's going to be some issues you know I don't know if they went to the to brother Banks religious house I don't know what they did for a bathroom for you know I don't know if there was another bathroom in the house or not I don't know but this man locked himself in a bathroom for a day or two fighting those demons and granny said finally the door to the bathroom would open and he would stick his head out and he would say meaty get the kids in the car I think we need to take a little Drive and so they would all load up in the car brother Branham Joseph at the time just a just a kid Sister Branham my grandmother and the two girls in the back seat and they would take off driving around southern Indiana well we have what we call knobs in Southern Indiana you've heard brother Branham explain it on the tape and so I know where the beelers lived and for the Branham used to love to take my grandmother out to The Beatles and he and brother Beeler would fellowship and Granny would fellowship and it it got his mind off of things and he was able to to uh come come back to being a being a human being and uh so again my grandmother in the back seat will begin to talk to brother Branham and ask questions and she said he would begin to talk to him and he would answer her questions but she said she's not the only person that's ever testified that it felt like this but her words were it felt like that Moses and and David and Elijah and Paul the Apostle and Peter and John was in the car with you as he's explaining the scriptures to him incidentally there was a there was a black brother from Baltimore that somebody played him the tape where brother Branham has explained what it was like at the tent door when he came in when Elohim came and visited Abraham and this this black brother looked at the brother that was playing the tape for him and he said you know for the randoms just preaching away and this brother says Google God Almighty was that man sitting there and uh the brother that was playing the tape for him says no he wasn't but the one Speaking was [Applause] so granny said that you know the Holy Spirit would fill the car and again she'd begin to shout and praise the Lord and have what she called a holy ghost fit and she said I would come out from under that Holy Ghost fit and brother branham's in the driver's seat of the car and these young men have experienced some of those roads down there in Southern Indiana brother Samuel has they twist and they go back and forth and up and down over those knobs and everything and granny said brother branham's in the front seat both hands in the air knees not touching the steering wheel and the car is going around the road and he's singing It's dripping with blood it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is driven with blood [Applause] one one last one about granny I think it's the last one a man came to the door one day granny didn't get to the door brother Branham answered the door the minute brother Branham answered the door the man fell on his knees and begin to worship brother Branham and he said words that were true he said brother random God has shown me that you are Elijah the prophet in this day and I've come to acknowledge that and he truly began to worship brother Branham Grant he said brother Branham reached out and grabbed the man by the lapels and pulled him to his feet and shook him and he said brother don't do that Worship the Lord Jesus only rebuke the man and send him on his way granny watch brother Branham walk from his front door into the den fall down at his chair and she heard him say Lord Jesus don't hold that against my brother I don't know what he's seen or heard that would make him do that but Lord I did what I was supposed to do I told him to worship you and you alone don't lay that to his charge so one day Genie and I were newly married and we didn't have a washer and dryer and so she would go up to my mom and dad's house and she would do her laundry up there and Granny lived with my mom and dad at the time and so granny had the ability to get on your nerves and so Jeannie walks in the room one day after doing laundry and Granny has my socks and my underwear and she's selling a red thread on every piece of clothing that Jeannie had just done the laundry on and Genie said in her sweet voice Janie says what are you doing that's David's clothes she goes I know they are because they just came out of the dryer but LG my dad LG has been missing some things and I'm just making sure you only take David's stuff back home with you and none of LG's stuff well my wife came home I came home that night from work and my wife was perturbed and so she explained to me in a nice way that I needed to talk to my dad about my grandmother's Behavior and so I did myself my sister because there was been an incident with her and her husband we all sat down with Dad and we explained to him how things needed to be done well dad the next time I was at the house I guess Dad figured he needed a witness so he set my grandmother down on the couch in front of me and he said now Mom there's some things that's come to my attention and I need to make sure what you and that you understand how things need to be and he rebuked her and she got up from her chair and she walked into her bedroom and closed the door and she was in there for pretty much the remainder of the day so after I come to the Lord I'm sitting listening to brother Hunter preach one day and he said you understand it had to be the Holy Ghost and Stephen because he repeated Jesus's words from the cross and he knew that his record was clear with Jesus Christ and that there was nothing that would stick because of the blood and so he said to those people about those people that were stolen him Lord don't put it on their account lay it over on my account because I know everything's okay between me and you and his brother Hunter is preaching the Holy Spirit spoke and said that's exactly what your grandmother did in her bedroom that day she went in there knelt down to me and she said don't charge this to the grandkids Lord I've seen a reality of what you are in a person's life and I know my record's clear so just take what the kids are saying and lay it over on me okay I'm gonna try to hurry with this last part so I heard about Jesus Christ I was taught about Jesus Christ my dad was a preacher my mom was a Sunday school teacher my oldest sister was a Sunday school teacher I knew all about Jesus Christ I could beat you at a Bible sword drill okay I could finish the scripture whenever Dad started saying it I knew all this stuff but when I got to be a teenager for obvious reasons to some of you I got smarter than Dad and I decided I didn't need to live under his rules and his regulations and all that and so I moved out of the house and I began to live my life because everything I've told you up to this point about my healing about granny to the 27 year old David Hoover they were stories you understand what I'm saying they were just stories so January this well I'm sitting in a Pentecostal church and the pastor gets up one morning and he's preaching away and all of a sudden I still to this day I don't remember exactly what it was preaching on but I know what he got ready what he said next had nothing to do with what his message was okay now I'm sitting in this Pentecostal church I'm a youth leader and this next part's not going to be real easy for me to say but just wait until you hear the end of the story before you judge me I'm a Pentecostal youth leader and I knew by my reading of the scripture the tongues was not the evidence I'd been taught that by my dad because my dad never believed that tongues was the evidence but I wasn't going to take my dad's word for it I was gonna I was gonna be my own guy and I was going to believe what I believed but I knew tongues was not the evidence and so I was uncomfortable when young people came to the Altar and everybody gathered around them and tried to pray them through the tongues I couldn't pray that prayer and so I started every service I was on the altar sister Genie said what's going on I said I I don't want to talk about it but I get down at this altar brother Samuel and I would pray and I'd say Lord I need more of you and that still Small Voice that has never led me wrong in my entire life would speak back to me and say you're not living everything you know when you live what you do know I'll show you more and somehow in my Pentecostal mind I knew he was referring to brother branham's Ministry and those stories that I'd heard on my life because my father even though he never realized that brother Branham was Malachi 4 5 fulfilled he did say I saw more of God in that man than any other man I've ever met in my life that's a pretty good testimony so I knew that there was something to this so I'm down at the altar and the answer comes back live what I've shown you I'll open up more to you and so I struggled with that I went to my Pentecostal pastor and I told him I said there there's something more there's something missing in my life and he said you've spoken tongues yes you shouted and run the owls in my church yes you're a youth leader you've been ministering for me yes what is it that you need only way I knew to put it was Paul had a Damascus Road experience yes he did I haven't had one oh well Brother David everybody's experience is not the same so then I I said well the only thing I know to say to you brother Slattery is I need a guarantee between me and Jesus Christ that everything's okay he said what do you mean a guarantee I don't understand that you've done everything that you're supposed to do you've repented you've been baptized you've been filled with the Holy Ghost da da what I didn't tell my Pentecostal pastor was as a youth leader in his church fill in his Pulpit at least every other week that I was bound by a spirit of lust I was addicted to pornography I did not tell him that I was bound by a racist spirit and I hated a man just because of the color of his skin and if I could tell a nasty joke about a man that was Black Or Hispanic I enjoyed it even more and third thing was I had a spirit agreed upon me that if you had a dollar in your pocket I was in sales I was going to figure out a way to get that dollar out of your pocket lie cheat still whatever and I'm a youth leader and so my Pentecostal Pastor said I don't know what to do for you you're frustrating me you're frustrating yourself so I went to my dad I told my dad I need a guarantee he said what do you mean I said Paul had a Damascus Road experience I haven't had that type of experience I want that experience with Jesus Christ I want him to guarantee me everything's clear the record's clean my dad said don't ever stop son until you get what you're looking for it's for you so I was seeking the Lord and the Pentecostal pastor his daughter was living in a homosexual relationship and outside the church and we had a Revival and she comes in one night of the Revival with her partner and she listens for the whole service and at the end of the service they gave an altar call and she hits the altar over on this side and within about three minutes she is speaking in tongues and everybody in the church is shouting and praising the Lord and having a Hallelujah time and something inside of me said you need to watch the life that she's going to live from this point forward she went home with her homosexual partner they continued to live together and the next service that she come to church she was the youth choir director and was teaching our young people a new song that they were going to sing and the song that they got up and sang there's a there was a worldly song at that time that said these words celebrate Good Time come on there's a party going on tonight and she changed those words just a little bit celebrate Good Times come on there's a service going on tonight now two of our brothers in the church had just done an expose on rock and roll music and the devil got so mad at him that he nearly split their marriages and they're sitting there watching young people that they've taught about the evil of rock and roll and country music and those kids are up there swaying to a rock and roll song and singing and so my righteous indignation I went to my Pentecostal Pastor after service and I said um isn't your daughter still living with her partner he said yes I said and wasn't that a rock and roll song that she just led the children in tonight and he said she changed the words it's a worship song I said brother something's not right here the Holy Ghost doesn't live in a homosexual relationship and the Holy Ghost doesn't sing rock and roll music and he goes she's my daughter you her yourself speaking tongues at the altar she has the Holy Ghost and she's gonna she's gonna lead our youth and we said we're not going to go to that church anymore and about that time was when I got introduced to a man by the name of Ed Hunter Jr and I'm going to shorten this down real quick we went to service brother hunter gets up and preaches and he preaches on a present tense Jesus I told Brother Hunter about the guarantee what I was looking for and brother Hunter got a crooked little finger because it was broken way back when and he put that crooked finger in my face just like that and he said young man what you need is the Holy Ghost well my initial reaction was I got the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues I've run the house I've shouted I got the Holy Ghost but then he handed me a tape one day called thinking man's filter and I put that tape in because I wanted to hear about this man that he was calling a prophet even though I didn't know that he I didn't actually think that he was Malachi 4 5 at the time you know I was going to study and show him how that they were wrong on that so I put the tape in and I'm going down the highway one day and brother Branham says and any man that will look upon a woman with painted lips short shorts and doesn't condemn her and say that's a Jezebel spirit he needs a trip to the altar himself and I turned the tape off and I said to myself I didn't say it out loud there wasn't anybody in the car to say it to but I said in my heart you're an old man brother Branham I'm 27 years old and they look good to me I went on with my business that day I got ready to go home I put the tape back in and it had backed up a little bit and brother Branham says any man I knew what was coming next and I'm like I'm I'm at least going to hear him out needs a trip to the altar and some little Ricky come up to me outside the Tabernacle the other night and said brother Branham I'm a young man you're old of course you'd think that way but I'm young I still think they look pretty he said I looked at him and said young man when I was your age I thought they had a Jezebel spirit I pulled that tape out of that tape player I looked at it now I was I was struggling with was he a prophet or was he not a prophet I looked at that tape and that still small voice inside said How could a man in 1963 know what you were going to think in 1984 and put it on a tape for you I said a man couldn't do that this is probably a prophet so I go to church and brother Hunter comes out and he's preaching the Lord moved in a supernatural way in the morning service he comes back into evening service which was not his usual mannerism and he says I didn't get done this morning and then he stops and he said excuse me he didn't get done there's someone here tonight that needs a present tense Jesus in their life and he reiterated what he had preached that morning you don't need Jesus in a manger you don't need Jesus on the shores of Galilee you don't need Jesus even hanging on a cross you need the resurrected Jesus living inside of you brother Hunter stayed up on the pulpit and preached I'm sitting about where my wife is sitting right here but a being a real live being unseen came down that aisle stopped at my Pew and stood between me I was standing by that time stood between me and that Pew in front of me there wasn't room for a being there but there was a being there and in the presence of Jesus Christ who I recognized it was him in the presence of Jesus Christ I repented I'd been baptized I began to confess everything I'd ever done wrong I felt like it took me an hour and a half I talked to him I told him everything I told him every lie I told him when I was a kid I told him everything I'd ever stolen I told him every evil thought I'd ever had I told him everything and at the end of me I was spent by the time I got done by the time I got done talking to him come here Paul please we're standing this close me and the Lord stand in this close I didn't see him but I knew that he was there and when I got finished I felt two arms wrap around me and hug me up like this and he said thank you you can be seated he said I already knew all that you're mine I come to claim you I am going to live inside of you thank you and the devil immediately said your wife is going to divorce you over this she will not follow you into this cult and I heard myself say brother Samuel my wife can divorce me and leave me tomorrow but I have to have you Lord he said your mom and dad's going to disown you they're not going to agree with this I said my mom and dad can disown me I don't care if I have any inheritance ever but I'm not leaving this building until I have you in here he said your boss is going to call you a kook and he's going to fire you because he doesn't want a weirdo working for him I said if I'm on the street begging for food I've got to have you Lord I'm not leaving this place without you and that being that was standing in front of me moved inside now my recollection at that point is I slammed back into my seat where I was sitting and I kicked and I screamed and I squawed and I praised the Lord because I had never felt that glorious in my life and for a good 45 minutes I just shouted and praised the Lord so we leave the service that night we go home we're getting ready for bed I'm laying down on the bed she comes out of the restroom or the bathroom and she says that was certainly a good service tonight I said yes it was and I looked at her and I said I got my guarantee and she looks at me and she goes you what because I told her I was looking for a guarantee she said you what I said didn't you see me I got my guarantee tonight she said really I said yeah I kicked I screamed I I the whole church had to have heard me she said no David you just sat there in the Pew and cried I said oh no oh no don't don't still don't steal my my experience I kicked I screamed I shouted I cried I glorified God she goes no baby you just sit there and cry so the next Tuesday that was on a Sunday night the next Tuesday I had to go to Indianapolis my business and I'm driving down the road and I put thinking man's filter back in now again I can't explain to you how it backed up but when I put it in the first words I heard was any man looks upon a woman lust after in his heart and something down inside said Amen brother Brown amen that's the truth [Applause] that after or that morning I'm in Indianapolis a place called Castleton Mall you know how malls have wings you know with the storage down different Wings I'm walking down I had to buy some office supplies I'm walking down this Wing getting ready to turn into this Wing where the office supply place was and two young ladies now this is January the 8th 1985. it was not above freezing that day I can I don't know the exact temperature but I know it was not above freezing that day and two young women come walking around the corner of that store on from One Wing to the next wing and they had halter tops on and short shorts and as soon as they come around the corner and I looked at them where the week before I would have undressed them with my eyes when they come around that corner I thought oh my goodness don't they know they've got a Jezebel spirit on them Lord help them and I stopped in the middle of Castleton Mall I threw both hands up in the air and I said God David Hoover doesn't think like that you've done something real down inside of me the next Sunday brother George Martin from South Africa was our special speaker now again you bear with me I'm just being transparent brother George Martin preached himself into a as my grandmother used to say he preached himself into a dither his shirt was soaked his tie was soaked his suit coat was soaked from sweating he preached so hard now I grew up with a bunch of Southern self-righteousness I was prejudiced I'm telling you only for the glory of God I hated people that were black I hated Hispanic people in my store that I ran if there was a white person shopping in my store and a black person came in I would leave that white person even though it was probably a guaranteed sale and I would go watch that black person and I trained my my sales people to do that I'm ashamed of that but I'm trying to show you what Jesus Christ can do what happens when you meet him and so I used to play basketball I wasn't ever any good at it but I loved to play basketball and I didn't like to play when there was black Brothers on the black men on the court because they get to sweating and I didn't want to be around them so that evening after service brother George is still in his sweaty suit clothes suit coat and his shirt and everything and brother Hunter comes to me and the vest will be on and says would you like to meet Brother Martin I said sure he said follow me and you had to go out of the vestibule and down the side and into the back room of the of the church and so he's leading me down through there and I walk in the door and brother George Martin steps out of the pastor's office and he's standing there soaked with sweat and he holds his hand out to me and he says God bless you brother and I grabbed that man like this and I hugged him up to me and I said God bless you brother that was a wonderful message that helped me so much and as soon as I hug that black man up to me something said you have never hugged a black person in your life what are you doing and I realized that Jesus Christ had set me free and to this day if somebody speaks about a person because of their race there's something that rises up in me and I go excuse me but we don't talk about my brothers and sisters like that and since that day I don't have a single experience to tell you about the greed but since that day I've had all kinds I've been in sales all my life I've not had a man I've worked for myself now the Lord made it where sister Genie and I own our own insurance agency but up until the time that I own my own agency I always had a sales manager always somebody that owned the company and every single job I've ever been on since January the 6th 1985 I've been called into the office and sat down at the manager's desk and I've heard these words David you you just frustrate me what do you mean what am I doing wrong you have opportunity after opportunity after opportunity if if I could just get the fire in your belly the way the the abilities that you have and the skills that you have you should be a millionaire and you let sail after sell after sale go by I don't understand you and I heard that so many times finally I looked at the one manager and I said you don't remember what happened on January the 6th 1985 he goes what in the world happened let me let me help you fix it I said I don't want it fixed I said up until that day I was as greedy as anybody out there and I would go for the jugular every time but since that day I can't do that to somebody there's something down inside of me that says make sure the other guy gets as good a deal as you're getting so let me wrap this up who am I talking to this morning who's he talking to this morning perhaps you've heard about Jesus perhaps you've set in Sunday school all your life and you've been taught about Jesus but I want to ask you a question this morning not because of what David Hoover has been through or anything but have you really encountered Jesus Christ have you met the one I met and has he become as real to you to where it's no longer stories you see now I understand why he touched me when I was just an infant I had no faith brother Samuel I had no good deed to bring to him I had nothing I could lay at his feet and say God I'm going to be a good boy and so I deserve this healing nothing but he healed me he healed me for a purpose he healed me for a reason perhaps it's for that person that's sitting here listening this morning let me just ask you something what's life thrown at you all right what is it that you're facing what mountain are you facing this morning what is it that you can't overcome you see I tried to get free of the lust I tried to get rid of the racism I tried to get rid of the greed I turned leaves I turn leaves I turn leaves every year I'd make a resolution on New Year's I'm not going to do that anymore and the next week I'd be right back in the in the muck in the mire but when I met him he changed me from the inside out and that's what he wants to do for you this morning where's your life taking you stop for a moment young person middle-aged person older person just stop for a moment and answer this question to him not to me that road that you're on right now those secrets that Mom and Dad don't know anything about those websites that you go to that you know you shouldn't go to but yet something compels you and forces you to go to them where's that road going to lead to where are you going to wind up at Jesus Christ cares enough about you that he sent me a little Old Kentucky preacher's kid that never deserved anything but yet he did something in my life he sent me on my vacation wouldn't let your pastor take no for an answer so that I could testify to you this morning because he is knocking at your heart's door and trying to wake you up and make you realize if I would do it for David Hoover I'd surely do it for you I'm here to testify this morning that Jesus is larger than life I had a life I had a plan I had ambitions but I found out Jesus is larger than that his plan brother Paul for my life was so much beyond what I could ever dream or what I could ever think what's he wanting to do in your life if you'll just yield to him musicians come I'm finishing up you see Jesus Christ is larger than your opinion he's larger than your idea of how things should be he's larger than your situation oh brother Hoover I hear it so many times brother Hoover you don't know my situation I don't need to know your situation I just need you to meet Jesus Christ the same one that I met because he is larger than that situation that you're going through he's larger than your failures he's larger than your hopes and dreams he's larger than your attempt at self-righteousness the Bible says in Matthew the fifth chapter and the 20th verse Jesus speaking said accept your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees you will in no wise enter the kingdom of God brother Hoover I was raised in this church this is the only church I've ever known president Samuel Browning is my pastor I believe God sent a prophet I believe that there's a message but can you live it and the answer to that question is no you can't but he can through you so all of your attempts all of your trying and pushing [Music] my God's larger than your hurts I don't know what scars you're bearing in your spirit I just know he's bigger I know he's greater [Music] he's larger than your doctrines he's larger than you're proven that you could do it on your own Jesus Christ wants to be larger than your life but the prophet of God says in a prayer one day he said God I thank you that you have always worked through human instrumentality you always do I don't know what that means to you but in trying to be very brief and getting close this brother over here he is going to encounter people that I never encounter [Music] and God wants to use that human instrument right there [Music] these instruments up here this instrument this sister is playing without her sitting here there's no sound but God puts a gift in a sister's life and she sits down at that keyboard and she begins to play and you know what we do we don't say oh our sister she did this she did that we begin to praise God that's the same with this brother I don't know why I'm choosing you brother I'm just the Lord just pointing you out to me God looks at this man sitting over here and he goes there's somebody in his life that he's going to encounter brother Samuel may never I may never I just need an instrument [Music] God you always work through human instrumentality what's he want to do in your life I don't know but you know that he's the one talking to you right now you know this preacher from Southern Indiana doesn't know your situation but somehow through this message through my stumbling words and everything he has gotten to your attention and he's knocked on your heart you don't have to come tell me you don't even have to tell brother Samuel Just Surrender to him right now where you set you say oh I'm supposed to come to the altar you don't have to just yield Just Surrender let me finish with this perfect strength and perfect weakness 1961 brother Branham says but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves and then the other side we get these feelings and we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of shape so he can when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fail there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail but he cannot fail so as long as we are trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us the important thing one of the important things that we must Master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability some of you are sitting here and you're pretty proud of yourselves and you realize I've got some Talent I've got some skill as long as you have the talent and you have the skill God can't use you and some of you are sitting on the other end of the spectrum and you're thinking I'm nothing I don't have any talent I don't have any skill and brother Branham is telling us you've got to bring that human mind under the control of the Holy Spirit and you've got to quit thinking about whether you have ability or you don't have ability what you have to do this morning is you have to turn it over to Jesus Christ and say God I'm nothing my abilities my skills my talents they're nothing without you lord and those of you that are sitting here thinking I'm a nobody God can't use me you have to give that up and say God all I got is Five Loaves and two fishes all I got is this love for you and this desire to please you but I'm going to turn it over to you this morning Lord I'm going to give it to you whatever you want to do Lord I'm Yours it's about our heads [Music] Heavenly Father I've been obedient to what you asked me to do I've realized Lord dear Jesus that there's nothing that I have said Lord that was so astounding or or so great that I could Pat myself on the back or I could say look what I did Lord I realize that this is something that you laid on My Heart Lord before I ever before I ever left the house and Fredericksburg Lord you came down and told me in the room this is what I want you to put on paper this is what I want you to wind up with Lord I've been obedient I don't know I have no ability to go back there and touch people's hearts and lives like you're doing right now I have no ability to get a person to yield I can only tell them Lord what would happen if they yield to you if they yield their instrument I don't know what the instrument's supposed to do I don't know what they are supposed to make what kind of music they're supposed to make what kind of of writing that they're supposed to do I don't know Lord but God you've got a purpose and a plan for each person that's under the sound of my voice right now and you've spoken to us this morning Lord I've done my best to yield to you now I ask Lord that this people would yield to you and let your Holy Spirit take control Lord believing with all of my heart there's testimonies Lord it might just be a card that somebody sets down at their table and writes to another person that's going through a trial it might just be a song or a poem it might just be a God bless you to just somebody walking down the sidewalk I don't know God you do Lord you know my plan you know my idea about this was to just come and sneak in this morning but God you had something different [Music] so I'm I'm just simple enough to believe God that you're going to take it to the fruition of what you saw before the foundations of the earth and you're going to work in people's lives in ways that they don't even think is possible have your way Lord Jesus have your way [Music] Lord I worship you worship you you truly are awesome you are the Mighty God You Are the Healer you are the Savior you're the keeper You're My All In All I love you Lord Jesus I love you with all my heart amen accomplish your brother Samuel God bless you thank you I Give Myself Away I Give Myself Away so you can use me I give myself away oh yes Lord you are Myself Away so you you can use me with my mind [Music] Christmas [Music] in all my [Music] mind I Give Myself Away [Music] to him I Give Myself Away [Music] Myself Away to Myself Away so you can be [Music] Lord here I say [Music] to you Lord [Music] Hallelujah sure [Music] myself away yes Lord I give myself away so now you can Separate Ways [Applause] well I Give Myself Away saw you came [Music] [Applause] [Music] fast in all my [Music] life Myself Away to you [Music] yourself away so you can you Myself Away [Applause] oh Lord I give myself away so you and you use me my life is [Music] my life is not my own Lord you I belongs to you I Give Myself Away [Music] I give myself away so you can use me I Wanna Give Myself Away [Music] so that you I can say this God has spoken and you know I kept the kids coming to my heart as I stood here brother Brown talks about there's a couple times where he said it was a situation in a in a meeting you don't hear him say this one too much but he said it was a it was a black sister in her her daughter were in the meeting and they begin to the Holy Spirit was actually drawing and working personally upon their lives among others but they didn't heed to it and when they didn't heed to it here they were you know God knows what lays ahead and I'm not saying an accident lays ahead in your future I'm just saying that you don't want your future without him if you've gone a moment without him you've gone a moment too long they left that meeting and they were in a car accident and her brother Ram describes that he said his they were there and laying on that asphalt and the little the daughter not little but the daughter looked over to Mom and said Mom we should have heeded the call tonight we should have yielded to that and we didn't I think that's something that how the Holy Spirit has applied and taken this word to every one of our hearts one thing about it God has always moved when we're honest because he's honest enough to come and speak to our hearts and what he Delights in is honesty back to him I wouldn't want to go out of here and leave this presence without having yielded Sammy you don't know what I have ahead of me today but let me tell you if you don't know him in that way what you have going on later today nowhere near and close to this moment to have a personal meeting with the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] and the whole key just like as the Lord took brother Hoover to say it and bring it all the way down in our lives it's to yield it's to yields sometimes we can wrestle around and kick around and everything I'm talking about sometimes in our spirit but it's yielding to him brother Brian said it like this in restoration of the Bride tree he said yield to him and he will take you to the Holy Ghost he will take you to your healing I can't get there you can't get there but God takes us there and I believe that I believe right here this morning it's not something I'm looking for I don't want I want you to understand it's not something we're looking for out here it's not even something that you're looking for some emotion it's him sure emotions will come but we're all different they're all different whether you have emotion or not doesn't mean anything because a person could have all sorts of emotion and there'd be no change it's got to be where he comes down to the innermost place where he takes his rest and where when he takes his rest like God on the seventh day cease from his own works you cease from your own works Christ in you brings rest and I to me I know brother Hoover I'm glad he took his time and I believe this I've said it back in the office and I believe it as I stand right here the Lord was taking him down these pathways I believe this is a predestinated moment I believe every service is but I believe this is a predestinated moment there were no plans of him being here until he sat next to me last Saturday and I started to figure out he was going to be around to me God ordained this and I just would say like this you know if you need prayer we're here to pray with you don't let the moment pass you up don't let Satan keep your back under Pride don't just let go let God have his way but Samuel it's a little bit later in the day but this is a moment with him I don't know you may not have this moment again I don't know I can't promise that but I know this one thing no matter what it is in your life if you need to know the Lord Jesus in a personal way he's here I say I've tried a lot of other times but have you yielded see have you yielded and what about even those as brother Hoover brought that quote around that you know the Lord but you realize God I'm still using a lot of my own abilities and you want to say Lord I want to surrender all my abilities and thoughts of that I believe he's here I believe it's here a matter of fact I know he's here and he's here to minister to our needs the Bible said the Lord was present to heal them and that God is here to presently to heal not only physically but spiritually thank you he's the same God I wouldn't let one situation I wouldn't let a complex I wouldn't nothing hold me back from touching Jesus press through press through [Music] and let's touch him let's invite him let's yield to him so I Give Myself Away [Music] I give myself away so you can me I Give Myself Away too long I
