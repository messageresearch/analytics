Amen. &gt;&gt; I give my mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord. [music] pleasedly to you Lord [music] Jesus fill me with your thought [music] make it all. Oh [singing] yes Jesus change my life. Let me [singing and music] live in all that's true. I just want to be by my sing again. I give my mind Lord. I give my mindless [singing and music] completely [singing] to you, Lord. Oh, [singing and music] fill me with your thoughts. Make it all [music] brand new. Change my life. Let [singing and music] me live in all that's true. Cuz I just want to think like [singing] you one more time. I give my mind completely to you, Lord. [music] Fill me with your thoughts. [snorts] Make it all [music] brand new. Change my life. [music] Oh, let me live [singing] in all that's true. [music] I just want to think like you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer tonight. And maybe as we approach in prayer tonight, I had had a text here from brother Barry Coffee here just [music] um a couple hours ago that um with the saints there in Tanzania, you'd get a text from brother Leas that's over there, a pastor, and um there's just been some real political unrest with some things that's taken place. A lot of violence has just just happened within within the day. And so um there the brothers are requesting prayer. Um also with the hurricane that had come through Jamaica, I was in contact with brother Keith Reed. Um I was in contact with him as it was coming in and then uh he sent me some videos and things even as it was going on and um so he's there still trying to assess the damages and so uh of what's taking place you know there um so you know communication some of you no doubt most of you probably heard within that the most the communication is down so it's very difficult to try to hear even the same way in Tanzania because of all the not because the hurricane but because the political unrest the the only way they can make contact is through cell phone and so it's it's a lot of things that's that's taking place and you see the the world is in such a turmoil &gt;&gt; you know we one thing about it as believers we we can't we can't just look and see the things that's taking place and realize that it's going home time. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; You know, I I couldn't help myself just a couple weeks ago [music] when everything was being touted about a great peace plan. And you know, the scripture just months just the scripture just have been going through my mind for months is when they begin to say peace then sudden destruction. &gt;&gt; And I'm not putting any timeline. I'm just trying to say is that there [music] is a thing a lot of things that people are putting their stock in and they're looking for. We see I mean even where our president uh and when he says something he does it um but testing now nuclear weapons. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you see the world's the tensions are bracing and uh we certainly know that what a time it is to be in Christ. &gt;&gt; What a what a place of safety, [music] you know, because just at any moment because we know that we have this promise that if we're that close and we see those things that before one bomb &gt;&gt; strikes this, &gt;&gt; the bride's already gone. The bride's already gone &gt;&gt; before one one bomb strikes it. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us very clearly that the dead in Christ will rise &gt;&gt; and we will be gathered right here. But here we are walking in another dimension. But yet here we are for that period of 30 to 40 days. And that's the same way it was in the book of acts. But you know, brother Bram says the reason also that that is is because he knows before he appears, we're going to be looking around to see who made it. And he said he don't want any eyes taken off of him when he appears. So within that 30 to 40 days and think how close we are within those times and you know [music] what what a shalom it is in our hearts &gt;&gt; and you know I believe with all my heart that you know God give us the wisdom &gt;&gt; give us the grace to reach others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May it may there be such a sound that goes out of our life that's greater than [music] any words that we could say. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just pray together tonight and pray for these needs here for the brothers and brethren in Tanzania and Jamaica. And heavenly father, we are so thankful God for your mercy in this hour. &gt;&gt; We didn't find you. You found us. Lord, if not for your grace, we would also be groping in darkness. Lord, we see the nervous tensions &gt;&gt; there in the world. We see, oh God, just where man's heart is perplexed with fear. We see the Lord, many of the attributes of that, Lord, just oh God, everything all around us. No, no settleness, no peace Lord. and so many things to Lord that are either taken or or viewed or so forth to try to drown out that real cry for peace in the heart of man. That's where your desire is to bring real peace to you, Lord. Because through that peace reigning in our hearts, you're making a people that are fitted and ready, Lord God. For there is coming a time, &gt;&gt; Lord, in that great millennium, when there will be peace when the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the earth, sea, and sky, oh God, a people that you have redeemed. You have taken unto us. You have taken us unto yourself. And God, molding us and preparing us, Lord. Even now, we're being prepared and molded, Lord, for that moment, for that time. Oh, Father, as we stand here, Lord, every one of us, undoubtedly, Lord, we have loved ones on our heart. Lord, whether it be parents, whether it be children, whether it be extended family, co-workers, oh God, we don't want to see one miss it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Lord, let our lives be so seasoned with you. that are that every moment through every action and the wisdom Lord for the words to be spoken that God just to be in this season in this moment Lord to to catch those Lord Jesus Lord of wandering souls hearts and lives Lord oh God maybe it's even to catch one that their eyes won't even Lord they'll they'll never be able to see fully the truth, but they'll accept the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. I pray in these moments, Lord. We just want to be vessels that are emptied, surrendered, and yielded. Lord, that you might work your will through our lives. Lord, help us, Lord. For it can even be the testimony through our lives that would reach someone else, Lord, of how that we will handle something or respond to something on the job. And we know that Lord, that's not a little thing. That's supernaturally that you working in our lives just like you did in the field with the bull with the prophet and the maniac on the stage and the hornets there in the yard. It was a supernatural work that took place, Lord. And may our lives, oh God, be that platform that would invite you to step forth. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray for the brethren there in Tanzania. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh God, would you just, Lord, just undertake for them? I pray that God you would just settle those things Lord as [music] you keep your hand upon the brethren Lord and the churches around oh God protect them Lord we Lord it's not hard for us to ask that because you said Lord you'd be a wall of protection around us Lord a wall of fire that we ask Lord for the brothers and sisters in Jamaica oh God brother Keith Reid and many the other brothers Lord Lord, oh God, may you just, Lord, I pray, undertake for them, Lord, give them strength, Lord, and encouragement, Lord. Father, as we're able to even help, Lord, I pray, oh God, Lord Jesus, there's not one assembly that could, Lord, take care of everything, but may you take, Lord, and multiply, oh God, to minister to the needs of your children. We just Lord, we love you in our hearts, Lord. We know, we sense it, Lord. It's going on time, &gt;&gt; every moment, Lord. So, Lord, we just commit this service in your hands and ask that &gt;&gt; draw us closer to you, Lord. Prepare us, Lord. I pray in Jesus name. Amen and amen. [snorts] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So good to be here in the house of the Lord. And Amen. Good to have our brother here with us. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I forgot your name. What was your name? Aquilla. God bless you, brother Aquilla. You know, he was here when brother Marcus was here and so so [snorts] glad to have him. How are you related to brother John Singer? You're not. Shame on you. No, I'm just teasing. But you aren't you from the assembly over there? Are you from the assembly over there? Okay. So, I I didn't know if you were related to him or not. I I don't probably Nobody wants to be related to Brother John. Don't tell him I said that. We think of one another. But, Brother John's a fine brother. You have a fine assembly over there. Brother David is a pastor and we [snorts] want to read here in the scripture. Um, and I know we've been reading these scriptures here and I want to just go a little further this evening. Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another. And by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another. I want you to think about that here. He is the living word made manifest. So this isn't it. This isn't a love that can actually be expressed uh outside of the love of God dwelling in the heart of the believer. which is the Holy Spirit. And it won't be apart from the word, but as a life is walking in the word. Walking in the light, this is an accompaniment. If we're walking in that light is that the love of God will be the accompaniment with the revelation that we hold in our heart. And so if if we hold uh revelation but don't hold love, then it's not revelation, it's knowledge. &gt;&gt; And so because revelation is that wisdom that comes from above and it's full, it's pure and it's full of mercy. &gt;&gt; It's full of love. See that? That's why revelation is it it gives to us what we have need of. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it not only opens our understanding but it imparts to us what we need. It quickens us. It alerts us to the word and then it here we are drawn and it's then not us doing it but it's the word now coming through our lives. &gt;&gt; So in John 15:17 these things I command you that ye love one another. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. Um, I want to um just speak here just tonight on on the thought here just for a few moments on that of u of brotherly love and brotherly love. I realized that this is a this just even in this um subject itself um could really merit even a lot of services and a lot of things. But I want to I want to start back in with looking at how that this when this is given in the word and to understand that anything that God requires of us in the word and what he's when he spoke to the disciples and he spoke to them and he said that we are to love one another as I have loved you. It's absolutely impossible without his love dwelling in us. and we dwelling in them. That's it's absolutely impossible because this love this degree is God himself. God is love. And so to to understand as when we see this here with with that of of brotherly love, it's something that God himself when his life comes into us, it's his life that then produces what what is actually being called for. So it will actually produce this of brotherly love. The prophet says it like this. He says the first thing that Pentecost produced was brotherly love. So miracles and signs and wonders those are accompaniment but I want you to remember that they're they're even the nominal world they have miracles they have signs they have wonders we don't downplay that but the Bible says miracle signs and wonders follow the believer and so this is why that we don't rest upon signs and wonders and no matter how marvelously God could use you or use anyone else we ultim ultimately is to rest upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so when we look at this that Pentecost, the first thing it produced was brotherly love. So it wasn't a group of people that were somehow trying to mirror what the Lord Jesus had called for, but it's what they yielded to, and it was now Christ working out that same love in their lives as he had towards them. Now, it says it tore down. I I love how brother Bram writes this. He says, "It tore down the middle wall of partitions and it made a brotherhood to such that they had everything in common in the Bible days a brotherhood." It did that. Not it wasn't something that they themselves altogether had to do, but it's what it did through their lives to where when we talk about walls being torn down, the world the reality of where walls must be torn down is from the heart. &gt;&gt; That's where love is to dwell. And that's where love dissolves walls. It dissolves separation. That's what brought God down to us. And this is what brought to where that even as he would walk with the disciples, his love for them. He had a love for them that at that time they were not able to receive that love and to respond back to that love because the blood had not been shed yet. But once the blood had been shed to take care of the sin, then vessels could be opened, surrendered, and the love of God could be poured into their lives. and then they could love him as he loved them. &gt;&gt; So now notice within this the prophet goes on to say Paul spoke of this brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal church and he said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues as men and angels and have not this love which brings the brotherhood I'm nothing. And though I have the knowledge to understand all the mysteries of God, I am still nothing without love. the love of the brethren. So, brother Abraham goes on to say, "This will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other." So, I want you to understand that people can look and they can try to classify you and say, "What do you believe?" And then you begin to speak and talk a little bit and then eventually if they have any knowledge or anything at all, they'll say, "What what do you mean you you you follow a message?" and they're and they're wanting to try to place you. This is why many times individuals ask, "Uh, what church? What what what denomination are you a part of?" And you say, "I'm not a part of a denomination. I I'm I I'm just I'm just a Christian. I'm a I'm a member of the body of Jesus Christ." But they're trying to place you. And then if if you know that sometimes where individuals say, "Oh, oh, you know, oh, you you follow uh uh William Brandham's teachings. Oh, you and and they and you know and there might have been some interactions that they had with individuals that actually were followers and I want to use that loosely, followers of the message. And because they had interaction, but yet to them what they saw and so forth, it it had nothing within it that would prick their hearts or maybe STIR THEM UP. BUT THIS is what makes a difference is when we have the love of the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S the seal of God. That's where the deception has come even within as as it speaks there in 1 Thessalonians 4 is to where that many having RECEIVED NOT the love of the truth. There they they have they've received a truth. Remember the Bible says in the last days how many will continue to wi with truth and and constantly just truth and truth but not receiving the love of it. And I can tell you this right here to know truth is a wonderful thing but really to really know truth is to know the person of Jesus CHRIST FOR HE IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; HE'S the one that makes the word live. He's the one THAT MAKES IT ACT. He's the one that makes it do what he said do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And so when we see that the love of the truth, that's why when God moves into a heart and moves into a life fully, I mean, even as God begins to take a hold of a life, there begins to be a love affair that is started. AND THAT LOVE, IT JUST MOVES to a TO A DEEPER DEGREE to where like the prophet said, one of the greatest evidences 64 question answers, he said, IS WHERE SOMEONE YOU JUST SO LOVE THE WORD OF GOD. YOU SO LOVE THE WORD. You so LOVE THE TRUTH. AND NOT JUST LIKING IT AS far as it's stimulating your mind, BUT YOU LOVE IT. YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF TO IT. YOU YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE ADHERED TO IT. YOU YOU WANT YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO MATCH THAT WORD. WHAT AN EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT'S ABIDE THE LOVE OF TRUTH IS ABIDING IN YOUR HEART. YOUR DESIRE IS to please him. &gt;&gt; So how the brother Ram says Pentecost had that I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of the apostles and the disciples they had that brotherly love. They wasn't greedy. They sold everything they had for the furthering of the church. They were so together till even when one heard the other died, they said, "Let us go and die with him." &gt;&gt; SUCH a feeling. &gt;&gt; Now, what produced that was the love of God in their lives. THEY HAD SIGNS. THEY HAD WONDERS. They had ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND ALL OF THAT WILL COME IN ITS SEASON. AND IT COMES IT AS YOU KNOW, IT'S ON AS NEED. GOD GOD DOESN'T THE PROPHET TELLS US OVER AND OVER GOD DOESN'T CLOWN FOR nobody &gt;&gt; when there's A NEED LOOK EVERY TIME WHEN THE THIRD PULL WAS MANIFESTED THERE YOU FIND WITH SISTER HADTIE YOU FIND with with with with with WITH SISTER MEDIA YOU FIND THAT THERE WAS A NEED IN EVERYDAY [screaming] LIFE &gt;&gt; AND GOD WAS SHOWING I'M NOT JUST GOD OF THE PLATFORM &gt;&gt; I'M NOT JUST GOD OF THE FIRST AND SECOND PULL, BUT I'M GOD OF THE THIRD [screaming] PULL. AND THAT'S CHRIST IN you &gt;&gt; working through your life &gt;&gt; as needs arise in your life. &gt;&gt; It's you walking with God and God walking in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a what a wonderful reality. That's that's that's why the third pole is not a mysterious re not a mysterious thing. It's simply Christ himself now working preeminently in our lives. the word having preeminence, our lives being surrendered to him. So notice he says for the furthering of the church they were sewed together to even when one heard the other died they said let us go and die with him. Such a feeling timeested faith. Brother Bram said God is love and you just can't do nothing but love when God comes into you. &gt;&gt; It's love brotherly love for one another. You see this is why the think about these statements now when brother Brandham makes the statement in Christ the mystery of God REVEALED IF THE LOVE OF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART &gt;&gt; you can't wait for those church doors to OPEN &gt;&gt; TO GET IN HERE AND FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND sisters &gt;&gt; but see WHAT IT'S COMING BACK TO IF THE LOVE OF GOD IS IN THERE NOW I DON'T SAY THAT A PERSON MIGHT NOT you know get out of sorts and whatever more but I'm telling you if the LOVE OF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART, HE WILL CORRECT YOU AND BRING YOU BACK TO THE FOLD. &gt;&gt; THAT BECAUSE THE LOVE OF GOD CAN'T FAIL. THAT THE CHARITY NEVER FAILETH. &gt;&gt; Is that right? When it anchors IN THERE, IT CAN'T FAIL. &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN WE SEE THIS, THIS IS ONE OF THE REALITIES. IT'S THAT A PERSON CANNOT SAY, "OH, I JUST LOVE GOD SO MUCH, BUT I CAN'T STAND TO BE AROUND THOSE PEOPLE. SOMETHING'S WRONG." THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; WELL, I JUST CAN'T STAND TO BE AROUND CHURCH PEOPLE. SOMETHING'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; IT'S A REAL SIGN OF A LACK OF THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN THAT WHERE IS THE HOLY SPIRIT? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? YOU COULD BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT PRODUCES A BROTHERHOOD, A BROTHERLY LOVE. IT'S NOT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. IT'S NOT US GETTING TOGETHER AROUND OUR OWN LITTLE IDEA having our own little click, our own little clan, our own little ism, our own little for US FOR AND NO MORE, OUR OWN. THAT'S NOT US. IT'S NOT OUR DOING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR OWN EYES. HOW GOD COULD TAKE A PEOPLE THAT ARE SO DIFFERENT, A PEOPLE THAT TEMPERAMENTS ARE SO DIFFERENT. HOW GOD CAN TAKE A PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND GOD BRINGS THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER, BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE OUTER THINGS. IT'S ABOUT THAT ATTRIBUTE THAT IS ACTUALLY A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD ON THE INSIDE. AND GOD WILL TAKE THAT ATTRIBUTE AND DRAW THAT AND QUICKEN THAT ATTRIBUTE TO BRING FORTH A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. And then through the humanity &gt;&gt; manifest his glory and his overcoming even through the rubbing &gt;&gt; of one another. This is why Paul would write in 1 Thessalonians 4:9 as touching brotherly love. You need not that I write unto you. &gt;&gt; Now, did Paul deal with with love? Yeah. Paul didn't Paul's not saying here, well, there's no need to even even to write about love. He wrote and as God would direct him not only within the Corinthian church, but Paul would admonish in this verse of scripture that you would also increase more and more. AND IN 2 THESSALONIANS, HE COMMENDS THEM FOR THE increase of the love from Thessalonians 1 to Thessalonians 2. &gt;&gt; So our love, the love of God in us, I mean, say it that way, can increase. Right? &gt;&gt; You see, it's taking every every bit of the of of the boundaries that belong to you as a son and daughter of God. GOD'S INTERESTED IN OCCUPYING IT ALL. God's not we're not interested and neither is God interested in just giving us OUR INHERITANCE, BUT HE'S INTERESTED in us filling that inheritance in that we ourselves are ARE PARTAKERS OF THAT inheritance to its fullness of what he's called us to &gt;&gt; in this hour. In other words, God did not give you, let's say, this whole building and wants you to stay in that corner. &gt;&gt; He wants to fill. &gt;&gt; He want He wants you He wants you to possess the land. And and THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE POSSESSING HERE IN THE LAND ARE THINGS OF OF COMPLEXES that will rise. MAYBE THINGS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN YOUR LIFE, THINGS THAT strange from THE FAMILY, BUT NONE NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS IS YOUR INHERITANCE, AND THOSE THINGS are only trespassing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's touching brotherly love. You need not that I write unto you for yourselves are taught of God to love one another. Not only did God lay it down within the word, but even how he came to us, EVEN HIS APPROACH to us. &gt;&gt; We were unloly, &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAME TO US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HOW MANY CAN YOU EVEN LOOK AT AND SAY, "WELL, MY MY GOODNESS, YOU KNOW, UH, here a prayer request." And yet, maybe it's a prayer request, and yet someone IS NOT REALLY ADAMANT ABOUT SERVING GOD. HEY, PRAY FOR ME. What are you What are you going to do? Are you going to tell your loved ones? Well, we're not going to pray for you. You need to get in church. AS THOUGH THAT THAT'S GOING TO WIN THEM. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO WIN them is THE LOVE OF GOD. AND NO, THE LOVE OF GOD IS NOT COMPROMISING. BUT NEITHER IS THE LOVE OF GOD BRISTLING, &gt;&gt; SHARP, &gt;&gt; DEGRADING, &gt;&gt; cutting down. No, no, that's not the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's human frustration. &gt;&gt; That's human dominion wanting to take dominion over another human and call it the working of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON I FELT LED. WHAT IS the leading? &gt;&gt; IS THE LEADING ARE HUMAN FRUSTRATIONS? &gt;&gt; Cuz you can feel anointed being frustrated. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PUT WHAT DID THEY SAY? WHAT'S THE WHAT'S the phrase? Uh a square peg in a round hole. &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO DO THAT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT TEARING SOMETHING UP. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT WHAT WHAT LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. WHAT BROUGHT THE MESSAGE TO YOU AND I? I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IF THE MESSAGE WAS ONLY DELIVERED WITH WHERE WHERE IT WOULD BE ACCEPTED, LET'S SAY BRANDON TABERNACLE AND IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SPOKEN OUT IN OTHER PLACES. DO YOU KNOW THE MESSAGES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE GOT RID OF INVISIBLE UNION of the bride of Christ works AS FAITH EXPRESSED? AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT LAST SERIES OF MESSAGES THERE IN SHREFPORT, &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT THE PROPHET THERE. AFTER HE OPENED UP AND HE PREACHED THE MESSAGE INVISIBLE UNION THAT CAME TO HIS HOTEL &gt;&gt; AND TRIED to prevent him. &gt;&gt; And he stands the next night on the platform and calls every one of them his friends. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's have an oldfashioned prayer line. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHAT WAS THAT?" I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT WAS. THAT WAS THE LOVE OF GOD. [screaming] THESE ARE NOT JUST QUOTES. THESE AREN'T THESE AREN'T THESE ARE PROJECTIONS TO YOU AND I TO SAY LISTEN IF WHAT GOD DID IN HIM THEN THAT SAME GOD LIVES IN ME. NO, I'M NOT A PROPHET. I DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROPHET. BUT THAT WASN'T ABOUT BEING A PROPHET. THAT WAS ABOUT BEING A SON OF GOD YIELDED [screaming] TO THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, brother Random would have made that his own. Think about what have been messed. It would have been missed. The messages &gt;&gt; things would have been messed. You you understand what I'm saying? If he would have took into ACCOUNT AND MY HE'S GOING TO DEFEND THIS, he's going to do this, he's going to do this. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE STANDS THERE IN FREEPORT COMING DOWN THERE BEFORE that in what house will you build me? He has said at the at the dedication of the tabernacle in Tucson, I'm not going to go down there and preach doctrine. &gt;&gt; He said, because brother Moore does not see the message, &gt;&gt; he said, I'm not not going to go there. He said, but of course, he said, you know, he said, if God leads me that way, &gt;&gt; right? Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, this is why brother Brandham, he had such respect. What what's to me is such direction he gave to us as ministers because he said, "I have enough respect to a brother to not go in his pull pit &gt;&gt; and preach doctrine." &gt;&gt; You see, well, brother Brandon went in his pit and he preached doctrine. He was a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE HOW THE PROPHET OF GOD CONDUCTED ITSELF. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET IN THE PULL PIT IN ORDER TO DO THAT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY, THE BIBLE SPEAKS TO US ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER BROTHER TO BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Oh God, HELP US. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED THINGS IN THE FRONT YARD. SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD. &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT IT OUT THERE ON INSTAGRAM. SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD. &gt;&gt; DON'T BRING THE BACKYARD ON YOUTUBE. SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. INDEED, you do it toward all the brethren. I think this IS THE KEY. ALL THE BRETHREN BECAUSE NO DOUBT THERE WAS there was brethren that everyone including us THAT THINGS AREN'T EXACTLY JING OF PERSONALITY. BUT GOD DOES IT THAT WAY TO BRING OUT THE LOVE OF GOD IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THINK OF WHAT A TERRIBLE CHURCH IT would be if everybody was like you or like me. &gt;&gt; I mean, I GET ON MY OWN NERVES SOMETIME. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; I MEAN, SOMETIMES I WANT TO JUST TAKE MYSELF AND SET MYSELF DOWN AND SAY, "I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU LATER." &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Some of you will get that when you get home tonight on your pillow. &gt;&gt; But it's a truth. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, MY OWN GREATEST ENEMY IS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; You know what his name is? Samuel Brownie. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you came tonight? &gt;&gt; BROTHERLY [screaming] LOVE. THIS BROTHERLY LOVE IS THE WORD PHILADELPHIA means love of brothers or sisters of brotherly love. Now this same word is used right there in the green. Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. SO THIS WAS THIS WAS A checking as Paul Peter goes on to say being born again of that incorruptible SEED. BUT NOTICE PURIFYING the souls unto unfeigned love of the brethren. So the truth itself has the ability not only to sanctify us but the truth itself to bring ABOUT THAT REAL TRANSFORMATION on the inside to where we love the brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the real test comes is after you have to be with the brethren for a while. &gt;&gt; That's right. Woo. Then you just you kind of you're not just CAUGHT UP WITH WOO LOOK AT THE PETALS ON that thing. That is such A BEAUTIFUL PETAL. IT GOT THORNS TOO. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; So you know sometimes we oh my what happened? THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE. BUT YOU SEE GOD ALLOWS ALL THOSE THINGS FOR WHAT PURPOSE? TO BRING forth the love of God in our lives. I want you to notice this effect of divine love. The effect of divine love. the effect of the Holy Spirit coming into our life. The prophet said, "The greatest gift that God ever sent to the world was the Holy Ghost and and would rally around it. Oh, if we would break down our little bars and let the Holy Ghost come in among all of us and create a godly, brotherly love and respect." He goes on to say, "Think of the importance of Jesus at the door." Speaking of Revelations 3, trying to get in to create a brotherly love. So I want you to understand this as he's dropping these things in over and over that brotherly love cannot even be produced without divine love. &gt;&gt; The divine love of God coming into our lives. And then that divine love, it's not just something that's laying dormant. It's just something that's just there. It's expressive. It it comes out. And we see that all through the scripture. GOD HIMSELF, HE TAUGHT us on brotherly love. He came down. He laid down his life for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Even when the DISCIPLES WERE EVEN ALL OUT OF SORTS, HE DIDN'T DISOWN THEM. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? He could he could address needs. He could speak to things THAT WERE TAKING PLACE, BUT HE NEVER DISOWNED THEM. IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE EVEN HOW JOB WAS IN TYPE WHEN JOB WAS ABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN THAT WHEN HIS WIFE WAS SAYING WHAT SHE SAID AND HE SAID THOU SPEAKEST LIKE A FOOLISH WOMAN HE WAS NOT SHAMING HER HE WAS DISCERNING &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH THE WORD OF GOD THE LOVE OF GOD IT DOES IT BRINGS DISCERNMENT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S GREATER than our feelings &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY JESUS COULD SAY TO JOHN WHEN HE WAS READY TO CALL FIRE down and say, "You don't know what spirit you're of." &gt;&gt; That's why he could say to Peter, and he wasn't speaking to Peter, but he was talking about the anointing that was upon him. Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Don't say that to your husband. &gt;&gt; Don't say it to your wife. Don't say it to another brother. &gt;&gt; But be wise as serpent and harmless as a dove. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because there's things there's things that can come. Anointing a thought and presence. You know, you get to dwelling on a wrong thought too long. Don't let them check your blood pressure. &gt;&gt; Why? IT HAS AN EFFECT. IT'S NOT JUST WELL AN AIMLESS THOUGHT. IT'S A SPIRIT ATTACHED TO THAT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE BEGIN TO THINK ON THE LOVE OF GOD AND KEEPING OURSELVES IN GOD'S LOVE, THAT'S THE ANTIDOTE IN OUR LIFE AGAINST THE SITUATIONS OF [screaming] LIFE. &gt;&gt; OH, thank you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Notice he says, "Let this audience tonight. Let them become one accord. Let all their traditions, every denominational barrier and everything, let the women straighten up. Let the men straighten up. Let the preacher STRAIGHTEN UP. LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER IN A REAL BIG BUNDLE of godly love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, to be able to let down to for even a meeting to be that way, &gt;&gt; let down barriers. I mean, you think about it. We have a meeting and getting meeting together. Well, I'm not going to go to that meeting. Well, I go to that meeting. Well, I don't exactly. I mean, it's different. If there's if there Let me just say it to you. If there's things that are false doctrine, it's blatantly, I probably wouldn't be there either. But I'm going to tell you, they're still my brothers. &gt;&gt; And when it comes down, and I would say it to you like this, IF I WAS INVITED to preach in one of their church, I pray about it. If God leads me to PREACH IN SOMEONE PLACE THEY DON'T AGREE with me, I AM NOT GOING TO GET UP there and blast WHAT THEY BELIEVE. LET'S FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND EXALT JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S NOT SENDING ME IN THERE TO STRAIGHTEN SOMEBODY ELSE OUT. BECAUSE IF I GO IN WITH THAT ATTITUDE, I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST STAYED AT home &gt;&gt; cuz you're NOT GOING TO HELP ANYBODY. BUT SOMETIMES WE AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE'RE MADE UP. We're want to iron out all the wrinkles and get it all TAKEN CARE OF. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY. MANY TIMES IT'S JUST SIMPLY THE DISPLAY OF DIVINE LOVE THAT YOU CARE. There's an old saying, people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. We know, LOOK AT THIS TEST. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH unto life because we love the brethren. &gt;&gt; Not just that we can stand them, &gt;&gt; we love them. NOW IT DOESN'T I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND it doesn't MEAN THAT YOU LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM &gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR THEM &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS DON'T LET YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES BECOME A WALL BETWEEN YOU &gt;&gt; AND TO WHERE THAT YOU ONLY FELLOWSHIP WITHIN one circle &gt;&gt; see that's a CHALLENGE WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT GROWTH WITHIN [screaming] OUR LIFE. LET ME TELL YOU, THIS IS WHAT THIS REVELATION OF GOD'S WORD WITHIN OUR LIFE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GREAT MIRACLE. THIS IS A GREAT MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A SUPERNATURAL WORKING WITHIN OUR LIVES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GETS DOWN TO? THIS touches our life to where we have to yield and the word come into action. Yes, &gt;&gt; as long as we we can just we can preach and preach up here and it never gets down and touches our lives where we're living. I believe in preaching preaching the revelation. But you see, THIS COMES RIGHT OUT OF THAT REVELATION. IT'S FOLDING ON DOWN TO EVERYDAY LIFE. THE PROPHET WOULD TAKE 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR TO open up Christ the mystery and deal with these things. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Why out of a message that's almost 4 hours long would he SPEND THAT MUCH TIME at the beginning? Because if that is not attended to and maintained and let that be the focus, then Christ is not going to be revealed through us. &gt;&gt; Notice he goes on to say, "Beloved, John, my I tell you what, John got a real got a got really filled with it. Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. So, everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. First John 4:12, no man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So John is bringing this over and over. This is a it's a testing. It's where we can look at in our lives. Now, let me just tell you something. There's going to be times and no doubt there has been times that you could look at the scripture and it's not to take you away. God doesn't take away the work of the Holy Spirit, the seal of the Holy SPIRIT IN YOUR LIFE. But we know we can grieve the Holy Spirit. AND SO AS A CHILD OF GOD WHERE THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL speak to our hearts, speak to our lives, IT'S CALLING US TO THIS standard of the word of how there's to be an expression of the love of God through our lives. IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WITHIN OUR LIVES. WE LOVE the brethren. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel. Oh, I tell you what, you know, if I if we I just I just love I tell you what, over there in this particular church, over in this church, oh, I just love everybody. Go for a little bit. It's just like a people people come here and they visit. Oh, what love, what love. And I'll hear that over and over and I think just just stay a little bit. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS OH, WE GOT PROBLEM. WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT BUT THE CHALLENGE IS IS WHEN WE'RE WORKING THINGS CONTINUE. YOU'RE NOT BECAUSE A CHURCH DOESN'T GET TO A SPOT TO SAY, "OH MY, I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE I WANT you and now I GOT YOU AND NOW I GOT YOU AND NOW I GOT THIS AND OH PRAISE GOD." YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CHURCH OF mayag Christians. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT IS A FALSE CONCEPTION. THERE IS CONSTANT WORK THAT'S GOING ON. &gt;&gt; THERE'S LIVES IN JOURNEY. THERE'S HEARTS THAT NEED TO BE DISCIPLED ALONG THE WAY. &gt;&gt; AND AT TIMES WE'RE GOING TO RUN THROUGH times like we covered on Sunday, WEARINESS AND MISUNDERSTANDING. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE TIMES my and rubbing. You know, WE ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE. But all of that in itself is a moment where God will brings us right back in tune with his word to say, "Hey, &gt;&gt; this is where we need to be focused." &gt;&gt; I want you to think these script. Look at these scriptures I just read and let me read you here just a few quotes before I go on. Brother Bram says, "The love of God sealed in your heart, pressed in until all the world's pressed out, and you see nothing but the Lord to love him. And as you love one another, you love the Lord." If you don't love one another, &gt;&gt; you can't love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said so. And God can't move into you. So God cannot move INTO A PERSON IF YOU don't love. And I'm talking about even in needs. You know times friends, do you realize even when it comes down to people going into these the cancer treatments? I've read this to you before years ago. They first want to know before they start giving them this medication. They want to talk to them and they want to find if they have any grudges toward anybody or any bitterness. This is medical science. This isn't I'm not reading a quote. I'm not reading a scripture. But here's medical science said because if that's there that's in the spirit realm that's in the emotional realm. If that is there within a person's life, the medicine will do no good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you know why? You're a three- room house &gt;&gt; and you're made. You see, that's is why that things cannot be expressed out of the soul if there's issues in the spirit. And that's the spirit realm is where the enemy likes to get in and get things built up. &gt;&gt; That's why that gate of affection is there in the spirit realm. But the gate of affection has got to be ruled by divine love. That's why memory has got to be ruled by divine love. BECAUSE A LOT OF YOU CAN HAVE MEMORIES. YOU CAN HAVE MEMORIES OF EVEN well so- and so said this and so and so said that. BUT IF AS YOU ABIDE IN DIVINE LOVE, YOU THEN CAN REALIZE I'VE SAID SOME THINGS THAT are off. AND MAN, HOW I WANT PEOPLE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WALKING AROUND AND THAT'S ALL THEY REMEMBER ABOUT ME. I I WANT THEM TO HAVE HAD THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD MY LIFE TO WHERE WE CAN SIT DOWN. AND IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT Samuel back here when he was such and such a age old. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THERE'S PEOPLE THEIR memories is like &gt;&gt; they're missing memories. &gt;&gt; All they remember is somebody from when they had their kindergart kindergarten picture and here they are 45y old person. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; GOD. YES. PICTURE FRAMES. BUT IT'S TO SEE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM. THERE'S GROWTH WITHIN OUR LIVES. AND THAT'S WHY we need we need divine love to rule over the gates in our spirit to rule over imagination. Oh, I seen that brother. I know he seen me. I know he walked right BY ME. YOU NEED DIVINE LOVE TO SAY AH. You're not coming in THIS GATE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT DISTURBING like Nehemiah said the rest. &gt;&gt; If I catch you, NEHEMIAH SAID, OUTSIDE OF THESE GATES WANTING TO SELL FISH, I'LL take you down. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURES. NEHEMIAH WENT PLAYING. HE DIDN'T JUST LET HIM IN. HE SAID, "DON'T even be bringing that aroma around here. &gt;&gt; DO NOT DISTURB THE REST. YOU AND I ARE IN REST, BUT WE HAVE A STEWARDSHIP TO SAY, I WILL NOT ALLOW THE REST TO BE DISTURBED." BECAUSE WHY? IT DON'T JUST AFFECT YOU. IT'LL AFFECT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY. &gt;&gt; IT'LL AFFECT EVERY RELATIONSHIP. IT'LL AFFECT HOW YOU WORK ON YOUR JOB. IT'LL AFFECT EVERYTHING. YOU CANNOT JUST TAKE SOMETHING AND IT BE COMPARTMENTALIZED IN YOUR SPIRIT AND IT doesn't affect everything else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; My my my my God can move into you here. So here's a real litmus test. You know litmus test where you really you really test these things. You know when they're they're testing for sometimes and you know they're testing for acidity. They're testing for things. We used to have to do that in chemistry and how much you know acidity and this and that. And then even when they do uh you know pressures uh pressure test on water you know they'll you want to put in a sprinkler system well it's got to be 30 PSI and then all of a sudden okay good 30 PSI that's not the final test the final test okay 30 PSI you put the other thing on there and now it's got to be when you can fill a 5 gallon bucket and how much time &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S CONTINUAL TESTS THAT ARE GOING ON THAT'S THE SAME WAY WITHIN our lives there is a testing IN OUR LIFE LORD HOW CAN I KNOW I AM WHERE I NEED TO BE because I'll just be honest with you. I can look at myself in the mirror and say, "Man, pretty good, man. You're doing good. You deserve the recliner today, buddy. You're doing a good job, MAN." THAT'S ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHY WE CANNOT LEAN to our own understanding. &gt;&gt; SEE, THE EXPERIENCE IN OUR LIFE HAS BROUGHT US TO RELY UPON THE WORD. AND WE RELY UPON THE WORD, LORD, WHAT DO YOU SEE ABOUT ME? &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU SEE ME, LORD? AFTER THE MESSAGE COMES FORTH IN A SERVICE, WE GO INTO PRAYER IN OUR OWN PRAYER CLOSET. HOW DO YOU SEE ME, LORD? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Lordise Bram says, "You'll come never come into the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit has healed you in the kingdom by his divine love." That the whole Christian world is your brother and sister. The world's sealed out and the God is sealed in. And when you love ONE ANOTHER TRULY WITH DIVINE CHRISTIAN LOVE, then you know the Holy Spirit is working through you. Then &gt;&gt; so if I'm walking on the water, that's not it. &gt;&gt; If I'm praying for the sick and they're being healed, it's not it. If I'm preaching, that's not it. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN QUOTE, THAT'S NOT IT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE THEIR PART. BUT YOU TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS AND THIS IS NOT THERE. Tingling symbol. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WEIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT IF I HAD TWO DIFFERENT BALLS THAT ARE UP HERE TONIGHT AND YOU HAVE THEM DENSITY. ONE IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PLASTIC BALLS THEY SELL AT WALMART. And then another one, maybe they look exactly the same, but the other one is a bowling ball. The bowling ball has density. And that's the same thing. That's what the love of God is in our life. It gives density. &gt;&gt; It gives substance. Our life isn't just filled and looking right on the outside, but it's got something behind it. &gt;&gt; It's got something that that pushes IT ON. IT'S GOT SOMETHING THAT WHEN THE pins of life, like in a bowling eye, the pins of life come up, IT'S GOT A SUBSTANCE THAT CARRIES US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I know. Don't throw me out because I said bowling. Just just an example. Okay. Put down the bar. [panting] Then you know the Holy Spirit really is working through you. Then now these quotes that I'm giving us this isn't about everybody is standing around and holding hands and singing kumbaya and BECAUSE THE PROPHET TAKES US IN THE CHURCH AGE book and says THE PROTESTANTS AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS ALL TRYING TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER IN a great brotherhood of understanding &gt;&gt; and they don't even agree &gt;&gt; they're not it's BUT IT'S SEE WHAT IT IS IT'S UNDER A FALSE UNION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT A REAL BROTHERHOOD IS IS BY THE UNION OF CHRIST WITH HIS PEOPLE &gt;&gt; INDIVIDUALLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, we're going to have a brotherhood of tolerance. Look what the Bible says. She is a cage of every unclean &gt;&gt; and hateful bird. &gt;&gt; Oh, we just love everybody. We take in everything. Well, we do love fallen humanity, &gt;&gt; but we don't LOVE THE SIN. &gt;&gt; WE LOVE THE SINNER, BUT NOT THE SIN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT THAT THE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS, "OH, WE'RE IN DIRE NEED FOR MEMBERS." THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS. WHAT'S IN OUR HEART IS WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART THAT BROUGHT HIM TO EARTH TO GO LOOK OUT [screaming] HIS FALLEN BROTHERS. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; He took part as the brethren were in flesh and blood. He came too. God took part of his own creation or he created a part of his own creation and became one of us. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And so we are brethren BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS [screaming] BRETHREN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAD TO HAVE SOME WAY TO GET BACK TO THAT LIFE. AND he who is the life, the source of life, himself became one of us, that we might share in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice this scripture here. I'm I'm I'm trying to bring this down here. He that He that loveth his brother abideth in light, in the light. Not just light, but the light. And the light is God. He's abiding there. It's where he's dwelling. And there's none occasion of stumbling in him. Every one of us have been in places where you're walking in the dark, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's not comfortable. Yeah. You you you're walking, but you know, sometimes our eyes can get accustomed to certain things and and so forth. I think at times when I've walked walked up uh walked up the path there and a lot of times I just walk without the light but I know there's some sticks and stuff in the way and sometimes my foot will get caught on maybe a a twig or a branch that I should have moved out of the way and you know because you can see TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT I CAN'T SEE LIKE IT WAS in the daylight &gt;&gt; and it's LIKE WHEN LIGHT ITSELF WHEN WE'RE ABIDING IN LIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES LIGHT EXPOSES &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES DARKNESS IT EXPOSES THE THE ENEMY'S ATTEMPT TO WANT TO ENSNARE US. IT ACTUALLY IS WHAT EXPOSES AND BRINGS DISCERNMENT to be able to say that's not my brother. That's not my sister. Deep. That's Satan getting in there. &gt;&gt; See, light brings discernment. &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THE SPIRIT AND WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S GOT BETWEEN. WHAT DOES THAT? LIGHT DOES THAT. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE LIGHT DOES. AND THE LIGHT brings us to that for for that uh for us to see that. Notice it gives illumination and brings discernment. Notice what Paul says here in Romans 12 9-10. Let love be without dissimilation. That's without hypocrisy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let love be without dissimilation. Abore that which is evil. So don't it's not breaking away it's keeping together. Abore that which is evil. Pleave to that which is good. Be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another. So when light will show up what is evil? You step away from it. And you say well h how does how does that look? What do you mean by stepping away of it? Brother Bram says in the message token, he says, "Don't never speak evil against one another." &gt;&gt; And speaking evil isn't just, "I tell you what, brother Shane, he's a bad apple." &gt;&gt; No, IT'S EVEN IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; DON'T SAY IT. &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN DID THAT TAKE PLACE? WELL, THAT TOOK PLACE FIVE YEARS AGO. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT [screaming] HE'S NOT REPENTED OF THAT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND HERE WE ARE PUTTING COUNTERFEIT BILLS BACK INTO CIRCULATION AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOW DO I STOP THAT?" IF SOMEBODY ELSE BRINGS IT UP, SAY, "WAIT, WAIT. LET'S let's pray. &gt;&gt; That'll stop it. &gt;&gt; That'll stop it." &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT THAT IS? That's a son of God taking dominion. &gt;&gt; Let's pray for my brother. Let's pray for them. Let's pray for this. Let's pray. Well, I tell you what, brother Samuel. I've been praying a long time. It must not have been in the right frame of prayer because you're still coming away with [snorts] something that just not the right aroma [snorts] THAT GOT SOME BACTERIA IN IT. HOW WHERE YOU HAD THAT AT? WHERE'S THAT BIN AT? IT CAN'T BE IN THE LIGHT BECAUSE THE LIGHT WOULD DETECT THAT BACTERIA &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE IT TO THE LIGHT. SEE, LISTEN. WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN. WE HAVE THINGS THAT are real and true. THERE ARE WRONGS. THERE ARE things that WE CAN SAY THAT BROTHER WAS WRONG. THAT SISTER WAS RIGHT. BUT DON'T TAKE IT IN THE DARKNESS. BRING IT TO THE LIGHT. BECAUSE AS YOU BRING IT TO THE LIGHT, IT EXPOSES IT TO WHERE YOU CAN SAY THAT'S MY BROTHER, &gt;&gt; LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHY, MY SISTER, BUT I KNOW, LORD, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. &gt;&gt; There's some reason you get in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just fellowship for a moment. Sometimes that getting into his presence on those things. Oh, how I wish it could happen that particular moment. Sometimes it's taken days, &gt;&gt; sometimes weeks. It's okay. You don't have to say amen. &gt;&gt; But I know what I'm talking about. That's why Brother Bram says before you go and talk to that brother, you go pray till you've got the right feeling. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, brother Bram, let he laid these things all the way through so that you and I CAN SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. I GOT TO GO AND I GOT TO GIVE MYSELF TO GOD BECAUSE I CANNOT DO IT by my own power, by my own might, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAYETH THE LORD, THIS &gt;&gt; MOUNTAIN shall be removed. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD EVEN TEACHING US through these things to rest on him. The prophet said, "Don't ever speak evil against one another. If somebody MAKES A MISTAKE, PRAY for him right quick." &gt;&gt; So, I see brother BRIAN MAKE A MISTAKE. HEY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, brother Dave. This guy made such a mistake. Let's pray for him. Oh, I tell you, brother Brian made he he tell you he made such a mistake, brother Brian. He this Brian over here. He made such a mistake. But let's pray for him. You missed the point. &gt;&gt; THIS IS TALKING ABOUT HE YOU SEE, HE MADE A MISTAKE. YOU PRAY FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; DON'T ANNOUNCE [screaming] IT. PRAY FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG. THAT'S STANDING IN [screaming] I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM MY SISTERS KEEPERS STANDING IN FOR THEM. IT'S US STANDING IN THE GAP. AND IT'S NOT US. IT'S CHRIST IN US STANDING IN THE GAP [screaming] IN THE BREACH FOR ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I give just one more point? &gt;&gt; Sister Stephanie said, "Bring it on." [laughter] &gt;&gt; I love it. But look at this here and I'm going to read you a quote. When you see this with the statue of a perfect man and I want to say to you that when we look at this and we consider it, remember there's elements that God brings us as he seals our life and our faith. Like the prophet said, when that water comes down through that rock box, he says it brings our faith from intellectual to supernatural. &gt;&gt; Remember sister Shepherd, the water was on her feet. So, brother Bram says you start with your new birth and then you grow up into him in all things. So when we see this, we recognize that as this is going up, and I don't want to spend a long time with this, but when we recognize we're continuing. It's not like, oh, I got to get I got to get all the faith, and then when I get faith, oh man, then I'm going to add virtue. It's growing together. Right? &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham says if you're not born again, it's like trying to put peacock feathers in a blackbird, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Everybody understand that? &gt;&gt; Because there has to be a, you know, you have to have an understanding. Yeah. There's virtue. Oh, yeah. God, God gives strength. He gives strength. He gives a He gives where there's a strength that can been produced in our life. There's a knowledge of God's word. You're able to approach the word with knowledge. But you're not in the place to where where where now it's going to grow into that. But yet God there's elements of these things that are coming along, but the Holy Spirit seals us. And then is where we grow clear to the rapture. &gt;&gt; And this right here is where we're called to manifest. We're called to manifest all these. &gt;&gt; But you know what, Brother Brian? How silly would it look if our faith was this big and our brotherly kindness was here? And how silly would it also look if faith's way out here and brotherly kindness is one little thing. &gt;&gt; See, it's all proportional. One [snorts] supporting another &gt;&gt; it that because the word remember it's all Christ. It's one picture. It's not compartmentalized. It's one picture. It's Christ. It's his life. So then when you see this, watch how Brother Bram takes this here in the message on brotherly kindness, which is brotherly love. He says, "When you get to that brotherly kindness, put yourself in his place on the matter." &gt;&gt; So after everything is talked out and finally and my my my we've talked, we've talked, we finally come and you realize, I need to go to God in prayer. How can this be it? How can that be? And you realize after it's all said and done, you know what? And God lets us, HE KNOWS WHERE WHERE HE IS. WE'RE GOING TO COME TO IT. And there's GROWTH COMING IN OUR LIFE TO BE ABLE TO PUT OURSELVES in the matter. And the other brother in the person's shoes. Watch. Watch this. My brother sinned against me, said Peter. Shall I forgive him? Seven times a day. He said 70* 7. Peter said, "Got to get a bigger file cabinet. may have to borrow Amazon's database. So, let me see. Let me GET THAT RIGHT. I ONLY HAVE TO FORGIVE BROTHER BRIAN, that sorry guy, 490 times. After 490, you're it, buddy. You've been picking on you tonight. Pick on brother Carlos back there every while. It's not ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS NOT SAID IN THAT WAY THAT WE KEEP TRACK. BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WITHIN US THAT FORGIVENESS, THE LOVE OF GOD IN OUR LIFE IS TO RELEASE. THAT'S THE GLORY. IT'S TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE THE OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; As you read in the scripture of the one who begged the king, please forgive me. Please forgive me. He had to pay back a million dollars. And the king said, sure. Then he goes to one of then this guy goes to one of his servants that owes him only a nickel. &gt;&gt; BRING YOU GIVE ME THAT NICKEL. The &gt;&gt; king heard about it. It said, "You won't forgive your brother or your sister. &gt;&gt; Your forgiveness is put on HOLD &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO SEND THE TORMENTORS &gt;&gt; IN YOUR SPIRIT. MIGHT EVEN SHOW UP IN YOUR BODY. I'M GOING TO SEND THE TORMENTORS BECAUSE YOU'RE MY SON AND I WILL NOT APPROVE OF THAT BEHAVIOR." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU THANKFUL FOR GOD'S MERCY? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; BROTHERLY KINDNESS. IF A BROTHER IS ALL out of tune, don't be impatient with him. Now, why would Brother Bram have to say that? Because that's natural human reaction. &gt;&gt; Oh, I always knew that, brother. I always [clears throat] that always knew is like cracker jacket discernment. I ALWAYS KNEW. I ALWAYS KNEW. I ALWAYS KNEW. God allows things to take place. Don't be impatient with him. You know, that's victory in itself. &gt;&gt; Is being able to be patient with him. The patience doesn't mean compromise. &gt;&gt; Patient doesn't mean I'm going to get the last word in. &gt;&gt; No, be patient with him. Brother said, somebody said not long ago, how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of God and oneness and all the rest? But the Ram said, see, put on brotherly kindness. I'm hoping someday, watch these attributes working. Patience with him, temperant, enduring with him being like kind of like biting the tongue. Doesn't mean you're compromising. It's just you you just kind of know. Some of you can relate to this. You've had teenage you can relate to this. You you're patient times you got to bite your tongue. Knowledge not anything anything wrong with teenagers. Knowledge to understand what it you hear him. You've heard him out. Understand what he believes. Okay. You know remember it's in his heart. That's what it is. Virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness, meekness to him. having faith that someday that God will bring him in. This is God operating in a body of believers. Now, what I just read is that something that right here and now we, oh my, when the Holy Ghost has come, man, that's exactly where I'm at. No God, these things have to be born in our lives and through situations. This is where fruit comes forth as we yield in our lives to him. Brotherly love. Brotherly love. A family purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Born of his spirit. Perfect in our natural family. Not everybody's perfect, right? Not everybody in the Browning family except me, right? Not everybody's perfect. That even includes me. Get a few scratches here and there. But on the more serious note, I want to say because I certainly don't feel that way at all. There's if there's one critic, I'm I'm the biggest critic I've got. But God here working through a family of brothers and sisters and teaching us. Do brothers and sisters at times have disagreements? Yeah. To have the thought that [laughter] there'll never be any disagreements. This is believer spoken word tabernacle, not Walt Disney World. Okay, this is this is where character is being molded. &gt;&gt; This is where we're being shaped and one way or sooner or later no matter it's just like from a person and there's sometimes I understand we have to change jobs. So I don't put every I'm not I'm not putting anybody in any category but sometimes the things that we're running from is the very things God's trying to bring a showdown in our life to help us to see I want to be more in you &gt;&gt; than what I am right now. And God will continue to go. And you say, "Will God do that?" Yeah. He's a faithful father. He'll continue to do that and bringing us around. But this a brotherly love to where we have brothers and sisters. Brother Ram says within fellowship, there's protection. You have brothers that pray for you, &gt;&gt; sisters that pray for you. &gt;&gt; That's why that even as we would pray for one another, you don't see someone here, take it on your heart in prayer. Someone comes to your heart, pray for them. even to even to reach out to them just even if you have to say within yourself you know sometimes there's things depending on how we are made up sometimes how we're made up we have to understand first of all even how we're made up to even have to go beyond the boundaries but how God will test things I say God just give me the grace to be this &gt;&gt; that's what I want to be I I want to be &gt;&gt; in that stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; That's not only do I want that to be the testimony that &gt;&gt; he loved God, he loved the word, and he loved God's people. What a testimony. And you know, if we love it in that way, we'll love we'll love humanity. I love humanity. I go to different stores and go to different ones. Sometimes I don't even know the people's names. We recognize faces and one or more and you know we just I like to try to at least leave them there with a smile on their face &gt;&gt; you know when you go into the meat counter at flickers and I like to leave them with a smile on their face you know they places you go &gt;&gt; you never know &gt;&gt; how do you know that that where what a person is going through that day &gt;&gt; you want to you want to leave &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; better than what where where what you found it may God help us &gt;&gt; let's just pray heavenly Father, how we know Lord that we we cannot Lord be able to fulfill this without you. So Lord, we certainly request and we desire that Lord Jesus in each of our lives, oh God, not only Lord that you would fill hearts and fill lives, but continue, Lord, just to refill us, Lord, and and guide us, Lord, that as we would look, Lord, in the approach, Lord, as we giving ourselves to you, Lord Jesus, help us, Lord, in these in every situ situation, Lord. We never we never know, Lord, what tomorrow holds. We don't know what the future holds. We don't even we don't know that, Lord. But we know that you hold the future and our life is in your hands. So Lord, we're asking God for your divine mercy. And Lord, we we want to see want to see that Lord so completely in our lives. Lord Jesus, there's Lord degrees of that. If Paul could write in that scripture that we referred to where he said concerning brotherly love, you need not that I write unto you, for you yourselves are taught of God. if he could write and ex and express to them commend them for the love toward all the brethren that's being shown and would also admonish them to increase more and more then Lord we know that there is more for us and you know Lord it's one thing for me to say this or anyone else to say it but when we really see that we need more is when the need arises. It wasn't Lord until the prophet had need of squirrels that the inspiration dropped to call for squirrels. It wasn't until Abraham had need for the ram until the inspiration dropped. Lord Jesus, same way Lord where the prophet I think Lord when he said that anointing drop there he was there I believe getting ready to preach meetings in Shreport in a morning and he began to relay regarding his wife said Lord she stood between me and the public Lord she's cooked my meal clothes. She's ironed my clothes. Lord, she she's not complained when under after under after under after under after under after the pressure I would go out hunting. He be to intercede on her behalf and at that moment you said stand on your feet and as you say it is that's how it will be. Oh God, this is where Lord your word it comes into fruition in our lives and what we see the need for Lord we need more of you less of ourselves that's what Lord with the revelation of the word breaking over our life it's letting us know it's moving in our life as sons and daughters of God you are always my son, always my daughter. And the Holy Spirit making this real to us, Lord. And God, there's an expression coming through our lives is just like the prophet, let us have that little litmus test where he could say, if we love the brethren, then we know the Holy Spirit is working through us. Oh God, help us. Lord, help us. We could Lord have everything else but if we miss that we miss everything Lord. But Lord, we know that Father, when the love of God has come, when the Holy Spirit has come, when that revelation of Jesus Christ has struck our heart, then Lord, we know that that love that not only took us from the world and took the world out of us. But God, your grace is sufficient to see us through. We want to abide in the light, Lord. The enemy Lord always is trying to thwart that Lord and try to draw us out into the flesh. He tried the prophet right there on the platform in Oregon. Tried there in the in the pasture with the bull in the backyard with the hornets. on and on. We see that Lord and undoubtedly Lord God we all are able to stand here and say Lord forgive me for getting pulled into the flesh spirit realm flesh but Lord as your children we want to learn we want to learn it's not to where we become altogether knowledgeable but sharpen us Lord to where we're able to discern. And Lord, that is abiding in your light. Help us, Lord. I pray. May you, Lord, so speak and minister to every heart, Lord. Just just take it to each of us as we need it. Lord, may you just come, Lord. You're the one, the great revealer of all these things. How could we even know where to apply it, Lord, if you did not come and lead and guide us into all truth? But show us, Lord. Help us, Lord, in our homes, in our families. Help us right here, Lord, among as believers. Lord, help us, oh God. Grant to us, Lord, the grace to even be able to look into our own life to examine and say, God, how do [music] you see me? The grace, Lord, to acknowledge even our wrong and the grace to say, "God, I need more of you, oh God. Grant it, Lord." For that's what creation is longing for, that display of divine love. That's what one Bert to the Lord. He saw that display genuine in that mother deer when she knew he was over there blowing that deer call like a fawn. But she stood out there gallantly. Oh God, we're not interested in having all the right words cuz we could have all of that. But Lord Jesus, if you've got all of us, then you're the same one who broke the seals. You're the same one who revealed the secrets of the heart. Then Lord God granted Lord Jesus through our lives. Lord, it's not, Lord, that we want all of you. We want you to have all of us, Lord. IT'S NOT US CONTROLLING YOU, but we, Lord God, we long to be so controlled by you. Granted, Lord, I pray for the love of God truly produces, creates a brotherly love. Lord God, I pray let that be Lord in every heart, in every life. If there's one here or streaming or that would archive the service and they can look and say, "My, I I know I don't have it to that degree, but may they recognize that the same God that would speak to their heart and may to bring conviction is here to pour himself in as we will empty oursel out to where Lord, they would have a a love that would stand for the truth." Not just truth of doctrine, but the truth of the character of Jesus Christ. Because Lord, I don't want the doctrine apart from your character. That's where the scripture says, "The letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life." We want it together, Lord. For that's what truly you're you look for is they that would worship you in spirit and in truth. Oh, thank you, Father. Thank you for your mercies tonight, Lord. Thank you for being a faithful father. That, oh God, you would just speak to our hearts as your sons and daughters and remind us of our high calling. Oh God, you've not shamed us, but you've come to call us higher. Grant, Lord, for one of these moments soon and very soon, this character is going to be raptured. This mortal shall put on immortality. Oh God, we've got a body that'll match what's on the inside. Then Lord, there'll be the raising up that glorified body that will all will be in perfect harmony in that in that moment. We're longing for that, Lord. This is why daily in our lives, it's bringing this flesh into subjection, bringing the outer into subjection. We love you, Lord. Be with your children, Lord. Lord God, as we just water the word just a few moments and you certainly deserve more than that, but Lord, even as we would go from this place tonight, may the word of God continue to be broken to our hearts, Lord, applied. Help us, show us the way, Lord. Teach our hands, Lord. Show us. Help us. We love you and thank you in Jesus name. Amen. Go ahead. Amen. Could we just worship him just a few moments? [snorts] Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior. [singing] I know for sure that all [singing] of my days are [music] held in your hands. Crashing into [singing] your perfectness. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. You gently call me into your presence, [singing] guiding me by your Holy Spirit.
