about it sometimes you're in a place maybe where you can't get down on your knees you know and to think about it that it isn't the position of our body we would love to get down on our knees or maybe you like playing praying prostrate or whatever but of how that just in the midst of that time if you think about it like when Solomon he knew he says if I just look to thy holy temple thou will hear from heaven and how our heart is turned into that place and say Lord I need you Lord you're my you're my strength and I tell you he knows exactly that heart our life it finds him and it knows exactly the direct GPS coordinates of his temple it knows it precisely oh my in there and it wonderful it little things like that I know it's very very simple maybe I'm just very simple but those are things that I I find to be so dear and so real in my life that no matter where we are we we have always that comfort that lo I am with you always amen Oh aren't you glad for that tonight we let's go right into the word God blessing musicians thank you Exodus 20:5 I want to turn back and just read a few verses of Scripture tonight I just just request that you you keep me in prayer as we fly out in the morning early and then we start right into the services tomorrow night for the for the youth meeting there in Quebec and all the way into Monday morning with that being the final service so you just just just pray I only asked you to pray for me but let's just pray that God would just just really do something god knows who's gonna be there he knows all of them all of the hearts that are there and and that's that's that's all we want we just want the Lord to be glorified within it all and you know I know in myself I said oh lord help me with strength as well with those services but God God is so mindful isn't he it's so wonderful so good to see each and every one of you tonight man I could just stand here and say that and man it's wonderful isn't it amen you expecting to have a good time tonight amen glory be to God well verse 31 let's start in here reading tonight and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers she belongs entirely to him this is his it shall be of the same you don't you don't belong to yourself anymore do you you you've been bought with a price you belong to him amen verse 32 and six branches shall come out of the signs of it three branches of the candlestick out of the one side and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side three bowls made like unto almonds with a knob and a flower in one branch and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch with a knob and a flower so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick well what happens if there's a branch that doesn't come out of the candlestick then it doesn't belong to the candlestick because the branches that belong to him come out of him they are born from him amen we're not we're not grafted in by a birth but we are birthed through him and in him amen and in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds with their knobs and their flowers let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and how many like to be remembered tonight in prayer may God bless you god bless your hands Heavenly Father Lord as we come together Lord in this time it's a very precious time for his Lord and father as you see Lord every need Lord even what was before the hands were raised Lord there all across this building Lord and I've got my hands up as well Lord Jesus I have need of you Lord and you know the needs behind the hands and you're the only one Lord that that really can meet it Lord and and the real reality of it is Lord you've already met every need but we just asked you to help us to see through Lord God and to be able just that that would so resonate and drop in our hearts Lord and we pray that when we would leave out of here that we will be able to say my it's been good to be in the house of the Lord and father we know that that'll take more than just us coming in these four walls but dear God it'll take Lord a divine operation it'll be a paradox Lord whereby that you can come and move upon our hearts Lord to where that even though we are setting at the address of 15:30 lake breeze Road but father within our hearts Lord God to be caught up Lord God in heavenly places Lord Jesus father to hear from you and that you would minister to the very needs and desires Lord upon our hearts and our lives Lord we stand in need of you because this is a task that man cannot fulfill so Lord we ask that you help us tonight a speaker and here together that you would just move among us in a very special way Lord ministering to every heart Lord we pray Lord we ask it all for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless yous your being seated amen I want to look there in this in distorted a beaten work to display light you know the more and more when we we look into the Word of God and the more that that I've studied and it's not really the study wood you can do only do so much but it takes inspiration dropping on things from the Lord God beginning to connect everything together and more and more than I look at it I come to even the greater realization and what's very simple but that in it all God is not it's not our abilities that God is after but God simply desires to bring us to a place to where we are so completely yielded in his hand that he's able to just reflect his life so perfectly through us I know that we we look at that and and sometimes we can get the wrong thinking and we look at it and say well you know brother Samuel once I've been born again of the Spirit of God that's the greatest yielding that can take place that yielding then makes way for him to then begin to move in your life and it's like a husband and a wife together to where that a husband himself he is wooing that wife and there is you know many times you look at the at the altar when when when they come together at the altar and things like that but Bream tells us back in I believe it's perfect faith brother brems as you watch how those two before the marriage he said their hearts begin to beat as one so the heart's so there's already an invisible union that has taken place but then you find to where that there is a uniting that takes place at the altar but yet and yet even with the pronunciation of that at the altar and what's been done in the engagement it still does not make them one neither does it make them one entirely to where even as they would they go on their honeymoon and all those things but yet the oneness itself continues to grow it continues to develop because there's ways that you're going to be able to know of this person in the care and everything that's gonna take place there's things that win before you were were married and matter we're just gonna go on this before you were married you know you when there was something you had need of you could talk to mom and dad or talk to someone else but after marriage you find yourself confiding in one another and you find that in the midst of it that the whole ministry is is bringing about that rest and that trust because we have entered into his rest and that's exactly the way that the Lord Jesus ministers to our life it's a it is a ministry that ministers that rest that is we're in that we have ceased from our own works and we're that God Himself is not interested in you and I trying to make the word work but all he wants is us to be surrendered to him because he's the one that brings the word to life and he's the one that brings it to work in our life you say well then what's my part in it yielding you might say well brother Samuel that's simple but it's it's the thing about the yielding is us even sometimes our mind and our thoughts even the way that we think about certain things can actually hinder that he wants us in a place to where there's no timidness or anything about that would pull back in our life but that it would be so so so surrendered to him and if that's what he's calling for that's his desire then it's gonna take him alone to do this and I'll tell you it's not something that we're looking at just in the future but it's something that even right now that's taking place and all across this building all the way through each and every one of us even those that are in invisible audience tonight you could raise your hands and say lord help me to yield more help me just to submit myself more Lord to you and in your presence and it's not just something when we come to church we realize that submission it starts here but yet it keeps on going throughout the day you know it's even throughout the day when there's thoughts can come in your mind may be thoughts against somebody else or or if something can be said or or this or that or the enemy can try to take the word and and you'll try to run you down with the word but it takes in that moment to come back and submit and say no I won't have any of that we are submitting ourselves in the very presence of Jesus Christ because to remember that in the midst of it it is it is a trust that God is moving in our life you know God he takes instruments that he uses but yet God will not force himself in any instrument and you look at each one that God has used down through time all the way from the Old Testament into that of the New Testament it was never a forced operation and then when you think of it how brother branham will talk about a gift within a person's life but the remm says that gift is not like a knife for a person takes and cuts their way into it now you look and you might say well how does that pertain to me because I don't have a ministerial gift but yet each and every one of us are gifted and we have our part within the body of Jesus Christ when you look at how that the tabernacle itself I think I don't know may year ago or so we ministered on this that in the tabernacle there were each one was so divided among the children of Israel to where each one would have a part as far as well among the Levites and the different families that they would have a part that they were designated as the porters of that particular part now that part remembers we looked at it sometimes it's just the define flower their whole part was watching over to make sure there was fine flower then somebody else was watching over to to make sure of the hangings and the curtains and somebody else was making sure that all of the instruments that were to be used that they were clean and made ready each one had their part without one doing their part then you would begin to see a breakdown you would see that the tabernacle itself was not fun chinning in the way that are not a function you begin to lay that pattern down not only for the age but then you bring it from the age you bring it down into every local assembly you bring it down into every family it keeps running the pattern runs all the way through because even in every one of our life there is things that you and I cannot just watch upon one gate we have to be porters upon every gate we have to watch and be ready we can't just be given into one area but we always have to be ready and looking to that of the Lord and you begin to find that how that within it all that every one of us coming back to the thought about if I don't have a gift ministry or gifting me how does that pertain to me because God takes listen to me now God will take a ministerial gift just like he takes that gift that he is sent to a generation which that light that seven star that star that God will sin and God not only is is giving forth his revelation through that ministry but also that ministry is an example of how that God wants to use his children you know it's like this how many of you ever read lyrics to a song and you might have read lyrics to a song and yet you never heard that song and if I called you up here and said come up here and sing the song he ain't even heard it so you wouldn't know how it goes you wouldn't know the tempo of it you wouldn't know that but yet you find somebody who sings that song and you're able to just kind of flow with how they're singing that song well you'd be even Barisan to get up and sing a special after only here in that song one time because even though you start hearing it if the song itself starts to imprint but yet you may not have the melody and the harmony and the tempo and all those things just downright you may not even have your key of how you're going to sing that song just right but nonetheless over time you yourself get to a place to where that you will know that song and feel confident in singing that song I'm going to tell you tonight we've got one song there's been one song of redemption down through the ages and that song in itself each and every one of you have a part in this song and in that part within that song God has one that he will show and begin to remake known his revelation in this generation and you and I can see that and then it will break off from there into other gifts and it keeps on moving down in the body to where that the body itself is so centrally focal I thought centralized focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ to where when you look at him you don't see big eyes you don't see little use all you see is Jesus Christ reflected in bright form what is that that's every gift that is set up on earth you got a gift in your life and that gift that's in your life will declare him to be the same yesterday today and forever you had a gift in your life you didn't know it but there was a drawing that was drawing you to this place of the word where the promise is born in this hour and a gift in your life as it finds its place around the revealed word it's just like that of the wise man it will declare the characteristics of Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever who is it that brings you into position it is Christ himself working and moving through and by a start not a natural star but a supernatural star it's reflecting his life his image and it brings you and I into position that we might reflect him this is all God's doing it's all his working and so when we're looking at this a beaten work to display life this this this this candelabra was not something that they brought out of Egypt it was not something that they found along the way but remember this is a spiritual pattern that God himself has set forth of this is a part that would be in the tabernacle that God has ordained for the children of Israel that they would make him a sanctuary that he may dwell in the midst of them you find this this over here to where that in the book of Zechariah it speaks of it and I'm not going to read from the scriptures we did last week but you find of how that God shows this right here almost in the middle of the Bible he shows it and then you find out that God here it is he picks it up clear over in the Book of Revelations because all the way through all God has desired to do all God's desire is to Tabernacle inside of man and it's God's desire to reflect his life it's God that accomplishes what he has said you realize any overcoming any victory in our life has not been because you and I have will have taken something boy I've taken the word and I but you're taking of the word if will phrase it that way it's not actually you handling the word member a gift is not like a knife to cut your way into it but the real taking of the word is where you've submitted and the words took hold of you and the word begins to work and move through your life and through it all it's God himself getting the glory all that he asks for us is healed that's it so here Zachariah you know is is is catching this of the candlestick and and he catches of a candlestick with gold and seven lamps that there would be there in in a bowl that's on top of it and held that there would be seven pipes to the seven lamps and remember he's asked he the angel asked him what is this and and zechariah being a true prophet of god he you know even though a prophet is given to be able to interpret but a prophet himself does not have the ability in himself to interpret but he receives one from god who's able to tell him this is what this means is that right think of how the prophet was setting there when the seven seals themselves were at work to be open and remember as he said i've set myself apart within this room and how that the angels were coming there day after day after day he himself look at this he was getting ready to take old context that he had preached from before but God himself brought a stop to an aren't you glad that there are things that maybe you've wanted to take old context you've wanted to take old things but aren't you thankful that you are in contact with that of the angels of the Lord because you are seated in Christ and the angels of God ascending descend on this access and it's there that Christ Himself is able to minister and the context that you used to look at you believe used to act by that Christ Himself comes down and says no we're not going that context any longer aren't you glad how can that be how could that be because you have one that is ordained to receive that oh my think of this how that Zechariah when he when he is he this has made known to him of what this is the angel that that came to him begin to let him know this is what this candelabra this is what this means the seven can the candlestick and it's seven lamps it is not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts o my very important not just safe the Lord says the Lord of hosts because in there is an encompass meant of this among the believers oh my now I look at this and I think about it of how that within this it's speaking that as brother Branham puts it like this he said what the angel was speaking to Zechariah he was saying to him that there is nothing that can be done by the church outside of me it has to be Christ is that right he says this is what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost so you see the whole working of the Holy Ghost even after you and I have been born again of the Spirit of God this working of the Holy Spirit through the word is bringing us to that realization and you know what God will allow you and I sometimes to try things on our own might he'll allow us to try it on our own power he will allow us to try to do things on our own and it comes to naught you say well I'm trying to do this according to the word but are you doing it by your might are you taking a hold of the word by your power or is it the word taking a hold of you there's a great difference because with the word itself remember there were many who rose up before the Lord Jesus himself and they led many people astray out in the desert is that right there are many Moses himself tried to take a promise and he put his own might and his own power or behind it but did it work it did not but what would enough happening is Moses was frustrated and said how to understand this of course not because it is not Moses strength that was to deliver the children of Israel it was not Moses who made the promise God made the promise and God who made the promise is the glove to come on the scene at his ordained time and God Himself will make that promise come to life and come to pass glory be to God what an assurance that we have in him amen this is where that when we look at this here that the oil itself is drawing out of the two trees and the Prophet will place it like this he'll speak to those two trees as we looked at it last week of the old and new Testament then then as he moves on down in a further part in Zechariah that the two anointed ones the Prophet will pick it up there after the seals are open you'll say these two are the two witnesses that are to go into Israel anointed of the Lord and you look at it remember we said scriptures have a compound meaning and when you look at and that Israel themselves does not receive a different experience than what you and I received remember it's only the elect of God that can actually be born again or be sealed because when God seals you it is God's stamp of his life his insignia we are sealed away in him he is saying this belongs to me so the same word now that has taken place down through the Gentile ages for some 2000 years over seven over seven Church ages that same God will rise up anointing two men with the Spirit of Moses and Elijah and they will go forth with the same message that remember was ministered here on the true baptism of the Holy Ghost coming forth from the true atonement which is Christ himself and that ministry will call them from traditions of offering this animal and offering this animal don't you see where this is at that the Ministry of Moses and Elijah coming in that time what the seventh trumpet is to them is the same thing the seventh seal is to you and I where Christ Himself these seven seal stepping out of book he has given meaning to the history of what has taken place all the way down we're not just referring to the scripture as stories and history we see it as tides we see it that it spoke of Christ we see that it speaks of us so it is not something to where we just remain in that it actually comes to reality in moose from type 2 Anna type who alone can move the word from types to Anna types Christ verse nobody else can do it but Christ himself you say well how can that be because it must be Christ that will move it from a type to an Anna type because the Anna type is Christ himself coming in the midst of his word to fulfill that word and make it live and when it is Christ it will always glorify God any so called Anna type that doesn't glorify God is false it's not a true Anna type hmm so you've got to look at the type and then you'll see the Anna type and when you see the Anna type it brings the type to life what are you saying but I'm saying we're drawing oil from the old and from the new although the Holy Ghost itself would move in the old it would move upon prophets of old it would move upon David David said take not thy Holy Spirit from me but remember there they could not because the atonement had not been offered it could not actually grab ahold to bring a quickening a new birth not whereby that only bat can come through the offering of of the true atonement which is the Lord Jesus Christ but yet the Holy Spirit moved there it spoke and it gave witness of this coming time even when you look at Solomon's Assembly when Solomon was preparing to dedicate the temple remember here David was not known by God you can't do it it's gonna be your son that will build this tabernacle and when Solomon is moved under under the direction and the pattern where did the pattern come from the pattern was handed from David the Bible said David communicated the pattern by the spirit on to Solomon oh this pattern was not just handed down three courts and here in there you see the Old Testament itself it speaks of the coming of the Messiah it speaks of the new birth it speaks of this time of God himself coming to indwell in his children and it speaks of the catching away it speaks of God's redemptive work not only among the Gentiles but God's restorative work to bring Israel back to her rightful place Oh My glory be to God don't you love him so to think of how that within all of this it's God working it's God moving it's God performing his word so it's everything itself nothing's out of time all all the same no we're we're so behind that no we're not we're right on time you see that top pattern can actually hinder you yielding anybody ever got nervous I don't ask you raise your head because you can praise your feet too when you get nervous about something or anxious about something it's like right then this becomes a fog they're right I need to think about this on what I want to do in this but lord I mercy don't put us in a crunch situation oh brother send up save it save it save it you're still flesh too but it's there when we get into though into those times it actually can remove us from yielding but you see God his desire is remember that we would be in arrests of that we can yield yielding being sensitive to his voice because it's him that's bringing this word to pass oh my so to think of this of how that in the midst of it we find here in the Book of Revelations tchau chapter 1 verse 12 here is John John's in the midst of this time and here he is on the Isle of Patmos and the Bible says that here that John remember he heard behind him was that lack of a trumpet that was that was speaking and John the Bible says in verse 12 I turned to see the voice so the trumpet it wasn't just of just a sound but the trumpet it had a meaning within it it was actually a voice so John is speaking this voice it held something of an order for his life like there's certain key things that maybe your mom would say and that would be different from my mom and she'd say certain things you would have a cue about that of knowing what to do you you see it's like a trumpet that's sounding you say but it's a mean you don't know she can sound like well we won't go there but a nun nonetheless it is a voice that will that rings out and here John himself notice what he said John said that I turned to see the voice that spake with me and once you catch this I can't deal with this a lot tonight but this voice it was a voice that here it was uttering it was going forth but yet it had signification it had meaning to John and John turned to see the voice that spake unto him and when he being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks don't you realize that to even turn to the voice is turning from the direction you're glowing and turning to the voice of one who is calling you the voice of one who is speaking to your life if you if you keep looking another way and somebody's talking to you that's very disrespectful but when somebody's talking to you and you know they're talking to you what do you do you turn to them you acknowledge them and there's got to be something of an interest and this has a personal interest to John's life just like the ministering of the Word of God by the Holy Spirit it holds meaning to our lives there can be a lot of things that could maybe delight us or interest little hobbies or something that we have but nothing should have more meaning nothing should have a greater resounding call upon our life than the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not just talking about when you surrendered your heart to God I'm not just talking about when God cleans your life up I'm not just talking about how to where when he himself filled you with the Holy Ghost I am if all of that has taken place then he should still have the preeminent voice of our life it should still be his voice that is preeminent above every other voice cause every other voice that comes around is a voice that will try to confuse you it's a voice that will try to upset you it's a voice that does not have any message or mystery about your life but the one who holds the mystery of our life the one that has a real message for our life is the Lord Jesus Christ himself but remember if you get too busy you can't hear his voice because his voice is not a earthquake his voice is not fire his voice is still small voice God was letting the Elijah know come back to stillness watch how God worked with Elijah when Elijah was all tore up God didn't come out there - Elijah Elijah what in the world are you doing here open of the Samuel he did say what do us now here yes h EA r what do you hear right what do you hear he's talking with Elijah but he's not demanding of the Elijah you see he's bringing him back into a place even though Elijah is the prophet of God even though in Elijah is to be used by God even though there's more for him to do he can't be taken off the scene brother joy until he's anointed Elijah but yet God cannot force him he's got to be yielded so God didn't speak to him in a earthquake fire it's still small voice why call me it looked like he was calm already because he was tucked in away in a cave no he was all anxious and all tore up and I'm the only one you see he was having a pity party I'm the only one ah it's just me I maybe I like feeling alone well I'm gonna tell you right now if the thought comes to you I'm the only one you know that's not of God because you're not alone there is a many membered body glory be to God don't you let that be an excuse don't let the devil put that in your mind or in your heart well I'll tell you what I really work sir God if I had more know that it's not runs required what's required is letting go and letting him and you can look at it and say God if I'm here in this circumstance if I'm here in this moment then your steal God how can I talk about God being a God of the line god of the bear and then I look at Goliath and say I don't know about this but he's the same God he's the same God either he's the same or he's not but remember he will not override our will now this is the mystery sometimes you look at and you think well sometimes I pretend - no you know God did things for me and Here I am still praying about it and you know I don't even think I need I didn't think I had the faith for it I was still praying god help my faith to rise and here I come to find out the promise is already fulfilled it's because faith itself is not a mental intellectual substance but faith itself is a subconscious working faith itself is a revelation from God come on now every one of us have had faith like brother Graham talks about and works of faith Express trying to work ourselves up into a healing or work ourselves up into something else but yet we all find out that's all our power that's all our my but the Spirit of God sovereignly can drop a little word in our heart that's all it takes it's all it takes once he's dropped that it's over it's something that has been ignited within us and we begin to reflect what has been ignited that promise within our hearts so then when we're looking at this here we find that how that God will will move in the midst of this time and here years standing in verse 13 in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man so here he is in this vision so the voice that's speaking to him is one who is likened to the Son of man standing in the midst the candlesticks and I remember the candlesticks look at how that it would speak of the plurality here but yet it only is truly one there's one beaten work they are all of one of the same but it is Christ himself that is actually the one who he is drawn to its Christ one like unto the Son of man in that that he sees walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is that right here clothed with the garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle what is this this is Christ in bride for me this is Christ dwelling in the midst of his church because remember here the atonement the offering was offered up is that right there had to be an offering up touch-me-not I've not yet ascended then he has since then his sins up comes back down walks among forty days on the earth with the disciples and so forth available proofs instructed them in the kingdom and then here after he has spoke to them they're on Mount Olivet notice he ascends up the Bible says that there were many who saw him ascend up and then in the Book of Luke it says they returned back to their to Jerusalem with joy because there was a certainty that the promise now that had been spoken now that promise they were returning with joy to believe that that promise is for me I am part of that promise I've seen the resurrection now I myself can be a partaker of that resurrection not just somebody who witnesses about it but somebody who's a real witness of the resurrection where he himself raises you from death unto life so when we look at this it is the very Ministry then of Christ himself as our high priest that he himself after he's offered up here he's ascended they're up before the Father here before they go to Pentecost and then at the day of Pentecost here comes the very Ministry of the high priest himself there was a changing of the priesthood and here he begins to minister the promise that pertains to the children of God what's he doing he is gathering his body that's upon earth his children his seed he's gathering them by his word he's induct them into his body so then it is his life his branches his knots his flowers his his his his and she gladly gladly loves to be identified in him yeah this is his Gloria it is his righteous not mine it's his yeah I don't want to be found having my own righteousness that's to miss it but to have his righteousness or glory be to God so here when you find that how that John himself here this is may known and revealed to John here you find that in this revelation and my we could really deal with this a lot but you begin to see that here is John cut away within this time and and what you find you find a principle that's all encompassing that any vision or anything of the word listen to me now any voice you know you got a try for spirit you're with me now you see anything anything that does not exalt Jesus Christ now let me let me go on now that does not exalt Jesus Christ to be the Lord of all the Almighty God the Redeemer that does not exalt him into that place that does not keep him the center of what it is that we're thinking we're feeling or whatever voice is talking to us listen to me now it doesn't matter even if it is scriptures that's coming to us we don't discern it by the scriptures you discern it by the voice behind it how do i discern the voice because the voice itself cannot cannot diminish the very character and life of Jesus Christ now you might look at the word that's coming to you and say yep this lines up exactly with the black and white but the actual motive and objective behind it can be as ranked and as foul as a possum as a poke at it can be so bad why because it's the motive and objective what's behind it you with me that matters a lot because what we offer up to God dogs are looking at so much what we offer he's looking at what what's behind it so this is where anything that doesn't exalt Jesus Christ now I'm talking about exalt him in the midst of our life do you realize that even when the Spirit of God deals with our hearts to repent or to make something right do you realize when we submit to that that is exalting Jesus Christ in his rightful position because you are saying no sir I will not give this place in my heart I will not give it place in my mind I will not allow this to control me or dictate my actions anymore I want Christ to have the sinner you realize this is important now you said Lord I want you to do that but remember not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord so you walk the spirit to move you got to come back in corn into the word to come back according to the word it's much deeper than just the print you've got to come back to the character who with now notice this here everything else if it doesn't how did the Prophet tell us very simply and Christ the mystery over and over and over any revelation that doesn't bring this revelation to light it's false it's got to be Christ all the way through old and new Testament what are these two trees standing on either side see it's giving life you know you can look back in your life and we look back and see where Rebecca's life we look back and see in Esther's life we look back what are we looking at we're looking at the flow of oil that's coming down through the Old Testament types of those lives even though they may not have prophetically said something but their life left left out and resounded prophecy in its life is that right what is it that's all you're traveling down from the Old Testament right when the Lord Jesus walked with them on Luke 24 he stepped out from the side of the road and he begin to take those things that beginning with Moses things concerning himself are you talking about a meeting he preached a message called the mystery of history and he shall he begin to go through and identify himself in the scripture my man who glory each moment so look at how that this revelation it will always I want you to catch this now it'll always exalt Jesus Christ this is why we must bring every thought into subjection every thought into the obedience of Christ the Bible goes on it talks about this condensation I I'm just gonna move on for sake of time it talks about this condensation in Hebrews 2 it comes to that place to where that he here he himself now is not ashamed to call them brethren in verse 11 and he says I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church while I sing praise unto thee O glory in the midst of the church this is the same thing that he he said in Psalms 22 22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee the name is is his life I've come in my father's name his life the expression of that life here he is declaring that name what's he declared he's declaring that that name is meant not only the same name but that name is the same power that was there and lived in our Lord Jesus Christ that same power now is released back to the Church of the Living God he's singing praise notice the Bible said singing praise and when you begin to look that up and study it you realize the phrasing that is used under inspiration that Paul would catch it is a hymn that is sung that a hymn that is being declared and hailed to the victor hail to the victor this song that the Messiah that Christ Himself is singing and declaring in the church is that I am the mighty Conqueror that I have conquered at all that I am to deliver that I am the one he is declaring is victory and how can he declare his victory he declares his victory through the vessels that he has purchased with his blood that he has called that he has sanctified and he feels them with his life and he takes a lot to where the Prophet said a woman to where the dogs would not even Hal her name but the power of God comes down and raises up her life what is that that's the manifestation of his victory its Christ singing in your life he's singing the song hail the victor hail the victor hail the victor glory be to God he's singing his song glory be to God so we notice here he is in the midst of the congregation now remember this is his rightful place is it right this is his rightful place but in order to come into the midst of the congregation speaking of his people of your life my life to come in the midst of it to be the center to be the head of that he himself who was the head was the greatest Almighty God went and became the lost welcomed in Suncheon he cloned and send it down to do what what was this about you know how the scriptures portray what love God had commended on us when we were yet sinners Christ died for us first John chapter 4 how did his love God projected his love to us there then while we were yet sinners yet he loved us what expressed his love not just that he came down but that he gave himself I had power to lay my life down in power to raise it up as the Good Shepherd of the sheep fold he laid his life down not for the goats for the Sheep there'll be some that benefit of that but they can never become sheep but the sheep or why he came oh ma look at--look friends look at the grace of God if there if there was no fall in the beginning there would have been millions of people that would have never been born you with me if it had just been what was there at that moment it would have only been the elect of God that would have been populated upon the earth but notice the grace of God so moves into such a place to where His grace is so great remember how Paul talks about his grace abounds His grace spills over into the book of life you with me now notice this here he is in the midst of the congregation he can't take this by force he takes this by love he Woo's you and I to himself but he doesn't all of a sudden pounce out after and say ha ha I got you know that's a deceiver well he does he Woo's us and he don't stop wooing us he keeps ruinous keeps wooing us keeps fooling us he's wooing us Oh Samuel that sounds like a happy marriage oh yes it is absolutely it's a happy marriage he's wooing us along he doesn't want us doing something out of fear out of timidness and I can't because you know what that restricts the flow of his life if it's out of fear oh I've gotta do this huh boy I've got at noon you can come in so tight and so tensed up he can't move at all all of a sudden you just don't understand what kind of a day that I've had you don't understand it but I'm sure every round throughout this assembly here we've all had days like that and you know sometimes it's been on the Sunday morning but things didn't go just right you put on the shirt that had the stain on the pocket didn't realize it you know what I mean or the toast got burner this happened or that happened you know but look what's all that is it's the enemy to try to get you to tighten up to where that God Himself is not able to flow through your life do you realize what that means Satan is scared he's scared that you and I offer if they yield my if they get yielded and they yield to him I won't have nothing to do he's afraid of yielding yeah because he knows what standing behind this set in a trickle of water brother this is a power gig come on now we're not living off drops we're living from the Fountain of Life there is a fountain that is open in the house of David let me tell you something model is that speaking for Israel but remember you are that tabernacle you are that temple that was spoke up in the book of Acts here you are raised up because he hath put you together you are ordained as stones into this body lord have mercy let's look at this order of the lighting a little bit look at this order of the lighting now let's kind of move from here where he moves in the midst of our lives what's how this says in numbers 8 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto Aaron remember who Aaron is he's a hot feast and say unto Him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick now notice this is just not something that's just you light them how you feel like Latin America's the high priest is given orders this is how your tool item it's not just any way not just any fire there is a way and the real true way is that as it says in the last the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick remember without the candlestick there is no seven lamps are you with me without the candlestick there are no seven lamps without the Lord Jesus Christ there are no seven messengers there are there is there is no there is no seven churches without Christ so without him none of this would be because it's his branches his schnapps it's his ministers it's his children it's his body his his his his his and the seven Lance shall give not made give light over against the candle stick and Aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the LORD commanded Moses so he lighted them now the question is I know some of this is review but still it's it's good so look at how the Lord will take us through it how where does he get the fire from you know that so that that's a very important thing where he gets the fire from if it's a man-made constructed fire this won't work remember God is laying a type here that is to be fulfilled in an anti-type it's not them getting together and bajate you would hear you you rub these two parts together and I'll tell you what does bill you you go over there and get some newspapers huh I'll tell you what you'll get some little twigs and then we got it we got to get this fire going no this was not a fire that man had to get going this was not a fire that they had to work up are you with me they couldn't be fire they might have been able to do this and do that and and do that but yet this fire itself in order to light these candlesticks had to be a fire that came from the presence of Almighty God notice this in Leviticus chapter 9 verse 23 and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle the congregation that came out and blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people notice the glory of the Lord appeared unto the people and there came out a fire out from before the Lord his presence his person there came out of fire this was not an earthly man-made fire so this is not anything that can be worked up and it consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they crowded and fell on their faces what took place on Calvary God Himself consumed the sacrifice he shall see his soul and shall pleasure when he had made his soul an offering for sin remember even when the widow of Zarephath when she spoke to by the prophet Elijah make me a cake first she has two little sticks and she puts them sticks together to make a fire those two sticks represent Calvary it was fire on and on you see this through the scripture that the fire itself this is not something that is new or strange to the believers it's fire God has many different places to where that fire itself will come right out of the rock many different places to where even the fire itself was in a bush and yet it didn't consume the bush in that amazing same way the fire is inside of you it's consumed a part of you but yet here it is it lives and manifests itself still within this bush glory be to God oma think of this it could not be a strange fire remember when those I believe it was about you and they dad remember the sons of of Levi when they tried to take in sensors and remember God it wasn't so much the incense it wasn't so much even that of the different sensors but yet those sensors were identified with them and even though the incense itself it could have been according to the recipe but the fire itself was strange fire and God let it be known I don't want no strange fire you you realize the fire is still here friends the fire comes when the sacrifice is ordered right and remember you and I are charged in Romans 12 to present your bodies as a living sacrifice you want the of God to flow you wanted to move through your life listen don't get down in the Molly groves but recognize but that same fire is there that same fire is there to move what must I do submit yourself as a sacrifice now listen to me it might cause you to sacrifice your thought about something your thought about something your feeling about something your idea about something you realize that one little thing could be holding back the fire of God when you begin to look at that you'll say this don't mean nothing compared to the fire of God you see when we begin to look at things in terms of what we value sometimes and then begin to look at what could be no comparison at all so here it has to be a fire from off of the altar of the Lord notice this in the patmans vision how brother Aaron puts it here he says the lamp was lit in a special way first the priests took fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of God heal it now watch disorder heal it first of all v lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl not to the side the one that is on the top of the bowl remember the whole part is the candlestick he has branches that come out of it you with him he's not exalting a branch a branch itself that exalts itself above the candlestick is not a branch of the Lord there right first Thessalonians chapter 4 that this man called the man of sin setteth in the temple tent temple of God exhort in there exalting himself as though he were God but he's not of God and watch this order here the lamb that was sitting on top of the bowl who's the first lamp that got the Holy Ghost Jesus yes sir yeah because those who are born born born in the kingdom remember the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Baptist why because you are born of the Holy Ghost so who's the first one remember on whom thou shalt see the spirit be sin and remain the same is he so what lamp was the candlestick he are you with me here so we find the lamb that was sitting on top of the bowl he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first land no notice it's not it's not having the torch and then you're going from the torch and light this one then you like this one you like this one but the life travels from one to the next to the next why because the life itself is not entering the body exiting the body entering the body exiting the body you are sealed with the Holy Ghost until the day of your redemption it doesn't throw inflow outflow inflow out no sir it comes in and it seals that age then there is a moving on to the next stage and the Holy Spirit moves calls out the elect of God that are laid and ordained in those respective beds of time and it seals them with the Holy Ghost glory be to God so here this lighting he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamb you know what that means it's the same fire of God dwelling in your heart as the same one that fell on the day of Pentecost it's the same fire of God who's that administered by our high priest the Lord Jesus Christ are you with me man can talk to you man can witness pastor can talk to you prophet can speak to you all those things but man cannot give the Holy Ghost that is a work that's sovereignly done by the shepherd himself is that right the whole word itself calls us into a place of submission and recognizing his presence the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp as did the fourth receive its from the third and so on until all the seven lamps were burning this holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his church through all the seven ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so that that transmission declares him to be the same so if there is a message or something that is taken now listen to me even if it's something that a person can look at that.look how things are taken so out of context within the scripture there can even be things it sells that even how how it is that that it will lay within the message but yet it takes the Holy Spirit to bring those things together and it will always highlight Jesus Christ to be the same it will not be strange fire it will always be the original fire that's what it's intended to be you with me it's so when we look at this it must be Clare him to be the same so if something coming forth somehow alters or changes the doctrine says well I don't think we need this anymore this really isn't necessary you better watch that slant it might be using dead old scriptures might be losing using genuine quotes but you got to watch the spirit behind it because what will the spirit exalt you with me look at this bowl can I have a few more moments Zechariah for to notice where this bowl is at and he said unto me what sea is down and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon it's seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof so Lotus you're not pouring in from the bottom you pour it in from the top down so the oil itself it is poured in there from there in the very midst remember all the branches themselves receive their oil from that of the candlestick and the bowl is on top not on the bottom it's on there of the top and it must flow all the way down and then there is wicks that are ordained within these these six branches that come out of it there are ordained wicks that move through each one of these seven candlesticks that are ordained by God now notice remember what the Lord Jesus said he told them in the Book of Luke I know familiar scriptures with us but he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high little Samuel that's really simple that's right it did not come out of a seminary it did not come out of the Temple in Jerusalem it came from on high this life does not come out of a church this life comes from on high it's because he himself the bridegroom this message that you and I so enjoy and delight from it was not a message of an earthly voice it's a heavenly voice amen endued with power from on high amen here it is in the book of Acts when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place see what they were ready for they were ready for fire what showed you they were ready they were in one Accord in one place that itself is a miracle when you study this word Accord right here I've studied for many years now not been able have been fully able to preach on it but one Accord it speaks of a divine arrangement of a harmony like to consist among a symphony where they're so in sync with one another though different in temperaments and makeup but is so able to be brought in such synchronization to where that he himself is able to be the sound that comes and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and he sat upon each of them here's the continuance who thou shalt see the Spirit of God descending in remaining the same as he cloven tongues of fire came it wasn't I don't know it sure sure I don't know I don't know about this one no no he won't gonna miss its target the Holy Ghost don't miss his target the Holy Ghost great mama Eagles she knows who belongs to her good ol repeater God and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance here's the ministry what is this the ministry of our high priest who was it that lit and ordered these lamps Aaron the high priest is that right so here is the Ministry of the high priest showing here he is on his minute oriole seat - now the Holy Spirit is released back now into the Church of the Living God identifying you and I in the true atonement Psalms 133 verse 1 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity lord have mercy I don't even see this this is just like verse 1 of x2 in it they were all together in one Accord in one place lord have mercy how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity who can bring that unity about nobody but God and God will work and work and work and work because it ain't just about unifying and Stella I'm gonna stand hand-to-hand here but it's about being heart-to-heart are you with me if your hand to hand and not heart to heart remember that's something that God looks upon and he frowns out are you with me it's got to be heart-to-heart so how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the candlestick upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments it's the same Holy Ghost that made its way down to the foundation with five streams of grace you with me stats are a perfect man then same strings of God's flowing grace it makes its way down the five streams of grace to bring an actual birth and growth and building off now just go down just so far know it goes all the way down what for foundation and builds on up so that we grow up into Christ in all things as the dew of Hermon hey anybody ever heard do fall I heard ring but heard rain this past week on the road what days we had it up I've been so locked away I don't remember what days we had it but I know we had rain this week and you can hear rain can't you how many like rain well I do I like it to water my plants and water my grass I like it sometimes all right but how many of you ever heard do if I ever heard do hmm you never heard it fall at night no have you ever heard do be caught up I mean rise back up you never heard that but yet it is something that takes place and you don't hear it it happens it's coming is like silent it's going it's like silent you can wake up and you see the do there and you look at the do that's come down up on the ground you see that visitation of do and then next thing you know you get back with your cup of coffee and you look at say what the do go it didn't announce it was going but the Sun let the do know it's time to come back home the Sun let the do know it's time to rise back up and that Sun rising on that do little Dew Drop lord have mercy it begin to move and that little Dew Drop begin to quiver who-whoa glory hallelujah what's the Sun the Sun is calling it back home a little Dew Drop boy it's on that grass blade well it may not be a big church I mean a big grass blade but that little do is just that little Dew Drop it's just there whoo it's going around and around and around and before you know it in a moment and a twinkling of an eye it's gone it's gone that's the same you know that's a promise to you and I God promised that that was the one of the blessings that Abraham gave up on Jacob of the do notice this do of Hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the LORD commanded the blessing even life forevermore let's just stop I can't go no further here is that life the promise of his life moving down into the body he's the life giver he's the one who gives and who has given you in our life so if he has given us life he's brought us to himself given us of his life then it's because of his desire to work through us I want you just to think of this here for a moment that that term in that thought line of a beaten work when you look at how that within that word beaten work sometimes the word beaten it really has a strong connotation especially in the hour and the time that we we live in but it means a work that's been shaped and it's been formed it's got a purpose in mind and Christ himself has formed you and I he's called us out of the world remember the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 12 now how that we are I've been chastened and we are chastened we are corrected Warchild trained remember how the word itself it comes like a schoolmaster to guide us and direct us but after he himself after he has come moved into our life we no longer need a schoolmaster do this and do that it becomes a subconscious working in our lives even of things that we and ourselves would not have maybe an answer to someone says hey you think this would be alright you look at I no it's got a question about Shabbos let alone because I don't know what to do in this it's just something you it's just something to registers I don't know I will just have to wait and see cuz I feel a little something about it someone say what what's wrong here I don't want to just feel it something I don't know maybe it's just me maybe there's just me and there's been times it has been just me times it has been just you but I would rather be it like that then of all the other times where we've went and had to repent you with me so within the midst of it this beaten work to think of it he's got a purpose of how that he's ordained for each of our lives and he's called us wherever that you are at and wherever that you are placed at your job school wherever it is God his desire is that the illumination of his life would reflect through you to be a witness in a dark world to be a light in your heart to be a light among your family you know what the light is the light is a witness it's a witness that not only he's still the same but the light and how it's shining in this hour it's a witness it's time to go it's time to go and how that God has called us by to himself our life every test and every trial everything that comes our way if we can we recognize this I believe how the Lord's been speaking to us for some time with tests and trials remember every one every true test and trial is predestinated by the hand of God and within it all listen to me within it all sometimes you may you might look at anything I feel a million miles away that's you feeling that ain't the truth but when you can recognize he's just as close just as near as he was when you was on the mountain he's not went anywhere he's in the midst of your life but the working of the test and trial that's predestinated by God is working the beating out the moving away of this guy who gets in the way this guy gets in the way let me tell you something we'll go into this later on some services this guy is not the wick this guy is not the wick this guy right here is against the program of God this guy is your biggest enemy Paul didn't say I was given a phone in my soul to keep me humble where did he say was given that thorn in my flesh what to keep the flesh down so that Christ might be strong and reflected through him I'll tell you what if Paul needed help like that we need it I'm not asking for thorns because we already got this thorn was not secret sins this thorn was that within his life see what God did God brought Paul to a realization of what this thorn was he said I besought him three times to take it but what did God say my grace is sufficient my grace is sufficient you say God knows exactly everything that is taking place this is his help to you and I to help us stay humble we need it we need it this guy would get out of order real quick but thanks be to God the high priest is in the house and he knows how to order the lamps don't you love him order my steps come musicians order my steps in your word amen you love him we want to see him reflected in our lives because without him or nothing or nothing well we want to do whatever job that we're on or wherever we go we want to know we our desires whenever we leave they may not know my name but they may say who was that guy something different that who was that lady is something that we want Christ to be the impression that's left upon people that's our desire because we want to be a true lamp that shines our light over against the candlestick it's to highlight him you love him let's pray together Lord Jesus father you're so mindful Lord you're so precious Lord as we look over Lord Jesus no doubt Lord for some of us Lord familiar places but oh how Lord we're not looking at it as places that we know in the scripture but we see Heavenly Father that even as we look at this it's just like your word where you would have them pack up the tabernacle in a certain way a certain order and then you would have them unpack it in a certain way and set it up that order took place over and over Nord your word is like a treasure where we pull out things both old and new but over and over Christ Himself is still set up the same way and Lord Jesus this is our desire the continuity of your life Lord in us that our life would reflect that same continuity to the taking down to the raising up Lord may you be glorified in our lives Lord father as we look at this Lord a beaten work to display light father you are our light without you we have no light Oh God without the oil without the fire we have no light but all Lord Jesus what a reality that the fire comes to prove that the oil is oil oh jesus how we love you tonight Laura I asked tonight good father that you would help each and every one of us maybe there's one that's here tonight that lord in their hearts just Lord desiring just to say Lord I want more of you Lord so I want to give more of myself Lord want to surrender more to you lord rahl up into my life oh god your presence your life Lord father granted Lord made Lord Jesus you find of our lives to where the word is it's coming forth the Lord Lord as you speak to us O God you are wooing us to yourself Lord you are drawing us Lord to you lord I pray that God that you'll just Lord move upon every heart if there's Lord any life or God that doesn't know you in that way may the Lord just surrendered to you Lord right now Lord may they just allow you to become the principal theme of their life Lord in the midst of it Lord and I pray that God for each and every one of us as believers Lord Jesus help us to be more yielded to you Lord Lord God it's you Lord as I think back to the scripture where it says he maketh me to lie down in green pastures Lord that's a work of you our Shepherd aware that our lives would be free from parasites a ministering of unity Lord and where that God there is such a sense of rest and care nor Jesus how do you minister to us Lord it's not like hands being taken upon us and shaken no no no no no no that that brings fear but Lord God over and over your hand is extended more to minister to us to speak to our hearts I think of wow your prophet put it there concerning revelations chapter 1 when John fell down you spoke to him and said fear not I'm he was dead and I'm alive forevermore your prophet took us right there and he says what he was ministering to John is the same thing he ministers to every one of his believers love courage and ability it's not our ability that we have it's the ability to get out of the way it's the courage that is able to submit and rest in your hand under that love that's projected and then received and reciprocated back through our lives help us Lord Father I know that in our lives Oh mile there could be so much so much or so many things Lord from down through time like the earth itself bears marks and scars they can go down ever so deep and they can find certain things that took place Lord sometimes Lord there's marks there scars that buried deep Lord in the caverns of our life Lord the Lord Jesus you are greater Lord you're greater you're able to help us and minister in such a way and this is what you do your love is a sanctifying love it's a cleansing love it takes away our thoughts of such inferiority it takes that away because that's a hindrance to your Lord it takes it away it cleanses us it cleanses us from looking at ourselves and saying I nothing I don't know why God even want me that hinders you because Lord humility is not thinking less of ourselves it's thinking of ourselves less and more about you help us Lord our desire is to fulfill your desires let them so resonate through our hearts in our lives burn like the flame Lord God in our homes on our jobs among our families in the church Lord one to another Lord granted father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] you're loving tonight calls us me just say Lord huh I just love him more well he comes and every
