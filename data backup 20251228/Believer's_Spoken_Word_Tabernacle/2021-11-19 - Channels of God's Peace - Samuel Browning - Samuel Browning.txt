two months since he passed oh my two months my i didn't realize it was already that already benjamin do you have me on okay we are really trying to juggle a lot of things here tonight and uh but we want to continue to remember them in prayer also um my mom and she just had got to tennessee and then they got news that my aunt that lives here in sandusky that she had passed away yesterday morning i believe it was yesterday morning and then our other aunt she's in the hospital right now and she just needs a she needs a touch from the lord and so we thank god for making a way you know for her and you know you just hear it there's other testimonies that you hear of just just really encouraging in this hour as well you know there's a lot of things you can you see a lot of things sometimes it's happening around you but there's a lot of things that's very encouraging as well it depends on what you're looking at and you know um i just you're just some different testimonies and things have just just shared with me and and i just want to thank god for his mercy how the lord just uh just keeping his hand upon his children not only here but around the world amen we thank god for that we certainly enjoyed the meetings this past weekend enjoyed the word of the lord and i just always believe that's something that's very very special we have a time it's like that to be able to come and gather around the word of the lord i certainly appreciate the gift amen in brother wayne's life and his consecration i just really really appreciate that appreciate his friendship and we certainly i can say we were edified as a body and that's what we that's one thing that we really look for is that lives would be would be edified amen in the presence of god so tonight we want to just turn our attention to the word and i just ask you just to just pray for me tonight and the lord will just help us just to just be able to step aside and that what it is that god desires to say to us that he'll just have free course to be able to say it tonight so we want to look here in the scriptures tonight in matthew chapter 5 verse 9. and you may have to just use your bibles tonight we've got i sent the notes and things on over but we've got quite a process that's going back there as well tonight and everything wasn't reserved to tonight but there's been a lot that's been going on throughout the week so we just want to turn our attention to the word of the lord and wonder we just couldn't pray before we read in the scriptures here heavenly father lord as we just just come before you lord in this moment lord we thank you for the privilege and opportunity that you have given to us to be able to come together lord to step aside from the cares of this life and sometimes lord those cares and the burdens and what is upon our hearts and what we sense around us it it seems so great and not that it isn't great but i'm grateful lord that we can just by the grace of god step aside and to know that lord that you're mindful of our needs you know not only what we are are in presently facing or going through but god you're mindful of what even lays lord even within the next moment and right down the road so we just lord want to say thank you for that lord and we desire to just step aside lord from everything of this life and invite you tonight that you would just come and just speak to our hearts lord help me to just step aside oh god and this congregation that you can just come in lord as speaker and hearer oh god to minister to our needs in a very personal way lord we just want to be sensitive oh god to the mind of christ lord that you'll just say those things that would be necessary lord and most importantly that the holy ghost lord would come lord be the spokesman here tonight oh god may your presence just move oh god through this building tonight lord and for every need that's among us that our faith lord will be encouraged oh god to know that lord as your presence lord withdraw near to us o god it is just lord a witness god that you are mindful of our needs lord we love you and we thank you tonight father in the name of jesus christ amen amen in matthew chapter 5 and verse 9 we want to just read this verse of scripture and we'll let you have your seats tonight blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god how many want to be called and recognizes that that wherever you go someone says that was a child of god remember brother braham tells us that a seal shows coming and going you know sometimes where you can you maybe see a person or meet a person you think my concerning this person but then once they've been there and they leave you think but see a seal shows coming and going and that's what we want our lives to want it to be a display that it's that wherever we have been that there is a witness that that's a christian that's a child of god it may not be that everything goes our way but that's that's all right we want to have a testimony that in the midst of it that we're a child of god amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated as we just just turn our attention here just for a few moments into the word of the lord i want to just speak tonight on that on a on a part we were looking at that the last a few weeks ago on on peacemakers and i want to just really continuing with the thought but i want to deal with channels of god's peace and you know for every one of us we're going to be we are a channel for something and a channel is is that of an opening and what's what's available something that can move through you know a channel is actually a prescribed route that's set aside for something to flow if it's water there's a channel for that water to flow through that channel is is is is for that water or the channel for electricity for it to move in throughout this building and i think about the channel that when we look at it in as the bible would say as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and that's just one part of it but when you look at it when the scripture would speak of it there in genesis 6 it would speak of how that the earth was filled with violence through them but yet as much as there were lies that were channels for violence to be made manifest and there had to be influences from another dimension that would bring about that influence in that time period and we know it was a time of of sin to where that god had seen it reached to a place it had just built to a place much like it has in this hour that we're living in to where that god would say enough is enough but you see before god will ever bring judgment god has already made a way of escape for those who would desire to escape and here god he there's a man in that time that is not known so much maybe around you know the rest of the community but he's a man that's known as a farmer by the name of noah and has a man that he is is available to god now brother graham would talk about how that noah himself would be one that was praying and you know he just just just was talking to the lord but yet god met him one day and god spoke to him and warned him that judgment is on the road and noah and he gave to noah a word a message that that there is going judgment is coming but i want you to prepare an ark for safety that will carry your family through that of the judgment and think of it when when noah himself how god when he comes into that place that noah himself after it's all said and done noah as god speaks to him come thou into the earth for i have seen thee and thy family righteous the righteousness was not anything of their own selves but what they did was they believed god's word they acted upon god's word and thereby god saw it as his as the righteousness on display so if there were those who were going to be channels of violence and channels of sin and all that immorality god had reserved to him upon earth a channel that righteousness could be made manifest to that generation that's the same thing god has done in this hour and that's the same thing where you and i are at as the bride of jesus christ and let me just bring it on down it's the same way it is with our lives individually no matter where we're at in our homes on your jobs wherever it is you are a channel for god to work through a channel that god's peace can come in to that situation in the book of mark chapter four this is recorded in in in matthew and luke as well but i want you just to think of how the scripture speaks here in verse 35 the same day the bible said when the even was come he said to them let us pass over and to the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship i think brother branham takes this phrase and brother braham said that we could preach a message on that just take him as he is and there was also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great comb and he said to them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him now to think of this that in the midst of this time remember how brother branham will will take this and brother bram will actually say it in this way he said jesus he says i don't believe he was exactly asleep even though he was tired and he was worn out he said but this was a time to test their faith to see where was their faith adam and in the midst of the circumstance and the situation that was going here jesus was in the ship he was resting but to recognize here was the god of all creation that had now come down and they had witnessed the things that only god could do not a man could do these things but only god could do it and this is where their focus should have been when the storm was coming up is to recognize who is there in the ship with them but instead just like any of us when the storm itself the bible just didn't say it was a storm of wind but it was a great storm it was a storm that you know it wasn't just waves that were coming along those waves were coming into the ship to where they actually begin to think that this boat is going down and so instead of recognizing who is in the ship they begin to become fearful they begin to speak to him and say do you not care that we perish and notice how jesus directs them in this hour you you know you find the word when it'll come and speak to our hearts the word does not only come to address a present situation but god comes to instruct us because you and i have had great storms of wind come about in our life there would be great storms of wind within the disciples not necessarily so much that we would read about upon the sea you could read of it when paul was being taken to rome but what about the great storm when persecution would hit the church of the living god what about when those things would come their way it wasn't waves coming into the ship but the difference was that there was a storm that was coming against them as believers but in the midst of that time i like how it says in acts 4 they gather themselves together and they begin to pray lord thou art the almighty god you know you and i have a choice on what we're going to focus on i i find it so fitting how the holy spirit would bring that even this weekend and opening up that service of focusing on the vindicated word of god it's not focusing on the vindicated word of the hour and everything else that's going on around us but there's got to come a time that where we look at circumstances around us jesus never told them to ignore the waves but rather don't let that be your focus let it be me who is in the ship be your focus because whatever you're focused on will dominate your life and that's what actually though a person could say i'm not focused on this i i'm focused on that but whatever you're focused on will actually come out in your life you know when a person maybe is going to get a surgery there's a you know a lot of a lot of ifs and possibilities and everything but but no surgeon goes through all the ifs and possibilities and gets you to focus upon the negative sure that is there but you know i've been in many times in situations of surgery and procedures whether it's been from my home or whether it's been from others right here in this assembly i've never one time had a doctor come in when i've been sitting there with the brother or the sister ever come in and paint such a negative picture but on the contrary i have this this has been settled this is the way we're going to go and they present and point this out in a positive way now that's what man can do we know man can fail but there's one that we know that cannot fail he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail he said whatever's gone out of my lips i will not alter it or change it this this is the place that we can rest on that is sure foundation it's not sands that shifts upon things of time but it is a firm foundation i want you to notice the scripture here of how that when that wind could come up how that the lord jesus notice how he deals with this he rebukes the wind the bible says and he speaks to the sea you see because the sea itself was only responding to the wind that was coming upon it so he knew what needs to be addressed you see the word is set forth in discernment to know what things need to be addressed and then things to be rebuked and what things need to be spoke to yeah i think about when i look at this here i think about that man remember where he was coming home you know from from good services and he had his wife his wife would meet him at the door and you know she had all sorts of things to say why are you going to that meeting why are you going and carrying on like in all those things and remember brother braham said that with that man he couldn't understand brother branham why is this still going on with my wife and brother branham simply told him brother you're approaching it in the wrong way because he would get her by the hand and you know the story he would he would just he was going to cast that spirit off her i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ i i mean and brother bram said here they were just spinning around i mean that had been a sight to see trying to hold on to the hand and cast that to cast that spirit away from her but brother branham comes along and says just go out the next time and get her a box of chocolates and you bring those box of chocolates in there and what was it he was dealing with an expression of love because brother bram tells us evil spirits are not cast out through indifferent and cruel living but he said evil spirits are cast out by the love of god is to have that love that's present there so to recognize that spirit is right there but how do we address that spirit and remembering that the sea itself is what is under the experience of that wind coming the sea just needs to be spoken to that that peace be still and the wind is what needs to be rebuked i i say it like this may god help us to be able to bring a discernment to rebuke the things that need to be rebuked and to also minister a calming to those things that need to be calmed and brought at peace i think to me it's i've always looked at this part within the scripture and of how the bible you know it's one thing when the wind settles like out here on lake erie it can be very windy but after the wind has you know faded off you'll still find that water is going to be choppy that water will still have all the after effects from a wind that's been upon it but in this scripture it says that there was a great calm that came upon it you see this was not this this was not just any ordinary person this was god that had come down in the channel in this word in that of the lord jesus it was god that was speaking right there to that need and to that creation how that the lord jesus himself was a channel that the very peace of almighty god could be made manifest through i'd say it like this every one of us we create an atmosphere we know that we create an atmosphere and you know brother brahm talks about it he says you know you've been around people sometimes he said you just love to be around him then he said there's some people he said they're fine people good people but you just can't hardly stand to be around them it's because of the atmosphere that they create and so brother adam says i wonder what kind of an atmosphere that the lord jesus would have created he said because there was virtue when there were needs that came up remember they re there was virtue that went out of him the woman with the issue of blood other needs along the way there was virtue that went out of him to minister to that need and that's the same thing when brother branham brings us into that place this is the same way that our life is to be lived in jesus christ we cannot do it of our own strength but we can do it by being tapped in to the right resource and staying in that right channel this is what brother graham says he said what kind of atmosphere would that have been he said it would have been one great big bundle of love respects and godly fear now you know every one of us here when we we look at that and and think about a life that that where has passed from death unto life and and the peace of god has moved in to your heart and life to where there is no more condemnation that is there there's nothing between you and god he he's the love of your life there's been a change that has taken place on the inside it hadn't been that you just changed you know changed churches or changed people that you're associating with but there's a change that's come on the inside of you the things that you once loved you no longer love there's a piece on the inside that in the midst of of every situation that you know that i know that i know that i know i know where i'm standing and i know that i pass from death unto life i know what god has done in my life that's a piece that the bible said that passes all understanding now to think even in each of each life that can come around right even through this building to have that peace of god abiding right there in our soul but you know there are events that can come around that will try to take peace from our life it can never take the peace of god from your soul but it will try to take it from your spirit you know from your mind to where you become you know well i can't sleep i've been worried about this or i've been thinking about this and those things take place in our life just as much as we would not want them to happen but things come our way but you know god knowing that those things would come our way there is there is an avenue that for you and i that we can look to god and god himself is it moves on the behalf of his children by bringing about peace in the midst of a situation i know sometimes we look at that well i just need to have this trial removed but remember if god removes the trial then god's got to send it back because you got to pass that test is that right i mean god god just don't write a's in his book you know because you know we're well you're my pet no god doesn't do it that way every test and every trial now i'm talking about tests and trials because there's things about our life sometimes that's not tests and trials it's simply our own decisions that's got us into situations but god can help us he will mold us even in that because the bible says all things work together for the good he didn't say everything was but it'll work together for our good if we will allow god to teach us to mold us and to shape us in that time now think about it you know brother adam here he is in his house you've heard this this particular account many times but here in the prophet's home you know i would say that if we did not have these insights into the prophet's home we would probably think that you know brother banham you know just oh my if i just walk into brother braham's home man everything was just right you know i mean sister media everything man they never had no problems there i mean here is the prophet of god the messenger of the age but we know better than that and what i mean is is that they experienced things that came and tried to trouble and take away peace because the enemy was trying to battle against that channel of god's prophet and he would come in many different avenues he'd try to come and attack the family he tried to come in many ways why to draw him out in those situations to remove peace from his home but god think how god would guide and direct us here in brother ham's life you know brother band tells us of how in our lives he said if we'll learn to be patient and learn to love and learn to be kind he said you don't make our home life different he said it'll make every relationship you have a little different and he says and god will honor you for it the brother man begins to talk about the turmoil that was in his home at a certain day and now brother brown he calls he says it like this he says you can see people that here they are in my home they're staying in hotels they're all showing up to come and they want to have a meeting with brother branham they want to be prayed for i mean sometimes you and i think about maybe our privacy think of brother brandon when he describes it right here he doesn't just say people were sitting in his living room he said people were in his basement this day people walking around in his basement people all through his house they were going about three hours brother baby said he had cases of mental cases and nervous cases and he said people walking around that were saying you better listen to what i'm going to say because i got a word from the lord i've got thus saith the lord for you and you need to listen to me if you don't you're going to die brother bryan said i had all sorts of things like that going on very key phrase brother ram says right here he says sometimes you have to put up with those things that's a powerful statement isn't it because you because sometimes we'd be ready to say you know what there's a door right there because brother branham said it just as much as you and i could say it as well brother brown said god speaks to me as much as he speaks to you i mean you know when you think of but you recognize of where where the situation was at there in that home my what a what a situation that that was taking place and brother brown begins to talk about how things that were going on that that had happened that among people coming in there and then you had all this disturbance that was going on in the home with becky and sarah you know there was fussing and fighting and everything going on but you know why all that was it wasn't because they were bad kids it's because there was and there was other atmospheres that were coming in there can you imagine having people walk up and down your house and and telling you well i got thus saith the lord for you and heaven and people all around in your house i tell you it wouldn't be like a christmas gathering this was not like a thanksgiving gathering this brought tension in that home because brother bran brings it on down it's spirits it's things that's being dealt with it wasn't that the kids were bad it was situations that was going on and you know when you when you think about it brother adam said there was only one thing i like how he says this he says when i looked around i thought there's just one thing to do we've got to change this situation when i think of that that statement that is placed right there that makes you and i aware of that as a son and daughter of god that we've got access unto god this this faith this grace that paul said we now stand in to think in the midst of that time there's only one thing to do i've got to change this situation and it wasn't because well brother branham was the prophet of god that the situation will be changed but as a son of god here he stands as a husband and as a father there's a need in his home a need for peace the enemy has come in in situations that sometimes we could look at that would seem like how could that have been that seems harmless those seems like situations where people are wanting help but notice how it came in to where there was such a tension that was in the home to where sister meaty would tell him billy help me i'm about ready to go out of my mind i know we've heard this before but see brother branham he says he come to that place and he's asking god to help him in his heart he's saying god that you would help me and look how he says this lord you help me now to get upon me the holy spirit in such a way that will change this situation he's standing as a channel and he knows just as he's a channel standing there on the platform night after night a channel for god to come and deliver his word through to you and i right now he's got to be a channel for what's going on in his home let me just say something like this if every if only thing a person can be is a channel at church you're only half a christian i've got to just say it plain because this gospel walks in shoe leather this same gospel whatever the channel is here it's got to be the same channel at home we just should not be any different outside of church than what we are inside of church it shouldn't matter who we're around or where we're with we are always available to god here he stood as a channel in that time help me lord to get the holy spirit upon me in such a way what if brother branham would have been drawn out which would have been very easy for him to be when people walking around the house telling him all sorts of things like that thus saith the lord this and thus saith the lord that what if brother branham would it have got under his dander just for a little bit i'll tell you what this situation would have been different can't you see why the enemy at different times why he wants to come at us he wants to attack us even before you get home from your job even before you get into other situations even before you get to the house of god he wants things to come up what to do what hinder your life as a channel to where you become so twisted up hey come on this isn't beyond us elisha was a channel of god as a prophet of god but just because he was a prophet of god didn't mean he had a switch of off and on he knew the situation he was in he was a little bit upset and he needed a minstrel to come and minister to his situation brother branham was set in the back office and say my spirit is so nervous so tore up from everything that's going on today i needed that song service hearing those songs that were being sung why to get him into a place to where now as a channel that god could come down and speak and manifest himself in that service and that's the same way that's just not for a minister that's that's for every one of us how that the enemy that's why he battles the way that he does so to think of it in this in this way you know brother branham as he takes it and you know it isn't anything real spiritually says to her i'll just say it like this a bible study wouldn't have done it right now are you hearing me bible study wouldn't have done it with sister meaty right now she needed she needed the presence of god brought near to her that same message that was preached now come in contact and applied to that situation oh my the token is not something we talk about the token is not just an experience and then it doesn't apply to the rest of our life it is the experience of the holy ghost in our life that now it is applied to every situation amen as a channel of god's peace think of it how that brother man tells us he began to talk to her you know about about a blouse that he saw that don't seem very spiritual at all but you see what's happening it's not so much about the blouse brown makes this statement he kept talking to her now brother banham would have told her there ain't no reason to be upset you're a daughter of god your daughter of abraham no reason just come on snap out of it you wouldn't have worked you with me he's approaching the situation this is an example for you and i but you know what it is sometimes sometimes we don't want to take the time i'm just going to get right down on it sometimes we do you know it's incredible how people can just say well you just have faith but when they're in the situation tell them just to have faith oh i need cough syrup just have faith come on somebody it's amazing you know what it is it's a part of humanity that's wanting to try to handle the word instead of being a channel for the word to flow through my we are the situation we're dealing with we're talking about being sons and daughters of god not just commanding things out of our out of well i'm going to command this out of the home and command this out of the marriage no rebuke the wind but speak to the sea rebuke the wind that's coming and sometimes that rebuke it's not even in front of your family it's not in front of your wife it's there in prayer oh my where you're standing there in prayer and you see certain things that are wanting to come into the home maybe it's anxiousness maybe it's nervousness maybe it's other things and you stand right there in prayer and you rebuke that spirit in the name of the lord jesus christ but you speak to the son or daughter of god as a channel of god's peace and let's just be honest friends there's none of us that come into these things and we've got it all together we don't have it all together we're learning we're learning as we go along and there's situations within this time that there's always an understanding there's a growing there's a lit listening remember when we're looking at adam and eve and looking at the control that god had placed the authority in adam's life he was walking under the word of god and when eve could say ooh that wind adam would say wind be still he was addressing those needs that were right there brother brown said it like this he says i kept talking to her how many know sometimes you just have to keep talking sometimes it isn't even that particular situation where it unfolds right then and there sometimes you just got to keep talking is that right sometimes it's over the course it could be maybe there's been a situation in the home situation of family you got to keep talking but let me tell you something if you've got an avenue to where you can get to that place to where you can talk that's a good place to be because it's a place that god can work keep he kept talking to her changing what was he doing changing that atmosphere laying my hand on her brother bram said after a while she was all smiles and then there was peace in the home he said we've got to change the situation you know he says it's an atmosphere that counts and you make up that atmosphere with what you are inside of you brother braham says it this way concerning this event in another place in the message he says you know he said what i was doing i was projecting creating a different atmosphere walk in the love of god have fellowship that's very crucial right there walk in the love of god have fellowship because our authority it comes from god our strength in in every situation i can go back through through my life and through our lives i can remember a situation where my wife and i we had just very early on we had a miscarriage and i can remember the situation like i'm down in the i was down in the basement it was when it during the time of summer i'm down in the storage room where i would go and pray at different times and all of a sudden i remember as i come up out of that out of that basement or i was in the basement i began to hear this crying and it just it was different i heard my wife this was something that was different i recognized this is some something's going on here and i walked up the stairs and i went there and i began to and i heard her and she was of course you you could understand where she was at within it and at that moment in that time how god just began to minister and help us in that situation to everything that laid before us within that day and then on coming days so much that was involved with the spirit and your emotions and i i'm just going to say it say it like this there's things that i i i look at that and i say god i thank you for your grace that when that came about that i was there in prayer there was a strength that was given brother samuel aren't you always the son of god i am the son of god at all times sometimes we're in situations that when you can look at it that is not it's not something we're called out of prayer but this is where it comes down to paul said pray without ceasing is always is being in that place of prayer and walking in love in the love of god to walk in it is to let our lives be influenced by it to take that word in because it's not just about oh what situation's going to come up don't even look at it that way but understand as we're walking in the love of god there's a maturing there's a growing that's going on i think of how you know when brother wayne was here i think it was on sunday and he made a statement and then he just kept on moving but the word beholding beholding his face and when you look at to behold behold it's not just something where it's a quick glance but you looked into and you're beholding and as you behold the bible says we are changed from glory unto glory david said all that i would dwell in the house of the lord too behold his beauty so beholding him there is a changing and a maturing that's going on in our life and also preparing us no matter what situation comes we've got a refuge and a strength to face that situation mr bannon says here he said just after a few moments you know when sister media she finally started smiling and things like that he kept talking to her when she got quiet sarah and becky divided up the play blocks joseph got him something to play with and there was peace in the home what was it projecting love they were mine my children my wife and i was god and then god giving his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family sovereign grace came in and quietened the family he was standing there as a son of god a channel and god was able to come down notice he says his spirit came with love for my family remember love is part love love also has understanding and understanding doesn't mean knowledge so much but understanding is that which looks at something and says i may not understand it here but i understand this is a need this is a situation for this person or for this individual and you're standing there as a channel for god to come on the scene second thessalonians 3 16 the bible says the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the lord be with you all how many believe that and knows that god gives peace always no matter the circumstances no matter the situations god gives peace and the peace we're talking about is that peace that comes from the kingdom of god not the peace that's from this world because that's not a true that's not godly peace it's not a true peace it's a peace that actually is bondage that leads to strife it doesn't bring a settledness but god's peace that issues in in the midst of a situation it comes i think about says it in the amplified bible it says that at all times and in all ways under all circumstances and conditions whatever comes the lord be with you all what a comfort what a reality that within that no matter what circumstances come no matter what conditions arise the lord of peace is right there to give us peace in our lives here's what david would write under inspiration in psalms 147 verse 14 he maketh peace in thy borders he maketh peace he's the one that gives peace to our life and to our home in john chapter 10 verse 9 jesus said i am the door and by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly i believe this is this is a checkpoint for everything that even that we would entertain or or take in in our life if it can't come through and by the door then we don't accept it if it can't pass through the door we don't accept it satan's avenue let me say this as the scripture said satan will come in every other avenue and when he comes some other way you already know it is not the chief shepherd this is a thief and a robber because jesus himself said i am the door and what god gives to you and i it doesn't take peace from us but it gives peace to us it increases peace in our life he said i'm come that you might have life and have it beyond imagination beyond the bible said what you can even imagine so to think within our lives you know brother adam will continue to pick this this thought up of how that things would come about in our life where he said sometimes he said family would try to fuss at you and is your life worthy of the gospel and he says but don't fuss back at him he said instead just let him know i'm going to be praying for you he said but rather be full of love let me tell you there is one feeling but many refillings jude would write to the church of the living god and say that we are to keep ourselves in the love of god looking to the coming of the lord and so in ourselves we are a little creator we create an atmosphere we create that atmosphere brother ram tells us by the life that we live the way we talk and their conversations uh you you know whether it's with people at work or even in your home if you start getting a little bit negative start getting a little critical you know there's an atmosphere that changes in your home and maybe your criticism really has nothing to do with your husband your wife maybe there's been some events through the day or certain things that you started thinking on and dwelling on and it starts affecting you it starts coming into your spirit it's right there and then it starts affecting even the way that you respond to different things let me just say this to you it really doesn't matter all the words that could be said spirits will travel on words it'll cause an atmosphere to come into that home you might say brother samuel i am a believer but remember that in our lives it it comes to a place that we must have our lives continually into the word and being washed by the water of the word you know as brother brahman says we create an atmosphere by the life we live the way we talk in our conversations and he says you know there's times he said where you you see people and you think oh no here they come they're going to be criticizing somebody or you know here comes somebody else and all they do is you know they they they tell certain dirty jokes and things like that and you turn away from them right because you realize what kind of atmosphere they're going to bring i worked with people that way you know oh here they come they're going to be running down the boss they're going to be doing this i mean you can even have it listen let's not just leave it out there it can be right even in church you're going to have people and you realize oh i mean they're going to talk about somebody they're going to say this about something i'll say this but you see we recognize that creates an atmosphere that's not an atmosphere that allows really for the peace of god or for growth to come about think about it he says the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere the things you think about things you talk about the bible says in isaiah chapter 26 verse 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee this is god's promise i'll keep him in a state of perfect peace whose mind has stayed on me let me just give you a little background on this scripture this scripture has to deal with when israel receives her visitation from god when the when the two witnesses are standing there and ministering the baptism of the holy ghost jerusalem is being encompassed in that time but yet the presence of god coming in the midst and gathering that 144 000 unto himself it stabilizes them in the midst of that hour just as his presence has stabilized the bride in psalms 27. the host should encamp round about me but in this will i be confident this because situations and and things all around but to think god's promise is thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee what kind of words that in the amplified bible says you will guard him and keep him in perfect and constant peace whose mind both his inclination and its character is stayed on you because he commits himself to you leans on you and hopes confidently in you let me just let me just move down here just over a few things to get to this point here you know brother brown talks to us in different places in the message and he'll speak of how brother wayne mentioned it one of the nights but looking back on this from some weeks ago and how that brother bamwood would speak to us in different places of the message of how that you know franklin discovered electricity but edison got a hold of it and edison said i believe this electricity will work for us it'll it'll benefit us brother branham would pick it up like this and he would say the same power of god that has raised us from a sinner to a child of god that same power he said will work in our life for many different things if we'll only allow him to you see everything god knows the things that you and i would be faced with god knew things that would come about even laying before us and remember tests and trials are not our enemy somebody said lord help me help me they're not our enemy yet the tests and trials that come our way are times of molding let me just say this a test and trial it's not just something you know sometimes that we look at that you know it's just something out here but sometimes a test and trial is even where there's expression that maybe you've been hurt someone said something a certain way and it hasn't been somebody in the world it's been from another believer or been from somebody else right around are you hearing me it's been right right around that way you know i think of one and this comes to me i gotta tell it i was talking to brother homer here a few weeks ago and brother homer said you know he said i know he said i really can't preach he said and he was just talking about things he said but i'll tell you what he said now my wife he said i got up and preached at a man's church he said and the brother had invited me and he said he told me he said you know homer he said you really can't preach he said but every time he said you minister he said god comes and helps the people brother homer said no that didn't bother me he said because i already know i can't preach he said but for my wife that was another story so sometimes in those in situations of of how that we're we're looking at things how things can work in such a a different way sometimes and sometimes when things come at us remember you know we're so full of forgiveness when nobody's offended us i mean every it's easy to forgive when there's nobody to forgive right i mean it's easy to if any man have a quarrel let him well there's no problem i don't have no quarrels but you see when there's things that arise like that that require us that requires something greater than ourselves and listen as a child of god you do not want the things of the world and those things i'm talking about even thoughts to entertain or to rest in your life because it isn't so much about the other person it's about your walk with god and listen it matters what we think and what we entertain and the things that we think in satan's objective is always to try to hinder that channel and that flow in our life and i want you to think of this here brother brown says if we can just study he says like i have water here and i know i need crops watered over there now what if i had somebody brother bill you had a well and you needed to water crops now what if you came and said let's say i need to get these crops watered and i sat down with you and i told you and said well let's look at the land you know to survey the land you've got to kind of look at it a little bit sorry the earth ain't flat you got to kind of look at it a little bit and you got to find out because there's laws and if you can find those laws laws of gravity you notice you spill water on the table it'll find the lowest point right but you've got to find how the channel of those laws to it'll take that water to that up to that field now brother bill we can sit there and brother bill's like come on brother samuel come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on i said wait a minute we got to look at this land a little bit we got to survey it because we've got to find how that that water will flow on its own and get it there we might have to dig a little bit here clear out an obstacle there but remember it's not us that's going to transport the water from there to there all we have to do is look for that channel that it'll flow through and if there's anything in the way get it out of the way so the water can get from there to there now it don't matter how much i tell brother bill there if brother bill comes back the next day first time to tell me how to get this you know what it is he's not wanting to do it because the channel is being made known you got to clear out a little bit of this sometimes the things that we got to clear out and we're wanting the spirit of god to come into a situation it don't have nothing to do with the water no problem with the holy ghost in every situation it's a lot of things to do with ourselves are you with me when brother branham was standing there in his home brother branham could allowed himself to be a hindrance but instead it was a channel and he asked god help me to be a channel in my home help me to be a channel that the holy ghost can come upon me to quieten her to settle her to bring her back into that place of peace what did brother banham have to do he put on an apron he began to put his hand on her back begin to talk to her begin to speak about things here was a man that spoke deep mysteries are you with me it was a channel that god used in this hour to speak profound mysteries to you and i and in the midst of this time here he is a channel clearing things out so the holy spirit can minister to his wife it wouldn't have mattered how much brother what brother brown could have done it still had to be the holy ghost to come on the scene i'll tell you for every situation in our life in our homes we need the holy ghost that's why every home is to have the token applied in your life as a husband as a wife and over that home and everything you do you apply the token if you can't do it with the token applied don't do it because it'll only bring bondage it'll only bring a hindrance and it'll cause that channel to be all plugged up samuel that's pretty simple but a lot of times it's a little simple things that we overlook and we wonder why where where is the supply where is the water going nothing wrong with the water sometimes it's the channel you know brother branham tells us we get to looking at we talk about the right approach he said if you just get the right approach to it brother brown tells us like this and greatest battle ever fought spoken words original seed and he speaks of taking in the word of god into our life and he said it's not it's not positive thinking it's the word of god it's a take in the word and you know i want you to think about how many times that we've maybe you're here tonight how many times we've come into situations we come into the house of god and we say lord i need a move i need you to speak to me tonight i i need you to speak personally to my life in a very personal way and god will come down and god will minister he'll speak to our life see when you're expecting and you're open and saying god i need you to come lord and to speak to me he'll come and speak to your life he'll come and speak very personally to your life and at that time it's time to take that word take it into your mind so take it into your mind because it's the word that has life into it and when it comes down in here it brings life sometimes it sometimes we don't we know this as believers we don't see results like this and sometimes because we don't see results then we then we wonder and say well you know lord what do i do in this you gotta you have to take the word that's been given and act upon it believing it and watering it that's the same thing when you're if you come for prayer you listen there's there's no man whether it's myself whether it's any other minister no man is going to stand right here and oh my that brother's gonna pray for me and this is all gonna no it's our faith in the word of god that's a finished work if we're looking at that that's the wrong approach it comes down to this is god's word we're following his word we're going to stand on his word and we look at it and say lord if there's anything in me and oh brother samuel if there's anything in me but do we really believe that sometimes we look at ourselves like oh my really brother samuel is there anything in me we'll say oh god if there's anything in me but really what if god says yeah there is lord me me lord you see how much do we because listen friends when we're looking at times even in situations and in things that come about troubling of things that comes about even in a way it becomes to evaluation in our life brother braham says examine your life by the word that's not going into some sort of purgatory or some sort of pittance but it's examining our life by the word and saying god if there's something that's out of line let it be lined up with you lord jesus because we know we need him oh my this is why the bible says submit yourselves therefore to god and resist the devil and he will flee from you but his very key part that verse submit yourselves that's the first thing submit is to yield and then resist him draw nine to god and he'll draw nine to you brother brown takes that that that particular phrase over and over through the message brother bram says in our lives he says if we could just walk in the spirit more like we should and he takes us to luke 24 when they were clopius and a friend were walking the rest of they were speaking and talking and thinking about jesus and what did it do it invited him out from shadows and types and he drew near to them because there was an atmosphere that they were in talking thinking about him you say by the same listen the bible said they were sad in their communications but in the midst of their sadness they were still talking about him they were talking about him they were thinking about the events they didn't understand what had taken place but they were thinking upon those things and he drew near that's why brother braham says in a service now i think about this not just in a service but what about in every in our everyday life keep your mind centered on him and let's just be honest our minds are bombarded every which way there's things that come all the time to try to take your peace there's things that you you that look that even in this past year year and a half i i don't know but of things that i mean i don't know if anybody has any confidence in the media anymore i don't know but you understand i i don't i'm just being honest i don't waste my time with it but i just it's amazing of the things that sometimes that is said and things that are put out there on the headline if you just read the headline you read the first little bit or if you just read one particular story and you don't read the other perspective the other part not just the perspective but other facts about it let me give you an example here is here is a headline about here's a young boy goes to disneyland he's vaccinated he passes away but the other side of the story that's not told is that this young boy is terminal cancer you see satan is a master of propaganda you understand me i'm gonna talk about conspiracy theories i'm talking about that even in the midst of this hour what about that man that stood in his his wife's room he looked at the monitor that monitor wasn't fake news are you hearing me it wasn't fake news that monitor right there he was speaking things that was going on with his wife but he chose to look at a different report when caleb and joshua came back they never came back and said these guys are a bunch of liars there ain't giants over there they never said that but you can't find one place in the scripture that joshua and caleb focused on the giants that was not what dominated their tents the rest of them look what was going on in their tents they were talking about the giants how impossible it was everything was going on look what was going on in their tents wailing and weeping and but not in joshua and caleb's tent joshua and caleb said wait a minute god has brought us here to this hour and this is where we're standing the same god that brought us here is the same god that will take us the rest away it's focusing on the god who is present he stabilizes our life i'm not talking about you understand about being in a hole but brother braham says we got our mind upon so much other stuff he said we got so much our mind up on business deals minds he set upon the newest soap detergent the newest this and the newest biss and i could just add into that the newest iphone the newest this and the newest that and there's not things there's sometimes where there's things that we have to be focused upon but then there's other times we have to realize that wait a minute here this right here is troubling my life it's taking peace away from my life things you begin to speak on and talk on you know how it is there can be real problems at work but it's how much you talk about it there's got to be a time where you cut it and say that's enough but samuel that's real practical you can put that in your lunchbox though it's wisdom on how when things are going on even within the home because we want our lives we want an atmosphere where the holy spirit is invited he's free to move is that right this is where we want to keep our minds centered on him let's just let's just close let me just close with this this one right here brother brown says just keep him on your mind keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises if you get sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised from my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i was healed keep your mind centered like that see god what this is not god's duty this is our duty keep your mind centered like that something look at this will happen to you something will draw nigh to you an anointing will come on you and out of that chair you'll go draw nigh to god and he'll draw nigh unto you i'm not telling you not to read the news not to look at it but i think you know exactly what the holy spirit has said here you things that you give yourself to if things are troubling you you need to get away from it if it's hindering your faith get away from it things that you give yourself to it's what you focus on that hinders it can either invite the peace of god or to hinder the peace of god in your life and i say oh god what what we have been given in this hour how when i when i say the message that god has given us i'm talking about the person of jesus christ that is right here in the ship and brother brahm said that same god who was over the wind over the sea he said isn't he the same god that can take over this dirt this body no matter what situation it is he's still the lord of all peace i'm glad for that tonight i'm glad to be a witness of that tonight glad to be a channel that the peace of god and i said god help me to stay a channel that that atmosphere can move move through can flow and if there's anything that's in the way help me to clear it out of the way help me to clear it out of the way you know the bible says live live peaceably with all men as much as lies within you is that right but it also doesn't mean we compromise for peace because peace is never gained by compromise there's sometimes there's things where you just simply on your job or in other situations you have to just let it go for what for the sake of peace is that right or sometimes we're finding out who's right really isn't the necessary part it's just simply to recognize we want peace we want peace let's go on amen you love him amen let's pray lord jesus lord i i thank o god as your prophet would describe this age that we live in and he would write of it lord in this manner an age unfit for human beings to live in with nervous tensions pressures lord we see here tonight just even an example lord that we looked into the prophet's home we've seen these things lord maybe not the exact same circumstances or cause we we can see this lord that how that satan desires in very subtle ways to try to take peace away from our lives lord may we oh god i pray just just drawing from the admonition of the holy spirit tonight the lord if there's if there's one here that would be listening that that doesn't know you lord in that way where there's a real peace on the inside in their soul may they just reach out to you tonight lord just a lord to lay hold upon the very one who's speaking to their heart to let them know that i'm your peace i can settle i'll bring a settling to your life a quietness where there's a rest to relieve the weary and the labor and the heavy load of sin [Music] grant that tonight and i know tonight lord that i'm speaking to hearts [Music] that can relate but also lord know just how how important lord in this direction that you would give us lord through your word being channels of peace oh god that the very things that we would think on i think it lord to be very fitting how you would instruct joshua meditate meditate on the word of god psalms 1 would write of a blessed man one who's not caught up in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord david would write in another place great great peace have they that loved thy law oh lord oh god if there ever is a time ever a moment that we can recognize as the children of god that there's one place lord that we can draw peace from that's from you lord that in the midst of a of situations and things that come about because blessed are the peacemakers this word as it deals with makers and maintainers of peace sometimes lord it's working to maintain the peace and that direction of what you've given in our home and in our life we learn how to go about certain things i think of it on the job sometimes lord as people will learn on the job and you learn in your home you learn certain things that will just causes things to run a little bit more smoother it just helps things along the way oh god help us lord because there's one objective that we have lord and that's to see you glorified lord we're only passing through this life this is the this is the shortest span of time we're only here for just but a moment jane james called it lord a vapor it's so brief that on a tombstone they just put a dash but help us god that for every moment lord that we're here this is our desire we may not be known for anything else we may not be known lord for this one prayed for me or that but what we're known as as a child of god blessed are the peacemakers lord you spoke to us so clearly we realize that doesn't mean going along with sin [Music] but god how did you give us a witness and a direction i think of how the prophet stood there we heard it again this weekend and he spoke to that infidel now he never came out and rebuked that infidel for being an infidel [Music] he did say at that moment he said well nothing to be too proud of but he addressed the situation that was present lord help us lord to operate in that discernment to rebuke the wind but to speak peace to the sea that storm that would want to come and lord trouble and try to trouble in our home may we stand lord may husbands may men of god daughters of god wives mothers fathers lord standing o god in the midst of that time when things want to encroach maybe it's lord upon loved ones they're not even under the roof anymore but they can stand there as a son and daughter of god and say satan take your hands off of them [Music] i've already claimed them over here lord loosen every band upon their life cause them to turn to you lord grant it lord i believe that with all my heart lord [Music] give us grace lord and favor lord to be able to speak lord to that sea to be able to minister lord to that spirit that's under the effect of god from a strong storm of wind lord like sister meaty's spirit was so torn the children lord were reeling under the effects of that but god here was a son of god that took dominion in his home and he did it by the word he never went around and told little joseph now you stopped doing this becky and sarah you stop no change the atmosphere and when the atmosphere was changed how everything itself took right in order playing begin to resume the right way god you're interested in every part of our life and i pray father for each need lord and for every life as it's gathered here [Music] we just want to receive that lord right here tonight if there's a lord a life that's here a heart we all stand there many times lord that lord how do i get the water from here to down there may you just come lord direct us in the right approach that we can get the water from the well to the field lord we pray you've given us your word lord in this hour get it into that place lord that we can see these these places lord help us lord i pray help your children in jesus name you know the bible says in the book of philippians be careful for nothing [Music] but it said with prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known unto god and the peace of god shall keep your hearts and your minds through christ jesus then paul would go on to think on certain things now to think of that you know prayer and supplication it's actually two parts you enter into prayer first of all just worshiping him prayer is really not about even it's not about requests prayer is about just entering in just starting to worship just worshiping brother braham says you enter into prayer you just begin to worship him lord jesus i love you lord you're so wonderful and he said you'll find you begin to worship him his presence will draw nigh then you find after you've had that that time of just worshiping then you let your supplications which are your requests to be made known you find those pair of prayer and supplication all through the scripture it's where there's needs but notice how paul said to let it be known with thanksgiving that god you're mindful you know what i have need of you've never failed lord you've answered prayers sometimes maybe not the way i want them but you've always answered every prayer you've watched over my life you've guided me lord what is it that's with thanksgiving with thanksgiving and then as you begin to enter into that place you find yourself tapping into a place the peace of god all night just begins to move pulsate right through your life keeps your hearts and minds brother brown talks about a another another woman [Music] remember she's the one in question answer 64 she she calls she said a statement the ram i've dreamed i'm in white sands i'm so overtaken i i don't know what's going on there's such a darkness or we're under such stress brother brandon begins to look at it and he says sister he said here's the trouble he said the white sands represents purity and righteousness he said but you've let satan put one over on you and he started to trouble you so she began to you know she began to take something that god meant for her in a good way but you see how the enemy began to take that and twist it around just like he can take a quote or a scripture and twist it around and instead of her something that should have brought peace brother brandon says that's your whole family in white sands he said they're standing where they need to be but he said what it is he says you've let the enemy come in and brother brahm takes that scripture he says think on things of a good report see the way that even of things that maybe she couldn't have understood that but she could stand there and say i know where my heart is at with god i know there's one desire that i have above everything else that she would be able to stand there and battle against that not allow the enemy to come in but you know it shows sometimes the weakness that's about [Music] us brown talks about another situation maybe you're not familiar with maybe you are [Music] sister meaty she was getting ready you remember they told her she couldn't have no more children here comes along [Music] sarah remember brother branham god spoke to him and said you're going to have a joseph here comes a little girl sarah a different one said maybe you meant josephine abraham said no he spoke to me joseph is coming the doctors told them before they had sarah she shouldn't have no more children then sarah come along then here this is she shouldn't have no more children but you think how the enemy worked this at work came in this situation there came a woman around and this woman come around the house and begin to come around and she was trying to tell brother branham that he needed to listen to her and she better do this and better do that he better do this and do that because if he doesn't god's going to take him and he goes ahead something's going to happen to you telling sister meeting now you know you would look at that and think somebody just brushed that off but it troubled sister meaty it troubled her think about it here's what she knows what the doctor has already said and where she's at it's troubling her brother brown says i slipped away from the house and i went out to the cave and i began to pray and he said god told me to go back and get my bible and he opened the bible to a place god opened it for him a place in the word and he took it back right there sister media went right into labor and here came little joseph you see the enemy he's an opportunist [Music] you try to move in and try to bring fear and try to bring in in situations brother bram says he'll even move in on a child he doesn't the enemy doesn't care in any way say oh god if we can see that here was children of god and things came about in their life don't you let the enemy beat you up when you've
