that's just lord jesus [Music] what a privilege and what an honor it is lord [Music] to know lord jesus lord we are being brought back home lord it's the spirit of that land oh god that has went forth to speak to our hearts and call us back home lord we see even where israel the trumpets sounding supernaturally to gather them back home lord we realize that every time when the trumpets are sounded there's a signification there's a gathering that takes place in that gathering is for a purpose lord jesus you might make yourself known to them and to seal that 144 000 [Music] lord jesus we're aware that what you are doing for israel you have done for us lord jesus the sounding in this hour we realize there's the song is wrote gentile days lord jesus we're so thankful that lord you sounded to our hearts lord o lord jesus it was your voice your spirit that called to us it was a call from home lord god here we were walking wondering we never could fit into this world as much as we could try but it just can never fit in [Music] lord how thankful we are for that sometimes in our life lord god it would cause us great sorrows we would wonder why why why but we're so thankful dear god because now we know why we can never fully fit in and be comfortable in the world because we were not of the world the lord you come you come and you let us know lord jesus you've brought us to yourself oh god we've been sealed with your spirit lord dear god as we've received the earnest in our soul oh god we have a great expectation lord god lord one of these moments these bodies are going to be changed we can say truly as those of old we are pilgrims and strangers our goals our focus our ambitions is not upon this world we're seeking a city that have foundations oh lord jesus we are delegates of that city lord oh how we thank you lord we appreciate you this morning may you just lord i pray just continue to move in lord upon our lives may the spirit of god lord just moving if there's one heart that lord has not heard that call may they hear it the spirit may they respond to that may they just yield to you and allow you to perform your good word through their hearts or do we just ask that you would just have your way for every need upon the hearts of your children lord god we place it on the altar of god in the name of jesus christ and we believe lord god in jesus name amen amen amen god bless you this morning and so good to be in the house of the lord isn't it good to see amen different ones and then some different ones that we see back here with us and it's always good you know it's just uh it's just something about as i heard brother branham tell us here the other day he takes that scripture out of ephesians 1 he has blessed us together with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places brother brown just simply said it like this he said see together he said we were meant together together amen not to be off on our own but we were made to gather together and you know it's something about it that's just so real you know when the love of god has so struck your heart it's just something about it you just you long to be amen where other saints of god are sometimes there's situations there's things that come up we've got different ones that you know anymore in the time we're living in and if you hear somebody sick about oh my goodness what do they got they're sick i mean yeah and so we realized that sometimes people deal you know with different things that come up but i'm so thankful that the stabilizers are put on the ship aren't you amen i'm glad that god is in control amen and he's he's directing he's directing every part of this amen for his glory amen so we just we're just so happy to be gathered together here this morning um let's just turn our attention here to the word of the lord um in colossians i'd like to go there first and in colossians chapter one we want to pull that in verse 12. amen bobby sister michelle god bless you it's good to see you amen i know greg and sister suzanne you've all had a quite a process but god is so good at me amen so good so let's just look here into the word and verse verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we want to continue to just looking at this the redemption of sons and daughters of god and we see this scripture giving thanks unto the father who have made us meet and that that whole part made us meet is that now he is the one who has qualified us we are qualified then to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light qualified is to make us bringing us into a place to now where we can actually be a partaker of the inheritance that always belong to us as sons and daughters of god and when you look at the the just the few scriptures that we have read here in the opening of our text you recognize that this as it says giving thanks unto the father we realize that by the grace of god in the evening light that has come to us that we're not speaking of three different people we're not speaking of two different people but we recognize that it was the father above us then when as he came down and he stepped in the body that he created in order to redeem you and i through that body it was now god with us and then after he ascended he come back in the form of the holy ghost and it is now god in us this is why when romans 8 is a scripture to the heart of a believer that says who can lay any charge to god's elect it is god who justified so we we've not been not by another person or someone different but it is god himself and he is the word when you think of the word or if i speak of those things this morning don't think of the word as the letter the word is the person of jesus christ himself it is god and we know that without coming back into john 1 but it is true that the word so it is the word itself and we see in this in verse 13 notice he qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints and light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness so before there can be a translating there must come a deliverance of the hold of darkness that's a whole process of where the evil spirit that would want to hold over a person and say wait wait wait wait wait or that of the darkness that could be even around them and there's habits and everything else still in the life but there is delivering power in the blood of the one who hath called you unto himself there's power to bring deliverance and now from deliverance then he translates us now this translating there's no one a man can do this for us it takes the work of the living god to bring us from where we are to where we need to be and you know what's powerful is that you can sit right in your seat and right while the word is taking place all of this can happen right there it's all how god deals sovereignly with each and every person what i'm saying is that translating is not a new church or that translating is not uh it's not something that's out here but that translating is to where that the holy spirit to where god has so moved in that life to where now that life has moved into a place in god to where it is as paul would write christ who is our life we are dead and our lives are hidden in god through christ that's the sovereign work of almighty god and you know the works that god does as it says in the book of ecclesiastes his works stand his works testify of themselves and you see this is there in the scripture when we speak of this uh inheritance that we have and i want to be looking at that term here this morning of inheritance and here in ephesians 1 verse 11 paul would write in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ i don't care how you read it in the scripture you can never read into the scripture and see the real redeeming work of the lord jesus christ and take any credit for it in your life the only thing you can say is it's him it's him it's what he started in my life he's the one that gave me strength when i fell down when i felt discouraged he encouraged me it's all him it's his work this is where paul could bring it into such a place in the ephesians uh uh letter that we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works now brother branham takes this here and in the adoption series he's working with this inheritance that lays that is that that lays or that is for us and he says look he has predestinated us unto this inheritance if i'm a right inheritance of something if god is knocking at my heart and saying william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there's nothing i could do but in the fullness of time god sent in his own good time jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance the sonship to be a son of god hallelujah an inheritance is what always belonged to you this is why when the scriptures when we see we see clearly and brother bannon picks this up jesus never gave me an inheritance he said my inheritance was first but god sent jesus god came down and he made that inheritance real to you and me hallelujah that inheritance that we would be the word we could see that clear back in the time of jeremiah sealed in an earthen vessel we can see that there is a promise that there are children of god that are going to come back into this expression back into that reality of a real son and daughter of god that's our inheritance let me just say this when that as it rings out in our heart you have a right it's god ministering to you and i this is your right amen hallelujah brother branham would say it like this and deity of jesus christ he said the devil is trying to make you think you're some trodden down something but you're not your sons and daughters of god [Applause] it's the devil trying to make you feel that way think that way but let me tell you the word will always come it'll deal with issues in our life but it comes to cut away and to lift up that life in the liberty that belongs to them as sons and daughters of god that's the real work of redemption you see this is where our inheritance here if you want to see the will being opened we read that last week in isaiah 53 who hath believed our will the inheritance that is whoever believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord reveal the report is sure in john 14 6 jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me in hebrews 7 22 by so much notice how paul paul would pick this out by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament and they were truly many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death you see every one of those priests they would live to a certain place and then they died and then here another one would come they would die it spoke even of that death that was coming to them that the true had not come yet that was only a time of the anatype that would come he who is our true high priest and you and i needed this high priest we needed god to become our high priest without him becoming our high priest there's no way that we could get back to god but god oh glory be to god to become a high priest is one who was willing to release and stand in the gap for you and me it's one who was willing to say i forsake everything else and i do everything that my brethren might obtain the inheritance it's one who is a servant and if that is the life that brought that came down was a life of service so much that jesus could say the son of man he came not to be served but to serve if that life if it moved in the groom that way it will also move in the bright body that way that it is not us serving our own will but we seek to serve the will of almighty god hallelujah oh my but this man verse 24 oh i love that but this man because he continueth ever hath and unchangeable priesthood he's made a priest after the power of an endless life the devil tried he tried to stop it you couldn't stop it hey the body was put to death but you can't kill god but that was all part of the mystery there had to be a purchase prize that was made to settle the debt but once the debt was paid hallelujah since deposited put back up on the one who's the instigator of it in the very beginning then he rose up on that easter morning brother he rose up in victory as the mighty conqueror he had overcome what was here in this realm and he went down into the lowest realms and he overcame what does that say if he is in you you are more than a match for the devil greater is he that is in you this is where the reality of a son and daughter of god it doesn't matter what realms are all around them it doesn't matter what realm that they're facing there is one who has already overcome in every realm [Applause] greater is he that's in you this is the promise of this hour that the word would be manifested in every realm hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah wherefore he is able can i have a little bit more paul give me a little more here number one wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them i like this he's able to save to the uttermost this word uttermost means perfection he's able to bring to a complete work it's that which is no longer you holding on but it's him holding you notice this comes that come unto god by him he's the word seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them that's pretty powerful he already made intercession for you and i yeah intercession was made clear back before the foundation of the world jesus echoed that prayer of intercession in john 17. and that intercession is still going forth even as the word is being ministered and the spirit of god dealing with ministers hearts brothers and sisters hearts that listen this is why when the scripture says we are to pray for the perfection of others it's not talking about we're going to no longer make a mistake i know we're not talking about that we're talking about the perfection of the soul because it must be god to come it's got to be god to work on that life it takes god working on that life and god to bring it all the way this is why through the scriptures and we see that we're we're not people who's ignorant and walking around and just pretending hey listen we're to be mindful we're to be in prayer and to recognize that if someone is not where they should be we regard that and say god that you would move for them lord bring them into this glory lord that what you have revealed in my life oh god what it will mean to them lord that standing as a priest of god now the scripture as it speaks of that intercession paul would write throughout of of christ as our high priest and he remember he had become a high priest that as a priest would come into a place they they come in or they're ordained for men in order to offer things uh pertaining to god and and paul would write in this manner who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way i want you to catch this compassion because he says in that he himself is compassed about with infirmity there was no weakness in on the inside did jesus experience temptation did he experience sickness yes are you with me so the bible said he was tempted in all points such as we are is that right yeah without sin james says god can't be tempted so it shows that god part on the inside was never tempted god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself you see this was the the very life of the lord jesus christ was the ringing out and the declaring of the inheritance this is why he could take the role led by the holy spirit and announce in that generation in that synagogue and throughout that i have been anointed the spirit of the lord is upon me to preach to proclaim to announce the acceptable year of the lord is on it was to announce that liberty has come it wasn't liberty according to how the church church was looking at it the church was looking at well if i can just get this on my back if we can just get rome on my back they needed more than rome off their back this world needs more than a change of govern of leaders it needs a complete transformation come on brothers it needs a complete change and this is exactly where the earth has already been brought and is going through its stages of redemption where god called it and repentance was there in the days of noah and god baptized this earth in the name of jesus christ then at calvary the blood was shed and the blood spilled upon the earth to say this always belonged to me i'm coming i'm making another step i'm coming back to redeem it fully that you see that every time god's dealing with your life he's letting you know not only does he love you not only is he interested in you he's trying to declare to you i want to finish what i started let me just tell you he's big enough to do it he can have compassion on the ignorance on the ignorant yeah that's you and me i'm not talking about your earthly standing i'm talking about your stumblings and on those who are out of the way that have not yet responded to that call that have not come across jordan he's there as a high priest he maketh intercession do you know his own life being expressed is an intercessory life has he's there he has there's an intercessory that is being expressed because let me say this to you there's not one son or daughter of god that'll be left behind then let me just announce it to the devil there's not one son or daughter of god that'll miss the rapture not one of them because the word of god is sure [Applause] not one son or daughter amen oh my because we're making preparation for that great translation event i don't want to miss it for the world do you notice hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us he obtained he entered in for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh see we're forgiveness what is the separation the word as it's going forth and that heart would respond there's a forgiveness but paul's dealing with the blood of those animals never brought those they no forgiveness but they never dealt with the real desire can't you see that's where the denominational churches are at they deal with all the grace of god all the grace of god all the forgiveness of god but there's more to it there's a place you can go to in god where it's no longer just looking at it and living a defeated life there's a place of victory in jesus name you want to know how that happened men men the bible says in jude men of corrupt minds they didn't come in by the way themselves so they don't know how to preach the way [Music] they turn the grace of god into lasciviousness it's sickness to watch and see the grace of god as though god's got to swallow their field god don't have to swallow filth he comes to change he comes to clean up he's a sanctifier what is it king's religion this is what i do take it or leave it wow but grace is not disgrace grace does something about your life grace challenges your life to rise how much more shall the blood of christ oh i love that who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience that's your soul from dead works to serve the living god now you know dead works or not are not bad paul writes about dead works be baptized baptism it's a dead work right laying on a hand come on now you know of bible readers hebrew hebrews 10 dead works then works are things that god calls you to do but that in itself doesn't change you it's in process it's with you it's with looking faith to the complete transformation but you see god's desire is not that we would just come by dead works you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ when does that become when it comes to that place of just a dead works where you're resting simply on that instead of having the rest in your soul you must come into the rest it's not praise god i was baptized that's all there is to it that's a start what's the objective it's just like every time when i've talked with somebody getting ready i want to see where people are at when they're wanting to be baptized because i know even in this city it's dominated with things of works catholicism and everything else all through here that water don't save nobody that water could have went on down the street and the fella next door could have took a bath in it the water don't have any virtue in it but the water represents a grave when you walk up and be baptized you're testifying there is a man that has left here he's buried not put up just in case but this guy is dead i testify that i'm no longer the same there's been a start there's been a turn in my life this is why repentance and baptism go together amen and for this cause verse 15 but we better get going and for this cause he is the mediator that's the ratifier that's the one who brings two to become one he's the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament that they which are called might receive the promise of eternal life so he took everything out of the way amen did you hear me he took everything out of the way brother samuel you don't know about this he took it out of the way so what are you saying quit letting the devil bluff you he's already conquered he already took it out of the way you have to accept what he's already done and the greatest honor you can do is to believe him when you start believing the word goes to work hallelujah for where a testament is it's talking about a will there must also be necessity the death of the testator right somebody left you something you can't go claim it right now until they die right you might be hoping but you can't claim it till they die you might have cleared out your dining room i'm going to make red for aunt so-and-so set you can't claim it until they die and you can't claim it unless it's already been designated to you but after the passing there's a reading of the will and when the will is read it lets you know this is what belongs to you this was left for you then you've got a right you don't have to ask nobody you got a right to say i want yes what belongs to me in other words give me my mountain i want what belongs to me you're not asking for something that don't belong to you you're not a fifa robber you're coming according to the way of the word you've got a right to stand there as a son and daughter of god it ain't about your righteousness it's his righteousness you're not standing there asking for it because you're worthy you're standing there because he's worthy and he has made you worthy what a compliment to stand there a man and say lord jesus i receive what belongs to me and the devil said there's no way you can have it too late it's already before the devil was ever the devil before there was adam's stardust or molecule before there was an angel [Applause] my inheritance was already locked up because i was in him that's my papa hallelujah you couldn't get me out of his loins the way that he moved down through the prophets i was there i responded the same way that noah responded i responded the same way moses responded why i'm identified by that life of the covenant coming upon the seed and what does it do it causes sons and daughters of god to manifest that same dna that's been all the way down for where a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it's no strength at all while the testifier liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood so it had to be a testament must be dedicated with blood he talked about the law when they gave the law in the beginning in the law and paul goes on to write about it when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people now notice wow has the word it wasn't just part of the word but everything that god had uttered every bit of it moses held nothing back from them and that word was declared and after the word was spoken now came forth the sprinkling of the blood the token that would join the people who responded to the word and said all that thou has said we will do so there had to be a response to the word now that the word has been responded to the blood goes forth to sprinkle both the book and the people to enjoin them showing of what god himself would do through the shedding of the blood in order for you and i to be joined back into the word which is our inheritance it would take that of a life one who would be able through that blood cell to combat put his hands on a holy god and then upon a center and he would be able to stand in the gap he would be able to feel the breach he would be able to remove the chasm he would be able to bring us from where we were and couldn't get back he would be able to bring us in to our inheritance [Applause] what is our inheritance the word right let me just say you are the word [Applause] you see that there was a fault with the first covenant the fault with the first covenant is it was wrote on stones and it was on the outside but god said i'm making another a new covenant this ain't a covenant that man makes this is a god thing this is a god covenant and this covenant was displayed in the person of the lord jesus christ wherein that the word itself was embodied there in the very fullness let me just say this we were in him then [Applause] we went to calvary in him when he got up on that when he got up on resurrection morning i got up in it [Applause] let me just say it simple like this everybody knows the story of lazarus when lazarus went in the grave now i don't know how it records from there if lazarus had children from then on out but when lazarus went in the grave are you with me when he went in there every one of the seeds that would be laying there in his body of children that could come remember what happened they laid him right there in the grave when lazarus laid there in the grave but brother when that came where the voice spoke and said lazarus come forth let me just tell you something not only did a man get up but the seed that was there in him got up also hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah i was there hey i was in my natural father when he when he cleared back i was in my grandfather come on now this is scripture when abraham met melchizedek levi is credited with paying ties and that was his grandpa but god was showing no matter what age that they meet the elect will act the same way when they come face to face with the world [Applause] why because there are the loins of god oh hallelujah you see it brings us across of the breach this is why in this hour god came in fulfillment of malachi 4. it's that the earth is to be delivered of a new birth let me just say this the church was to be delivered of a new birth satan still had claims on the church he could say to the church you ain't going nowhere you got my baptism come on that's a doctrine of devils he said you got my baptism there's a lot of other things but you see listen listen this is god's work god there was no god didn't need to bring a new deed the deed is the word he didn't need to bring a new deed like you got something you buy a piece of property and something you say man they want to let me take possession of it they won't let me move in they won't let me do this they won't let me do that you don't need a new deed you need a clearing of that deed you need a clearing of lanes liens oh this is a beautiful house wow this is a nice house why and it's a great house we got but we can't move into it right now why not well there are all kinds of taxes hold on and you know all kinds of water bills somebody just let the water go and it's thousand dollars but in a beautiful house that's my house where you're gonna move into it no no it's got liens on that house it doesn't matter how much you hold that deed that house ain't yours until there's a clearing on that deed you receive the deed come on now you receive the deed the moment you believe but when the holy ghost has come he clears anything and everything that was ever against you there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus hallelujah it clears us this token clears the body of jesus christ for rapture there's not another message to come this is the finishing of the mystery of god we're cleared for rapture glory be to god in the highest that's why this earth she's under those nervous prostrations she's longing for the manifestations of the sons of god earthquakes in diverse places [Music] men's hearts trembling for fear why there's nervous prostrations hallelujah there's got to be a passing away of this civilization in order for that other one to move in see it's by a new and living way i have to let me refer here to this i read this to you last week but i want to refer to it because i want that continuity of thought in hebrews 10 19 having therefore brethren boldness a confidence to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and he is the word people can look for lots of signs they can look for things oh does it yeah do i see signs in the hands or do i see see but you see the where the believer for the believer we he has unveiled to you and i in his word amen it's not something that you can even explain it might be something that gets your attention of what god does maybe you're in the service and something that god does and it brings you to where hey there's something there there's one here that's greater than man there's something here there's the god of the word it's god declaring himself and then that same god will come right down for he is the word and he'll begin to reveal that word and in the revealing of that word it begins to uncover that life let me just tell you something when that word when the holy spirit comes in that way he's not trying to shame you he's trying to uncover the works of the enemy that wants to isolate you and hold you back from that promise the devil is afraid of the holy ghost he knows when the holy ghost and your heart just stands there steadfast and says that's my promise that belongs to me and that life becoming united with god he knows it's no longer you but there's a mighty god on the inside of your life he's afraid of that because then you become a tormentor to him hallelujah then you've been made the head and not the tail [Music] glory be to god in the highest amendment now let me just let me just move here the scripture paul as he would pick this up and it's a spirit of truth i want you just to catch that for a moment when the lord jesus when he speaks of the coming the return in the form of the holy ghost he calls it the comforter i must needs go away that the comforter will come and then he declares in the same uh chapters there i believe it's 16 when the spirit of truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth you see the spirit of truth does not work in error it works in truth manifesting truth for he is the truth the life and the way he comes to lead you and guides you into the truth your first birth in my first birth was not the truth but this new birth this is the truth you shall know the truth it didn't say it will set you free it said it makes you free because you're not the old man made over you're a new man in christ jesus it's the holy ghost come to that seed that womb and it quickens these two have become one [Applause] he makes you free [Music] no shame on me hallelujah yeah i think it'd be all right we just sing a little bit and then come back at it glory be to god are they not all ministering spirits look how paul writes this ministering spirits that are sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation the word comes to you to let you know this is what belongs to you and you're sitting there in the seat and now brother bran will put it the angels of god are all aligned right here and there might be a voice to say no you can't have that no depart from this or this or that but here the angel of god said go ahead raise your hand go ahead accept it go ahead what is it it's the angels of god don't you realize friends we're not alone there's more with us that's against us hallelujah your eyes are open to see brethren sister not only is there a cloud of many witnesses that are saying that you are more than able but there are angels that are standing here that can never stand like you stand but they're there to encourage you when you've been in a hard temptation a hard trial and you felt like i couldn't make it but you stood the word inside of you stood and the angels came and ministered to you [Music] and brother dave the lord said now which one of y'all got the softest hands well you do okay you go take care of dave's brow you want you you just you just ripe this brown and i want the one with the softest hands come on now that's what god asked for elijah i want the one with the softest hands and which one's the best cook out of all you amen you see how the holy spirit would bring that down in such a way that even in the midst of the test and trial god says i provided my best for you hallelujah ministering spirits [Music] i'll just tell you i ain't preaching by myself it ain't me taking courses through the word it's directed by ministering spirits hallelujah oh brother samuel that's all for both that's on speaking of my inheritance that's only speaking of that position i know what i'm speaking of i've been there anybody else will witness with me i've been there i know what i'm talking about and there's a ministering spirit because it's not me i didn't bring myself there it's god it's not you that brought yourself there it's god and now you're a yielded vessel of mercy and god makes known redemption inheritance through your life hallelujah this is why paul could say in second corinthians 5 20 now then we are ambassadors for christ you might say i'm not a minister but you're an ambassador you're a delegate of this new city you're a representation of it god's speaking through your life in ways that i could never get to people and god speaks right through your life hallelujah hallelujah amen glory be to god right here and where you live at god has ordained that his voice would thunder out of your life hallelujah remember what jesus said when the voice thundered what did he say that wasn't for me that was for you are you with me hallelujah when the thunder comes that's not about you it's god's voice speaking through you it's god thundering out it's so hard as though god look we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we'll make co-workers with him we got one person one one purpose and that's to see everybody lit with the same holy ghost fire amen amen we pray you in christ said be you reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and we can't make ourselves that he makes us we are his work you see this is the workmanship of hebrews 1. we referred to that last week he obtained that inheritance a more excellent name this is that which is spoken where paul would write he spoke to the fathers in the prophets now in these last days by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things you see the son he is the word it's the spirit of truth coming through the word revealing the inheritance to the heirs it's a it's a word this is why i mean i mean what good would it do me to show up to oh there's been a passing in the hannah family i don't know who it is oh brother samuel why don't you come and i come i'm sitting there sitting there sitting there sitting there i i don't i i know i don't there ain't nothing i don't hear nothing about it for me they can get up and say man isn't that wonderful brother brian be like man in that wonderful sister barb we got a brand new grill we already have one we can use another one we got and i walk out and everything i didn't hear my name being called now let me just deal with this devil the devil that would like to try to tell you you ain't getting nothing out of this you ain't learning nothing you ain't growing nothing let me just tell you something there's something that's striking your heart amen a man can't do that it's god is striking your heart it's not just words words can't do that alone but it takes the word himself who gets into his word and he begins to speak that word he begins to come to your heart that is god personally personally working in that life you see it's the ministry of reconciliation it's the spirit of truth calling us unto the truth himself which is him which is him you see the spirit of truth it calls us into the union what was prayed what was long for that they john 17 that they may be one even as thou art in me that i in them amen this is the perfection where it's the old man dies and it's the new man on the inside growing more and more and more into the image of his father you know there's things brother carlos i find myself doing it my dad they just make fun of me for doing that you know i'm picking and i find myself it just just happens it's coming don't worry i mean i don't despise it but you know i think man i used to poke at him before don't worry he's coming brother shane you see it begins to come the longer and the further that's on the natural how much greater is it on the spiritual because on the spiritual it's not you and i it's not my triangle i'm gonna try it's not that rare it's us yielding and him doing man let me just try to and where i'm not gonna get get get to where we want but we're gonna get to somewhere here in second from the 2nd thessalonians 2 verse 13. can i have just a few more moments [Music] some of you are like your fear moments by the same well that's you pulling don't stop pulling that right cause you might pull you're a miracle that's good hallelujah you mean man you might pull what you have neither ain't that right sister linda last week he came right there isn't that right he came amen second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you've been chosen [Applause] glory be to god [Music] moses tried to forget about it preach with me somebody he tried to forget about it he got out there and got himself occupied he thought if i get if i get in this business i'll get my mind so occupied i won't even think about my failures but god wasn't looking at his failures [Applause] moses thought that god expected him to be the deliverer but god said i'm to deliver i just need to use your body i need to bother you follow your mouth it ain't your voice it ain't your lips but under that blood when you speak by this revelation the hold of pharaoh will have to turn loose on my people moses left out of that burning bush experience brother he didn't just know he was chosen he wasn't trying to forget all his failures he knew where he was standing he was standing on holy ground he had been redeemed and god had anointed him commissioned him go speak the word [Music] you've been chosen [Music] to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you see the working of the truth the sanctification of the spirit the cleansing the burning out and the ceiling this is all god's work it's the pathway that you must come it's the path what pathway is it it's the path back home amen when the jubilee had come they had to sound the trumpet they would sound that ram's horn and then let him know a sound went forth to let them know the debt is settled you can go back to your inheritance this belongs to you could argue with the voice of that trumpet you know something that resonated down here that voice sounding to those who were servants who had been brought in and around israel and weren't sons already come on now that sounding didn't mean nothing to them are you hearing me if this gospel means something to you you know what god's letting you know you're a son and daughter and i've come to bring you back home that's why this word means something to you that's why god sent this message this message was to call sons and daughters of god and bring us into our position in christ jesus to give us that liberty that belongs to us as the sons and daughters of god you've been chosen hallelujah it's up to you whether you'll accept it it's up to you whether you'll take it or not but you've been chosen to pass through this way the word has already went forth and opened up the way [Applause] thank you let's stand praise oh god where and to he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ this is what the gospel it calls us spirit of truth deals with our heart and it calls us by the truth into the truth the whole time it's truth working in our lives the enemy can say oh you know where this has been in your family tree for years this but that ain't the truth are you with me when those spies came back from across the land they said oh there's some big boys over there big ones man joshua and caleb never said you guys are a bunch of liars there ain't nobody over there a bunch of midgets they never said that joshua and caleb chose to be occupied with the truth there's a time when the truth is not the truth [Music] the doctor says you're not going to make it well by all medical reports and how things are that could be the truth but there's another report there's a truth that's greater than that truth and that's the truth that i choose to believe it's a truth it calls us into himself [Music] it's the inheritance that belongs to us where he comes to set us free he comes to make real to our lives that inheritance he calls us to himself and remember brother brown would say just like this he said as soon as he said that word goes forth and i relate it to you i think a week or so ago brother ram said it's like a and he's letting you know i called you he said then he says you in your heart you say you know what [Music] i got to make a decision here and then when you make a decision you've made a a start [Music] brother man says see he says let's steal that same what's he doing the spirit of truth is encouraging you in the truth to accept the truth to believe the truth this is where he calls us by his spirit this is why truth itself is so much greater than the lie then that darkness of that first birth the truth is so much greater the darkness that encompassed our life when truth went forth it pierced the darkness it let us know this is a potential your potential as a son and daughter of god i know probably many of maybe some of you have experienced things like this i experienced that even as a school teacher i experienced kids when they would sit down with me you see sometimes they were just a little nervous they'd sit down one-on-one some of the programs they had us doing they had to read and read so many words per minute forgive me i don't mean to be political or nothing like that or anything like that but i never believed in none of that garbage anything about how fast you can read it can you remember what you read sometimes people become so educated they become fools i had this little girl sitting there [Music] she said mr brownie she said i ain't a good reader i said i told you you wanted a good reader she said well mr browning i never could she said read real fast i just these many words were many i told her i said you've been coming to this table and reading to me since we came together here in september i said let me tell you something a good reader ain't about how fast you can read i said but every time you've come here i said you're not only able to tell me what you've read but you're able to make connections with what you're reading with other stories and personal experiences in your life i said that's what real reading is all about [Music] it was just like something just broke [Music] what she had thought now maybe there wasn't a teacher brother aaron that told her that it just was you know i can't remember and she just felt that way it was something about it but the moment then i could speak to her when that came about and addressed that i could have never addressed it brother dave if it hadn't come out but as soon as it came out i could address it with the real truth [Music] what would it do it would remove her from that lie that imagination that she had of her own self it condemned her she carried it with her but once that came in she could be settled in that that's over you could try to say what you wanted to say again about you can't read that fast don't matter [Music] that's in the natural that's in the natural what about our lord jesus what about our big brother what about our heavenly father he would come down and he would make known to you and i there might be loads you're carrying it might be things that you just thought about your own self it might be sin that you're carrying it might be habits you're carrying but he come to let you know you don't have to carry it no more [Music] he lets you know put an end to it right here his is the voice of truth it's not a reason it's a truth the truth comes to set you free now see then what you can do is instead of now being anchored or really not anchored but falling under that imagination that reasoning walking underneath that lie [Music] you can believe the truth you believe the truth the truth goes to work this truth is not it's not a dull sword it's not an antique it ain't something we put on the wall it's the word of god spoken by the holy ghost and that word goes forth to cut free cut free doubt and unbelief what do i do brother samuel believe him who speaks to you him that speaketh glory be to god [Music] let's pray lord jesus for every single need for each heart for each life lord there's not one person not one whether they're even in the sound of my voice whether here whether through the internet whether the archive the service there's not one person not one not one [Music] the lord would have to stay and live under a lie they don't have to live under condemnation the lord the word it comes to speak to our hearts cast down imagination lord even those of mind battles [Music] i pray right now in the name of jesus christ dear god may you just sweep in lord god i pray right now [Music] or to realize there's a ground that they're standing on it's a solid ground there's one who's in the ship there's one who's greater lord i pray for that heart right now [Music] lord may they anchor may the lord take that of the truth over every lie that the enemy would want to try to put lord before may they take the truth of the voice the voice of the holy spirit the spirit of truth that's calling him lord lord may the lives and hearts right here this morning maybe lord one of your children here they are they're walking in their inheritance lord they've been brought in here by you they know they're not the same no you've changed them lord your word burns in their hearts but there's a need in their body lord is part of their inheritance in this land [Music] this might be jericho this might be a different city lord i heard as your prophet said there in the message the adoption series he said once we've come into this land it's yours it's yours healing in the body maybe there's something that's come along on oppressiveness or a depression you've got authority to rise there's a power on the inside of you you're not a piece of wood floating down the stream you once were that but you've been yielded into the hands of the master you've been you're now a part of his boat there's an engine power behind you there's a power of the holy ghost you might have got a little tangled in some things but there's a power to get you out [Music] if repentance is needed repent if it's just to stand there and to believe the truth and say i'm not going to accept this i'm going to stand on the truth of the report i have believed granted lord for every need among your children this morning those in need of the holy ghost those in need of deliverance those in need of healing whatever it is it's all satisfied and met in the lord jesus christ we accept it now father in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] thank you for this [Music] [Applause] now all i know is your forgiveness [Music] big toys [Music]
