[Music] lord with that confidence that you knew how to put the words together you knew the words of the heart lord i'm glad for that lord because you're not interested in anything of worldly beauty

lording maketh intercession oh god with groanings that cannot be uttered lord helpeth our infirmities so thankful for that lord [Music] god even when you came to anoint david through samuel you spoke it so clearly that you look not on the outside as man looks but you look to the heart lord truly lord god that's where you look lord that's what you bring forth lord by your presence a man can lord take upon this earth and they can lord begin to excavate and pull out precious minerals that are beneath the soil and in the dirt sometimes so deep beyond what any mortal could ever be able to see lord what about our lives there was no one worthy no one could bring out of our lives what was really their lord beneath all the darkness beneath all the chaos beneath all the disorder there was a son and daughter of god a seed of god on the inside that needed light to reach it we were like those pond lilies down beneath the muck and the gum of the pond of this lord humanity oh how we thank you o god that you have drawn us lord by your power by your strength lord you've brought us to yourself that glory that was there on the inside you brought that forth lord that's a reflection of you lord we're a reflection of your work we thank you so much lord we're we're counting we're resting on that lord that god you see our hearts may you just come now just speak very personally to us lord we need to hear from you there's no doubt questions and you're the answer lord i pray that god that you'll just cause the words to be formed lord from my mouth and calls our ears to hear may you just come right among us lord just just take us under your control speak lift to ear to us tonight lord move among us in a very personal way father for needs that may not even be seated here but we believe dear god that the word goes forth lord and it's not bound by a physical realm lord we just ask lord god that your word would go forth lord minister to every need lord we pray the name of jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you thank you musicians amen jesus loved the lord and it's so good to be gathered here together once again we want to just invite you to the word of the lord i want to go back to first corinthians 13. pick up some of the verses that are here and we want to move a little bit tonight we also have a thankful to the lord we have a baptism here tonight sister norma schooley that's brother richard sanchez and brother bill sanchez that's her sister as well as sister angie sister angie's there too so we're just thankful to the lord amen for that amen may god just just richly just continue his work in her life amen amen i'm glad that he's the one that's overseeing the work aren't you amen just like the lord begin to speak to us on sunday whatever he starts he finishes he don't leave no job half half done he finishes it out amen so let's let's begin reading here i want to go back to verse 1 and then we'll come down from there paul says though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and i have not charity i've become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing my goodness i mean if we're just looking at what we see out here we would say my goodness that's it right there but paul says though i have all of that and if i don't have charity all right it's nothing it's nothing it doesn't need to add up to nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing of all the great sacrifices that we could make but yet if charity is not governing it it's not even wrecking to our account it's nothing verse four charity suffereth long and is kind i want you to notice we've been looking at this here for some time notice how paul then will go right into this this verse and then into the next verse of what it is not charity envyeth not it bonneth not itself and is not puffed up doth not behave itself on semen seeketh not our own is not easily provoked and think of no evil amen may god bless the word as you're being seated tonight we want to look here for a few moments here in the in the first part of that verse of first corinthians 13 5 and you see there's many things that even that we have been looking at here within charity and what paul was dealing with it's a real substance in our life this is not a charity in which when it speaks of charity it's speaking of that of the very love of god that's not something that you or i can attain to in our lives but it is so it's a sovereign work of almighty god it's god that begins to deal with our heart deal with our life and it's we surrender to his call and as he begins to work in our life from repentance and then into being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ it's just it's simply just taking god at his word of the promise you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit it's all it's all in love it's looking and knowing that what god has promised god is faithful to fulfill that promise and so this is of the charity it's the very love of god it's god's own life that god would deposit into our life and then through that the working of his life in us remember how paul would say in one place of the scripture in in thessalonians he would say of how that were to love one another he said you need no man teach you for you are taught of god because even in the expression once that has been expressed to us we've caught that from god then we recognize that it was god who loved us when we were unlovable it was the love of god that reached to us and looked beyond everything even of the times that we ignored his call even when he tried to deal with this even of the little things that god would have done that we we just walked right on past but it was god watching over our life all along and even to this moment but to but to see that how that that charity itself as paul would write of this it's a real substance in a life it's something that's behind that should be a real substance behind the gift and these things that we read about in the first part of first corinthians 13 these are things that can be all seen out here and demonstrated out here but yet if there's not a real substance of charity behind that it's nothing it means nothing at all and this is why when brother branham would tell us in the message of prisoner he would speak to us and say don't ever judge your life by how many miracles or signs or wonders or gifts he said don't ever judge it by that but judge your life by the sweetness and the humility to the word of god in your life that's a real prisoner because a prisoner is one who is yoked to the word by the holy spirit times we can feel a pull because as we're still here within this body but a prisoner is a prisoner to the word where we want to so lose sight of ourselves i want to continue to lose sight of myself this is the desire this is what a real a real prisoner in how to be or how that a real prisoner of the lord is further becoming and so when we look at this here tonight as you see the scripture says does not behave itself unseemly this is dealing with an expression it's dealing with a behavior and so when we look at this one of the thoughts that one of the things that i want to just look at and maybe just to drop this and i don't know if i'll get to this tonight but i want you to remember that though you can come from whatever state or whatever country you come from and there might be certain characteristics you bear of that country or that city or whatever you come from but when we have become a child of god by the spirit of god we no longer are holding to that first birth that first nationality or ethnicity however you want to put it we now recognize there's a greater calling in our life we still bear the reflection in this life as the scripture said it's a bride out of many kindreds nations and tongues but the sovereignty of how that god has assembled his people unto himself that you begin to recognize that yes we have a natural family but you recognize i am part of the family of almighty god from that moment on you recognize yourself as a pilgrim and a stranger in this land you realize this is only a temporal journey you recognize that every moment and each time it's a molding it's a shaping this time that we're here is a time for an opportunity to make a decision a time god gives us an opportunity in this life to receive a real pardon from sin to receive a release to receive eternal life and then to walk and make ready for that for that land that is coming in because remember in that land what we are going to even in the millennium and then into the future home remember it is not something that just for you and i even say well you know i'm just going to be over there but god after he gets a hold of your life he molds your character he shapes you as a matter of fact brother rem says he does this with nail scarred hands and he molds us and trains us to be conformed to his own image because we are his children begotten by him and he is faithful to raise us and to build us up and mold us even through the tests and trials we go through there's a purpose in it and saying all that i say it for this we have a greater representation we have a greater constitution that we are a part of and that is of that new jerusalem of our future home we have a greater identity as a matter of fact if you went from this nation to another nation they would say oh you're american but remember when you've been born of the spirit of god they can say you're a christian because we are identified by the spirit from that land and our lives are under the governance and the direction of the holy spirit himself who is the word so then there's an expression out of our life as delegates of that new city we're heading there this is where this is where we're going right now is the time of the molding and the shaping of our character and we can truly say amen to this character molding is not the funnest part character molding is not something that you or i would just stick our hand up and say hey i'll take a little bit more of that but we know that that's what's needed and god always gives to us just what we need just as we're able to handle it and he gives us the grace to come through it oh i tell you i thank him for that the bible and just thinking of this i this scripture i'm just drawn to the scripture here in romans 12 9 and then we'll read down to verse 10. it says let love be without dissimilation that means without hypocrisy abort that which is evil cleave to that which is good so these are things that as a believer abort that which is evil but cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another i want to just this is where i'm drawn to on this part that charity does not behave itself unseemly and that that whole phrase it means it doesn't act rudely or unbecomingly right and to see that this is part of of an expression and in honor preferring one another you know there's there's really only one honor that we need to seek and that's the honor that comes from god everything gets into trouble when it tries to find honor one from another and faith is broken and everything else just it goes haywire this is why only real honor is the honor that comes from god oh other honor it fades away it's temporary and men lose their souls and they lose everything else because they seek after the honor of men instead of after the honor of god when the lord jesus came remember he came among a bunch of religious people in that time and they were seeking honor one from another even some who would not even make a decision or stand up for their son when he was healed they were afraid about being kicked out of the synagogue why they honored more their their the pharisee down there or the priests they honored them more than they honored the word and so now when it comes to it this is where it shows to you and i that even when we don't understand and many times we don't understand but to recognize the word we can say lord i honor you lord and by giving ourselves to him god will unfold it god will interpret it god will open our understanding he's not asking you and i have to do that as brother brian sung that song be it unto me according to thy word that's honoring god just let god do what god does so we honor god by standing on his word this is what the scripture in honor preferring one another so this is not this honor it's not speaking of an earthly honor that that is of this world this is speaking of in honor preferring one another this is a real honor it's this word it deals with a price that is placed on something a price which is of a value a price either that has been paid for something it's an honor the word honor also deals with honor which belongs or is shown to one and i think we can wholeheartedly agree there's times that there's honor it doesn't belong to someone but yet we honor them anyhow are you with me but iran teaches us that the spirit of god through the scriptures teaches that even where brother bram says when you cannot honor the man you honor the office is that right respecting the office peter would write honor all men love the brother brotherhood honor the king is that right these are scriptural so these are principles and i i'll say it in this manner that they are principles that just doesn't apply when it's convenient for us or when everything is going our way or everybody agrees with us and my we're right on the same bullet points and we know this these scriptures call for expression when everybody's not on the same bullet points as you and i when everybody doesn't go along with the way we think or we feel but this is where the real character and charity is expressed even in this time even in our behavior a price that is fixed here you know a price the scripture says in first corinthians 6 20 for you are bought with a prize therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods this is a price we've been bought with the price what price have we been bought with we've been bought not with silver or gold we've been bought with the precious blood of the lamb and to recognize that even in these things our how paul would write of it in this way in colossians 1 21 you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight i want you to catch this for a moment in his sight in the sight of the world and others perhaps many of us could have been rolled off as a lost cause it's true and in reality i don't care it doesn't matter how good you were how good anybody was without the mercy of god we would still be trapped we needed someone a kinsmen to come to you and ask and to bring the price of ransom to be able to set us free and then that that faith from that act could begin to rise in our hearts to believe what he has already done for me and grace to act upon it in his sight i mature in the site of the town of samaria the woman at the well would have never been deemed worthy but in his sight you see his side goes deeper than what can be seen on the outside his side was it goes to the depth to know what the real need is down there and to think if in his sight in his side here we are standing with the holy spirit in our life identified as holy unblameable and unreprovable because we are not the same people we used to be we've been changed there's no longer the tie to that former life our ears have been open to hear his voice we're not hearing the word as a stranger we're hearing the word as friends and daughters of god that's an act of the holy ghost you know right in his sight brother branham says in the sight of the church you can backslide but he said in his sight there is a bumper of blood and god cannot see you through the blood she said to others you could backslash but to god you cannot backslide because your life is hidden in christ [Music] in his sight but don't we appreciate that then then we must apply it and recognizing that in his sight brother branham could say it like this he said if i had a little charger maybe let's say like this bottle of water here and let's just say it had within it some of the literal drops of his blood oh he said i would take that and i would hold it to my bosom and say how precious that is this blood that was for me he said but i recognize sitting here tonight is something of greater value than his blood because he was willing to shed his blood for you and i we are the purchase of that blood so in his side he deemed us worthy and more precious than his own blood for he shed his own blood that he might bring us back to him to open the way that we might come back to him as sons and daughters of god it's it's a greater price that's in his sight so to recognize the value in his life to recognize who it is you are to recognize who's sitting beside you to recognize who's around you are you with me in his sight we're talking about sons and daughters of god i want you to think of this here in psalms 105 verse 11 a very tremendous chapter brother brown will take this and he'll read almost from verse one but i'm not going to and you preach the message respects if you haven't listened to that in a while it'd be good but brown i want you to catch what is dealing with this here in verse 11 of psalms 105 saying unto thee this is what god had said unto abraham and jacob and isaac saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yey very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm now remember here is god guiding guiding israel he's directing them here he brings them out of egypt remember god called him out of egypt he says not because that the lord loved you anymore but he had a promise that he made to the fathers and you are a part of that promise and god has come to confirm and fulfill that promise and how that god guided them through the wilderness taking care of their clothing taking care of their food and of their water god is a provider what a testimony we could preach on that god will never call you to do anything without providing the means to do it he is jehovah jireh he provides for himself because if he put it on your heart he's only asking to borrow your body it'll be him do it and he'll provide all that's necessary god as they walked with god here they were they were not an army as far as a trained group of people but they were marching out under the word the pillar of fire and cloud by day and here they are moving not as a trained army but god even as they walk with just simple honor to the word of god coming through his servant moses god displaced kingdoms they wouldn't let them pass by the king's way and god displaced them god god would come against them god would not allow his people to be touched or to be to come upon and be vexed now we know that there were those who came in that way they would come at them and god even held it in the place of amalek and god said i'll remember from generation to generation what amalek has done i'm glad that god still remembers tonight what amalek has done i'm glad he remembers what what took place right there in the garden of eden when the enemy came in against the weak one he came down i'm glad that the strong one tonight still makes himself no i've not forgot my covenant i've not forgot the trap you've been in but i'm here and i stand with my hands up in the air as a deliverance in your life god remembers his word glory be to god and you know not only does god remember his word god even remembers the attitude you and i take to it in the book of malachi there was an ascribing angel that while the word is going forth an angel is ascribing the attitude that the people have toward the word as it's coming forth is that right it's a book of remembrance oh aren't you glad oh you say i don't understand at all it will watch your attitude towards it if your attitude you see because it's just like the prophet tells talks to us about the opening of the seventh seal and that quickening power the lord coming among us it depends on the attitude you take toward it as whether it'll do you any good or not is that right it depends on the attitude when god asks you to do something when he told them about remember the the the the hear the the empty uh uh jugs at the the uh there it came at the marriage feasts when they were empty and he said go fill them with water it depended on the attitude that they took at that time but there was an attitude they heeded to a word that said just do what he said unto you to do don't try to figure it out just go do it they did their part but he came and did only what he could do what made the difference their attitude towards the word my mama touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm you see it's honoring god when they honored moses it wasn't just moses they're honoring god being manifest in moses are you with me when they honored elisha they were honoring god being made manifest in elijah recognizing god touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm how that god would would guide israel through this now let me just drop a few things here in the scripture as as we're reading in honor preferring one another this word prefer it means to go before or to show the way to go before our lead to go before as a leader this deal this this display of honor it's not something that is just to be told but the real preferring one another in honor is show me and it's not me saying brother richard show me it's where brother richard might see something or somebody else see something and instead of just taking you know the oh well here this needs but there's sometimes where there's things be an example be an example to how it's done it's like you think maybe somebody says oh my goodness i tell you what these young people i tell you what they they need to they're getting too caught up you know when they're playing volleyball or whatever somebody needs to show them that points don't matter we'll get in the court and show them don't lecture them show them preach somebody be an example let them see an example this is part of honor in honor preferring one another let somebody be the go before hey this is this is the scripture this is what god himself came down he did not come down with an addendum to the commandments and say here here's another uh load of writings no he came down as the expression of the writings he was the very nature of god that was on display for you and i this is so that you and i we can see god this is why john can say we have handled of the word of life with our hands it's that god on display and if i might say it it's like when brother branham as he came to jamaica and the president president this is not even a believer the president talked about billy crown coming into jamaica and he said oh my we had wonderful meetings and you know and then another brother oh we had wonderful meetings he said but when william branham came god came and visited us he wasn't putting brother adam as god but he's letting me know there was something a greater one who was in our midst i say tonight god will stand and be your representative amen oh god what a compliment preferring one another you see this is why must always prefer one another just referring to some quotes he said that's the life of christ is to prefer your brother or sister and if they are wrong listen to these words now i'm dragging my feet purposely if they are wrong that's all right you'll never make them any better by kicking them around put an arm around them pick them up is that right that's brother batman true in here in another place and he's talking about david and he says of reverence we ought to honor one another and respect one another as brother and sister and love one another with undying love he said people say well i just can't he said you just stay there long enough until you feel that way amen you know brother branham would give him examples and i just many of these things you know is just as he brings it to my heart brother brown would talk about even staying in a prayer in a season of prayer until you feel different it wasn't gun christianizing people but it's recognizing that there are times that this guy has got to be brought in subjection and praying in a season of prayer you're not defeated you're raining are you hearing me you're reigning as a son and daughter of god if we're going to stand in dominion there in the millennium we got to start right now right this is not my inheritance but it's my possession is that right yeah so known as he said that's a real good sign of christianity when you can't from your heart this is very very important from your heart love those who do not love you love the unlovable and he goes and speaks about how the pharisees you know they only do favors for them who do favors for them you know scratch your scratch my back and i'll scratch yours and i like how brother brahman says in the message adoption he said i'll scratch yours whether you scratch mine or not amen this word came with the full character you say now you be kind to those who are unkind to you do good for those that would do evil for you always remember that keep it before you that god is watching you remember in his sight remember god was good to you when you were evil to him now in how god had spoke regarding how god would lead israel god led abraham and let's just look at even with abraham and the promise of how that god would speak to abraham and call abraham out of the of the land of chaldeas and remember abraham his back down in the lineage was his great great grandfather and i don't know how many greats to put in there of of noah but it was enough to where that abraham had heard that god had spoke to noah abraham's down there in a situation as an idolater or making idols brother bram tells us like this and faith is our victory he heard about god's visitation to noah and he got down and he prayed and he said god like you spoke to noah will you speak to me the same way amen it invited god to speak to abraham and say get thee out of the land of thy kingdom god came it was god dealing with abraham think about it i wonder how long that abraham had known that about noah how long that abraham maybe was going around and he knew about it but here he is a man of 75 years old i don't know when he prayed that prayer maybe he was 74 years old but really when it comes down to it how many years did he go along in life oh lord jesus this is why the bible says that direct them when they're young in the way that they shall go when they grow old they will not depart why there's more than doctrine that's been given it's a living expression of a living god it's a real substance or an anchor something to that they can come back to it's not you it's god that came back in that moment and here is here is abraham and remember what god told abraham he said when he called him out into the land that he would go god said i'll bless those that bless you amen and those that curse you i'll curse them now i want you to remember this that god when he made that statement it did not give abraham an occasion to the flesh are you hearing me it didn't just give him such a liberty that he could just act in your way but god is the god of his word and and the word itself that's him that's his nature that's his character abraham was a delegate of god he was looking and he he was being called by god into this place now remember he brought out his his you know his his father and and here lot came with him and he had them with him and then after his father passed away then they come into the land but now after a period of time there comes a situation in the camp of there of the air between abraham's herdman and lot's herdsmen now i want you to just to look at this scripture here in verse five it says lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together let me just pause here that was all in the plan of god god had already told him to separate but god knows how hard it is to be separated from those that you love and by new this this love that was within abraham filial love god didn't say why you got that old feeling of love god knows how hard it is so god already in his mind this was already laid out this was not an afterthought but god knows a situation will arise but in that situation god has confidence in his word that he's told in abraham that the word will make the choice of the word and the word will act like the word god's got confidence this is all now just like we've been saying the handkerchief to be here the glass is here it's god this situation that you and i could say oh my if lot would have just been over there oh my if this would have been over there oh my this would have never happened this was arranged by god that this strife would come [Music] god let strife come between jacob and his father-in-law because he needed to get jacob he needed to get israel back in his homeland are you ready for me god knows exactly how to get us into position the bible says in verse 7 there was a strife between the herdman of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's cat and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land right it's very interesting the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled there in the land here are these unbelievers out here and they're going to sit and they're looking at wonder how they're going to handle this see somebody's watching somebody's watching you everybody else can do what everybody else does at work and you know what dog eat dog they expect that kind of stuff out of one another but they look at you amen somebody help me preach the parasite and canaanite they dwell in the land and abraham said unto lot look who took the initiative let there be no stride yes you do not record in these scriptures lot speaking up abraham spoke up right this is silver dollar this is part of silver dollar silver dollar isn't just oh i've heard directly the voice of god it's also the action receiving the life the character the person who was within the voice let there be no strife oh my god amen an absolute is a end of all strife you've got to have a real absolute to be able are you with me let me just stay with this not run with those it's so hard sometimes i have to run on them trails i praise thee between me and me and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren the strife didn't change we're brothers it didn't change how i feel about you i'm letting you know we're still brothers abraham took the initiative to make sure we're not letting this change we're still reverent that's the son of god stepping up brother are you with me oh my mama look at he says is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if i will take the left hand i'll go right if i'll depart to the right i'll go left in other words abraham said i'm going to give you the choice i'm going to give you the choice the direction that you that that you're going to go i'll go the opposite way all right now this is part of the testimony i want you to look you never find in the scripture here just to move through this you never find lot saying uncle you know you're a little bit up in age this land's barren you know what you probably should have the land that's a little bit better water i've seen some land down here that looks like the garden of eden but abraham said uh-huh there's been a lot of things that got this world in trouble of things that looked good all right but they can't see beyond it block didn't ask abraham lot did not prefer his brother are you with me he didn't prefer him lot just said all right i already know where i'm going then i'm going to this land where it's watered it just looks like the garden of the lord it's watered so nice my flocks are gonna go there and if you'd if you would have read lot's facebook post you'd have said this guy's all about lot instead of the song it's all about you jesus it's all about me jesus come on now you see this is lot he he had that way now let's just look at this just for a moment you see even within that part of it of how that lot would even display himself when the fussing had started abraham caused or said that's enough brother brown would say this like this say this over and over and let me just just to pick that up he's speaking of he says how did god abraham gave lot the opportunity if you go left i'll go right you go right now go left he said that's the christian way giving them benefit of the doubt how many of you know what that means benefit of the doubt benefit of the doubt means that there are times that somebody might say something to you and you could doubt it their actions and whatever more there might be things you could stand there and try to say okay you get your attorney i'll get my attorney they'll get our papers and i'll get your papers and we'll just settle this out because my points are going to be heard this is not what happened in this strife are you hearing me what happened in it over and over as brother brown tells us he gave lot the benefit of the doubt you know what that meant was released released now i want you to think about this giving the benefit of the doubt he said the ramp says like this he gave lot he said abraham acted as a christian would do showed that's god's faith the spirit in him he gave lot his own choice that's the way a christian spirit does it always goes the extra mile or gives the coat and it says here's the land before us we're not going to argue we're brothers i think that's something to be really applied right there to hold it in that manner we are brothers we are brothers it's a benefit brother brahm says that was the real christian spirit in abraham give even the enemy the benefit of the choice it got quiet in here we went from shouting to [Laughter] now look what paul says here in colossians 3 verse 12. i only be a few more moments put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bows of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another forgiving one another it's easy to forebear when you don't have to forebear amen i can forgive everybody when i don't have to forgive nobody wave offenses just wouldn't come offenses will come this is part of the testing and the shaping in our life there's still little prickers sticky parts about that carnal nature that sometimes things that people do or say just get caught in the thorns come on now sometimes in my house i look out my i look at the other day i'm looking out the office window and i'm sitting right there and i look out there where'd that piece of styrofoam come in my landscaping and got in my rose bush it took away from the beauty of my rose bush up around that dogwood what in the world or what it was it was just trash that was blowing along what happened to getting away was the thorns on that rose bush it needed a little bit of help to get it off of there because that rose bush didn't look too good with that piece of styrofoam like wrapper hung onto it and god knows how to get things off of you and i this is why we must be washed with the washing of water by the word because sometimes there's things that just get stuck there's things sometimes it gets stuck in our spirit stuck in our mind and we get stuck on and you want to say you've said the same thing over and over it's time to get over it amen mama if any man have a quarrel against any now it didn't say if anybody's got a core against you he said if you've got a quarrel a complaint against somebody great what should i do with that even as christ forgave you so also do ye thank you well they're gonna know that they displease me i'm gonna pout at them a little bit even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfect this whole phrase of put on it sink into like a garment you see the charity on the inside being now displayed on the outside that which is long-suffering and kind that which is right here the tenderness the bowels of mercy it has to be displayed as the bond of perfectness that which we're a life is totally absorbed it's put on charity so what what do you see well you see a little bit of the blue shirt but now you see the jacket right put on charity now notice the benefit of the doubt i got to take this back off or i'll sweat it up i'm closing this is what i want you to catch me god god's choosing of abraham you know that that don't change god's choosing god's choosing is not altered god does not choose down here in time like people who choose kickball teams god didn't choose and say man shouldn't have chose that one god don't work that way right god molds us he shapes us he forgives us molds us shapes us we fill the test again molds us forgives us molds us shapes us see god's all about mastery learning man when i had a teacher in college first one ever told me i believe in mastery learning i thought what's that and what they said is you're going to pass the test if you got to take it over and over and over and over because i don't accept failures in my class now first i thought man that's great but you know what that did that took the off of it but you know what it didn't make me lose i studied for those tests and by the grace of god at least all that i can remember i didn't have to take i didn't have to take them over you see what it was mastery said you're going to pass it you might have to take it 100 times but you are going to pass it because greater is he that is in you [Applause] glory be to god and the christian attitude now that's within abraham it's not just abraham standing on the word of god honoring god's word but he's honoring the word of god and at the same time honoring the word he's also honoring lot without compromise he's not going along with lot like let's let's go on down that way and let's go no he's standing on the word honoring god god's beholding all this and at the same time he's honoring what you make the choice abraham didn't ask him now what started this whoo abraham probably knew better now he everyone's saying we ain't getting this in the pastoral office he gained the benefit of the doubt benefit of the doubt and notice how god honored his attitude god let abraham in the situation that god had already orchestrated and allowed to come to pass god stepped back and abraham displayed a real christian attitude and because of that once abraham was or lot was separated what did god sell to abraham abraham lift up now thine eyes look to the north look to the south look to these look all around you for the land i give it to you all right brother says it like this i close god saw that great move that abraham had done that great thing that he had submitted himself and give his brother the benefit of the doubt and took the lower part abraham what what part are you going to take i'm taking the barren lands you see within that when abraham gave that choice lot also showed what was in him but abraham even when it came time for judgment showing that abraham kept no records of evil he said lord per adventure there's 50. will you spare the city what about 40 30 brought it on down 10 who was he interceding for lot lot wasn't thinking about lot wasn't thinking lot didn't know what was coming on but look what the effect of this light did this revelation it continued to mold the very character within abraham to abraham's standing as a king and as a priest in honor referring to one another amen may god help us as delegates of that city lord mold me shape me lord help me to humble myself help me to take the things to you in prayer and just to be honest just to really lay our hearts out before god and lord jesus that you would help us to enter in on behalf of brother or sister or whatever it might be because remember lot was not a believer of the same quality of abraham doesn't mean now don't take this out of context it doesn't mean that everybody that doesn't agree with you or they're a penny no there's sometimes there's disagreements between silver dollars and sometimes there's disagreements and things between silver dollars and pennies and sometimes there's disagreements between silver dollars and things that are not even change wrote on the book of life but this is where the scripture says to honor all men is that right may god help us lord jesus i'm grateful lord for your mercy your word lord as you speak to us it challenges our hearts father there's we say man to it lord the desire from our heart is that our lives would be molded in your to your own glorious image lord these many of these scriptures these parts within it lord we need your help lord jesus because lord we know that this is not it doesn't just lie within us lord to move in this way but there's a longing the desire in our heart as believers is to please you lord jesus and lord to see how that you move oh god seeing abraham's attitude in that time lord you came down oh god and you spoke to abraham to look from where he was oh god he seen the land as that land of possession that land that belonged to him oh god help us lord help us these are lord this is what we desire lord that you would speak to us lord as you spoke to abraham lord that you lord speak to our hearts in that way help us lord help us lord to recognize that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord lord sometimes it's so easy for us to recognize it when it's things that are going our way when things don't rub against the grain but god help us to recognize when that does rub against the grain that it's that's the moment that lord we need to ask for your grace lord jesus to submit to the molding of the potter's hand help us lord i pray as lord you would speak out dear god through your prophet back to us it'll take perfect love to get there we know lord jesus that that love it's the holy spirit it's your own life the love of god dwelling in us lord that love dwelling in our life it presses within us it moves within us even lord of something that may be that just the slightest little bit maybe it's been a thought maybe it's been some way that we've acted or or even the feeling about an action maybe it's not even an action that lord where a finger could be put on it but it's just something about it within us that we catch that point that's not us that's you lord oh god help us to be sensitive help us to be sensitive lord jesus we don't want to grieve your presence lord help us to be sensitive lord i pray to you lord god to be able to stand in that place [Music] to know that lord god we're put here to be instruments for your service lord your prophet would put it like this to be instruments in this last day to bring the realization of god before the people help us lord help us lord i pray may we just stand in the water of that word lord allow the word to wash us may we just give ourselves lord more and more to you lord make me more like you lord a very simple song that we sing but lord with all of our hearts this is our desire to make us more likely help us lord god not to get our eyes on the things of this earth help us lord to stand as abraham stood that day abraham realized he was heir to it all and because he recognized that it affected his conduct in that moment lord jesus let that realization of the airship as sons and daughters of god let it become more real to us the lord sometimes the feelings or offenses help us lord help us to recognize these things their temple help us not to get pulled down and trapped into him lord but help us lord i pray to stand like abraham stood and take the initiative and say we don't want no fuss no arguments no strap here we're brothers we're family glory be to god in honor of preferring one another help us lord to have that deserve it lord help us father i pray we love you lord tonight may you lord bless this time lord the baptismal that will take place i pray that god you'll bless our sister lord amen i pray that lord god as you who begun this work in her heart lord i pray that god that you'll come and you would cap it off lord jesus may lord god from even as her heart lord was sensitive just to surrender just to yield to you as you would deal with her may lord that same simplicity she would just continue to yield to your voice and knowing the lord god you will lead her in the paths of righteousness you will finish your work granted lord i pray in the name of jesus christ don't you just love me oh my let's just worship him a little bit as we make ready for that baptismal service i don't even like to say a little bit because he deserves worship at all times but when these things like this just strike our hearts just something about it and say lord i want that seed just to be watered in me i want to just i want to be more like him i want to be more like that my life could be so molded more and more into his image will i ever or will you ever reach the perfection to where we don't have certain feelings in a certain way no no that's not the perfection you will have those feelings things will come at you things will come at me but remember overcoming is to recognize the devil in every one of his trips and then recognize that god in you is greater he's already overcome that i'm thankful for that aren't you and that perfection on the inside it's calling us to that land you'll take us there he's molding us and shaping us he's preparing us even right now oh my hallelujah go ahead please [Music] fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my [Music] i just wanna think [Applause] [Music] fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my life [Applause] [Music] let me live in all that's true i just wanna think like lord teach me me and god show me your birthday [Music] fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my life [Music] let me live [Applause] oh take teach me to be still [Music] show me your purse oh i give my mind completely me to your thoughts make it all brand new change my lives [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] over over and over he molds me and makes me into his like this [Music] fashions the clay of honor am today yes all because jesus is he is he wants me to stay [Music] when i stumbled he just picks up the pieces [Music] [Music] he holds me and makes me into it's like this thank you lord who still fashions the and it's all [Music] you can be seated if you if you can't see you can stand up i think they're going to try to show me okay okay i just want to give a quick testimony of how my sister came let's say 25 30 years ago my brother bill at one of our family functions he tried to talk to her and he left and i came a little later with my wife and i sat next to her and she was very upset because somehow she got the understanding that bill told her that she was going to go to hell if she didn't give her life dear lord and it took me 45 minutes to calm her down so it wasn't her time so you know we're close family but yet we didn't we we see each other mostly on the holidays and that but when it came time to hang around with my sister we didn't hang around i didn't hang around with her too much but what happened was after mary's sister mary died in march she came up from columbus she's been living there for three years she came up from columbus and i asked her to stay with me and maria so as she stayed with us one day her and i were in the kitchen and we're just talking and all of a sudden she starts telling me that the lord was dealing with her she's been checking things out and and i just sat there i just listened because i didn't think too much of it i'm just gonna let it go so i got to a place where she she started saying that she needed the lord and i still didn't do anything but then after we kept talking she started to cry and that's when i stood up and i went to her and i told her i said i'm gonna i said i'm gonna pray but i'm gonna ask you to ask the lord to forgive you and to come into your heart and that's what happened we prayed amen and she she gave her life to the lord now here we are 14 months later she's been locked up in columbus because she hasn't been able to come out much maybe i've seen her twice and talked to her a few times but in the meantime the lord's been doing the work still in her life and i and i and we go back to that we've talked a few times already how it wasn't her time when bill spoke to her i mean anybody could have talked to her it wasn't her time so it wasn't a work that bill did myself it was the lord because the bible says that no man comes to god unless god first draws them and as we were even sitting at the same spot today her and i she just she's surprised how the lord is still dealing with her life it's a shock because that's what the and i told her i said that's the way the lord works so we're in 14 months ago after i talked to her a little bit more i we talked to her about baptism and then i told her it says well when you get ready to baptize you bill and i will baptize you and she goes good she says good so here we are 14 months later i wouldn't have thought this and probably her in bill when they thought we're bad guys here so it's all the work of god and we're very grateful let's pray together gracious heavenly father we come before you thanking your lord for another soul that's coming to your kingdom we're asking lord that we'll baptize here in this water but lord we want you to baptize it with the holy ghost of fire the lord we can do is commit it into your hands and lord she's believing lord she's grateful lord god for what you've done in her life and look what you're going to continue to do in her life we love you lord jesus we know that you're the baptizer we thank you my father through jesus christ what you're doing in my sister's life amen norma according to your faith we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] let's give the lord's blood of the land are your garments spotless are they white in the blood spotless are
