now oh I will take Hallelujah [Music] glory for all that I need [Music] oh I will play yes [Music] [Music] I need good let's turn in the word to Second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7. each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus it's so good to be together this morning it's good to be in his presence amen it's just so precious because of what the Lord will do Among Us in his presence things that many times that we are not even aware that God is doing while we're in his presence but it's just we know that he's moving and I just want to I just want my heart I want my spirit I want my mind if there's any thought if there's anything that's in anything else I want to just lay it aside amen and I just want to move with his presence amen second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7. scripture said for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace I really just want to lay on to that it's according to his own purpose and Grace brother Samuel I really wanted to be saved the only thing that could have put that desire in you is that was in you that was in you there was a longing for God and you didn't put that in you God didn't put that in you and there's nothing else that can truly satisfy that outside of getting fully in his presence amen but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto I am appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentile so if you'll notice Paul in verse 11 he just he wasn't saying I've chose this occupation I've chose to do what I'm doing but Paul is saying because of what he has done how he has come by my way then he has called me to this amen this has all been unfolded amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just dwell here upon this thought here this morning and we'll just see how the Lord will just take it but I'm again looking at these scriptures even from last week when we were dealing with the quickening power and there's certain things I want to get to with a quickening power that I I know there's no way in the world I'll get to it today and maybe even maybe a few weeks down the road but I want to take this thought here upon this because when you think of the quickening power of God remember how brother Brown says it did not just come and Quicken their spirits but it quickened the mechanics which was that seed that word on the inside that makes the word live out through our lives because um it could have it could come upon the spirit but it can leave and there's no anchor there's no typos there's no conversion when it just comes upon the spirit but when it comes upon that of the soul and there is a seed of life there by virtue of his of the predestinated plan of God it will Express God in this hour and I want to just deal with this thought here on zeroed in determined to fulfill his purpose says it like this and the message absolute he says he had a purpose in Saving me see God God is a god of purpose God doesn't even call this meeting here together just to take up time in our week God hasn't called this just to occupy a certain and give us something to do or even to make us feel good that's not the purpose of it he had a purpose in Saving me he had a purpose in Saving you and I am determined by his will that's key I am determined not by my own will but by his will to do it not to add to it or take away from it and your brother Brian goes on he says I'm so determined just to remain with this gospel as long as I live by the help of God and here is Grace there were Millions dying in sin when he saved me who was I that he should say he had a purpose saving me and I'm determined to carry out that purpose he says I don't care it might be my end maybe pretty soon now but whatever it is I'm still anchored never changed it it goes on very similar statement in another message of the absolute but I want to read how he says it here as well he had a purpose in Saving me he had a purpose in Saving you and I am determined by his will to do his will remember what the will of God is the will of God is to be filled with the spirit of God the will of God is that his life would be on display through him by a real born-again experience and we understand just in that phrase just in that term born again it's not the same life continuing on but it is a new life that's why we say a new birth because it's not the old man reformed it's a new creation amen created in Christ Jesus unto good works I am determined by his will to do his will and that's the reason he done it and I don't know why he done it Hallelujah not to add to it or take from it as I recorded he said or said in Revelations 22 19 he said don't do it if he is our absolute it cannot be otherwise there's no way for it to be otherwise he has got to be the absolute the last word and so when we when we see this not to add to or to take from I want to say this and just to drop this to start here this morning when we talk about a purpose the scriptures tell us that everything for everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven and the purpose that we are in right now in this hour the anointing that is upon the Church of the Living God in this hour is the anointing of the eagle that characteristic is is reflected in the anointing of the Holy Spirit coming upon the people of God so it is a power that is moving that is lifting a people from the cares of this world it is an anointing that is moving and directing our thoughts from Earthly things to Heavenly things it is an anointing that is bringing a faith in our life to believe things that reasoning says it's impossible that your own mind cannot even be able to make sense of but it is that which is surrendered and it's God moving in a way by the anointing upon the word of God that there is a people that are standing like Abraham when Abraham was there in Genesis 22 and I know we speak of Genesis 22 and we say that was a type of Calvary and so it was but it was also remember what God did in the groom it was a testimony of what he was going to do in the bride that there would be a Seed of Abraham a royal seed that was included in the promise that would come to a place of maturity in Christ that they would be willing to lay down everything everything and walk with the promise of God and that's a people that's ordained for this hour that's a people that's walking in perfect Faith that's a people that's in position for perfect Faith to move into this is a people that is ordained for the ram himself to appear we're living in that moment we're living in this hour in this time and I say as a Believer down Through the Ages that has served the purpose of God because if they were a Believer what designated somebody as a believer because they said they believed May but it was because they served the purpose of God is that right how could they have served God's purpose without God revealing himself to them right I mean you know how it is sometimes when you try to either sisters you bake something new or brothers you're trying to work on something new uh you look for certain things so that you're not necessarily staggering around you want to have a certainty about what you're doing and to think that within this God himself God Alone is the one who brings certainty in the life of the believer to where our life walks with a certainty it's not a in other words it's not a certainty that's between me and my daddy me and my mama me and my wife or my wife and my heart it's not it's a certainty that's between me and God that if nobody else no matter what anybody else that there is a certainty in your walk with God that I've met God I know God and God is in control that's what God intended that it would be that personal in our lives and every purpose of God is served the believer serves the purpose of God in the season in time of his revealing that's what brings the certainty and they manifest the promise of that age in the days of Luther they manifested that of justification they live free from that Creed that Dogma that tradition of uh you got to be saved you got to belong to the church to be saved but an anointing of the spirit of God Came Upon Luther and when he nailed those 99 theses through the door let me tell you something one he was nailing to the door God had already nailed or made real in his life and the people in that hour lived the just shall live by faith they manifested that how did they manifest it by the anointing that was set forth for the hour the man anointing coming upon them that characteristic of the spirit of God and they like brother Ram tells us in the fifth seal they could not help but respond the way they did to the anointing many felt the anointing but it mattered what was in them was there something there to respond to be quickened to respond to the anointing of the hour so I will say this we are ordained in this season to the time of completion this is Harvest Time this is the time where the mystery of God should be finished this is the season of rapture this is what the Church of the Living God has looked forward to and if I can even say it this is what the prophets of the Old Testament have looked forward to the whole Bible is pointing and written and is declared for this hour that's right it's that's why in The Taking of the book and the loosening of the seals it is releasing this to the believer that we can look in here and by the spirit of God making these promises alive to us to the believer it brings faith in our hearts it brings faith in our life it produces a faith walk thank you Jesus and I'm going to say the purpose that we are in is rapture [Applause] purpose we're in for this hour that's what everything is is about that's what every decision this I'm talking about personal decision every decision is about Rapture it should be the purpose is Rapture and it's not Rapture in terms of a coming event but the Rapture is on now are you with me at the opening of the seventh seal Christ coming down and descending it is the releasing of the anointing for the Rapture upon the body of Jesus Christ and that anointing is the token is the Holy Ghost in his fullness it is the abstract to the title deed it is Christ himself he's the one that's announcing you if not a man a man was only the microphone that the mighty Angel announced the Rapture is on and that must be a manifestation in our life it's not a catching away of our mind where we can repeat quotes but it's a catching away where our soul on the inside has been caught away from the hold of the devil we're aware of authority as come and said take your hands off of him [Applause] brother Samuel you don't know my life let me tell you something the prophecy when Jesus rode into Jerusalem he was speaking even of his return in this last day he rode on the fold of an ass one that could be redeemed Hallelujah he wrote in in power how is he coming in power he's writing in in the lives and hearts of his people Hallelujah oh Lord let my will let my attitude let my thoughts let my all be like the Palm leaves that are laid down for you to move upon now I want to deal with this zeroed in and determined to fulfill his purpose because it's according to his purpose that we are saved and called it was not us seeking after God it was God who came seeking for us the son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost right just like when you have something that you hey Hey where's this at where's this at where's that at and where's this at my keys where's this at where's this at what they belong to you you're looking for what is lost right so the son of man the ministry of the son of man is to seek and save what is lost what you think of this here this morning his purpose in Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and that's key you didn't say everything was good but it worked together for the good to them that what love God that's the key to them who are the called according to his purpose somebody say his purpose according to his purpose Ephesians 1 7 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and proven so it's God unfolding himself to you and I verse 9 having made known let me just pause for a minute that unfolding to you or I is not a teaching it's a person being revealed I want to just make that clear it's not a teaching it's a person being revealed he is abounding toward us it's not a teaching it's a person that's being unfolded and being revealed having made known unto us the mystery of his will I tell you friends that's a blessing because that in itself in verse 9 it it relieves us of our uh our stravings and laborings it brings it's an opening to the real rest of almighty God he reveals the mystery of his will so it's not me by my will trying to do his will [Music] are you with me Cain was a will worshiper he worshiped God by his own will but Abel worshiped God by God's will through his surrendered will that's why Paul can say in the book of Colossians that many in the how that they worship it is will worship they're willing something to God willing that God would receive something but that is not God's program God's program his will is that he would be the one that on the inside of us through a surrendered will think of it calvary how did Calvary come about nevertheless not my will thine will be done and that made a way for you and I to come to a place that we could surrender our will that his will might come fully in and that surrendering goes on notice the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is where we're at he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him right amen no now in which he hath purposed in verse 9 according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself and that word purpose it deals with something that is placed before or set before or set forth in other words it's something that can be looked at it's exposed to view it's to come into a public view like that and this is I love this this is how it uses it here in this Greek word it uses it as like a body of one who is dead lies in state now follow me now brother Adam tells us in choosing of a bride he talks about when that love of God Is So struck the inner part of our life by the Holy Ghost what is it it's a dead man a life that is died to self but is alive to Christ and that's right brother Brown said you ever trying to do anything to a dead person you need to do anything to a dead person I say God help me to stay so dead to myself dead to my will right oh my so it's a purpose didn't know he purposed god Set this forth now let me hone in on this God set this purpose that he purposed in himself god Set this purpose forth as Paul said through the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ God set it forth that he might dwell in man and have the preeminence the first place in man God and man were reconciled that then through that reconciliation God might reconcile the many sons and daughters that were already here are you hearing me the purpose God's purpose God's desire has always been to share eternal life with man when man fell he separated himself Listen by disbelieving the word of God he separated himself from eternal life is that right by disbelieving the word he forsook that of eternal life and so the only way that life itself the Tree of Life the only way man could ever come back to a place of being a partaker of eternal life it would have to be no other way outside of God himself manifesting himself in flesh and then for that then the purpose of God it's not that the purpose of God was stalled but God's purpose now is unfolding in a place now of redemption and because to all the heart purpose brother Brown would call it the heart purpose of God what would we say the heart purpose well the heart purpose of anything is the main purpose and the Heart purpose the Eternal purpose was that God was going to take a bride of his own choosing is that right and to think God himself think about how God would make himself known to Moses God would reveal himself there even in that Pillar of Fire but God changed there and now you know God came and he uh that he might dwell in man he went into spirit that he might dwell in man and God in Jesus Christ it was God acting in a man what he really was you want to know what God was want to know what the purpose that he had in himself it was God acting in a man what he really was Jesus Christ was God acting in a man in a man that's what he was so in other words as we said it was not a teaching it was Christ himself being revealed God was revealed in and through the body of Jesus Christ not a portion not a part but this was a moment of redemption down through the Seven Ages like the seven colors of a rainbow it's been the seven portions it's been God revealing himself but in the end time is where he steps forward and God veiled himself in a life that was Sanctified to his purpose and what was that all about that purpose was not to highlight brother Branham that purpose was to reveal Jesus Christ and let you and I know Redemption is all this is what belongs to you that's what it was all about what belongs to you not just at a church service but what belongs to you in your everyday life and love it's a victory it's a freedom it's a liberty yeah Moses seen the shape of his body right oh man that was God's glory being revealed what about now what about now oh his ground rate being revealed remember presence of God being revealed in a many-membered body well I don't know that's so-and-so this so-and-so be careful discern the Lord's body are you hearing me now he was acting in a man then Jesus but now he is acting through man that he is chosen for this purpose his purpose somebody say his purpose Ephesians 1 11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will praise God Hallelujah sometimes there's things and I understand there's times there's things that just feel so chaotic but let me just tell you something nothing is out of God's control that'll take a situation that somebody and turn it right around for his own Glory you say how can you say that because God's purpose cannot be defeated Hallelujah you can't stop God's purpose [Applause] Satan has tried over and over dumb devil you can't stop God's purpose you can't because if you can stop the purpose of God you can stop God and stop and defeat God's purpose I'd say when the Hebrew children were in the fiery furnace it looked like defeat was upon them but they were right where they needed to be that's right and just like me or you nobody would have signed up to go to the fair fiery furnace but God to prove that his purpose can't be defeated he anointed that King heeded seven times harder he would have done that he was the guy pacing the floor after they did it but why did they have him because the spirit that was there that got upon him to anoint it to hate it seven times hotter but God allowed that to be to prove one faith that you cannot destroy my purpose for men the men who threw him in there died but while they was in there God came to him let me tell you God ain't afraid of the place God ain't afraid of the fire god ain't afraid of the water God's Not Afraid of the test or trap or tribulation he's just as much God Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah and when they came out that fiery furnace the hair wasn't singed have that stuff when I light the grill I get curled up but the steak's worth it but then when the hair sensed the one their garment wanting sins let me tell you something they didn't have some flame retardant clothing on they weren't dressed down there in yellow suits with yellow hats they weren't walking around in tin foil like walking around a volcano they were enshrouded with the power of God because why they were walking in the will of God by his will they had a greater protection and fortification all around their life Paradox why wasn't their clothes burned but yet the ropes that held their hands was burned somebody [Applause] when they were bound to it how can that be burned and yet their clothing wasn't burned it's plain to me how they could come out of the furnace and not smell like they had been in a fire oh yeah [Music] Glory Glory well you know sometimes the way they fight fire is with fire [Laughter] whoo in whom we have also obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you know there's nobody that can display the attributes of God like you nobody can display that he's a savior unless you've been saved nobody can display he's a deliverer unless you've been delivered nobody can display he's a Shepherd unless he's your Shepherd see you were made to display his attributes oh my that's why we're not we were not made just to read about it but it was meant to be an expression a relationship that we were ordained to reveal and to manifest the attributes oh my I wish I could just leave her and preach on that a minute our life is to display those attributes and brother Brown said your purpose here is to worship God you cannot worship Him correctly until you worship Him in spirit and in truth now I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going somewhere now in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 9. and Paul would announce this was the burden that God had put upon his heart to make all men see and like brother Ben will pick that up over and over again and Christ the mystery all men won't see now when Paul said to make all men sing it was not Paul trying to exert and put humanly efforts in it but it was Paul uh yielding his human his human will to God's will let me give an example when times got hard in the in in in the city of Corinth it was a wicked and bad City and Paul those times were hard and Paul said I think I'm going to take a hotel in another city because this is bad he was ready he had already faced resistance are you hearing me now he had already experienced resistance but God came to him that night and said hey wait a minute I want you to remain here because I have much people in this city Hallelujah so even in the midst of this right here there were those that were ordained to life that even when the circumstances looked Bleak remember it would not be Paul that was making them to see it it was God is God coming down that's why it's all Supernatural are you hearing me now you could have a Bible study a month or Sundays and listen friends I'm not against Bible studies I'm not against those things but sometimes all we all that is done is more educating than in getting to the real purpose now I know I don't put no time limits on God you know if people are willing to meet and things like that but you understand what I'm saying that if I say all this pointing to and should point to one thing it's got to be a supernatural work between God and his people a man listen as much as I would want as a daddy I can't place that in the children I can't place it as a pastor I could put my human efforts in it and put myself in a grave God don't want my human efforts you want a scripture on that not by power not by might but by my spirit say it the Lord there's only one thing that'll move unbelief and that's the spirit of almighty God the presence of God coming down my mind to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery oh the mystery what is the mystery the mystery is God Christ in you the hope of glory to understand the part our part our share our participation notice from the beginning of the world who hath been a hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according listen now to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord according to what the Eternal purpose in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him now I want to deal with this word purpose here a little bit and I we're going to see where we where we move to on this because I've gotten more to go but I want to just lay this in and we're talking about the purpose of God in his purpose so not my purpose is his purpose if my purpose must be found in him if my purpose and his purpose aren't jiving together then we know who's wrong I'm wrong but my purpose is to be found in his purpose my purpose in life is not to take away from his purpose all right because my purpose is temporal but his is eternal and I want to we want to operate sure we have temporal things but we want to operate under the influence of the Eternal now here's the word purpose I love this and I'm promised I'm going to try to get not too carried away on this but I want you to catch this a purpose this right here according to the Eternal purpose this word right here it is the word that not only means purpose but it's the same word for shoe bread wow according to not just deal with me just be with me bear with me a moment and the shoe bread itself so let me just finish out this definition it's a setting forth of a thing placing of it in view the showbread so it's taking something and putting it in view so it's not hidden but it's in view now I want you to think of this because where this shoe bread and what it was just to give a little bit of a background it was 12 loaves of Wheat and bread it would be round like this and and it would be corresponding 12 of those loaves it would correspond to the 12 tribes of Israel so it had a connection with the tribes and these laws were offered to God every Sabbath and they were separated into two roads I don't want to get preaching the types but there's six here and six here and they were to lay for seven days upon a table and they were placed in a sanctuary in the front portion of the Tabernacle and afterwards of the temple so it was a purpose so here the Eternal purpose or the setting forth or placing into view or the the shoe bread that Eternal purpose what was purposed in Christ Jesus our lord so I'll just say it like this as the 12 loaves of bread were replaced on the Sabbath day it was placing those Loaves on his table when you read in the Scriptures it says his table it's not a man's table we are called to the Lord's table amen the Lord hath prepared a table for me not I prepared it do Lord have prepared a table for me in the presence of my enemies it was the placing of those Loaves on this table before the Lord that consecrated them to him so in order when the priest would make them they would make them there on the Sabbath day and they would bring in new Loaves and take those that were there and they would take them and they would eat the loaves that had been on that table for seven days are you hearing me that bread could it was only consecrated they went through all of the formulas doing this doing that fine flower all of that but it can only be consecrated when it was placed upon the table of the Lord before his presence before the Shekinah Glory of God now I want you to think this showbread when you hear the word showbread brother bran will call it shoe bread it's also called shoe bread but you notice it is the bread this is what shoe bread means it is the bread of his presence it is the bread of his face that's what shoe bread means the bread of his presence the bread of his face it's the bread can I say this the bread of his purpose amen so that bread now think of it here that think of it even how that God would pour out in every generation the hidden Manna to one a messenger that was ordained to receive that revelation and then there were those ordained to hear that Revelation and to receive it and walk in it Exodus 25 30 just so that we don't miss it here and thou shalt set upon the table of shoe bread before me always this word it becomes of his presence now and I want you to think upon this bread I wish I would have got the picture for you but just bear with me upon this showbread they were to put pure frankincense and frankincense speaks of divine service now I want you to think of this the Shekinah Glory the light of God coming upon the word of God is what reveals the purpose of almighty God let me just read a few statements here to you I don't have these posted there but you just have to bear with me the Shekinah Glory and the light of the Shekinah over the word and the word is a seed it brought forth the shoe bread to Believers only so it's the Shekinah ripening the seed bringing forth bread because what we're ordained to eat is not seed but bread is that right now the word of God is a seed and the seeds must be ripened by the presence of almighty God and when they are ripened by his presence then what we are partaking of is the bread of his presence it's the bread that reveals the purpose that we're called for you with me it's the bread of his face so it takes the word or the Water of Life to life in the sea now blood Ram goes on he says it like this it's all out of the thing and go God he said now breaking into the veil as we go through the veil and get into his presence where the word is not the Creed the word and in there seeing the Shekinah Glory the Shekinah the power the Holy Spirit shining upon the word bringing forth the promise it shows you're behind the veil so the word think of it now as the word as the promise of God the Shekinah Glory of God the Holy Spirit ripening the promise in our life taking a word God speaks to you and I a word a seed and you and I walk into the Shekinah Glory with that seed the presence of God will ripen that seed and make it live and what is it it then becomes the bread of his presence bread is the staff of life is that right now think of it here brother Brandon said I want you to think he said oh may we break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is Standing before you see who God is standing here before us the same Pillar of Fire he's veiled in human flesh notice he's not talking about history it's an announcement he's standing in human flesh oh he says what does the Shekinah do the shoe bread seed the word that we're to live on in this day by the promises the Shekinah Glory ripens that shoe bread brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer what has laid in the pages of the Bible year after year in the word for this age to every season there's a purpose through every time there's a season is that right there's a purpose notice this whole time he says here we are we are living in the time of Malachi 4 and what is that to do it's to turn the people back from the stumbling block to break down Traditions to reveal the bread with the Shekinah Glory to watch it ripen and produce just exactly what he said it would do it's the shoe bread for this age what are we talking about the purpose of God being revealed and God's purpose is not just something he's telling you but you listen when God told Elijah what to do Elijah in his weakest moment he ate the cakes that was made by by an Angel is that right and when he ate those cakes he went in the strength of that meal for 40 days I'm telling you we are not running by the strength of a Creed or a governor or a tradition it'll give out that's why you can't make this message a Creed and let it just stop with your mind let it just stop in your spirit with just agreeing with it you've got to die to yourself and become one with it Hallelujah then it become strength for the journey did it in making God empty promises I promise I'll not do this anymore I'll stop doing this I'll stop doing that but when it's in the word becomes rapid it becomes bread he said I am the bread of life the passion of Jesus Christ the bread of his presence the face of God revealed what did John see on the Isle of Palms he saw him what was it the bread of his presence the strength that he needed I'm telling you the strength to live and overcoming life it lays within the word of God it lays in the promises of God to help you clean up your life it lays in the promises of God but you've got to get zeroed in let me just say this I want you to think of this every Sabbath here they were 12 more lobes coming up and they would take those loaves that were there now I'm going to ask you what preserved those those loaves from corrupting help me now you sisters that make fresh baked bread and I'm not talking about the kind you buy from the store you know you bake it you better eat it right what a privilege right you know even you make ice tea you better drink it in a certain time coffee you better drink it in a certain time I'm asking you what kept that bread from spoiling what kept that bread that it won't know oh my we gotta eat this bread well you know just cut The Moldy piece off right there what kept the bread the shoe bread remember the purpose what kept it intact and not spillable spoiling what was it what was it that they have oh my brother Sammy they had super organic ingredients come on Church come on man I can agree they had it I could agree they had organic maybe they had organic but that ain't what kept it was natural ingredients but when it got [Applause] it got on his table what did it mean to be on his table it was a sacrifice glory be to God it was his presence that consecrated the bread it was his presence that kept molding us away from me are you hearing me now that's the same thing that keeps that whole Spirit of mold and complacency and starchiness away from your life what is it that keeps that man in check it is the presence of almighty God what is it the bread of his presence the shoe bread manna that is no longer just written where it's become light and light and power and glory and freedom and liberty the bread of his face the bread of his presence the bread of his purpose so there's an ongoing display in our lives because if that bread had been placed anywhere else it would have molded do you realize that's why and hear me out now that's why just to sit in the courts and hear the word and I believe in being Joy listen I get joy out of hearing the word of God but I know that my joy don't stop when I end are you hearing me my victory don't end when the Music Stops my victory don't let my victory my freedom my overcoming don't end when I get outside of church so it's not about I hope I can make it to Tuesday hope I can make it to Wednesday that's not a Christian Life let me just tell you you need to tell that devil and say I'm sick and tired of you robbing me of my privileges I don't have to live I hope so maybe so if I can hold on you can't hold on but you've got to have one on the inside of you that's greater than your will that's greater than your abilities because if not you can walk right out of a service like this and eventually you find mold in your life well I felt the prince of God nobody's denying that but it matters where it falls in your life remember the manna that fell out there they were to consume that Manna when it fell they took a golden Homer and put the manna that fell on the first day back in the holiest of holies the rest of the Manna after just within uh you know the hours of time it corrupted wow was there anything wrong with the Mana no it needed to get in the right place nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost come on Church well I've tried I've tried it's get the Holy Ghost it's got to be a real blue birth experience on the inside huh brother Samuel I'm tired of hearing that preach I imagine there were some people in Noah's day that got tired of hearing him not talk about rain but to me it's kind of comfortable to know where I'm standing because I'm also placed here as a light in this house to proclaim the Liberty that God has given to you that you don't have to live below your privileges come on friends you don't have to live below and let the limitations come in your mind well the devil said this well the devil said that when's the last time who says you got to listen to a liar everybody come on friends he's alive how do you know he's lying whenever he opens his mouth the spirit of God will never run you down he will bring conviction he wield you with your life he will call you through a higher walk he will tell you to stop living immoral he will tell you to put down cigarettes he will tell you to get off of the internet he will tell you those things why he's calling it alive [Music] okay oh my mama so our lives it's an ongoing display in our lives just as they had to make bread every seven days and they would put that bread right up there now I'm not talking about getting down and discouraged but if down and discouraged leads you away from the house of God you need a deeper walk with God you wanted you saying you're living underneath the lights when it's cloudy outside it's cloudy when it's sunny glory to God it's sunny when it's raining Oh Me Oh My God come on friends we don't live and serve God by our feelings it's time to get to a place that we're beyond our feelings oh my so it's an ongoing display so our whole lives are the display of that shoe bread man of his face our lives are to be a reflection of his presence in all things remember it was what was hidden but it's a reflection in all things every one of us have our own walks of life places we come from we have decisions that are placed before us constantly is that right but the shoe bread man of which is the purpose of God that which gives us strength let me tell you if you're not feeding like you ought to be you're going to be weak this is desperation how should I be eating this shoe red Mana it's time for Rapture you need to have your shoes on you you need to make sure that there aren't things that are hanging down in your way no nothing that's going to impede the coming of the Lord in your life over the same I'm ready to go do you have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost you ain't ready to go that's first things first well I'm trying to get this straightened out first you worry about let all that other stuff you can't never straighten those things out you gotta let God be God first you got to seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness let me tell you something God will come when you mean business and it'll have to be shown through your life whoo What is it I'm talking about a bread with purpose in it a bread that when it's being ripened it takes a hold of our life a bread that gives leadership to us my mama it's 12. a number of horseshoe I want you to think of this positioned and placed in him and you know what it's not confined to a day I know they had to do it every Sabbath day but it's not confined to a day no more with a believer once you cross over into that Eighth Day once the New Birth has come once the Holy Ghost has come then you are living under the Feast of almighty God you're living by the strength of the shoe bread in your life in other words your life is the testimony and Witness of what a real Christian is you want to know what Jesus would do in this hour our lives are to display that wonder what Jesus would do on this situation wonder what Jesus would do here wonder how Jesus would raise his family wonder what Jesus would esteem to be the most important well whatever he did before he's still the same God is that right and if we're eating of the shoe bread word the bread of his presence it has the same effect on our lives let me just let me let me let me close with this here my I'll tell you sometimes I I just I hate the clock there's other times I love it there's other times I hate it and this is a time I hate the clock you say why because I feel like I just got lifted off but I want to say this that rightful partaking of his the bread of his presence remember his purpose according to his purpose as we're partaking of that word that is his purpose his life and it shows itself through our lives let me just I'm going to close with this thought here it's out of the message faith is our Victory if you haven't listened to that message you'd be a good message to listen to here I'm just drawing a lot from into that and throughout the messages of the absolute rising of the Sun and so forth but faith is a victory be a good one let me just say it this the purpose the purpose in your life or my life what we hold or esteem I'll say this what we hold our esteem is our purpose it shows see the shoe bread manna was hidden it was hidden the rest of them could not see that but only the priest who was separated could be a partaker of it and by being a partaker of that it was then if we can bring it to this point now it's reflected in our lives so it shows no matter what we say and you've heard brother Branham you've heard this statement over and over and it's not just statement brother Brands made but it's a common statement before all of us actions speak louder than words so whatever the purpose in your life whatever you do not what I say and I say well my purpose is to do this is to do that but remember it's his purpose and then we find our purpose in his purpose let me just close on this Bill REM said any of you know that in Olympics or any other athletic exercises no matter if you arrive first in the race if you haven't played the game according to the rules you're disqualified you have to play the rule right and that's the way it is with the human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect to win you've got to play it according to God's word and the purpose that you were brought here for now there's so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of a purpose in life now watch out brother Brown describes this doesn't seem to have any kind of a purpose in life especially in the day that we now live in people just seem to think that all they have to do is keep up with somebody else boy I'll tell you if there ever was a time for that I mean you had to look next door to see what color they painted their steps now you just go on Facebook and they can Photoshop their steps it's all they painted them till green gotcha that was just a picture some of you'll get that tomorrow especially in this day that we now live in people just think that all they have to do is keep up with somebody else it's a rat race but Satan has designed it in the beginning he presented to Eve God won't mind God understands God really knows and then he raised her curiosity to look into it are you with me raise the curiosity what was it to get her to reach after something and yet she was in safe in God's Pavilion she had everything that she had need of right then all she had to do was wait on God's season that's all she had to do but see how Satan's desire is to try to reach for this reach for this listen friends you may not be reaching for sin you say well I'm not reaching for sin but I want to remind you of this the root money is the root of all evil and if everything that you're doing and sacrificing is for money you need to you need to get back in the friends of God either you've never been or you need to go fully into it are you hearing me brother Samuel that's strong well in this hour I know we're living in an age that really don't like to hear tough things but I'm I'm I believe I'm talking to believers who want to hear and if you don't sorry we'll give you earplugs the next time because I'm I'm going in a rapture and there are there are lives and hearts that this word is rapturing and catching away not just in a day coming but right now Moment by Moment by Moment by Moment by from Glory unto Glory unto Glory under Glory as I'm feeding on the bread of his presence foreign which is revealing the purpose of God for my life let me finish this quote I always have to keep up with somebody else with the Fashions of this world and with the enticements that the world has to give it's just like if you go to school and some of the little girls wear a certain little frock or dresses or whatever you'd call it all the ambition of the rest of that school has is to pattern after that girl with its hairdos or you know got to wear a certain certain style or you got to wear you know you got to wear everything in a certain way it's got to be it's got to be out right here you know wow that's cool who said it was cool I say that in a matter that we want to be careful what we're patterning after yeah yeah and I'm talking even to the young people because what you pattern after those Styles carry spirits are you hearing me now this is free it carries spirits who is it that would draw you and motivate you to want to be like somebody else out there God's given enough examples right here in his word God's given it if you can really say God my eyes I'm looking at the wrong thing I'm setting my ambitions on the wrong thing when you set your Ambitions and your sights on the patterns of this world you're missing God's purpose you weren't to be a dummy in a display of that of Satan Styles you were to be a display of the glory of God as a young person yes as a young person the Holy Ghost doesn't have any age limits on it and when I said a dummy I'm talking about a mannequin just so we understand some of the women see on television some sort of lady come out might as well say Instagram whatever insta book to Facebook whatever television some sort of lady come out and dressed in a certain fashion that's their ambition to dress and to act like that that's just about the limit of the American ambition is to get a new job or to get a raise in your salary and to get a television or a new car wow sell out time with God for things that are temporary things that you could turn around let's just talk about a new car drive it off the lot already lost thousands of dollars nothing wrong with a new car but if a new car if it's going to require you and keep you out of the prince of God where you can't pray and get before God and be in the house of God that I'm telling you that ain't God's will you'd be better off driving a car that you had to duct tape together and paddle around like Fred Flintstone and be in the presence of God I ain't saying that to be funny I'm saying it because it's the truth you know why because you can't even be free in your mind when you got things on your mind and the Bill's going to get paid am I going to be able to do this am I going to be able to do that it's traps it's what is it trying to do weigh you down and Satan said it's all right that ain't sinful but it's weighing you down it's taking away your meditation there's anxiousness setting in there's depression setting in there's tenseness setting in all these excuses come here what you're doing trying to keep your way from the shoe bread manna that reveals to you this is not your home this is not your purpose oh my wow no one only got two more paragraphs I just want to set this for a Direction because everybody's got Ambitions oh I'm I'm uh I don't have ambition no you just watch it you you watch the purpose whatever the purpose is whatever let me say this whatever is first in your life and whatever you value the most it'll show it shows let me say this those things brother Brandon said they may be all right but there's higher Ambitions in the human life than those things and Christians should set their affection on higher Ambitions now that's scripture let me make sure I'm reading that right and God should set the Christian's affections on higher ambitions no Paul never wrote it that way in Colossians 2. he says if you are raised with him if you're raised with him you set your affections on things above that may be where you've got to pray and say Lord there's some things that's pulling on me some wants but there's one want that I know that I need and that's you because I don't want my wants to become Shackles on my life when my prayer life is Shackled In My My Walk with You becomes paralyzed because what's what's happening it's paralyzing the purpose that God's called you for I think it would pay us all to set down and wonder why we are here in the first place ever who it was kind enough to bring us here we ought to consider and ask him what he would have us to do the purpose of his coming and to fulfill what he has purposed us for right I think that would be I don't just think once I think that every day Lord take my hand guide me this day Lord Jesus Lead Me Lord there will be decisions that will be placed before me that I I don't I don't trust myself but I'm asking you to be the influence Lord you know what is the next step ahead of me Lord I don't know but I want to feed on the bread of your presence of what is the real purpose of my life like when you get into that place you think this is where I belong this is it this is where I belong where in him in his presence in his presence now you know what if there's anything that Shackled you down and has got you away from the prayer the purpose of God right here this morning he's still the one to release shackles it may not be necessarily things that you could just shake off and you know put to the side like like this right here of my handkerchief but it might be things that what you've got to do is eat yourself and pray yourself free in your own life you say why would God do that because if God just lifted certain things from our lives we would turn around and get tangled right back in the same mess the next time is that right so God is a faithful father because remember he's got a purpose all of his discipline all of his correction all of his admonition he is here for the full nurturing and counsel of Our Lives and there's one thing that God desires is that we would serve his purpose I'd say Lord this morning if I've got a purpose that I'm putting up here and it's adding to the word of God or taking away from the word of God or making a word of God not that important or less I'd say Lord Jesus grant me Deliverance this morning Deliverance this morning because you know what it is it's all about us recognizing it sometimes we look and say I want to get right out of this but remember remember eating our way and praying our way to Deliverance because what will happen the word will give you wisdom and strength because you'll be faced with that test again you'll be faced with it again every test when we fail a test we will have to take it again we'll have to keep on taking it until we finally pass it how do I pass it with the pass over I pass it with his strength I pass it with his help I believe God I believe he's here I believe we've gathered right here in this presence and what a moment and an opportunity friends if the word of God if it's only been something that you've enjoyed and it's only fell on your spirit and you go right back out and live the same kind of life that you've always lived why don't you let God say Lord I need a real Deliverance in my life and you know what if you're not at that place of real desperation in your life with God you need to get desperate you need to say Lord Make Me desperate Lord because it would do you no good if you're not desperate it would do you no good but say Lord Make Me desperate make bring me to the place of desperation like you brought Jacob to as long as everything kept on going okay for Jacob Jacob was okay but eventually God started turning so things the countenance of his father-in-law turned against him Jacob started noticing certain things oh I'm not I I can't dwell here anymore I can't dwell there and God was calling him come back to Bethel come back to Bethel I say this morning let him be the Lord of your life if you've never received the Holy Ghost let it be here this morning let it be a real desperation upon your life but remember God will not come over unconfessed sin he will not come over and do a work when you're living in a way that you shouldn't be living but if you can stand and really from your heart say Lord forgive me and I make a declaration by his word by the strength of the bread of his presence Lord I'm going to live for you it's you that I want it's you that what matters more than anything else in my life when you can get desperate that way he'll come you say how do I get desperate ask God if it's not there say Lord think about it life and death it's got to be between life and death maybe here this morning maybe things that you've got entangled with certain things and you think man I just can't do what I what I used to do I can't do what I used to do man I used to be able to do this and used to build that well listen first of all I'm just going to say to you don't roll around in pity because I won't do you no good that that's another one of Satan's tactics to roll around and then we get to look and oh but right here this morning the first way of Deliverance is to recognize I need help I need help I need help I need God's direction for my life I need God to come I need that first part in my life that's what I need let's pray Lord Jesus oh Father Lord is here we are gathered you're under Lord the roof but I believe that we are gathered more than just under the roof of this building we have gathered Lord God under the revealed word of this hour gathered under your presence Lord Jesus it's not us that has brought us to this place that Lord you have led us you have drawn us Lord father you see Lord every need all throughout Lord there's needs throughout the building you know every Heart Lord father lives that Lord where there's a need of a real desperation Lord Jesus I pray that God that May there be Lord a desperation Lord in the hearts that would set in by your presence Lord pray that God that Lord for lives and hearts Lord that your God that don't know you Lord in that way that Lord just to know the word is not life but it's to know you Lord to where that it's your life that's on display in our life it's something Lord that starts in a very simple reflection that could be asked the life that I Live Now is that a life that I would have to try to explain to somebody or is there a life a testimony of a Christian that's on display the lord requires not even my speech but it's lived it's lived the world Lord will classify when they can see people on Sundays dressed up maybe shirt tied suit not stress whatever it might be they can classify all those are church people well they go to church the Lord we're not called to be church people that's not what a Christian is a Christian does Lord does go to church but a Christian Lord is not a church life Lord I know we've heard this over and over and over and I'm sure I'm sure oh God the effects Lord where it will take an effect as it has throughout the Time Lord my prayer father I don't want to see nobody miss it Lord I don't want to see him miss the joy that is right now the freedom the victory the Liberty that God you have made available right now Lord may be a son or daughter that's underneath Lord a cloud of darkness and dismal but father your voice would call out to him Lord and let them know I am your Liberty I am your freedom granted Lord I pray this morning father if there be any Lord that we can look down lord in our lives if there's anything Lord God that is caused us to be hindered decisions that we've made that Lord God is hindering hindering the Lord the purpose of God from being served in my life I would but if I could but Lord I pray this morning Lord Jesus may it be so personal Lord God between every one of us Lord between us and you I pray father may you grant the Lord God that that what's needed right now Lord to lead us Lord because we can never see that Lord that we're in a trap we can never see what's going on we could try to go from this to that to this Lord and it ends up being a more of a tangled up mess but Lord God right here this morning Lord in the bread of your presence the bread of your face the bread of your purpose the purpose Lord that we are called to Lord Jesus we're taking Lord from that bread this morning Lord to receive strength Lord in our lives strength Lord God to stand there and say Lord forgive me Lord strength Lord Jesus to be able to say Lord help me there's some decisions Lord that I've made that I need Grace Lord God I need strength Lord God there's certain things Lord we need you Lord Jesus oh God may you Lord as you would just move throughout this audience here this morning may we accept the grace of God moving by our way oh God and just to draw strength from you Lord from the purpose of God Lord I don't want to go about my according to my own ways my own doings I want to walk according to your will Lord Grant Lord I pray father Hallelujah amen Hallelujah oh my god

place but when the word spoke to him in another place Cain said no no no no my humility ends right there but you know humility itself is even when the word speaks to our life and it might go against the grain but we say Lord this is your word and you know the reality of it is is God does not come God the spirit of God does not work in condemnation he does not work to do that the word brings correction and the whole word of Correction is meaning restoration and healing he's not given us the spirit of fear but of Power of Love and a sound mind Lord I want more I only want more but even as I'm eating on this bread I want to humble myself if there's things that I'm eating on the bread and it points out things that's there in my life things that could be hindrances that's what the word has come to do to changes that's what we've come to the house of God isn't it that's what we give ourselves to the Lord as the Lord I want to be further changed I want to be changed because you know what one of these moments is going to be the final moment of change the same sweep that leads us right now to change will be the same sweep that'll move over us will change the very atoms of our body oh Lord I want to just I want to just take in that bread of his presence if it's something that's against my will or my wants Lord I want your will above my wants it doesn't mean I may not be disappointed but I want his will I'd rather be disappointed right now and then later down the line a day a week or whatever down the line I say thank you Lord for grace that gave me to go against what my will was and to accept your will right oh Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord as we just Lord come into a moment right here Lord I just pray that you would just go with each and every one Lord more different ones Lord as we go our different ways Lord God for every need Lord that has been gathered here this morning in every heart Lord as we take the words and we lay into our hearts and allow the word to just comb through our lives Lord with just our desire is to be pleasing Lord Lord we want to just look in the mirror of your word and we're Lord we see our shortcomings we know it's your love that would make that known to us because it's your desire to do for us to move in our lives Lord we want to be Lord zeroed in and determined to fulfill the purpose of God distractions everything all
