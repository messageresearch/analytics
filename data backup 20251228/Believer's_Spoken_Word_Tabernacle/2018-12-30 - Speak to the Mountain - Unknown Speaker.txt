that's said and done we pray in Jesus precious name Amen and the church said a man god bless you you may be seated this morning we greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and being your greetings from our home church that's her life tabernacle as well as sister Loretta and of course brother Paul and all the campers are at camp and that's why we're looking a little sparse here this morning because there's a camp going on and that's important that was a week a man I'll tell you who but it is important because the future of the church is up there amen praying we're praying God will bless them train God will filled with the holy gold praying God will meet their needs and they'll come back and courage and on fire and start a fire around us here to be able to be a blessing so we're thankful for the opportunity to come this morning for the sim kind of called last minute and asked us to come and we didn't know for sure if we'd be able to come because I knew it's just a loretta wasn't able to drive and and I don't drive that good anymore I Drive good it's just that I somebody said I had bedroom eyes they keep going closed and when they go close I like to sleep so driving is not a real good thing for me if it's a long distance anyways but we're certainly happy to be here and brother Kinsel act it was so gracious this morning from our assemblies a guitar players there a musician's been there for well since almost at the beginning of the church in many many years now and for the kids a good buddy of mine and so I called him there are texts and rather and said hey would you like to go with me he text me back and said okey-dokey I had heard that term in a long time but years old as us okie-dokie work so so okey-dokey here we are but we're happy to be here III called brother Sam right let him call me yesterday and talk with him a little bit not really wanting to get into any of his territory for the New Year's and for Christmas and things of that nature I didn't know exactly which direction to go this morning but God had laid on my heart once he had called and asked us or text us and asked us to come the Lord kind of been dealing with me to speak this morning a little different thought and not really preached but maybe just a little admonishment a little teaching that we've done at home we've done it for a couple years in a row I think we've been able to speak they're on it in in that is then they're simply on setting goals in our life setting goals in our life so with your permission and I already have his it's not on no I don't wanna work okey-dokey we will okey-dokey I don't matter it's something what's easier on you are you sure perhaps if you let me this morning I'll just share some things from from my heart I've done it with a home church there in at home with with brother Paul's group the last couple years and our family for I don't know how many years or just more than I could even account right now but we have always tried to have around New Year's a goal-setting session with our family where we'd all get together and come together and we we'd write down our goals for the coming year and and for short-term for long-term spiritual goals and natural goals and health goals and financial goals and just goals goals goals you would just write them down and it's always been a blessing because that they're coming when the next year comes we'd get our piece of paper out if we can find him I never could find mine but we'd get our piece of paper out and we would go through the list of what we wrote down and and what we saw come to pass what God has helped us bring the past that year and it's astonishing some of the things I'll share some of those things with you when we come down to the end of this so I thought maybe this morning if it's okay with everyone we'll just take a little time well it'll be relaxed I won't be preaching so is there any visitors or anybody visiting this morning or are you all any I'm not gonna want to barish I just want to know if you've never how many's never heard me speak before oh you never have well bless your heart god bless you it'll be open okay boy oh boy these guys are sensitive around here okay all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna take the time to do that and I I should have read the scripture while you were standing but if you don't mind standing with me one more I got two verses here that I want to read is found in in mark 11 verses 23 and 24 and I've got to be honest I've thought this every time I've come here and stood here promise me you'll mention it to the trustees or deacons I need a light right here this is so dark on to me on the pulpit here that it would be nice to have a spot that just come right down here didn't I don't want it in my eyes but I'd like to have it so if somebody could remember to mention that to brother salmon to the trustees and to the Deacons and to the the people that are in charge of blindness in the it would help it would help okay so I'm gonna try to I'll try my best to read this so mark st. mark 11 in verse I think I said what I say 20 23 and 24 very familiar to us okay for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed is that what it says what it says be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and I can't read it come here son come on up here yeah come on you can read can you read those two verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall what's have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them he shall have them even you have them therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and and ye shall have them you shall have in these itself hey give him a hand he done a fantastic job thank you brother and then they come up and tell me it's right there all you got to do is what sorry son that's how he gets by now I know but Sam's younger than I am he's got good eyesight so and but this this ain't all up there I wish I would have had time to do that I wrote this out the other day while I was trying to get some thoughts together here so one more time father bless this meeting in Jesus name Amen god bless you you may be seated so I want to speak a little bit on goal setting today if you don't mind and like I said we our family has done this for a number a number of years and I want to just take the time it hopefully won't be very long but what I want to do is just share some things that I feel are principles of life or important things enough to to do the right things in life I know the LaFontaine family is not anything special as far as being any different than anybody else God has blessed us God is with us through the years I'm very thankful to have my children serving the Lord and I and I say this without any reservation it's nothing that mummy and I did it's it's totally His grace that has allowed us to be able to do that I'm glad our grandchildren are all in the church and serving the Lord of the best of their ability and now I got two great-grandchildren who are also who are also potential believers and are also gonna be tremendous even though the last names van Wyk they're gonna be tremendous it's okey dokey so that's the phrase for the day can you just coin that phrase got it back into my memory from eons of time as a goal alright so this will be a little difficult more difficult than what I thought too to be able to read this so you just bear with me no but we know that we know that life is not easy life can can sometimes dish up some pretty tough things and it's not always easy to be positive it's not always easy to just stay on top of things it's not always easy to to be happy when you're facing some of the trials and tests and some of the things that we go through in life you can offer some pretty some pretty rough territories and pretty rough things to do and even though we we you know we'll face sometimes situations and troubles and problems and things of that nature we always try to encourage people to to stay positive to keep the right attitude we're talking about it in the office with brother bill back there there's things that we can always complain about all of us there's always going to be something in our life that's not going to go the way we want it to go there's going to be situations and things arise that are gonna be trials and tests and in in in mountains or whatever you want to call it you say to this mountain there's always going to be things that are going to be hard for us at times to adapt to but we've got to try to keep a positive attitude other random said this little bride is never negative she's always positive brother if you're gonna light up here you were so sweet but I don't need it I'll get by with if it's gonna be a big problem you got you it's okey dokey we do things strange when I come around here so I remember I remember one time I forget where it was now I kept going to a church and their platform wasn't this high but it was I it was a huge step for me and didn't have a railing and they didn't have a step and I'd have to every Sunday I go they have to step up or win tonight and so I kept saying you know what I need I need a step down here guys I need a step down so and then I said because I doll just have to lean over on the piano it get up there like this and it was awkward so finally after years of saying I need I need so you never give up you always express your needs the brother him or his daughter I don't know who it was Oh give him a hand he just left every night oh my goodness my goodness had him up snowing I'm only kidding thank you brother I appreciate that so they got a step and and then they put a railing up there and and I don't go back there very much anymore because I don't travel that much anymore but they did do it and now what can I say this is so this beats putting the spotlight up there really because the only thing is it takes room up if brother Sam's got a big bunch of notes and stuff so but anyways so when we look at when we look at these things now as we try to zero in on a thought here for a little bit today when we face these things we want to try to encourage ourselves and in anybody else our honesty to stay positive when brother man that made that statement this little bride is never negative she's always positive I thought whoa how do you do that well it's it takes work it takes sacrifice it takes it takes being on top of your thoughts what are your thoughts come from when you're going through trials and tests and tribulations what is your thought header where's it at why me Lord or thank you Lord for an opportunity to serve you today that Lord whatever comes my way I know you're going to help me through it because he's the same yesterday today and forever and what he's done for others he'll do for me hey man because he's no respecter of person so it's not what's what our name is it's who we are as far as our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ it has to stay the same so this little bride is never negative she's always positive no matter what we're going through and let me just say it like this no matter what the battle is no matter what the mountains are that we're facing there's a god that has the answer for us to every situation to every problem to every need that we're facing so it's not always easy to be positive but it's always beneficial because if you get under the circumstances they can weight you down pretty bad they can take away your joy they can take it away here happiness take away the the blessings that God has in store for you so we want to always try to keep a good attitude for the things of life and the circumstances of life and even though even though we mess up by everything that we make mistakes sometimes we say things we shouldn't say sometimes the pressure gets so great that things come out of our mouths that we were and you know what you can't you can't just reach back up and put them back in they're gone they're out there all we can do is repent later Lord sir I'm sorry Lord forgive me or if we've offended somebody ask your forgiveness because that's a good thing to do hello that's a good thing to do to be able to do things that way so as we're looking at this this morning and I know I was probably about 14 years old when I have an uncle I had an uncle he's gone now his name was Jim my Uncle Jim he was my mother's brother he came to me when I was about 14 years old just a young person and he looked at me one day and he said he said what are your goals for your life about 14 years old I'm just I'm just a kid I'm playing ball I'm enjoying life I've got all of my friends I had given my hearts of the Lord and an alter my life turned around I love the Lord with all my heart but here's my uncle standing in front of me saying what are your goals why immediately he responded with heavens my goal good answer right I thought so but he didn't he won the Christian he said no no I'm not that's not a goal that's not what I'm talking about it I didn't have a clue I had never had anybody asked me that question what are your goals and I was really dumbfounded when he said I I just said no no heavens Michael that's my I don't want anything else and I just want to go to heaven I didn't realize there would be like 70 65 years in between then and now that I mean I'm still I'm in heavenly places at times not all the time but there's times that I've been heavenly places but but I'm not I'm not to that place yet where I'm what I would call in heaven so in the meantime he's saying what are your goals not not talking about heaven I'm talking about what are your goals here for you in this life well I didn't have any who at 14 has goals I want to be a professional baseball player because my grandfather was I wanted to be a good Christian because I believe that's what I was called to be but I didn't know what the future I didn't had any idea that's why immediately when I graduate from high school I went I went into the Air Force because I had no direction in my life no goals nothing said I guess I was just gonna I didn't know you know what it's gonna do so it was a challenge it was something different then what I've learned then later on in life I learned that if we don't set goals or set things down in our life that we want to accomplish then it becomes very difficult to really accomplish anything or go anywhere in life to make it ahead as we call we need things to look forward to without which life can become very hard and very miserable very mundane now as a believer we know heavens are our home and that's a good goal that's a good answer but it's 2019 almost and we're not there yet we thought I thought I come up in this thing for a few years I thought 1977 was gonna be it when John Paul was born in 1966 I said he'll never go to school he did he graduate it took some college courses semester to he's 52 years old now my son who wasn't ever going to go to school is 52 years 1973 come around I knew a family you would know some of you if I called her name so I won't call her name but in 1973 they got rid of their rakes their holes their lawnmowers and everything because the calendar stopped in 77 that's what somebody said wasn't gonna be anything past then so you count back three and a half years for the rapture the tribulation so we're gonna get out of here in 73 so they mmm got rid of this guy when visited them hardly had a chair set on outside I said what are you doing said well we're the raptures taking place we're getting out of here that was great I went back and visited them next year or two new whole new rake new lawn horse it didn't happen no they didn't do that because they wanted to be weirder abroad to be straight they did it because they really believed and it wanted to get out of here I want to get out of here I remember I was at an altar in 1977 I was at an altar on December the 31st on New Year's Eve at midnight and I was praying Lord Lord 77 the calendar said Lord get me out I'm still here you're still here we've got to deal with life we've got to live with it I believe we're going I believe it's going to happen I believe the time is coming but until it does we've got to deal with the here and now we've got to live a victorious life in this present world and what I went on to learn in life is that successful people set goals they do I didn't know that at the time I I had no idea that the things would be that headed and that that tough in life but now I realize it and I learned through these years that we must have the right attitude about things and we must be able to set goals and thoughts of our important things that we need to deal with now and in a near future in this life so I'd like to speak a little bit this okay am i doing okay everything okey dokey okay I'd like to speak just a little bit about about some of these things that I've you know encountered through the years and some thoughts and suggestions if I can do that to put down and so that's what I want to do this morning is just be able to do that and some of the things that were that I would call keys or that helped make us successful and happy and in this life he said in the text here and I were that we read in his word he said we need to speak to the mountain young man right here read it we need to speak to the mountain and my question to you this morning is what mountain are you facing this morning what mountain is standing before you personally this morning that looks like an insurmountable mountain it's so high in your life that there's just no way in your thoughts or mind that you're ever going to get over it it's so big and wide that you don't think you could ever get around it and it's so deep and so low down that you're never gonna be able to dig underneath it my question is what mountain or mountains are you facing this morning because we all have them in our lives from time to time something standing there and a problem a situation financial health-wise and it's standing in front of us and it's looking at us in the face and saying you're not gonna get past here and we look at in our human frailty and it looks like it may be right well I'm here to tell you this morning not only are we going to get past it not around it not a above it not under it not even just past it to where we look back and say there it is that's not what I'm looking at I don't want to just get past my problem I want it to be gone I want to speak like he said to the mountain and have it removed gone so that when I look around I can't find it anymore it's not there not just get over it or under around her or past it I want it gone because he said ye shall speak to the mountain these are removed and you're gonna have whatsoever you ask I don't know about you that's hard to come to comprehend but I believe it it ain't always easy it ain't always what it's cracked up to be sometimes because those mountains of cancer those mountains of health problems those mountains of finances those mountains of family problems those mountains of spiritual walks can get pretty high pretty big but they're not higher and they're not bigger than my God is and he said this too shall pass glory to God I'm not gonna preach I'm just talkin is it okay so we've got to learn to believe that we have the power over those mountains that God has placed within us the answer and the solutions to overcome those things remember the promise in every age was to him that overcometh not just get around it I just put it off and not just but overcome it amen so I'm talking with you this morning and I'm and I want to talk about these problems in these mountains that's in your life standing in your face pointing its finger at you and saying you're not gonna get around here it's discouraging you but I'm here to tell you this morning you can't overcome it you can rise above it you can speak to it and move it because in you is creative power as a believer to speak to that mountain I know a prophet one time that said you have the power to speak a world into existence and to go live on it you said in every believer is that power no the thing is I don't need to go live on I don't need to live in another world I live in this world but you have the same power the power that can speak a world into existence can speak a mountain out of existence and he's gonna do it for whoever you are no matter how young you are no matter how weak you may feel how insignificant you may feel I'm here to tell you this morning God is still God and he's still in the throne he's still able to speak through you and perform flat-out miracles every once in a while in my life I get the faith raised in my heart to believe for those things I'm praying it'll stay all the time but every once in a while I'll reach that plateau of faith in my life when I speak and I need God to do something and he comes on the scene he does it whether it's the weather or a situation or need my family's a brother a sister somewhere the church every once in a while I can get to that place that there's enough faith in my heart that I can speak with that confidence God I need you to do this I want this to happen Lord let it happen father in Jesus name because I want everything according to the will of God not in my will it's not what I can do it's what he can do and I've seen him come time after time when I get to those places and I've seen him do it I mean miracle after miracle I've watched him perform it and I have perfect confidence this morning that he is more than able to do what he said he would do you say you speak to it you say it's going to be gone you have goals you said you got to speak them and set them into existence let it be Lord this is what I want father I want this to happen your mind is a master computer if we really knew the truth about our minds we only use a small portion of them science will tell you there's so many things up here that never get touched in our life because we just don't realize what we've got setting up here I remember when computers first came out they would take up a city block or more remember that people giant things and they'd feed cards into them and information into him but you're mine now God has placed within you a master computer but it's like other computers out here all the way from the city block long to the little iPad little Lou iPhone to the human mind it can only your computer can only deal with the information that's been downloaded onto it whether it's an app or whether it's from Apple and they did it to begin with and they put all this what you put into it is what you get out of it hello and it's the same with your mind you download things into that on a daily basis sometimes sometimes on an hourly basis and what you put in is what you get out if you if you download a bunch of negative stuff in there you're going to get a bunch of negativity out hello this is not rocket science if you download positive things in there chances are you're going to get positive things out of there but it's what you put in and no deposit no return you've heard that before so you've got this master computer in your mind and let me let me just help you a little bit when you download things like I can't that's impossible for me to do it'll never work I've known people who have tried it and I've never seen anybody be able to do it so I know it ain't gonna work and you're downloading all the time you're saying those things because death and life are in the power of the tongue so a proverb says what you speak is what you get whoa that changes things so here you are your your downloading your computer can't impossible won't ain't can't work never work not for me and your computer goes and it shuts down it's just out so no matter what you're trying to get now you've told it it ain't gonna work but lord I need this to happen and this to happen but your computer says nothing here to work with but by the same token if you put the right things in I remember one time our house was on fire we came home with Church on a Wednesday night came in the house turned all the lights on went in the living room then all of a sudden we we smell smoke I loved it and it was coming up the stairs to the basement our basement had a fire in it that the firemen found out from the light switch he went down through the wall in a car basement fire and I didn't know whether we called the neighbor they called the fire department or we're new new to the place we don't need to live there a few months and and so we were rendered - so all I call I all I knew to do is pray fire is one of the worst things you can deal with because there's not a whole lot you can do with it unless you're a fireman and know what to do and they say wants you if you got a fire you don't want to open windows and doors well we painting because we had just bought a we didn't buck leave we bought a mixing board we had a concert in three days and we had all of our equipment in the bedroom so I told the kids get mom and dad get mom and again and Sharon and any I got a house and go get the equipment in the bedroom under the bed was a they start pulling equipment I'll drink hell and I go around I'm gonna they say don't if you got a fire don't over like keep the window in the basement I got the little hose I wait for the fire I don't hear the fire track and I know better to do that so finally I realized I said I this thing to work so I stood back there and I just simply said god I don't know how you're going to do it but you need to put this fire out within three minutes four minutes the fire department showed up but the fire was out before they got there you know what he did something that he can't do he caused one of the one of the seams in the pipe that had been what do they do when they what soldered and that's not supposed to give somehow the heat of that fire melted that solder and it broke the pipe in in the water spewed out and put the fire out he can do whatever he wants to do I don't know how you gonna do a little bit somehow you need to put this fire out he's come and said what you do what you do I prayed I I don't know what you shouldn't cook the window in and now you tell me God can do it but your master computer when you put the right things in there I can I will I am going to do this I want this to happen Lord and I want it to happen this way and scholars school people teachers tell us it's better if you write things down because it helps you remember better and it's got a stronger positive attitude so when you compute things into that computer I can I will it's going to work I know it's going to happen I believe it's going to happen that computer of yours wakes out it boots up brutal okey dokey and it goes to work to find ways to make it happen it does all of a sudden thoughts start coming to you I could have been standing in here forever you know what it never worked but the thought came to me speak the word and I did it it worked sometimes it's much to my amazement Lord going to a preacher revival one time I was driving in snow that was so treacherous we shouldn't man or beast shouldn't have been out there and it was gonna cancel the whole meeting just not even started yet and I said god caused the snow storm to stop in Jesus name I pulled off the road and I sent there a few minutes and it quit it had been predicted he was appearing in our it been predicted to come from how long what's going to bother Johnson's sometimes it surprises me sometimes I forget that I've asked and things happen and I I said wait a minute I asked for this and here it is because I dared to be different I dared to trust him I dared to believe him I dared to have confidence that God would hear my prayers and be able to do it because I spoke the word and it came to pass you say well you you you you can't do that that's impossible no one's ever done that before let me let me just say excuse me I'm not no one I'm not anyone I'm a child of God I'm a believer I'm Holy Ghost field I have the power in the name of Jesus I've got the power in the name of the Lord though Satan rages I forgot the words I will not be defeated I've got the power in the name of the law and we forget that because it's hard to remember that when the mountains standing here looking down on you I don't know the story like I should has been so long but it was one of the church age messengers that got woke up in the middle of night with a bad presence in his room and I remember as a young Christian I used to have times like that things were startled me and wake me and I'd have battles with Satan and somebody remember who it is I can't remember which messenger it was but he was startled he woke up and Satan was sitting down at the end of his bed and he looked at him you said oh it's just you he turned over and went back to sleep yeah it means that we've got the power over anything he wants to try can you believe it I can it will I do believe hmm it can only compute what you put into a church now when I look that word Mountain you should say to to the mountain when I looked at that word mountain in in in in the Greek one of the one of the definitions in the Greek was robinia ribbon is Rab bi n IE Rubini and it means to remove mountains and it's okay it's okay to go around it it's okay to go over it's okay to dig under it but I'd rather remove it I'd rather the thing be gone not not look back say ho you know I came through that and inspect it no I don't even want a part of my life I don't want part of my memory I want it gone so we speak to those mountains God has delivered you and even though you're a human being and you got problems Church troubles troubles but you're also the child of God and you have the power I'm here to tell you this morning you have the power as a little Creator to speak those things out of existence as a matter of fact one of the definitions Mountain one of them said to accomplish the most difficult stupendous incredible things we talked about speaking the mountain let me read it again to accomplish the most difficult stupendous incredible things because remember the promises to he that overcometh it's alright alright let me move along here now I'm what do you understand that you can do this you every one of you from the youngest to the oldest and the weakest of you that feel that way to the strongest of you the feeler you can do this God has placed within you the power why do you think he would say ye shall speak under the mountain be though what you think he said ye because he knew you could do it cuz in you and your DNA as a believer there is a power laying in you that needs to be spoken needs to be expressed so that it can work you have the power to do the most difficult suspended stupidest incredible I couldn't say that word ass for the kid in the car how do you pronounce to suspend this he says to spend to what yeah I don't even how to say it no see T I gots to pinned us I wrote s T u - s P and D spin - see us so I wouldn't mess it up Stu spend us that means incredible fantastic unbelievable I'm talking about you don't want me how about you you mean me yeah you you're stupendous you're incredible you're amazing you're filled with power that God has placed within your you have you have that all right because it's not us as him we need to anchor our mind to these thoughts this morning I want this to happen Lord I'd like to have this I'm praying and I'm believing Lord for this to take place and you're right and you watch through the year or years it's God brings these things to pass I've seen him do a church I know I know what he can do I know how he can do it because whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them hello and ye shall have them so you gotta believe because I got confidence God is gonna see you through no matter what the case may be I know he's gonna fix it for me because I've got confidence yeah God is gonna see you through no matter what the case may be I know he's gonna fix it for ye ah don't worry about my singing it's okey-dokey because I got confidence and I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to do that which I've committed unto him against that day ye shall receive that word receive means to hold on to to take possession of and to take upon oneself to possess it so when my Uncle Jim said butch cuz that's my nickname you know that they're butch what's your goals you just wiped me out but you know what I found out through the years I found out successful people our goal setters they make plans they dream up ideas they ask their employees and their think tanks and what do you think what do we want to be a year from now and they'll have meetings together with their leadership and they'll meet on a continuous basis through the year and they'll have these these sessions where they'll solve problems some of them deal with situations but they'll dream they'll have goals and they'll set their goals this is where we want to be one year from now this is where we want to be ten years from now this is where we want to be 20 years from now this is what I'm saying this is my vision and without a vision people perish you've got to have a vision so you can step into vision and step into the vision and step into the vision and see God do those things and when he does it gets exciting you get you get really excited and you get built up and it'll give you confidence that he is the same yesterday today and forever I think it's one of other berry coffees Suns at works works for the White House he doesn't work in the White House but he's got a he is in there a lot but they got a little building right beside the White House and they have a they have a think a think tank I guess is were they they have a group of guys get together and they're constantly problem-solving the things that are going on in the world situations and things and they're constantly in their everyday and and and and they're figuring out answers to problems and they're figuring out solution and they're figuring out ideas and what are we gonna do with this and how what about this list list and you know present that to the president on a daily basis or a weekly basis I don't know and they'll they'll present their ideas and their solutions and her thoughts but it's progressive you got to have something moving in your life to keep you vibrated and keep you alive and keep you moving and keep you motivated it keeps it going the same of the church without a vision it'll perish that's why I go to church as our family goes they go and sing at churches and some of these older churches all there is as old people and because they got no vision all the young people have left or growing up and and out there anymore they're not they're not coming in there because they're there's no dreaming there's no goals there's no future don't let that happen in your life in your family in your church dream think big remember that's the first book I ever read when I joined Amway mmm that dirty word called anyway well I didn't just join it once I joined it about four times through the years I think one time I didn't know it was that way and I joined kids but but anyways the first book I ever read was the magic of thinking big but you know what it opened my eyes horizon it opened my mind to think in ways I had never thought before and I applied some of those principles and then I read the Zig Ziglar book I'll see you at the top and I was sitting down here in the bottom saying you're gonna see me up there Zeke but I learned to dream I learned to believe I learned that if we don't plan for it if we don't dream for it if we don't set goals for it then there's a real good chance we'll never get it because if you got nothing planned then nothing comes from it unless Satan gets into the fix you've got to have direction you got to know where you want to be and what you want because there's too many outside voices it's not going to keep you going there's five things and I'm gonna mention these and then I'm gonna wind it down to close here very soon there's five little things in life that I've found that we need and this is just mean I was talking from my heart to you the number one thing I think we need is to have we teach the young people when they go to camp we have four years you need to feed your experience number one God has done something for you in your life and he's blessed you ities he's maybe you went to a camp and gave your heart to the Lord maybe God has given you the Holy Ghost maybe something but you've got to feed that experience you got to keep it fresh and keep it going read your Bible every day we've heard that before and pray we need to to do what God said let me give you a verse of scriptures you want to turn with me over to I think it's over in 1st Corinthians 11:3 at 16 and I'm gonna read from verse 15 first Corinthians 16 15 and I love this I love this scripture here but we got to have some kind of experience that we're working on or feeding first Corinthians 16 15 I beseech you brethren you know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of a kea and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints they have addicted themselves we always think of an addiction as a bad thing but here's a good addition they've addicted himself to the Ministry of the Saints and in verse 16 he goes on to say that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that believeth with us help us with us and labour us so we want you to do this he wants you to do this Paul said to addictive feed your experience we need to do that when we come to church we walk out the door we hear a Gospel message which is the the breath of God the life of God speaking to us we walk out the door we don't want to forget it we don't want to let it go talked about everything else in the weather and everything else we want to remember that and we want to feed on that want to dick tower selves to it because it's it's the Word of Life that we're talking about the second thing I think we need to do is we need to have the right attitude toward things because the wrong attitude breeds a negativity the right attitude brings positiveness in the message called the principles of divine healing the Prophet makes this statement he said the right mental attitude toward any divine promise we'll bring it to pass he goes on to say if you're a sinner confess your sin and believe and after a while you'll be a Christian why cuz you believe you see it ain't that simple yes it is because how many has never heard the statement you are what you eat if you eat junk food you become junk eat healthy you become healthy hey Jay right where you are what you think the computer as a man thinketh so is e hello so we are what we think as well so we want to think the right things we want to have the right attitude toward things because I'm talking about Jesus Christ is a high priest of our confession he is what we confess him to be in other words God is only as big as you will let him be come on now he is only as powerful as you were letting me because as a man thinketh in his heart so is he we know with us we can't do those things but with God all things are possible nothing can stop him and you need to know that that's who you're serving another another message called who is God it was preached right here over here in Cleveland he said god I love this quote God will make your body obey your confession oh do I love that quote I love it like you don't know how I love it when I found that quote I was sharing at one time and Billy Paul we were talking I was Billy Paul Branham he says he said I love that that's my favorite quote the other people told me that I said fine too now your God will make your body obey your confession and my confession is and I've said it for years I only weigh 175 pounds when I left Arkansas and moved back here to Ohio 15 18 years ago now I don't remember when I left there but the bill I weighed 300 plus pounds I weighed myself two days ago I weighed 226 pounds that's over 70 pounds I've lost in the last 15 years and you know why because I keep saying I only weigh 175 pounds I've lost over 30 pounds in the last four to five months you see look John that all you got to do brother can keep say I mean how you how you doing hey that's what you have to do the loss I had to have a lot of willpower I had to convince myself that those things probably don't taste good anyways although they're drooling with sugar hey he gets sick enough God will make your body obey your confession and I want to go on record here this morning again I want to go on record again I'm healed of prostate cancer totally completely healed of prostate cancer because he said with his stripes we were healed he said it in the Old Testament and Peter said in a New Testament by His stripes we were here said in the Old Testament I stripes you are healed New Testament by straights we were healed and I believe that though I've got symptoms though I have a doctor standing in telling me this is happening and this is happening and this is where you're at in your PSA is this and I'm healed I stand here confessing it with everything inside of me by the in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I'm healed a prostate cancer and I believe it with everything inside of me all these symptoms nothing but Lyon vanities and this too shall pass if you thought I look good at 300 pounds just wait I would when I graduated from high school I weighed 255 pounds 155 not 55 lord have mercy 155 pounds I went in the Air Force two years in the Air Force when I got to the Air Force I weighed 175 pounds two years after I got out of the Air Force I got I got married to sister Loretta I got I weighed 200 pounds when I got married so I'm going from 155 175 200 pounds after marriage I don't know what happened I do too I do too sister Loretta came from a family she had eight brothers and two sisters we're 11 children in the family and two adults when she cooked she cooked for all those people when we got married two of us she cooked for all those people my mother was very conservative she said cleaning up your plates I don't want any leftovers so I'm looking at the first meal sister Loretta fixed for us mac and cheese this bowl two of us to this day it's hard for me to eat mac and cheese we ate it for one week we had it for two weeks but that's my story and I'm sticking to it by His grace by His grace in a message called manifestation of the Spirit preached over here in Toledo he said he can do nothing until you confess it first so you're not gonna have any goals or any accomplishments until you speak it if you don't confess it then you're not gonna possess it my theory if you don't confess it good chances are you're not going to possess it you've got to speak the word learn to speak the word don't be afraid of speaking the word and if you want to get a little more confidence with it write it down write it down if it's weight loss stick it on the fridge door I weigh 175 pounds and all this good stuff in here probably don't taste good anyways I have to confess I get weak sometimes but then I remember sugar feeds cancer and that's in the equation too well I guess I can only have a little bit of sugar how bad do you want it how bad do you want your goals how bad you want your dreams learn to write them down learn to keep me going I'm gonna end here a real world quick you know you getting something out of this now you said if you confess me before men this is what he said now manifestation of the Spirit you confess me before men I'll confess you before my father what you say down here I have done for you that's what I say the father that I have done for you what you say down here in other words that I've done for you I'll say it to the Father up there if you say down here I'm saved he says up there he's saved I'm healed he's healed I'm delivered he's delivered I got big trick he's got victory I'm going to heaven he's going to him I'm in the breath he's in the ride what you say down here I'll say up there the power of the spoken word hey you got to keep it going Church number three thing I think we need to do is check our motive constantly well Branham said it in a message called power transformation 1965 he said always check your motive and objective and see if it's according to the Word of God if it isn't leave it alone your motive in your objective what have you have the right motive but your objectives wrong what if you got the right objective but it's not according to the word those things don't work check your motive check your objective and make sure it's in line with the word the fourth thing I want to mention that I think is a great thing to adapt to is learn to speak and use your authority you possess the power of the spoken word the prophet of God said we are living a thousand or thousands of mile below our privileges everybody thought about the brains never even hardly ever used most of it it's the same with our faith we live so far below our privileges because we don't exercise what God has given us come on now you know what's the truth Church ever-present water from the rock he said and Jeff he said you have the power to create a world and go live on it that's why I like to see our young people go to camps and stay around I taught my I taught my kids growing up I said you stay around positive people positive people will help you negative people will hurt you you got a neck of it attitude you it'll hurt you it hurts your friends it'll hurt your church can even destroy you and your friends and your church the last thing I want to mention here and this part of it is you need to be create your own atmosphere as they did an act to you in the upper room and that must fear for birth that's what we do here we're walking them indoors we create an atmosphere we do that with our song service we do that with our worship what are we creating an atmosphere so that when the word comes they'll be such an atmosphere here that births can come forth from it it's all about atmosphere when it comes to hatching a chicken out they said well you got to set a chicken under the hen if it's going to hand out no you don't you just got to have the right atmosphere the right light the right heat right sensitivity we walk through them doors back there our whole purpose our whole attitude are holding I ought to be creating an atmosphere so somebody can step into it and find a new birth find divine healing find deliverance fun victory find joy find happiness so that when you go out you don't go out the same way you came in hey man I hope you got something out of this today I hope you got something out of it today Church now I'm gonna give you about three keys before we end this I'm gonna give you about three what I call keys to our family our family la Fontaine's and these are things that that we adopted through the years three major keys that I think has helped our family stay together by the grace of God it's only him because we have our problems we're not perfect we're not a hundred percent where we should be all the time we have problems but we've learned to deal with them we've learned to sit down we learn to talk about them key number one to our family into what I think would be helpful key number one is that we had family devotions just about every night except for Wednesday nights when there was church then and a lot of times on Sunday when we had to services but five four to five nights for sure strong every week we would have family devotions would call them DeVos I remember going through the house many times saying time for DeVos time for DeVos I had to yell upstairs and downstairs and everybody knew the family knew when it comes time for devotions it was time to drop everything we're doing we usually did it about an hour before bedtime every night we'd come into the living room bring our Bibles and we sit down and we'd read a scripture now devotions to a lot of people mean different things I didn't put a tape on all the Prophet and let the kids fall asleep on the couch listening to it I didn't think that would be productive I didn't preach my Sunday sermon to him hoping that they'd get saved before I got to church we would read a scripture maybe a chapter every night and I'd have different people read I did I read mama read Paul reg here in red Isaac read Sheree couldn't read she wouldn't even ear in some of the early days but we would read the scripture and then we'd sit around and we'd talk about a little bit and then we'd take prayer requests who has a pervert quest tonight we've got something going to pray for and in each individual night different ones would pray or those requests and then many times we'd sit around and either talk about the scriptures that we read or or just talk sitting in a controlled atmosphere living room talking about things in life and what happened to stay in just our lives and I saw the Holy Spirit just settled our home down when we went off to bed there was peace in the house it was a wonderful thing that was the first thing we did I learned that from a quote that brother Branham said he was talking about chaos in the home and he said he made a statement he said are you ready are you ready to put the family altar back in your home buddy that hit me like a ton of bricks you know one of the hardest things to do is pray with your family don't you ever notice that before but especially if it's just you and Mom or you and one child or something but it's so productive it's so needed second key that I want to mention and I'm closing with these keys by the way I'll give you a few testimonies mean I'll close second thing that we adopted and I adopted this from a man who was my boss his name was mr. Taggart man he owned he owned the gas station a large gas station in Ann Arbor Taggart shell and every Monday night mr. Tager would have a gripe session for his employees at his house and all the employees would go to his house on Monday nights I learned this from him and one guy would stay at the station and keep the station running or two and on that in that grape session we were everyone would talk about what bothered them that week where things were where things went well what things didn't go well any suggestions we had or ideas we had how we can improve things and we get everything out talked about and it was worked for a good atmosphere and I thought you know what I'm gonna do that in my home so every Monday night in my home I adopted from mr. Taggart a great session that's what I called it Monday night gripe sessions what we did was we establish this rule though all through the week and weekend nobody could argue with anybody nobody could fight with anybody we had to save it for the grape session it did two things number one it brought it to a controlled atmosphere so there wasn't a bunch of nonsense going on number too many times I saw hearts touched lives turned around and confessions and apologies made but most of the time I saw this now what was it you were started to argue about I don't remember cuz it wasn't worth remember but mother had another rule she put with that she had the jar rule mother came from a home there was a little bit eight brothers different I don't want you feeling sorry for her because I had eight brother-in-law's I had to treat her right okay mother had a jar she set out in that house she said I don't want anybody arguing with anybody take it to the grape session if I hear it you got to put twenty-five cents in the jar I don't know how many times that jar filled up I don't know what happened to that jar my wife could be a rich woman right now and I wouldn't even know it but you know what Billie worked it was a wonderful thing and we'd I'd seen times we'd hug and fast I I'm sorry I didn't know that hurts you now the person that had the most things to say when we started that was Ike he was like four years old we started in a feel for time full-time in he's a doubt pal he hit me and I didn't and in cells all night it'll be all right now he's a fine young man got a wonderful family I tell you his kids are just unbelievable and they're unbelievable but it worked I'm not trying you have to do these things I'm not telling you that be good to have devotions but this worked for us I'm just telling you what worked for our family the third and last thing that I want to mention on this is we had every New Year's Eve ever January we had what I call dream night what we call dream night and we we still have it I learned this like I said from Amway all the leadership would get together and have a meal on New Year's Eve and they have dream night we'd set our goals for the year and for the month and so we did that where we set our goals and establish our goals long term short term spiritual goals natural goals physical goals financial goals whatever we wander right down everyone in the family from from the least to the to the oldest it started with Ike back then and then share he come along and she started in up to and we would write down our goals and put them on a piece of paper and put them away for the year we will go around the room a lot of times and say what's your goal and we'd read our goals from each other because we wanted each other know what we're praying about what our desire was the Bible said like I said in Proverbs 29:18 where there's no vision the people perish and I remember I brought first year I did this back home until Edel there for the church I brought little Stevie up Stevie's 12 years old now going on 21 and you know that is so I brought him up front of the church and I said Stevie I want you to take this imaginary gun he's a good hunter and I said now when I tell you to Stevie I want you to aim back here and I want you to hit the bullseye I said okay he said okay he's going along with me I said all right Stevie I said go ahead hit the bullseye knee raise that gun I said what are you doing he said you told me hit the bullseye I said but where's the bullseye he said I don't know I said how you gonna hit it if you don't know if you don't have a target you don't have anything to hit if you don't have a goal you don't have anywhere to go so it's important that you learn to set goals and that's my sermon for the day however I'd like to read a few goals that our family has had through the years I'll start with my daughter Sharon remember where she put four different things these are some of the goals that Sharon has had through the years one of the first ones I remember she remembers well was when she was 12 years old we were writing out our goals that night food for dream night and one of her goals that she put down she was she was seven years old I'm sorry she was seven years old she wrote this down I want a little redheaded sister I immediately rebuked her said that's not a goal that's just wishful thinking but she kept it on paper when she was 12 on October the 25th 1979 Cheri was born a little redheaded caboose these are some of her other dreams and let me just say this on the onset so I don't have to say it every time all of these things have been met by our family for our family she had a desire to record a solo album she wrote it at age 12 she recorded it at age 14 a solo album by Carrie Sharon she wanted to start a newspaper for young people call it youthquake news it happened but you wanted to start some Sunday school programs for the church see now it does kids days and whatever else she want to have a baby get to on ever own music studio even wrote down what you want to call it fountain Music Academy it came to pass wanna have a grand piano I remember seeing at least two or three in her house before at one time and the new mission work twice now they've been to the phillipines once they've been doing some Bob way in a new and Wilma I remember Paul's Paul's for a long time said I my dream is to go to Arizona for the special meeting sometime and I remember Paulie did I didn't have two dimes to rub together to give him I wanted him to school so bad but I said Paul you just got to pray you got to believe you got to pray you got to believe and so they the day come for the meetings to start there was no way for him to go he just looked at me and said well dad he said I guess God doesn't want me to go I said I don't know you just keep praying that was a dream goal that day when he went to school I went to the mailbox in the mailbox I can't remember the exact funds but I believe it was a thousand dollar check from a minister I didn't even know who wrote and said brother John I felt led to send this to you people love your ministry all over and we appreciate you and I always try to pay some extra ties the end of the year this is an offering for you I went to the bank I cashed the check I went to the triple-a I got the ticket he came home that night I said come here Paul and I handed in a ticket for his flight to Arizona he missed the first service that night the next day he flew out to the meeting because he dreamed it was a desire of his heart whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them these are some other things Paul said he had a desire to be singing a group a desire to buy a car as first car he bought was a Volvo hmm you ought to read the Bible all the way through he doesn't anyone to listen to every message and sermon that was available in I think he's done that Isaac on the other hand he was a real dreamer he wanted to travel and play with a group he's done that on different occasions with our family with a group called the tackett's he's even he's even gotten as far as playing the grand piano on the Grand Ole Opry stage for a group while they were singing said oh he said I mind his ire dad he wrote it down he said I want to record an album project and I want to I want to play all the instruments on it and record it you know what cost for studios recording Oh another thing he said I'd like to have a studio in my god he did and he recorded and he played all the instruments and it was good it was it wasn't just okey-dokey it was good all right back then now back then now though I'm going way back when he was young you wanted to gain weight I think it's always trying to be different than the rest of the world well all the world wants to lose weight he want to get now he wants to lose it he gained it and now he wants to lose it when sherry came along these are some of her goals and let me say they've all came to pass maybe except that tall dark handsome guy with she said I want to travel and sing with the group she went with the Arnolds on the road four years in a row saying with all the major groups that are in gospel music just about every one of them she wrote down one year she wanted to go to Paris she went she said I want to sing on stage at a Bill Gaither Homecoming not asking much this little kid of mine redheaded caboose so we pack up as a family we go all the way to Tulsa Oklahoma as the Arnold's the group she was singing with it's on stage for the homecoming that night singing on a Bill Gaither stage I got pictures of her ever give her this year of her with with all the leading people sitting around singing on the stage and she came down off the stage and she I said well what's next sherry she said I want to be on a homecoming video so before that concert was over that night Bill Gaither had come to the Arnold's and said I want you guys on the next taping so they went to the next tape and they sang on it and she was on she's on to other videos not singing but she's in the audience I'm to other videos and singing with the homecoming artists that ain't nothing to us you know people that don't sing I'm a crooner but it was everything to that little girl when she wrote those dreams down those goals down and God answer done you don't think that gave her confidence she said I'd like to have my own apartment she wrote these things down I'd like to buy my own car I'd like to do a solo project Jeff Easter produced it for her I'd like to do a Christmas CD she's got a wonderful Christmas CD out and the burger produced her second CD that was out and then Henry came into our family oh Henry first time he ever came to a dream night with our family when chairman Sheeran got married first time he wrote down these things I would like to record some of my songs that I've written that year the CD the tape influenced the first influenced album came out that year with just the kids on it this real one of the dreams he's had through the years is I want to have a house in the country he's got a beautiful house in the country now I don't have any car payments if you know Henry he'll drive a rattletrap put baling wire on it and do everything you can but you don't know car payments you don't have enough house payments he said I want to be debt-free he went to the bank here a while to go to get see how his credit was cuz him and his daughter and his wife are gonna start buying and flipping homes that's 30 days higher now stop working for everybody else and work for themselves so he goes to the bank he's not had credit and empty number of years he's never got anything no credit established so he goes to the bank and finds out he's got a better credit rating than I do then Paul does in all of us go figure the last thing he said on his list that I knew of anyways I don't know what he wrote last year and here before said I'd like to have a tailor guitar I guess that's a real nice guitar tailor mom well he's had two of them my first one he had for years 15 years broke and now they told him said we'll we'll replace it we'll replace it free we'll give it or if you want to upgrade we'll give you an upgrade and you just pay the difference well he wanted an upgrade when the dust settled they fixed it said take it back doesn't work it didn't work so they come back and he said I want this upgrade well before he got to the store to buy the upgrade and pay the difference somebody anonymous had slipped a check to Sharon and said whatever the upgrade cost here's the check pay for it then Sharon and Vanessa bought a little attachment you put on it that amplifies it so it's got no cords to it and he's good I wanted to go full-time in the ministry I wrote that down the years we traveled all over the country I'm telling you as your friend it pays the dream and it pays to dream big let me ask you this question before we close suppose money was no object in your life money's no object what would you like to have you see my brother John money it no no no no my father owns a cattle on the Thousand Hills and the taters in it if money was no object what would you like to have what are some of your goals where would you like to be a year from now physically spiritually financially health-wise what I'd like to do right now is I want to change the order of this service I want to end it but before I do I've asked the brothers back there to hand some paper don't blank paper you can do that now brothers and like every one of you to take a sheet of paper before you go will that prayer before we do this and I'd like you to take the time just for a few moments write down what your goals our desires are god-willing for this year or for five years or for ten years short term long term what would you like to see God do for you in the future let's stand for a minute god bless Yahoo I hope this helps I don't know is it blessing let's pray Heavenly Father we want to thank you for your love and your grace and your mercy thank you for the opportunity to be here this morning Lord - I know

cause of the girl and just bless them and take them to higher heights deeper depths bless these people now Lord as they write their goals out father I pray your blessing be with him father in Jesus

go I understand take the time and write down what some of your goals are for the year maybe for the future what would you like to see happen then when you're done that you can read them to your family if you want to later when you get home it's a good thing to do sit down with one another and say what what are your goals these are mine that way you can pray for one another and do that kind of work for each other do you have it that way while you do that I'm going to have these guys just play softly if song leader can tell me if he wants to and get ready but as far as my parts concerned I'll just let brother bill dismiss you are you coming up by the bill okay brother okay come on brother missed him and just just take the time don't don't overpower them with songs right now just something
