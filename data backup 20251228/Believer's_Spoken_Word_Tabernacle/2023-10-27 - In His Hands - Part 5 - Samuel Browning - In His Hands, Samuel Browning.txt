the hospital um right at the end of last week and then at the first part of the week uh they were transporting her over to Cleveland Clinic for bypass surgery and that's Olivia sister d schaer's daughter and so we want to just continue to remember them in prayer as well I know there's many other needs I know there were many that were read and there's many unspoken requests among us tonight

and in the time of uh of loss there with brother Billy Paul and uh ALS also uh the the rean and the Parker family that the Lord would just just continue to give them strength and comfort in this time and um you know we we certainly are thankful that we have an opportunity because we know at times when we're praying for others there's times where we're standing in the need of prayer and you know I I'm just thankful that we can just as a body we just want to hold one another up in prayer amen so let's just go to the Lord as we prepare to turn to the word tonight and we just want to take these requests and also that the Lord just being mindful of our needs tonight that he'd just come by our way and speak to us Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you Lord oh God that we can come Lord before your throne of grace and mercy Lord there's requests and there are petitions upon our hearts Lord but we want to say thank you than you that you've made a way Lord Lord there's an assurance in our heart that Lord you've said if two or three can agree as touching any one thing it shall be done and Lord that when we would go Lord and come together in that all sufficient name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and bring these petitions Lord for different ones that Lord are in need Lord of a touch in their body Lord and strength Lord different ones Lord in need Lord of situations with the job

love you and we thank you tonight Lord and we just give ourselves to you father in all things may you be glorified in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen if you would appreciate the song service there if you would turn with me to job 23 and uh verse 8 I want to say just um been able to listen to a good pretty good portion of the service here on Sunday and might want to service you know I I tell you you know there things that I to me it's such a blessing uh a lot of times you can't explain everything that God is doing but you know it's such a it's a blessing because I I certainly believe that as a body of Believers we are benefited uh being able to have that CU I believe in a full work of the full five full ministry it's essential to our lives and uh it's all God but we we need we need God moving through different Avenues different channels God has every gift is so unique and that's what's so wonderful and God knows what just you know God knows just what we have need of you know because when you think of it uh I know for myself even if I'm here I don't I don't speak to a minister I because I don't want that done to me if I go somewhere else I I don't want to go if I if I think that a minister is going to talk to me I'll wait and I'll walk in when the song service is going I even though I'm the preacher there might make them a little nervous but I wait I I just don't I Want to Be Free when I preach the word of God and uh it's a little different here we you know us you know as a pastor well there's sometimes there's things that I know but you still got to wait on God but when God just brings other vessels into and and you know God is speaking right down our alley how precious that is isn't it it's God and and it's his love for you and I and it just it that's why that it's it's so necessary just uh uh God just moving even through that channel of a fivefold Ministry and so we thankful to the Lord for that I know you believe that but I just I just want to say if anything more just thanks be to God that we are able to have that in verse 8 of job 23 job said behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold and my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the command of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to read just one more scripture here before I begin to look there in that verse in job this is out of Isaiah 53:1 and it says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand think of Isaiah caught up and seeing this hundreds of years beforehand but knowing what was required and that would be life it would require for our life it would require his life and we recognize that it was God that came down and God himself created the Tabernacle God shed the blood that was shed for you and I the pace the The Ransom was paid for us and to be able to recognize that to see that the very desire that God had for our life that that the very pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands and there's no there's no greater place that we could be as a Believer than in the hands of God there's no place that we would rather be we want to be in God's hands and we know that in the hands of God God is molding us he's shaping us he's working even now in our lives and I want to just say that as we've looked here in the previous two services and we were just looking at that of the word of where that job said I know he's working on the left hand but I cannot Behold Him job being a prophet he had received uh Visions from God inspiration from God but as far as what was taking place job was not receiving any inspiration there was no vision there was nothing there was nothing at all and that was what was troubling job because job was looking for an answer but yet I I think what what's so important as we were closing out last week and looking at decision of how that God himself a prophet cannot pull things out of God brother BR said a prophet cannot do that a prophet cannot make God reveal but a prophet is an instrument that is used by God that's set aside and ordained and gifted where God can move down at that time and God will make himself known his will his vision his word in that hour and it's for a purpose it's not to highlight the man that message is given for a people of God will everybody want to hear it no but there is an elect people that will are ordained to hear that word and that word will find its Mark in their life now I'll just say it in this way there's a lot of things that and when we speak it in that way it would seem as though that every little thing is just exactly perfect or in far as when someone hears it why immediately at that moment their lives will turn but sometimes a life it will take God working on that life for a period of time to break down their will but needless to say every seed of God will come into position by the Holy Ghost there will not be one that will miss it and it doesn't matter how far that a person can run the prodical son went far away but he never got away from what God already fora of him there's a lot of things that can be entangled and you know and things within life but you know God knows exactly what is there and he knows every situation God knows how to work and to bring everything around so I I just I I rest in that reality of how that within this that God himself in the times that where we can't see him but it doesn't mean because we can't see him at that moment that he's not working just because we haven't heard from him or he hasn't made known to us this this is what's going on it doesn't mean that it's not working and I know these can be sometimes very simple or very if if I can say it in this way a very Elementary uh way of saying that but yet these are things that even in our walk with God that we need to be reminded of because the biggest part of our life of our growth is not something that is visible or we're seeing you know uh manifestations here and manifestations there but so much of our growth is what is done in the secret presence of almighty God as a matter of fact that's why when when we look at the opening of the word and the ministry of the third pool which is Christ coming in to a body of Believers tabernacling in his children that the Bible would always the the angel of the Lord would always point to Matthew 6 and speak of that which is done in secret shall be revealed openly that you know don't let the left hand know what the right hand is doing but it's a secret work that is taking place and let me just say it like this this is something that even in the midst of a service where God is expressing secrets to his children God is speaking lip to ear there are things that we could walk out of the service tonight no doubt we will there are ways that God would have spoke to you tonight that may be somebody else that God has touched them in a very certain way something was said to answer a need in their life or a question and you you stand there in amazement and awe but how that God God is able among a group of people to speak to every single need and minister to our lives so personally I'll tell you that's a God who cares that's a God who is a living God that's a god that is not just one who is confined within the walls of a building but he hears our prayer as a matter of fact he sees and he knows all about us he knows everything that you and I have need of and what's on our hearts and so when we think of this that it's God he is still still working and it's him that is moving even in these times and hours and sometimes there's things you know that when we look at this in verse 9 I'd like to just jump into it it says on the left hand of job 23 where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him you know if God let us know everything that he was doing when he was doing it it would not require faith it would not require us to trust but God works things out in his time and in his season and it's for a purpose and there's things that God will let us know and there's other things that God doesn't let us know like we said last week with with the prophets where God why would why would God allow you know brother Ram takes that with Jacob to stand there and he said to be dis do you know to be deceived and that's the words the prophet used to be told that your son has been overtaken by wild animals why would God allow that why if he's a prophet why would God permit that and you know I think we touched on that some time ago if Joseph if Jacob would have known where Joseph was at he would have went down there but it would have messed up the whole program of God but God God was working all the time and though when you know through every situation from Isaac even when Isaac was blind and we know the blessing Came Upon Jacob rather than Esau it was God who was working the whole time and so what's important as we were concluding in that the last time is like what job said at the end of this of our text tonight that job was standing right where God had revealed for him to stand there was decisions that he had to make in that moment would he listen to his friends would he listen to others around him or was he going to stand upon what God God had already revealed to him because that word he was able to examine his life and know where he was standing so here we find in the Scripture it says where he doth work and I want you to notice this word work here it means to do to Fashion to accomplish to make to bring about or produce it's this is the same word that the second time it's used in the scriptures this same word that is used it is in Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was swn and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good you know the Bible tells us in the book of Isaiah that he hath wrought his Works already in us that everything as we said with the apple and with the leaf everything that is in there to be released God has packed it already in the seed it is there it's not something that's coming from out of here in but it's what God is releasing what is already laying within that seed because that is the word so the word that you and I are receiving we are hearing it is the word that's giving Authority it's the same life of God that's giving authority to that inner man to come forth it's giving Authority for that word to come to pass it's there there is something very special that is taking place between the believer and God so this word to work where he does work but I cannot Behold Him that word work is the same word that's used in verse 11 in verse 12 on the tree yielding fruit now in our lives there are seasons just like right now we are preparing to pass into we're passing into the fall season some of the days that we have right now well you know they told us to prepare for it from the week previously you know get ready for some cold temperatures and we did have some cold times but then after these next few days it's going to get really cold possibly they look at that midweek next week snow on Wednesday some of the first flurries but you know there's Seasons that come even in our lives as Believers I'm sure that every one of us would love just to live in springtime we'd love to live maybe in summertime but there's all seasons itself are all necessary parts of our life and when you even look at fruit itself in order for fruit to be produced you know it it takes one thing that that we we know you know even from elementary school where there the flowers themselves have to be pollinated and in order for those flowers to be pollinated sometimes it takes some strong winds to blow that pollen right then there's other times it takes living creatures it takes that of you know of of bees moving and so forth and getting in there to the pollen and they transport it back and forth and it's God's provided way of how that all of that would you know come out and the flowers that are so breathtaking to us and we think my goodness how beautiful is that apple tree and the blooding the blossoming and and things but yet reality of that flower itself is there to serve a purpose that then once the germination has taking place then it'll you know it closes up and down there on on the bottom where there's been a germinating take place a fruit begins to form which the fruit itself is something that we would go and we pay money for but that fruit is only there that houses around the seed the seed's what's the most important part but the fruit itself it it comes around that and we know that even when you look at fruit trees and things like that I I've never raised any any fruit trees myself but you know here sometimes when I would talk with different ones and read upon this at times from studying on it that you know even with fruit trees there comes a time that's so necessary of cold temperatures there's a certainty even with the different variet ities of fruit trees there's a need at times for what what was looked at like a little bit of a coldness that would come about that would begin to set the process because fruit itself starts even in the process or the fruit producing stage in times when it's dormant and times when it's cold and it's necessary it's not a place that I'd say if the fruit tree could speak about it it's not something it would want to go through not one of us want to go through times of coldness now I'm not talking about where we are neglectful or we you know and we get cold on God but sometimes what I'm talking about is where there's times in our life to where it just seems like that you know you don't feel the presence of God like you'd like to feel it now you've got a choice during that time you can either manufacture it you can either be down about it or you can go ahead and praise him because he's worthy to be praised because just because you don't feel him does not mean he's not right there job said I know he's here I have went forward can't find it I've went backward but I know he's right here how do you know that job because he has revealed himself to me and he knows the way that I take he did not open the way and turn around and leave me as an orphan to find my own way but the same God who found me and delivered his word to my heart is the same God who promised he'd never leave me nor forsake me he'd lead me the rest of the way home so even in the times of coldness I'm going to worship God that doesn't mean I got to manufacture anything when Paul and Silas were in prison it was not a time that they felt like worshiping let me tell you the surroundings itself let alone what was on their body maybe the clothes sticking and the blood dried up it was not a favorable moment and a time but he is still even in the times of cold times oh friends you say well I'm going to wait till the warm time but you need the cold times you need the times in your life where the presence of God you may not feel it but he's still right here he's still working even when you don't feel it it's important Even in our walk with God that as we we learn that and listen friends there's nobody I don't think there's anybody more than myself and I probably to every other believer I love to feel the presence of God I love when the presence of God comes sweeping down but let me just tell you something I am going to stand right here if I did not feel his presence I would stand right here and deliver the word that he's placed on my heart if I don't feel his presence when I'm praying I'm still going to say Lord you're worthy Lord you're worthy that I would ask you for leadership this day you may not answer me this moment but I want you to know I need you I need you every step of the way there's decisions I don't even know about that is facing me but I want you to know Lord I'm asking you to guide me and when those decisions come up today may you be the source of influence of my life just help me to be sensitive in the times of of coldness [Applause] Lord oh my I think about it you know because you know when we look at in our life brother Brandon would say like this and getting in the spirit he said you know he talking to the Pentecostal church he said we get into such a place he said that we are are living in Mountaintop experiences he said but your fruit will freeze in Mountaintop experiences is that right now there are fruits now listen now there are fruits that will grow in the mountain but only at certain elevations we're talking about Mountaintop experiences I love Mountaintop experiences I believe we need Mountaintop experiences God gives us Mountaintop experiences but God never intended for our Christian walk to be from one mountain top to another Mountain Top to another Mountain Top to another mountain top so when you go from a Mountaintop experience maybe there has been just a tremendous set of meetings a tremendous service something that God has done or is doing in your life and then you look at and say where can I find the next Mountaintop listen the only where that fruit itself will actually grow and come about is in the valley but God didn't give you those Mountaintop experiences Just For Nothing God gives you those Mountaintop experiences for you to draw from when you come into those moments in the valley so they're not just for not and you know what the thing about it is that's wonderful with the Lord Brother B tells us about that with the Mountaintop experiences that you know that that people get into a place well if I don't shout I don't run I don't do this then somehow they feel like that something's not had but let me tell you as a Believer my victory is not based upon whether I run every service or I shout every service but my victory is where my soul is in Jesus Christ if I can rest right there there might be times that for running shout we're not against any of that but neither is it something that we have to have when we come to church because if it is it'll become a manufactured event is that all right we're not asked to manufacture fruit we're asked to Bear it oh glory be to God so here's another thing with fruit and and you know the producing of fruit that you know sometimes when there comes that that element of pruning that you know sometimes in backyard situations you know maybe individuals that are not really versed in it that you know would have the Orchards and things like that and how they go through them and you know when you look at it there is sometimes where they can do even an over pruning of a tree and when you go to overp prune a tree the tree itself will actually try to recover the actual bark and everything in the tree it'll start to grow even more profusely branches it starts to grow out even more of wood rather than fruit wood or wood in which fruit itself can come forth so it takes just the right amount and right balance in pruning to know what to prune off just how much to prune off I'm glad that God's in control of that I'm glad that God didn't leave that to me that I can come down to your life or you to mine I'm glad because we'd probably butcher one another up but I'm grateful for the grace of God that God knows exactly where to make that cut at you know because real pruning of a tree is not going out and getting your hedge clippers and just just blistering the whole thing and just you know chopping it all the way down or giving your nice tree where it looks like a beetle haircut but that is not how that trees and fruit trees are trimmed there is an AR to it there is a course to all of the trimming it's not just random and let me say it like this in our lives the way God deals with our life the test and trials are not random God's not handing you know just throwing out a bunch of tests and trials like somebody busted a pinata and and you know and Candy goes everywhere you get what this no every test and trial is ex exactly fitted for our lives now watch this when we look at this in John 15:1 the Lord Jesus spoke of this and he said I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman so he's the caretaker our heavenly father is the caretaker every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every Branch I want you to notice this every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it so being purged is not punishment to be purged means you're bearing fruit am why does he Purge it that it may bring forth more fruit you see sometimes the thought process that when we look at fruit more and more and more we look at things just being added to and added to and added to and added to but yet the reality of more fruit coming forth God knows exactly how to get the fruit in Us and how that it would increase in our life he knows exactly what to prune off and to purge in our lives now notice in verse three now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you now truly a lot of the purging or the purging that even takes place in our life where the spirit of God will begin to work you know work with a life work with a heart begin to purge and the spirit of God coming to our hearts as we will receive the word the word will actually bring a purging in our lives you believe that it'll actually Purge out habits it'll Purge out desires it'll Purge out things now it won't overrule our will but if we'll receive that word the word itself has within it the cleansing power to be able to move through our lives and separate and absolutely cut away every habit everything that's unlike God that we might be fruit bearing Believers and I don't know about you but friends I I want the word to continue to to examine my life I want the spirit of God to continue to move through my life right now that's the privilege I have you have as a believer that the spirit of God would continue to move Upon Our Lives that our lives would continually be purged in his presence free from anything that would hinder his working am glory to God now I want you to notice this that every branch that bears fruit he purgeth it this word purgeth it it means to cleanse of filth of impurity from useless shoots to prune from guilt to expiate so purging itself it's working on on branches now remember he said I'm the vine ye are the branch right and when you consider it I want you just to listen to a few of these things when you look at with the pruning and purging because pruning and purging it's really it's really the same thing of what we're looking at here tonight now these are things remember on the left hand he doth work this time of pruning and purging is not the times that we are maybe seeing you know if I can say it in this way that would necessarily be the real shouting times yet for a Believer there's joy in our heart in the midst of Trials I don't know what's going on I don't know how everything's going I don't know everything that's working out right now but I know in whom I have believed you say what is that that's called faith and faith is what Masters every circumstance to master the circumstance does not mean you need to know how it's not about that it's just you trust God and you know that the Lord is working he's got everything under control I placed everything into his hands and I'm looking to him now notice in order for this I want you to think about this even when you look at some of the trees let me just give you a little bit of stats here when you look at certain trees and how that there is certain ways that you cut them there's certain angles you'll make on that tree when you cut that tree certain times of the years even certain things when you will cut that tree if you don't cut it just in the right angle then you got to put some sealant around where you cut that or else that wound itself you know can actually affect that tree I'm glad that God knows the right angle to take with you or I he might bring in a man he might use this gift he might use the pasture whatever it is but God knows the right angle to minister to our lives he knows the trial that's needed and and the right perspective in order to get that cut if it was you and I sometimes the ways think about it in our own lives of how that God has dealt with us and the things that he has brought forth of our life we would have never paired together that test or trial we would have never paired together maybe that sermon or that text but how that God came in such a way and he made such a precise cut in our life because he's interested in us bearing more fruit Peach and nectarine trees boy I like that them don't you I like them with crust on them peaches Peach and nectarines think about this after a growing season you got to remove 50% of last year's growth wow you might seem like 50% of the growth of the growth that's come about this is why when you look around you know we've been privileged around here to have Orchards all around us you can pretty much drive down Route too and you'll see burnhams you know there used to be uh the different or was over there with that big car place took it now and there's Millers out there you know uh in South Amherst and places around you look at every one of them apple trees you don't find trees that are ginormous right they're low you don't find you when you're looking at those trees you not only are you seeing the roads from where they planted them but if you've ever walked out there and picked apples you know you can walk right down through there you're not ducking underneath branches and you're you're looking at things if you ever stop and look at it you're looking at things that have been so meticulously cut and crafted in such a way because there is someone or a group of individuals there that actually are tasked with caring for those trees now when we go out there to buy the apples I don't go out there to look them guys up I don't say hey who are the guys that was out here pruning these trees out here who's the guys that was doing this here I want to thank them because there is some good apples for some good apple Cris I want to know where those guys are at no you and I don't think about that whatsoever when we go to the store and buy the buy the apples that have an inch of wax on them that even deers won't eat you know we go to do those things we do not think about all the pruning and all the labor that went into it we don't think about that all we're doing is enjoying the fruit but do you realize that the fruit is only one season but there has been multiple Seasons there has been things that has taken place there has been pruning where men have studied that tree that know that tree know that even that type or that variety and know exactly how to cut it that's no different between you and I because God said I know my sheep and I know them by name I know exactly how they're made up I know exactly the certain things that work out in their life and I know how to bring more of myself out of their life my think about this the Fig Tree the Apple the pear the plum the apricot they remove about 20% of last year's growth so sometimes we look at adding to as though that it would why would you be taken away why would you be taking away 50% of the growth on peach trees and nectarines why would you take away growth when we've just had a Fruit Harvest the scriptures tell us that you bear fruit he purges the branches that bear fruit in order that they may bring forth more I want you to think of this in this term some of the things that they would look at with pruning trees is to control the size like we said when you you go down the road and you look at them they're not real high up but they're you know they're they're aware that it can be reached with a ladder and you know the re they'll even they'll actually prune them in such a way so that it'll keep them in a place where it can be reached a place to where that you know that the size of it does not get Beyond itself for it able to keep up because they could let it go and just let branches go everywhere you could have a lot of fruit but the fruit would never come into the development that you would be used to you'd go out there and go to pick yourself some Granny Smiths and you'd say what are these green knots on the tree why it's because things was left unattended it knows they control the height of the tree God knows how to control the height in our life the height I'm talking about is to where that we don't get too big for ourselves God knows how to keep us in a place to where we're in humility where we're in for the presence of God because when it is in humility then God can move and work in our life this is why even with test trials coming our way the best of our ability to work and to say Lord I want to stay humble before you and we pray and we're looking to the Lord but yet God knows there are elements about our life that we need divine intervention like Paul had where Paul said lest I should become exalted there was given to me a messenger of Satan to bust at me lest I would become exalted God knows how to keep us down not beat down but keep us in a place to where we're looking up to him he knows how to control the size about our life I'm glad about that aren't you cuz sometimes maybe I would think that I'm not getting too big and God said hey you're getting so big right now there's not a fire trick fir truck ladder that can rink up to you I need to get you back down here where I can get on a step stool because that's the only place that I can really work with with your life oh my you know there's also that part where even that the growth the growth needs to be stimulated this is another benefit of pruning and purging to where that growth would need to be stimulated in in that of that fruit tree that it would grow what they would call fruit wood or branches or wood or more choots that would actually be valuable in the production of fruit but you know there's also you could leave that tree and let it be neglected and if you leave that tree and let it be neglected them branches will grow across one another this one coming across to block the light out from this one it'll become so intertwined now there's guys that actually want to argue about this and say you know hey you don't need to trim it back just let them grow but you know there's been different times for places that I talked to individuals over the years cuz you know I I like apples and you would talk to them and they and some of the things that they would tell you sometimes individuals that's bought houses and they themselves had an apple tree their beautiful apple tree and we actually trying to work on that apple tree to get it back into a place to where it would actually be fruit bearing and they've studied it out looked at it how you should make the cuts but sometimes when things have been so neglected and just let go where it's not been cared for it gets to a place to where when it's been that way it just starts to produce a lot of dead wood I'm glad friends that God just don't neglect us I'm glad that God don't neglect our lives I'm glad that God knows exactly what you and I have need of you say what do you mean by that I'm glad that God doesn't ask me L Samuel would you like a trial would you like a test I'm glad why because I tell him no because there is my flesh does not want test or trials yours doesn't either but God knows what we have need of and God looks at our life and says I'm not going to neglect your life I am going to work and bring out of your life exactly what I see in your life I'm glad he doesn't neglect us oh my you know and it all depends on one of the things that they'll talk about is the goals the goal that someone has with that tree what's the goal of it you know God has a goal with his tree his bride tree with with your life my life God's got a goal and that goal is that we would bear much fruit is that right God's Not Just satisfied where you and I could look back and say I take what one year oh my there was a bunker crop that came off by the grace of God I'll tell you about 15 years ago there was such a crop came off we had such an Apple Festival God don't want us living in the history God wants he's the I am he's the everpresent God and whatever that he did before he'll still do the same today and what matters is listen friends though time increases though their age and everything else but God never changes and God will allow circumstances and situations in our life to arise in order to prune and to purge our life because he's got a goal God is working on our character in our life I want you to think of this right here think of the scripture whosoever beareth fruit that Branch he purgeth it that it may bear more fruit read the end of job when you read the end of job God gave him double right of all that he had previously brother B tells us God was purging job for the purpose to bless him so purging is not something of punishment it's actually in order to bless us that God himself might be able to become more preeminent that his grace and that his reflection of his life might shine forth through more in our lives now he didn't give him any more children the prophet tells us He restored job the seven children he lost how did he restore them they did not come back upon the Earth but brother Ram tells us they were waiting in glory for him God revealed to job the sacrifice and what you offered up it has been sufficient and they're waiting on you over there job so job didn't lose anything if anything at all from this right here of this purging he's actually gaining amen oh my you see God will do that to bring us a little closer to him listen friends we can all just let our hair down tonight those of us that got it it's a figure of speech but it's true sometimes when things are comfortable about us we're not as diligent as we should be things are a little bit easy it's not maybe as diligent as we need to be but God knows exactly how to bring things around in such a way I I think of that listen to me what would that that mean think of the love of God when you or I do not even deserve for God to come round our way and for something to come around that will actually drive us onto our needs even in a greater Earnest than what we've been you know what that is that's the love and grace of almighty God absolutely nothing that you and I can take credit for but through that moment God is actually purging yes amen he's purging Our Lives what's he doing he's controlling our size prise God he's keeping us into a place I want you to think of it that even when you have trees I've looked at it when it comes to even the vines and the grape Vines and things like that sometimes you've got to provide the direction that they need to grow yeah you know you've done this for your tomato plants at times sometimes you just can't leave them just flop over you actually got to put the steaks and you twine it around you go out there and look at it put a bigger steak around it what are you doing you're providing direction for it and God himself knows exactly and he does provide direction for our growth this is why God has he'll Place himself he'll plac his word before us God will deal with our lives he'll deal with things so personally not just through the preaching of the word yet he does that but God has such a way that so personally that when we are in the midst of a purging time of a test or a trial where there isn't well we could say fireworks going on we're not seeing the right hand I cannot behold God God is not allowing me he's not telling me what he's doing but there's things that God is doing that it's actually bringing out and causing me to die more to myself why that more fruit could be born you know there's absolutely situations sometimes that we would absolutely every one of us would have avoided situations we could go back and say oh man you know we could try to retrace your steps and everything else but here's the result of it God knows every single moment what matters is what has come out of it in your life what have you what how have you given your life to the Lord God wants he wants the Harvest itself to truly be ma maximized in our life the other reason you ever seen when you go down the road and you see the trees I I remember always looked at this when I was on my way to work and I pass by there's a section uh there on route two right before right after you come across that big bridge in here and I'd always look at that section right there and you'd see them trees and I'd watch the guys get out there with the track tractor with the bucket on it and I'd see them out there and sometimes I can't help it when I'd ride by I'd look at and think them the ugliest looking things and yet I know them are apple trees you look at them and you think sometimes why are they taking out the branches and I mean it's like right here in the middle you know if you brought a hydran bush or you bought a rose bush or you brought something else and it was wide open in the middle you'd be having your honey Tak get back to the flower nursery with the receipt and saying I want something that's more full but you see the inside part of that tree is what has to be kept open in order to allow light to get down in it and these things where the branches are growing say it don't look pretty it don't look pretty when you're looking at it but there is a reason for all of the pruning that's going on that's how that God works in our life to make to ensure that the light itself would continue to pick penetrate down into the depths of our life that everything stays you know cuz sometimes there's things that can get in the middle of our life there's things that can become the focus of our life that's not the right Focus there's things that all of a sudden certain fruits can start coming out and we're looking at it saying what's going on it's what's going on in the middle of your tree and God wants to prune out the middle of that tree in order that what his image his fruit his life would be reproduced my my my don't you love him there's got to be that also the very other part that goes with that is for proper air flow brother Ram says that he would say it in this way he said sometimes we think when we're going through the purging that God is angry with us everybody ever felt that way I'll be honest for everybody here we look at it right I mean what's going on I mean I haven't I haven't heard from him I haven't felt his presence Hey listen as a believer that means everything to you hearing from him you might go weeks on end from not hearing from your best friend but not hearing from him it's troubling not feeling his presence it's trembling it causes a Believer to look and search and say Lord is there something wrong in my life and as Believers we come to a place to understand that when our hearts are really poured out before God if there is something in the way God will make it known but sometimes it isn't about things being in the way it's simply God wanting us to be opened up and realizing that without me you can do nothing why was God purging him he was purging him in order that job would bring forth the abundance of fruit and giving him a fruit a few trials God was proving that in the midst of conflict he was proving it to Satan that there is somebody who will stand steadfast in the midst of it amen I wish I had a diagram up here tonight I actually had it but I we things I didn't get it dropped to him back there and we had a lot was going on there but you know many times there's been some things and I I'll tell you a little story on myself my wife and now we've got you know we've got multiple hydras and things like that over the years but the first time we got this big hydr that well it wasn't big it was just in a you know it was a small one like this and she wanted one so bad and to me I looked at it and I thought cuz I already got it one time for how I trimmed the cherry tree now there ain't no fruit coming out of our cherry tree but I I you say what what did she do she pulled up and stopped and got out of the on the driveway and just looked at it now I'm the gardener around the house but when it came to that right there I thought oh man it just crushed me cuz I thought oh I hope I didn't ruin it I hope I didn't mess it up I was the guy who gave that we that cherry tree a beetle haircut you wonder where the rest of the Beatles at my wife just looked at it so when we got this hydran I'll tell you what I did she wanted one of those I looked at it I said honey CU I know you got to make certain Cuts you got to do certain things when you're trimming them and you know there's certain things they work on New Growth I said I'll tell you what I'll plan it for you but now I said you'd be the one to trim it would that be all right I said I'll make sure i' I make sure I've got you Sharp utens I'll sharpen them for you I'll make sure they're ready to go but if you'll just do the studying and the busy work and take care of it because I do a lot of other the fertilizing and things like that trimming up roses and things but you realize that some of that right there of going through and you study it of how you have to cut not all hydras are the same same way with fruit trees but there's certain ways that you make Cuts I wish I had that diagram up there because there's just certain ways it's not just going and just making just a flat cut all around there's certain things that's studied out and to think how that God knows you and I oh my here's a fruit time coming out in our life and we look at it say glory be to God and then look off of that branch and here's coming you know a shoot off the branch and here a shoot off the branch and here a shoot off the branch God just looks at it and he trims it back right here and trims this away right here and you and I can look at and say Lord what what what's what's going on what are you doing what's taking place Lord I don't understand what's going on he's pruning our Liv lives it doesn't always make sense to us when God is pruning away our lives as a matter of fact we don't always know what's taking place this is why brother Bram you've heard me refer to this quote here for time and time again where brother Bram says this regarding job I don't have it up there but I just want to refer to it he said regarding that of job that sometimes people think because that other people are sick but they've sinned no he said God does deal with sickness and sin by sickness but not in every case he said in this case with job he was not correcting him but he was bringing out the qualities of a Believer bringing out the qualities what qualities would be brought out in our life when we consider that the stature of a perfect man you realize every one of those attributes are already in you they're in that seed already true we have to come under the word for our day just as everyone had to come in the word for their day truly God makes indeed temples and Tabernacles of his glory but you realize that every one of those virtues in there Faith knowledge Temperance virtue godliness brotherly kindness you realize that every one of those there's a continue as the scripture says and adding to or increasing or enlargement it's continuing and you you know what when we think about it with patience patience itself is not just something you wake up in the morning and say you know what I think today would be a lovely day for patience to be added I'll take some more patience on my life you can't do that patience can only be added through circumstances that require death and allow patience to come forth requires of where we're trusting and looking to the word of God we're trust like Abraham was trusting in God and go for God to complete the work he had to be patient is that right Abraham had some failures on that right there but when it all comes down to it you find patience grew in Abraham's life it's the same way with faith faith is made to grow Paul would write to the Believers that your faith May abound right the prophet spoke about when in wings of a snow white dove and he would talk about where God had brought him in his life through the opening of the word and he said this has led me to a faith I never had before amen why it was growing our faith you see this is why we are we are Liv we are living beings we are living images of a living God working through us he's not just where we're sitting there with faith and virtue and praise God I've got everything you know Master this is where some of the things I don't want to get off on this but sometimes it's gotten off and it keeps people well I made it here and I've got up here and I've got up here it's not like that it's what's already packed inside of you and the spirit of God is what quickens that seed on the inside because if it's not then it's like as the prophet said over and over and over a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in itself then virtues are spirit-given virtues that must come out of our life by the spirit of the Living God what I'm trying to say is is only through times of adversity do they grow can we just look at a few things here I just want just have a couple scriptures and then we'll come to a close we're talking about the fruit of the spirit but let me keep let me skip Galatians 5 and let's go to Philippians 1 verse verse n I'm going to look at this word abound but this word abound it means of a flower that's going from a bud to full bloom I want you to look at this in Philippians 1:9 Paul said and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment now how can we can't just sit around and say you know today's going to be a day where my love abounds this is where the Love's going to abound I tell you today I'm going to really I'm going to set my mind to it and I'm going to the love is going to my understanding in situations is going to grow today my discernment in situations with love is going to grow don't work that way the only way that love itself May abound more and more in understanding and discernment is by experience it's got to be pruning that goes on in our life and let me tell you every moment of pruning is worth it every moment that we're dying to ourself because in order for love to be expressed you've got to have that which is contrary and sometimes it isn't altogether somebody in opposition or somebody coming against you know all the chapter on 1 Corinthians 13 but sometimes it's just situations where God is helping you and I through experiences in our own life Paul would say you need not any man teach you to love one another cuz you're taught of God God loved you when you were unlovable and even now at times when you don't don't deserve it God let you know it's not about what you deserve my love is unconditional is that right he's he's doing that so that you and I might learn that we that our love might reach out Lord amen well so and so don't deserve my love says who well they haven't been faithful they haven't done this they haven't done that so you've got conditional love now you see God is not going to neglect one growth in our life God said that's a branch that's growing across you got something growing across there we need to get that pruned out so light can hit that area in your life because it's got to bring forth It's got to manifest the love of God in every area and every part of our life I say Lord help us I'm glad he's the one doing the pruning aren't you yes cuz if it was left up to me and left up to you we would probably just have branches going every which way we would say why cut this off here why cut this off here why cause this one to go this way what but God knows exactly what he's doing he knows why when every situation comes across our life listen friends if there's one thing that we can learn don't wish away every situation Hallelujah don't look at every situation of why did so and so do this or why did this do this but sometimes God allows wrong to come your way to see what you're going to do about it and whether or not you're going to humble yourself under the mighty hand of God God's doing that to prune Our Lives now remember there's only two ways God's way and our way God's way is always right right our way is always is wrong you're right verse 10 why so understanding and discernment here that you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteous that means being complete which are by Jesus Christ un the glory and praise of God Philippi 1 Thessalonians 3: 12 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all menoo that's just not buddies just not friends just not Brethren just not the people who even agree with us but toward all men friends love is not compromising love has a standard is that right but God make us increase and abound in love so here God knows in order for that to come to pass there's got to be pruning in our lives and pruning and purging God will allow situations to come our way test and trials to purges these are not that purging us these are not those times of oh the right hand where the Red Sea is parted yet it's his power it's his presence the whole time but it's not those times where you feel like maram grabbing the tamb bring and running up and down the bank in the midst of those times it's a time of us dying to ourselves but yet those are the greatest times when God's working it's when we're surrendering to him yielding to him dying to ourselves look at this in Psalms 92 let me finish with these three scriptures I I love these scriptures those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God those that are planted he plants us the Lord he's the one tendon to our lives verse 14 they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing so it's not just a season but it's a continual it's pruning that's going on that purging where those that are planted in the courts of the Lord still in the old age will be fat and flourishing that word that means full of spiritual Vitality verse 15 to show that the Lord is upright they are living memorials showing that the Lord is upright and faithful to all his promises he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him that's part of the purging on the left and he does work let's stand yet I cannot behold him but he's working yes the times like I said when they're going through comes into early spring that's when they're out there trimming trimming pruning that's the ideal time when they catch their first little glimpses of warmth in Spring that's when they're working on those fruit trees but how many of us make an appointment and say you know what I tell you what brother Brian let's let's meet up at Miller's right now we'll meet over there in early spring huh first thing you had asked the question of why did they get a new shipment of Amish pies come in CU they do get them out there what what what what did they get in CU you know there's nothing on the trees there's not even leaves who wants to go look at those trees right now there's no apples out there to pick but yet that time that you and I are not paying any atten attention to it are not drawn to it that's when some of the most important and is the work that's being done that we benefit from in the fall season so the times when you don't see God working you don't feel him working of course we examine our life we check our life but when you see when you don't you can look in the word and say Lord I by your grace I don't I don't see anything at least it's unbeknown to me but I Got Confidence you'll make it known to me if there is see listen friends God won't drag God won't lead you on God don't make you guess he wants Fellowship to be there between you and I but think of what the scripture says that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings that Christ would make himself known to you and I he would Purge away I tell you what I want to do I said Lord just let me stay in that place that I can just those decisions we were talking about last week Lord help me just to stay in that place getting Lord God if it's it's me humbling myself more because there's always room for that help me Lord in the midst of these times I've never been there in situations where you don't know what's going on there's nothing you can even explain to anybody else there's things that you it seems like in your life and you know what I'll tell you this right now this is just experience coming through if you dwell on it very long it can get you down you start dwelling on what's going on and what's taking place you dwelling on it I'll tell you what you'll be you having the blues pretty pretty [Music] soon brother Samuel what must I do those are times for decisions and remember the prophet told us that when we make decisions in the midst of those times that's overcoming even to make a decision as we said in times where maybe his presence you don't feel it like you felt it at other times he's still present amen he's still God when you don't sense his presence when you haven't maybe heard an answer from him maybe there's something he hasn't seemed like he hasn't spoken to your life in a while when you've examined your life by the word you've let the word examine your life that's why even we come to the house of God L friends even in the best of our looking at our own lives I'm glad that the Holy Spirit he'll come right by our way and God is so mindful he'll bring an examination on our life oh you know what it's like writing a paper you ever wrote a paper and you edit it you check it over how many ever wrote a paper before okay sometimes I mean the things you can write it over you think man this is is perfect I've went over this with a fine tooth comb then you give it to somebody else right and they start reading it and you realize words that you have filled in in your brain that you left out they catch places you should have put a comma they catch places that should have been a period they catch you see there's certain things that we look at and we can look and think everything is just exactly just right but God knows how to scan Our Lives say here's time for a pause oh this is a runon God knows exactly what he's doing in our lives every service we know this by now every service is always it's so unique you can't you can't reproduce and you wouldn't want to try to do that but you you want God to be free to move in such a way in every service cuz he knows what we have need of there's times we need our lives examined and we all we always do but we need that that part about our life because if there's something out of place then we want to be known about it but if we've examined it and then the spirit of God is coming down this way and the word's coming then you can stand there in the midst of that and say Lord I know my life I I I'm placed right here and the word has examined my life Lord then you're standing in a channel waiting for inspiration and you can stand right there with with faith and wait and no I don't see him I don't even feel him but he's my way maker amen and he's working amen he's working on the left hand he does work this may not be a red sea moment in my life but he's still the God who opened the Red Sea he's the god who's holding my life right now he's the god who's working all situations right around for his glory you believe that God is working let's just pray could we just pray together Heavenly Father Lord you are so mindful Lord of every need in every situation Lord as we take this example that you would Place upon our heart with purging and pruning a certain times of the year and things that take place that none of us think about we don't think about it when we go to buy the certain Delicacies of fruit and things like that we don't think about all that but God how we benefit from that fruit that's come forth Lord God this is your desire Lord in our lives Lord God that through every branch that beareth fruit you purge it that it might bring forth more fruit Lord help us

as we're praying and we're looking to you Lord God the understanding you would give us by the grace of God it doesn't take away our Humanity where our Humanity like job could even during these times worry would want to slip in Lord but God may we remember Lord may we remember that Lord even when we don't feel you we don't see you you're still working Lord May at that time lord as we continue to

God knows what he's doing to where we can look at things and we start we look right here and say Lord help me sometimes it isn't even about you know brother BR says and the humble thyself he said he said don't ever let an arrogant Spirit come around you he said even if someone's done you wrong or you think they've done you wrong he said don't let that come around you he said if you want to get anywhere with God keep that away from your life amen and yet we're tested by that is that not true true but you realize when those things come about in our life sometimes we don't catch it right away we don't but as we're praying and looking to the Lord we realize Lord my heart needs to be right my attitude needs to be right what's that doing God's pruning away through that situation God is
