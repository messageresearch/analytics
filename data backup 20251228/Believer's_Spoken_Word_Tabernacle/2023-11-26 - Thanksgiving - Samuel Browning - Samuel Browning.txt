you Lord I need you Lord right now oh yes Jesus I Need You Lord I need you Lord right now lift my hands down my knees worship at your throne I need you Lord I need you Lord right [Music] now you know we consider place you know in a moment that we're living in and when the lamb steps forward we know he Ste forward to take the book to reveal to make himself known to us in this hour we also realize that through this there's coming a literal Corporal coming there is yes sir and you realize that the moment that he changes those garments lays aside those garments and becomes the lion that signifies there's a change at the same time taking place on Earth amen that's good and to think that in in all of that in this moment it isn't just that we need him there as a lamb to cover all of our mistakes but I wouldn't want to be here a moment without his Mercy we need him every day the Bible said let us come before the throne of grace that we might find help in the time of need and I I don't know about you but I I find that scripture it means more to me than what it did even years ago I I don't just look at that scripture of looking at God helping me beyond my mistakes no I I look at that as God you're the one to bring to pass in my life the word that you've spoken over me and asking God let that word let it just live out in my life we're coming before the throne of grace that we find help in the time of need without him we can do nothing isn't that true amen it's so it's so good to be together and uh so good to see each and every one of you evidently you survived the holiday oh my one of my buddies on the on one of my threads that I'm on said man he said I hope we're okay to button our pants we Sunday morning you know but uh it's just it's just been good to be together and uh we're just grateful to the Lord for his Mercy amen for all that he has done and all that he's doing amen and we just um are grateful for that I tell you what the Lord has been so good to us we've had some wonderful services is here uh with brother Timothy there on on Thursday night and and I know sometimes it's a little it can be a little difficult to understand uh the language and sometimes those backgrounds and uh but um I think the point got acrossed and uh I I certainly believe it like this when I you know approach it and say God just help me to give me the understanding amen that we need cuz he's still the same God that loosens our opens our hearing and what needs to be gotten and I thought that was so powerful of what the Lord brought there through uh brother Timothy Amen in that night and if there was ever a time that we need to be United it's right now and you realize that that uniting itself is not something that we do on our own strength or our own accord but that's that's through God's working in our life it's just as much as we look at things and we say with lining up with God and as we line up with God then we'll be lining up with one another abolutely because we otherwise it's just us conferring one our thoughts on somebody else but if we're lined up with God then we can be lined up with one another amen and that's I believe that's God's desire and I tell you brother uh brother John Sanger I so appreciated amen the ministering of the word appreciated a gift amen that was there and uh how many of you are blessed in these past services amen really truly blessed and um uh I'm I'm so glad to me I I've said this over and over and I mean it I'm so thankful for the variety that God has God doesn't want any of us he doesn't want you to be like somebody else he want you just to be you how he's made you and God has it's just so beautiful the bouquet and the ministry we have certainly been blessed I'll tell you to me the Bride of Jesus Christ is a blessed people oh yeah amen and with the with with with with with the gifts that God the love gifts that God has given to us my I tell you just every angle and all those all those places I just I just love it I love it amen just love the Lord and I I certainly believe there are things that God has has done so specially Amen in these services and so we just want to look to the Lord this morning and just invite him that he'll come and just speak to us so before we turn to the word word this morning could we just go to him one more time in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just come Lord into your presence Lord right now how thankful we are oh God that we have Lord this opportunity Lord to be able to gather together and Lord we just ask that in these moments Lord that you would just Lord gather us under your wings Lord May you speak to us Lord the things that we lord would be in need of and Lord need to hear In This Moment Lord may you I pray God just Lord help me to step aside Lord the inspiration that Lord oh God that I've received Lord this within may you Lord just help me Lord that that same inspiration will come Lord to deliver this word Lord Lord as I heard your Prophet say it Lord even ear earlier this week Lord as he prepared to preach that future home and he made that same request that that same inspiration would come but knowing as he said it would be in the hands of God and so Lord we're asking you Lord because without you we can do nothing we're asking that you would Inspire us for this moment lordu that father the word would go beyond just our hearing and would move down oh God lord deeper Lord than just our speak Spirit but in our soul God as you're passing through every Avenue you're the Lord that Health all our diseases as the word Lord is passing through Lord as we hear it Lord God as it's brought down in from the father from the Physical Realm the spiritual Lord into our soul God as the word is passing Lord may it bring healing Lord in every channel in every area Lord we just give give ourselves to you Lord and we just ask oh God for your blessings this morning may you have your way we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you turn with me to Psalms 100 I want to look here this morning want to say thank you to the musicians and uh so thankful to God Psalms 100 this is a very familiar Psalm to many of us and that many times we quote from this um but I want to read from here and just just drawing a little a little thought here this morning Psalms 100 verse1 this is a Psalm of praise says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness that means joy and come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise and be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations amen I just like to speak on a simple word Thanksgiving may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated this is a Psalm of of Thanksgiving it's a Psalm of Praise many of these different Psalms would even be rehearsed some of them at certain times not only in the year but some of them were were Psalms that were rehearsed in a daily manner some in a weekly manner but this is a Psalm of Thanksgiving and I want to just say it like this that Thanksgiving itself is an expression of gratitude yeah and thankfulness for what has already been done and you're a partaker of it that's right that's good you can't be thankful for anything that you've not experienced true but when you've experienced it then you can be thankful that's why the scripture could say oh Taste of the Lord and see that he is goodjah amen yes now if you'll notice this here as this Psalm of praise the Bible says in 1 chonicles 1634 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and for his mercy endureth forever and say ye save us oh god of our salvation and gather us together and Deliver Us from the Heathen that we may give thanks to th holy name and glory in thy praise now I want you to notice as we're just a few scriptures that there is a reason for giving thanks and that reason for giving thanks of even how David has expressed this and this is a Psalm here of dedication is that of what God has done God has gathered us together God has delivered us so uh my praise is not empty my praise is full that's right in Psalms 30:1 when David's house was dedicated it said thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing thou Hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness Oh Glory to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever that's right so David is declaring I I've got a reason to give thanks abely because you can't give thanks for anything if you haven't experienced it it would be like you giving thanks for uh the Thanksgiving meal in my house and you did not eat it but if you've been there and you ate it then you can say thank you is that right and this is why that when David is expressing thou in verse 11 turn my morning into dancing you have put off my sackcloth and gted me mlus aren't you glad when God is the one it's not you or I that's determined when to put off the sackcloth but God is the one who puts off the sackcloth God is the one who looks down into our life and he sees when that first Nature has so aligned with his word and it's God who brings about the change in our life thou H has turned my mourning into dancing some 107:15 oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men now when we get into this Psalm here this morning in Psalm verse 100 verse one as we read in our text it says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands uh very prophetic of what would take place we understand that it was the spirit of Christ in David as it was the spirit of Christ in the rest of the prophets when they would speak because in this time there is no other people who knows the Lord outside of that of Israel but notice he said All Ye Lands it would be where that God himself would be known among the people among his children that that mystery that would be hidden within him that he would take a bride out of many kindreds nations and tongues so this is the point that I get to is That Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all ye land so there is no nationality nor excuse for us not to praise the Lord hallelujah now it's true that we all might worship a little differently but let all of us praise and give Glory unto God A Joyful Noise yes sir amen has he done something for you has you has he brought you from where you were to where you are now notice Make a Joyful Noise not just a noise but a Joyful Noise something that has substance something that has reality in it something that has significance that word joyful is a shout to raise a sound cry out to give a blast it's like that of a shout in a Triumph uh shout like an alarm to battle it's to shout in Triumph to shout for joy and let me just say it like this the only way even when Israel came around the walls of Jericho and it was on that seventh day that they were commanded after the seventh time around to shout the shout itself was already a shout of Triumph because God by his word had already declared the victory is finished so when they shouted it was not something something to where they just came under some type of a feeling but they were shouting because of a reality that God has already given us the victory yes sir is that right and there was a shout for Joy so there is a A Joyful Noise and the bible let me just say it like this a shout has a meaning in it it is a response to a certain reality that you've experienced the Bible says in Zechariah 4:6 it said not by might nor by power but by my spirit saeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so not just shouting not just shout but these shoutings have meaning in them Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now even these scriptures that I've read here it has meaning to you has meaning to me as Believers because we have received the shoutings of Grace yes sir amen where God has gathered a people and built them under the power of God back into a place a Powerhouse a temple of the Living God and hear The Headstone coming and it's shoutings of Grace Grace unto it let me just say it these shoutings are not empty noise but they have meaning in it is that right here stood a prophet in that hour he knew what he was talking about he had been somewhere and was able to tell you I've been there on the other side and I have saw it and millions shouted out we're resting on that yes sir amen there's a substance to my shout notice in Jo job 38:4 I hope you're getting what I'm saying in Job 38 verse verse4 here God is speaking to job all of his trial everything he's going through but God does not take him to the trial God takes him to his victory which go before there was ever a trial before there was ever atom dust or molecule that job was found secured in the mind of God where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who ha stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or laid the Cornerstone thereof you might say well what does that have to do with my trial if you can recognize that there is nothing when you see yourself there there is nothing here in the temporal life that can alter your Eternal destination sir yes sir all of the things between here and there all of those things are things permitted by God all of those things that but they cannot alter the destiny of a child of God so in the midst of what I go through I can still have a Joyful Noise because I know in whom I have believed that's right good is that all right we believe that don't we notice this when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God did what shouted for joy now I don't think I have this quote up there but just listen to this out of the serpent seat opening quote dear God the Great and Mighty God who formed All Things by the power of His Spirit has brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who freely died for we Sinners into this to reconcile us back into this marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God and as we're Tau in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the the world when the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus so we were shouting for Joy because we seen our Salvation in the lamb of God that's why we can shout now because what happened there and I was a part of there now has struck down and it's caught up right here in my life I recognize I'm a part of it yes sir I'm a part of it that's what brings out a Joyful Noise are you hearing me I don't just get joyful when things are up and that everything's good and my bank account here and my bank no that's a joy that the world give Jesus said I give you a joy that no man can take from you then not a child can take it out of your life Hallelujah there's nothing can take this Joy away from you that's right glory be to God you ought to just say it's my joy that's right he gave it to me now it's mine oh my notice notice here Hebrews 2:11 for both he that sanctify and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he's not ashamed to call them Brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee this is who he is that's right he is the Victor the mighty conqueror he is proclaiming his victory over Satan he is proclaiming his victory over the world where is he doing it declaring it in the midst of his church that's right let me just tell you something right now that maybe you don't see yourself as Victorious but what's important is is God sees you as Victorious and that's why God is speaking over your life because it's you and I coming to see what God knows and sees about you and I and the Bible says he will declare his name his life his character himself in the midst of his Church in the midst of his people and He will sing notice this sing praise unto thee notice what the spirit of God does it's praise unto the finished work of Calvary hallelujah it's finished I am redeemed the Bible said let the redeemed of the Lord say so amen singing A Hymn that's what that scripture means a hym a declaration of a hero I say there's no greater hero than the Lord Jesus Christ the almighty God come down Among Us and do the work and reveal himself to you and I notice this I will declare thy name unto my brethren in Psalm 751 he says unto thee Oh God do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks now I want to just think the point right here David is certain here we know in whom we are worshiping we give thanks unto thee oh oh God isin't it wonderful to know your God isin't it wonderful to know the Living God I'm not talking about an imagination I'm not talking something that somebody's painted up but I'm talking about to know him oh God do we give thanks unto thee we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous Works declare that's so good thy name is near that name is person his life it's near because who can do this but God that's right now the Church of the Living God we do not follow signs and wonders signs and wonders are to follow us so we're not running after signs and wonders no we're not looking for a Ministry to spring up that well this ministry would be like brother Bram or them we're not looking for that that's right we've already received our last sign that's right and the greatest reality is is to recognize that it's Christ in you recognize that God don't want us running here and there if I have this man pray for me or fact God don't want is not interested in that God is interested in that you and I can recognize Christ in our own lives so good that's the purpose of this message is to bring a living God to live behind our flesh and manifest Sons and Daughters of God in this hour yes well I'm talking about Thanksgiving who alone can do these things but God just got a call here this morning even from sister readen I know the prayer request was made keep her in prayer but the doctors even you know you heard the testimony she gave during the communion service a few weeks back but even the doctors here once again the doctors spoke to her and just here recently and said I don't know what's taking place but those tumors are shrinking Hall even more I tell you why sir it's God yes sir and God's got a purpose for Sister Rita who can do it but God I thank God for medical science but let me tell you something there ain't enough medicine that can heal anybody is that right if it could then you take a dying person put some put some heal or put some medicine on their wound it'll never heal because life is the healer right so I want to say it like this I'm so thankful for the time we're living in not because of the world not because of the world situation but I'm thankful to believing we're living in the time of the Finish we're living in a time of the end we're living in a time that all the prophets and all of them have looked forward to this time yes sir if Luther could have lived to this time he would have loved to have lived in this time but he fulfilled and responded to the anointing that he was under to do what God called him to do same thing with Wesley same thing with the zza street Pentecost but where we are living in a time to where there is a people on earth now that will not see death there is a people that's not looking at promises a far off but there is a people upon Earth where the Living God is declaring himself that I am the Fulfillment of all things we are living in a time where the word itself the Bible itself it is now an open book where we recognize and we're seeing our self our identity even in these scriptures that we are reading here this morning we find ourselves find this day find this hour how could we have done it without the spirit of God that's right brother brandom opens in the message the in the message the Rapture and he says oh you're hearing these brothers get up and make statements about the message of the hour he said what that is it's a promise that God has made to us in this hour and he I love what he says next he said we wouldn't even know where to go in the scripture but he's led us to those places that's right the spirit of God has quickened to us the places in the scripture those places that belong to us in this hour because here we are preparing to step into a new day and so with that in mind we recognize the Bible says in Revelations chapter 5 where we stand We're The Taking of the book and the taking of that book is the most Sublime Sublime event within history he took the book he paid the price of redemption for you and I is that right he prevailed In The Garden of Gethsemane he paid the price of redemption in other words to bring you and I back to the rightful life that we were intended to be in the beginning and down through time God you know even there in the time among you know uh the disciples at first not even aware that there was going to come forth a gentile bride but God had it in his mind it was a secret hidden Mystery amen that God was going to call a people out of the Gentiles for his name sake yes sir many different types we could run through in the scripture but I want you to notice the Bible said that this book it was written within and on the outside sealed with Seven Seals meaning that there is a meaning within here God himself his thoughts are written within his word God does not have to come up with a new message but it's God fulfilling his promised word that's God interpreting his word on the backside of the book backside meaning not outside but it's speaking at the end time yeah that here when there was a strong Angel proclaiming oh let there come forth if is worthy let him step forth or forever now hold his peace now to recognize that within this when the book was taken if I can jump to verse eight when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders how many know that's the four that's the that's the 12 apostles that's the 12 Patriarchs f down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints you know you could take this verse right here and put it right back in the devil's nose where the devil said your prayers aren't working your prayers aren't affected you've been praying about your children but let me tell you something every prayer you prayed has not just went out and floated by but every prayer is reserved and God fulfills every word in his own time I think of how the Prophet baptizing brother Billy Paul he said oh God let Hope look over the banister of time right now brother brandom would sit there and baptize others and say here stands A Mother's Prayer that's been answered Hallelujah yes sir amen that's why we pray our prayers are not hope so our prayers are I know I'm a Believer I know where I'm standing with God and he said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it that's right Goode verse n and they sung a new song Oh My Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof so notice there come a change for thou was slain Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us unto our Gods Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth you're a king because he's made you a king that's right A King is a ruler that's right you're ruling over sin the flesh the devil and the world right now Hallelujah yes sir you're a king right now and you're also a priest you're bringing spiritual sacrifices unto God not just with your lips but with your life amen even in the moments and times that we don't feel like it but yet in our life there's a praise that's going up right are you hearing me now saying with a loud voice notice and I be heard I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all them that are therein heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto them that Seth on the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever amen John is worshiping here as he said unto him that sth on the throne and unto the lamb it's not two different people it's the same almighty God that has stepped down in Redemption hallelujah it's God become one of us and John is rejoicing oh my let me tell you something when John is writing this in Revelations 5 under inspiration John is caught up in the spirit yes he is he's in the spirit and he's receiving Revelation oh my he's hearing what's going on let me tell you that's why when I hear the word of the message of the hour I do not hear a word of defeat I do not hear a word of Doom and Gloom come on I hear a word that there is power in the blood of the Lamb amen Worthy is the Lamb to receive Power Glory and Honor you know what that says I ascribe Authority unto the lamb that he is more than enough to achieve and do what he said he will do he doesn't need man's intuition doesn't need man's thoughts he just needs his word to be received and believed and his word will perform itself I said Worthy is the Lamb oh my think of it John went from weeping to rejoicing he started out this chapter weeping Hey listen when God got a hold of our life we started out weeping right right we can go some other places in the scripture but let's just say here we had to start our weeping but notice who is it that changed our weeping to rejoicing who is it that turn my mour into dancing who is it that gave me oil for Joy instead of mourning who is it that gave me Beauty for Ashes who is it that took away the Garment of heaviness and gave me a Garment of Praise I say I know what he's done for me and I'm thankful I'm thankful oh my John there was a Mourning that was turned into Joy you see brother Ram would say it like this go in paragraph 303 there Brianna please in the message the breach 303 he said talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there is John what did John see his representation he saw his theoy he saw himself he saw his true identity what revealed his true identity the opening of the word the lamb the lamb having the book and beginning to speak it's the lamb who opened John's ID and John was able to look past this mortality that here he is in bondage trapped in but he shall be delivered from this glorious bondage are you hearing me oh Thanksgiving you talking about Thanksgiving he saw John he saw himself so tell me that brought forth A Joyful Noise John said I don't know about anybody else but I saw myself and when I saw my name in the bookall I'm acting like the Shepherds did when they were called to see unto you is Born This Day in the city of David A Savior and they looked upon him and they began to rejoice and the angels be to sing Hallelujah and the prophet said oh they talk about people getting out of order he said I Ain ever seen anybody get out of order when the word of God goes to being preached and their names are being revealed and they shout for Joy yes sir so I tell let me get to my first point this is what I most most thankful for let me just Echo the words of the Prophet this is what I'm most thankful for you are standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place talk about a Thanksgiving hallu I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of I'm more thankful for that than any Financial Security I'm more thankful for this than anything else that you could look at because all those things can be gone in a moment's time I am more thankful for this because this is what's Eternal it really causes us to evaluate what do we spend so much time and energy on right are we giving more of ourselves our energy sometimes our mind our thoughts and our being and everything of this and that are we giving it for Eternal things or temporal oh brother Samuel we've got to live in this life I know we have to live in this life but this life should not squelch the Joyful Noise trials yeah Trials come but you see many of the things when we look at it what's the Eternal part and this is what to be most thankful for you are pure you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman look at this that's both born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ Oh my he said if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I can't die for that sin somebody took my place it'd be like you going down when somebody's paid your hospital bill and you argue with them about paying it it's already paid what do you have to do accept your release and don't live like you got a debt hanging over you anymore how do I do that receive and accept what he has done for you oh my friends don't you understand that's what this message come for this message come to reveal Calvary to you and I Calvary seems like a simple term it seems like a term that would be presented well that's presented in all the churches no it's not this reality back to our sunship as Sons and Daughters of God it goes much deeper than us looking upon the cross and say thank you Lord for paying the price I'm glad that somebody came down and they paid the price but you see the reality that God does for you and I is break back the veil to realize you are a son and daughter of God and you are called to be a partaker of that same life life Hallelujah the bloodstream open to you and I notice brother Brandon would say it like this oh my notice he says in in paragraph 277 I'm just going to skip on down he said hallelujah oh he says you're not only that talking about Justified but you're going to the wedding in the sky see justified in the first place what's the first place back in the mind of God Amen that's the first place going back to the mind of God where you shouted for Joy you saw your salvation saw the finished word you were Justified you see this word has taking you and I back back before Genesis 1 back into the back part of God's mind and when we can see that that reality then there is nothing when that is anchored in our heart there's nothing nothing present nor to come height nor death nothing can separate us from the love of God that we have in Christ Jesus our lord ain't that wonderful it puts all the glory on him so what's our shout about it's about him what's the Joyful Noise it's about him it's what he has done what he's done what he's doing in my life you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky hey you already got your token you already got your seat your seat's already picked out amen aircraft already been selected and it ain't an airplane amen but you are in Christ Jesus by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body you have been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ you're seated in Christ and ready for the Blast [Music] Off glory be to God hallelujah oh my you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace unmar Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own I'm glad that was just kind of dropped in there a little bit more God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there yes sir not here there that's right not here there he slipped the wedding band on there oh my you were always to be his I was always to be his I didn't know it you didn't know it we stumbled around but he found us oh M Bas plac it on you there put your name on a book what a Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God no wonder the scriptures could say in Psalms 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine Lin is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called un the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God beauti hallelujah Psalms 951 oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation oh yes he let us come before his Pres presence with Thanksgiving I got some Thanksgiving I got some praise Lord I want to pour out on you glory like that woman that had the alabaster box she had something that she wanted to pour out on him amen there's some Thanksgiving there's praise let me just tell you something right now I don't have to be in these walls to give him praise I don't have to be in these walls to give him Thanksgiving right no sir I can be walking and many times walking or driving down the road it's even in those moments you begin to think of the goodness of the Lord think about God's mercy think about him think about the word is the word you're hearing the word being preached and you're listening to it you're drawing from the devotions as you're reading the scriptures and then as you just go to start thinking on him my there's a praise that starts to bring up in your life is that right H yes sir right oh my oh brother Samuel I'd be careful about that you might keep your hands on the wheel well I'm not advise anybody to take their hands off the wheel but you remember when brother Hoover was here and I've heard brother Hoover tell this a number of times even when we were with him there in Jeffersonville of how then when brother Brandon would finally come out after being gone away from the in the meetings and after then fighting all those Devils when he would come home finally when he would come out and they knew at that time get the kids together we're going for a ride in the country and brother Bron would begin to testify of the goodness of God and you know what brother Bown never testified of it of I I did this or I did that but he testified I was there and saw the Lord do this I saw the Lord do this and as brother brand begin to testify even how that you know the sister would record it oh my here she would at that time in the presence of God she'd begin to speak in tongues and then you'd find brother randam his hands going up when he was driving and on those roads friends I know them roads then roads curvy up and down you think it's it's hard enough with two hands on the wheel and what I'm trying to say to you is is that in that moment of praise and thanksgiving for what God has done I believe listen to me now I believe that we can be so caught up in the presence of God that God will guide you through problems on your job God will guide you through problems in your home if you will begin to think of his faithfulness of his goodness he'll guide you in the sharp terms he'll guide you in the UPS he'll guide you in the Downs glory be to God hallelujah Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king Above All Gods he Psalms 921 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name oh most high now watch this to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night now notice this it's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord to sing praise unto his name oh most high to show forth thy loving kindness which is his own life in the morning and thy faithfulness every night so in the morning you know it's no hard it's not hard to see things in the morning time many times you know depending on where you live you can see things you sat there at times Everything's kind of dark but then all of a sudden you start seeing that Sunrise then there's things that you start to see and you start to see little things that even sometimes even we've been out in the woods and out there real early and then you start looking at things you hear things moving you're out there you know cuz you go out in the dark if you're going to hunt in the morning and you go out there and you're looking and all of a sudden you think is that what is that I'm seeing is that a dog or is that a deer you know I mean you can only shoot at a certain legal time you know but still when you can shoot it's just 30 minutes before 30 minutes right after there a 30 minutes before Sunrise yeah so when we look at it there's things that you can see so clearly in the morning but in the nighttime when you can't see things real clearly this is the time he says Thy Faithfulness it's a time we can declare not only the dawn that has arose the morning the light that has come in our life but what about in the night times in your life what about in the times of night times that's right the times to where when everything despair everything else is going around this is also a time to show forth his life but Samuel what are you saying that A Joyful Noise isn't always about the morning A Joyful Noise is at all times David said I Will Bless The Lord at all times at all times is that right so notice as it goes on upon an instrument of 10 strings upon the sultry upon the heart with a solemn sound for thou Lord Hast made me glad notice thou Hast made me glad through thy work I will Triumph in the works of thy hands oh Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep now it with this in mind because when we're reading this here in the scripture Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord I think those are things that's resonating in your heart right now that you realize that that Joy itself comes from knowing what God has done for you you are a partaker of his life and with being a partaker of his life you see how every one of us are all different I and I understand there's we can get excited we can go uh you know sometimes we reach way we would respond to different things but I just want to say it in this way right here that God has not made it so that every one of us act exactly just alike God's not done it that way no he has that's why I don't pray for people if well you know they're a little bit timid let's pray that they'll be boisterous I don't pray for that because God's made us the way he wanted us it's no more praise if you're not timid than it is if you are and so forth are you hearing me I'm talking about something of a depth that where we look at that if there's a shout like we've been looking at there is a substance to this are you with me John just wasn't you know John just wasn't around a situation but John notice when he saw the 4 and20 Elders he heard all the Angels heard all the worshiping what John was worshiping was not because the Angels were worshiping John was not worshiping because the 4 and20 Elders were worshiping Shing John was worshiping because he saw himself that's right so John's worship was based on his own experience are you hearing me brother Samuel yeah what are you saying I'm saying that's how it must be when it is like that you'll be able to show his loving kindness not only in the morning but in the night time when pressures and everything else come around so I want want to just say it like this that you know I realize that some that might be very timid may not be real loud I know that listen friends I can stand right here it doesn't bother me I've preached in places now you know not everybody's expressive as we are as an assembly that's okay and neither would I want to try to make us them or them or them us I I don't want no formal Spirit coming in here that's right I'm sorry I don't want no formal spirit I I want listen I believe that the Church of the Living God ought to be led by the spirit of the Living God the prophet said that the Holy Ghost is to reign in the camp of the children of God and there is to be spontaneous worship that's a direct quote now what does that mean that means as God is moving upon lives personally right are you hearing me now now when I say it like that you may not be the one that maybe shouts the loudest you may not be one that really shouts right out but you know let me just tell you you something right now you've got a part and let me just tell you your part in a Joyful Noise the prophet speaks of this of the Throne of God Among Us and he says it like this in the Revelation series he said out of this Throne you know our Thunder's voice and voices and Lightnings he said oh there's voices how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy I'm talking about a Joyful Noise that's right every one of us are called to this the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God yes sir now watch this say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on that's thunder yeah that's a Joyful Noise unto the Lord that's good hallelujah oh my it'll take the temper out of an Irishman Glory oh it moves down Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands oh brother BR said that throws evil way that's the Thunder that shakes the devil so I want to say we're called to live my next point a thankful life to live out a thankful life Paul said in Colossians 3 let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be you thankful now you where in the scriptures the Bible tells us as the Lord Jesus he was going out of the midst of Jerusalem there were 10 lepers and these 10 lepers begin to call out to him now I want you to notice there's 10 of them and they call out to him and they ask him Jesus have mercy on us so they altto together they call out and they realize that he's able to help them now I want you to in the scripture I'm not I don't have this up there but I want you to think of this for a moment the Bible says that when Jesus Jesus turned and when he saw them now you realize they had leprosy brother Brian turn me down in these monitors just a little bit just a hair when he saw them he had to be close enough to see them right so sin ain't never intimidated Jesus that's that's right he had to be close enough to see him hey the Bible said that that many of them of the publicans and whatever more in the beginning of Luke 15 they came to him now they didn't come to him because Jesus was a compromiser but neither was Jesus shoot shooting machine guns at him as they were walking up to him but it was the life the presence of God the atmosphere let me tell you something friends what's more powerful than any words that you you and I could say is the atmosphere brother BR sister create an atmosphere that they'll drop into hallelujah oh my now notice he he he don't even he don't walk over to him brother Brian he didn't walk over to him and lay hands on him and said come on up here I want to pray for you we believe in laying on hands but he didn't do that he told him this is what he said he said go show yourself unto the priest and the Bible say says as they went on their way they got up and went on their way and as they went they were healed didn't even lay hands on them but the word spoken in the situation Jesus have mercy on me that's 10 of them you know 10's a worldly number 10's a carnal number is that right come on now but notice nine of them kept on going but there was one of them that turn came back he began to look he begin to see my walks changed maybe my ear this has come back my nose has come back there's been things restored to me that I had lost you know he he was thankful you know but the rest of them oh they went on they never returned back to give thanks and you say well why would God God knowing all things why would God heal them knowing they weren't going to go on and follow him because God loves Humanity that is good preaching yes sir yes the nine went on didn't bother Jesus he didn't lose one ounce of virtue as far as healing in terms of oh that's nine less people that can be healed it's already paid for there was one that came back and begin to give thanks the Bible said when he saw he was healed he turned back and and he glorified with a loud voice glorified God and he fell down at his feet and gave him thanks oh my you see how many I think when I look at through the prophet's life I think of over the years there's been people that's come and gone even when we were in the little church there at Gary Avenue remember seeing people get out of wheelchairs and services powerful things never went on to serve the Lord as far as knowing what you know I don't know really they what what they knew or where they were at they never walked maybe on into truth I don't even know if they went on to serve the Lord but I this is what I want to say to you is that when we look at it the reason that the Bible says serve the Lord with gladness we're not serving the lord out of Duty this this one returned back he didn't do it because he had to he returned back because he was thankful am you know what he did he recognized God was in in Christ he not only recognized and it heard about all the Miracles as the other nine had but he recognize right here this is none other than almighty God come down Among Us and you know what he was doing he was entering into his courts with Thanksgiving he was entering into his presence into the gates into the courts with a thankfulness in his heart you said brother Samuel how does that translate into a thankful life because you realize that it's by grace through faith that you're saved you can't work yourself to ever be we've read this already you can't work yourself to ever be good enough but it's by Grace you are saved and once you are saved Works themselves are in appreciation gratitude thankfulness for what he has done for you that's right oh my so we can see when we look at this in the scripture that's why why that in every part of our life every day of Thanksgiving is that right Jehovah Miracles brother bamon we are your people we're not under any bondage we're free the son has made us free we're free indeed to serve our Lord our Lord and our father we thank thee Oh you talk about a Thanksgiving Day for Freedom every day is a Thanksgiving Day every hours of Thanksgiving Day oh I who was once blind can now see I once was a sinner and now saved oh God how free we are how we can give you Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving from our heart that Jesus Christ the son of God is not dead but he's alive among us tonight proving himself alive so our Thanksgiving is not confined to a day is that right we recognize what that was all about is that right the woman fled the Bible tells us in the the Romans in Revelations 12 we realize what this was all about are you hearing me I'm not talking about now this modern history stuff I'm talking about the Bible the reason they came to pmth rock they were running from that Roman Catholic Spirit sure in order that they might worship God in Freedom it had pervaded and made its way into the church of England the angling church had went all around you there and let me just tell you when you begin to go back and study history you realize it wasn't just one short snapshot Journey these were people that actually time and time again tried to leave some of the first times were down there I believe in a ship right next to Turkey but notice they were ratted out and brought off of that ship and rock back right back into England but let me tell you something there was something in their heart let me tell you something it was more than their DNA it was prophecy that was to be fulfilled yes sir it was people that were Longing For Freedom are you hearing me it wasn't a freedom where I can just do what I want to do their freedom that they were thinking about was a freedom to serve God that's why they came here it want the freedom because they had an attitude against of England or attitude about this that is not what they came about that would still be bondage because you can be over here and still be bondage Happ hatred in your heart right here from somebody across the sea that's right come on you can still be bound from things from years ago if you don't allow the blood of Jesus Christ to give you Grace to go down in the depths of your life and bring healing and deliver you from that complex you can hold things in your life but there's Grace that can go down in your life that you can have a Thanksgiving a continual Thanksgiving a continual working of the word brother Samuel what do I do do exactly like the 10 lepers did oh it's true in your life you can be completely liberated from sin set on fire by the spirit of God Christ as the love of your life and how the word will come right down in your life and reveal certain things that are still hidden there maybe things that are put out maybe there was a a complex about this and God in his own time goes down in there and begins to bring those things forth do you realize I can't find mine you can't find yours but David said he hath turned my sackcloth he hath turned my morning into dancing he hath done this it takes God to reveal those areas in our life and then it's God as we submit it's God that turns the morning to dancing it's God that removes the sackcloth it's God that heals the complexes it's God that heals the wounds in the spirit it's God who does that and then I got just even more to thank him for thank you Lord Jesus oh brother Samuel that's a scar but you know what a scar is it's a sign you've been healed and I'm not living by my scar I ain't posting my scar hey everybody look at me let me post it on Instagram look at my scar look at this no no no as a child of God we are thankful for the grace of God that I'm no longer in bondage to that and let me end with this give thanks at all times if there's one that can be challenging it's this right here but you see in every situation it's not that every situation as we read here in the scripture in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you it's not saying that everything the thing is thankworthy that's not what we're giving thanks about that's right we're giving thanks unto the Lord that Lord I don't know how all of this is going to come out but I know I'm yours I don't know how you're going to work all this out but I know I'm yours you know I just heard brother brandham here just just the other day brother baram is there and he's preaching on wings of a snow white dove and at the very end of that message brother Bram is so confident he's looking for his healing to come in this Dimension he makes the statement I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know how I don't know when but it's settled it's settled now it wasn't that he didn't get healed he just did not receive his healing in this Dimension good it would be in a few days where he would step across that dividing line of Time and Eternity right amen when he stepped from this body into that body there was no more stomach condition no more every seven years no more no more of that you know we all experience those every sevene Cycles but notice in everything give thanks now you know I know this is very simple but how many want your faith to be strengthened okay about five of of you 10 of you I want my faith to be strengthened don't you you know scientific research within this I'm going to read you something in a minute but scientific research actually shows your brain cannot produce chemicals for gratitude and anxiety at the same time wow think of that cannot produce gratitude and anxiety at the same time now let me ask you this question I wonder how I wonder what Paul and Silas were looking at when they were in that jail you see I understand sometimes when we look at things that we could think oh my this just something you know that Paul and Silas they just got all work no they just didn't get all worked up what what I've delivered to you here this morning is the same thing they had in their life you've got the same experience and if you don't you can have it this morning to where they can make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord when they came in there notice it was even their life that was a testimony their life was a testimony if I can say it like this it wasn't because they were the best singers that caused the Philippian Jailer to say hey I want what y'all got cuz y'all all really know how to sing nope that ain't what it was what was it well me saying Brother Sam you saying they weren't singing no they were singing it was something that was evident within their life that they were a part of to think about it individuals who were in bondage who had been beaten but they begin to worship about the Midnight Hour no wonder David could say I'm going to wake up and give you thanks in the Midnight Hour in other words at the first Breaking of Day Lord I want to give you thanks I know I'm not putting any un unbearable burden on some of you like good Lord midnight I'm just going to bed right then well it gives you a chance to give praise for you lay down but think about it even when we get up of a morning I wonder how many times when we roll out of bed of a morning we say oh Lord Jesus not another Monday not another week now our flesh feels like that right right our flesh feels like that I don't think anybody jumps out of the bed and says wo man I'm going to work this morning but you know in everything you can give things Lord thank you at least I got a job that's right that's right thank you Lord for giving me rest thank you for blessing me Lord with a good mind thank you Lord for giving me favor Lord thank you Father in everything give thanks Hallelujah now here's the reason brother BR talks about in his own self with that nervous condition he says I don't say too much about it around people this is what he says in uniting time and sign maybe I I'll read it to you he says I do not try to say too much about it you know around people complaining because I think one of the horriblest things is to see a man or woman that's constantly what's it say complaining yeah we all can say that one help me Jesus I've always thought God keep me from it that weakens Faith all the time what does complaining complaining that's wow that's true we got things we can complain about but Paul said like this he said I will glory in mine infirmities I didn't mean I I'm sure listen friends I'm sure Paul wasn't bubble dancing i a what Paul was talking about Paul's not talking about let me get worked up let me get I got to get then I got to get it no no no but Paul recognized that you know what that even though things are all around me that's taking place I'm going to make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord I'm going to going to worship God I'm going to I'm going to Worship the Lord I'm not going to let these things dictate my life are you hearing me there's times where reports can come fear can try to strike us sadness can try to strike us despair things that literally can knock the wind out of yourselves but if we can say God help me help me not to complain help me to remember that though I see these things around you've never failed me Lord you've never failed me Lord Lord I give you thanks right now when everything was taken from job the first infraction the Bible said he bowed his head and worshiped God the condition was not thankworthy but God was worthy of thanks when it happened the second part happened once again job worshiped and gave God thanks I say thanks be to God for his Mercy aren't you no wonder the Bible says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice in Eep in Philippians 4:4 let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God be anxious for nothing I'm glad that he's a reliever of that aren't you I got another part I can't even go into it here the one thing I just want to add to that to say what I'm thankful for right at the beginning of the week and just just meditate and just strike Lord I'm thankful there's a place where I can let off the pressure I'm thankful there's a safety place that I can go and let off the pressure and matter of fact I don't leave and go out of this safety Place once you've ever come in to Christ he's brought you in you don't ever come out you don't ever go out and come back in you come into a place of safety this City of Refuge I don't want to leave no more I want to dwell here but you realize within dwelling there he's the place that I can let off the pressure because pressure itself brother Bram says it like this he says it makes the bad act that way it makes the good act that way it makes these churches out here act that way and he says it makes the Tabernacle act that way what is it pressure now no doubt some of you sisters had your pressure cooker going for Thanksgiving or maybe your up to-date instapot that is the classic around our house and you know my feelings on it it's not as instant it's pretty good though it can make some pretty good ribs and things like that but let's get to the point when it's done and all of a sudden I I'm sitting there in the office or maybe I've come out of the office I'm sitting there on the chair and when I hear that I know few more moments dinner's going to be ready but you see what if there wasn't a valve to let off the pressure you've got a valve a place to let off the pressure and I'm thankful for that because you and I are living in an age there's pressure all around our young people face pressure that I never even faced we're facing pressures that our parents Grand grandparents never faced that's right but in the midst of it all I thank God for his light for his life for his grace that he has made known to us and I'm thankful there's a place where we can let off the pressure where we can there in him I'm thankful aren't you yes sir absolutely Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord in our walk in our life from our mouth you realize even as you speak the Lord help me on this test you realize that's Joyful Noise God help me today at work that's Joyful Noise Joyful Noise isn't just as I said right here Joyful Noise is your walk with God the bells and the the pomegranates on Aaron's robe moved together and it signified there was life and you may not be a real boisterous person here that's okay I don't want you to be a boisterous person I want you to be who God made you but if you're one to shout the house down I want you to shout the house down is that all right we are who God has made us to be but what's important is is that our response is out of the Thanksgiving of what we've experienced right I tell you you might have want you you know even for a person I've talked to people you have too that maybe they've only experienced just a little bit where they have repented of their sins but man they are thankful I remember I was there I was there it's something to be thankful for when you feel the sin you feel the load lifted off of you right then it's things you WR andness God taking things out of your life there was more Thanksgiving that was coming right it it just keeps on going it don't stop you're watching his working amen don't you love him what a Thanksgiving it let's pray heavenly father so much Lord to be thankful for so much Lord so much father we thank you for your mercy once again Lord Lord knowing that father there's a substance there's a life there's a reality oh God that burns within our hearts and our lives we're thankful Lord as we thank Lord upon your goodness as the Bible Lord we read that scripture out of Psalms 107 oh that men would Worship the Lord praise him for his goodness and his wonderful Works Lord we are thankful for what you have done in our lives and what you're doing Lord is your just Lord moving Upon Our Lives Lord to bring Lord growth in our lives a maturing Lord we thank you Lord for your mercy I want to say Lord I Thank you for your leadership in our lives I want to say thank you for every test and every trial Lord most importantly for your grace that's carried us through Lord thank you for Lord every moment and every time of Correction Lord thank you Father thank you Lord oh God for your mercy as David said oh give thanks unto the Lord over and over he would say for his mercy endureth forever Lord I know if there's one here this morning that does not have that that reality Lord maybe they've walked to a certain place but God may it move to the depths of their life may they just Lord just welcome you [Music] in Lord I wonder those 10 lepers you know they had to be able willing to look past their feelings and their thoughts even to be where they were at I don't know Lord I don't know if there were certain things maybe our arm was drawed up maybe a hand was drawn up maybe there were things Lord that maybe their ear because we know leprosy it just eats eats away it's a type of sin that God you spoke to him and said go show yourself unto the priest and as they went and did as you said they were healed now I don't know how many steps they took I don't know I don't know if it was 1 2 3 4 I don't know but all I know is they walked in obedience to what you said and your word went to work in their lives Lord we're standing here one out of 10 one out of a mil million to say Thank You Lord not just from our lips although Lord I believe you're worthy we say a lot of other words we say a lot of things Lord but we can never praise you enough Lord but Lord like your Prophet told us in the Hebrew series he said you know you can worship God right there in the store when you expr Express to somebody else isn't it a beautiful day the Lord has given us yes sir Lord so many opportunities to worship you so many opportunities to make a Joyful Noise that our lives Lord can declare your goodness your mercy your faithfulness Lord granted Lord I pray this morning if there's anything Lord oh God if it anything at all let it be that lord it's you that's been lifted up that God every heart and every life can see see themselves in you Lord even more clearly and to realize Lord we're not defeated the circumstance we're in right now or the situation or the trial that's not the defining of our life and who we are no more than sin was the definition or the defining in of who we were but God it's you that reveals our identity what I know sometimes as young people and sometimes middle-aged and older too I you still find it especially with social media and things all together people come under pressure Lord wanting to go on vacations like this one feeling they need to have this particular name brand or have this all these things pressures but God I pray if there's any place to find our identity it's in you it's in you you're the one who gives real value to our lives [Music] Lord grant it Lord this morning I pray we want to say thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus bless your name father amen you love him amen let's just stand go ahead Bri brother Brian lead us in a song Thank you for the cross Lord yes Lord thank you for the price you paid bearing all my sin and shame in love you came and gave amazing prise oh yes Lord for this love [Music] Lord thank you for the nail St wash me in your cleansing flow now all I know is your for forgiveness and embrace Worthy is the Lamb Seated on the [Music] throne we Crown you now with many crows you victory glorious high and lifted up high and lifted up oh Jesus Son of God The Treasure of Heaven crui wor Worthy is the [Music] I want you to think of that just presses on my heart in everything give thanks I didn't have time to relay and it just comes to me you remember the scripture says rejoice in the lord always I read that to you rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice these were not words that were just commands like well just rejoice but it's recognize where you draw from is not the situation or not what's taking place but joob where were you where were you joob going clear back from the foundation of the world see it always goes go back go back to the foundation that's why our Joyful Noise this is not a joy that the world has given to us no that's why that I I don't have to know the outcome of this or how this is going to work out or how this is I can just say Lord I Thank you for grace for this moment I thank you that you're in control Lord I Thank you Lord for your reminders Lord how you come Lord daily and remind me of your goodness Lord I Thank you Lord for leading me it's just step by step hallu cuz sometimes you're not you're not gloring in the end result you're giving thanks to him so it isn't something we're just ignoring like well I'm going to ignore this problem that's not what this is but it's saying God I don't know how you're going to work it out but I'm going to continue to give myself to you I know one thing in this situation I'm going to give myself to you I want my attitude I want my thoughts I don't want to be a complainer I don't want to talk about the situation and negative I you know sometimes we can talk so much about the negative I wonder if we had a meter around our house at times I wonder if it was a meter that could come up and talk about how much was negative and how much was positive I think it would scare us now you know that talking don't come out without there being negative thoughts you just begin to think about who he is to you Hall what he's done for you and to know like David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadth me beside the Still Waters he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he anointed my head with oil aren't you glad he anoints your head with oil yes I'm glad I'm glad he anoints my head with oil you know what that is to keep away the parasites I'm glad he anoints my hair my not my hair but my head was loyal you say Brother Sam way you're talking about I'm glad that when I don't have the thoughts that are necessary but God anoints with thoughts of Victory brother Bram said you just start to get on your mind you need healing in your body I'm the Lord that Health thee he said you just get on your mind that you need the Holy Ghost he said he's the one who gives the Holy Ghost just begin to think on him you're going through the midst of a test or a trial or a situation begin to think upon the goodness of God and say God I don't know how you're going to work this out there's a lot of avenues to be cleared out there's a lot of things but Lord you're more than enough in everything give thanks so this ain't something I'm working up this ain't something you're working up you understand it's something to where we say Lord I don't know how but I know there's things even right now friends that I look look at and I say God I don't know how but I know you're in control I say God have your way and in the meantime I just want to say thank you Lord I want to say it from here but I realize sometimes that I may not have all the words I may what what happens if I don't even have if I don't even have strength to say Thank You Lord my life my life can say thank you Satan might silence a voice but he can't silence the voice of your life there Comes A Joyful Noise that in the midst of it that's right yes sir so I say Worthy is the Lamb Worthy is the Lamb amen as they play

didn't know what it was so I took a benad drill and then I took uh some htis hyd cortisone and cream and I started and then but instead after Rel the uh the alleviation of the cream I started itching and then um as the days progressed by by Sunday it got too far so it started to spread it's in my body and so I got to go find out what this is so I went to the emergency room Sunday morning they administered medicine and then I said well it took away some alleviation well I said just take this and you'll be fine I said it's a contact of some sort they didn't know I don't know if they knew what it was or ever found out so over the months I've been taking shots I've been getting sick things been happen but then it would go and uh like one uh brother darl war was here my eye was infected and I prayed they then they prayed for me that night and then all they left me they went to Friday when I was sick this past Sunday it was Wednesday when I started and 5 days L I can't stop it I got to make sure this is not contagious I said it's just Conta you'll be fine it's not contagious so I decided to go service Sunday evening but at at the hospital do over over the times that I've been there I would leave and I look and I would see people the world's suffering it's crying he needs help and so I seen children at times I said and I wondered and I said where's my heart at so this last time I was leaving I saw this boy and his mother I wrested with us and I kept ring so I walked over I looked mother in the face I said listen I go to church we pray for the sick I said you want to pray for your boy I said her eyes illuminated said yes I looked at the boys in this delirium going in and out I Lay My Hands On I say a simple prayer said God help him just alleviate whatever is bothering him I said he's in and out he said I don't know what's going on but God please help him when I was leaving I spun to my left and there was a man he looked like big Burly fell like 6 foot 250 pounds and in his face had looked at while he was pleading for help and I thought I said I thought I didn't know whether to perceive that to be selfish or maybe that he would want prayer too he I believe he heard it and I hope that he took that God don't forget me but when I saw him I said look massive gu said I fell I left I lo I walked out I said Lord please be with him as well and the people are suffering they're and they have more faith than I give them credit for they're willing to reach out they need everything all resources that the devil does to to us God has resources to with medicine to doctor through science through prayer faith and we need everything that we can must that God has put in our Arsenal to share with others and so I thought when I left I said well I miss service but then I said wait a minute you can archive it how do you know that God didn't bring you here for that reason for that boy so we just want to take a chance we don't miss opportunities that God presents us that we can reach out to someone who may be suffering that we may consider ourselves and put ourselves in that position and that's what Christ did and we want to be the same thing as Sam was preaching he said those things as said they were just highlighting what I was going through what I want to seen I said let's not be forgetful that God has reached out to us and the Bible also says how do you know that you're not the hand of Mercy to that the god of hand of Mercy to that person who's in need so I want to thank God for what he's done for me and that the battles and trials may come but God's still on our side and I'm grateful [Applause] sir Lord once again for your mercy thank you Father for God the testimony Lord father I reminded even Lord as that testimony was being given and thought about Lord and brother brandham was laying there on the highway the condition Lord that he was in after that the drunk driver Lord had hit them and he asked about the condition of sister mey and he said Billy put my hand on her and he began to pray for her in that moment Lord to me I believe to all of us these are not just testimonies or stories that we hear but it speaks to us Lord and sometimes Lord in the midst of discouragement in the midst of moments of Despair those are some of the greatest moments that we can be used of you Lord mountaintops are not the only times you move you move in The [Music] Valleys you provve that Lord over and over again in our lives and in through the scripture that you're god of the valley too Lord may you just go with us be with each one
