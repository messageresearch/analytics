that are out and we want to just remember each and every one in prayer just knowing that there's many different needs and others are traveling some will also be traveling here this coming week i ask you just to be in prayer for a mom and myself willing to leave out early in the morning just to go to west virginia to be at the funeral my mom many probably know about it maybe you don't but my mom just uh one of our another one of our aunts just went home to be with the lord and that's really almost been within a month of each other my mom has lost two sisters been very close and my aunt marcella she just went home to be with the lord she just tired and you know she just was um she was ready to go and some of you probably a number of you remember her coming here at different times and uh so you know we just thank god walking in all the light that she knew and so we thank god for that and i tell you you probably never meet another person who's loved the lord she really loved the lord just loved to talk about the things of god and so just ask you to keep us in prayer lord willing we'll just going down to that tomorrow and then i'm going to come right back also from as far as everything stands right now lord willing brother alexander mcgoulas will be here on sunday that was planned before everything else started to take place last week as well because i was scheduled to be down with brother ray erickson since the first part of this month or november or whenever um so we'll just ask you just to be in prayer for that as well we certainly appreciate brother alexander coming and my goodness brother brother nathan my goodness sunday service was just tremendous oh my goodness it was just tremendous i i just was so enjoying it myself and i said i wish i was there because it's not the same i've i've had the stream before it's it's just not the same you know brother brown tells us when we gather together and we know that to be the true it's more of the godhead bodily among us and say how did you act in your living room well i act in my living room just like i act here i don't act any different at home uh you know but it just was so good and just such a rich word for this hour so encouraging amen so strengthening in our lives and i just so appreciate uh brother nathan coming there uh without myself not knowing exactly the direction of different things to go i thought i better go ahead and get on this and and get brother nathan here and i appreciate those of you how you stood here even last thursday and brother richard with gomez they had to just really as i called them and asked them at that point in time if they'll just take and do a prayer meeting at that time and so they did and i appreciate that and i know different ones as they were able to be here we're here and uh there's certainly one thing that we can never do too much of and that's pray friends say we might sing too much we might read too much we can do a lot of things too much but we can never pray too much and so we we just always want to to be in prayer um i think that's i think that's pretty much it of what i wanted to share with you i i really am i want you to pray for me because i was very torn about whether to even uh go this weekend i just kept on moving back and forth and uh just just praying about it because i wanted to be here and there's things that even last week i was ready to bring to the church and so but god knows everything in god's time and we just need to hear from him so everybody doing okay okay all right well let's just let's turn in the word of god if we can thank the musicians i want to also thank the lord for just touching paul and you know there's a lot of different things that as you if something that you i don't want to give this too much time but as you if you have a question about something at any time on whether to come or not to come you can always call the deacons or myself i know there's a lot of different guidelines and some new things that's even today has even been further altered of some things that they're further learning so if you have any question at all you can always call the deacons or or myself and you've done very well with that i can tell you that as a congregation whether it's been a text or a call or someone's asked me about the samuel what about this and we've gone according to everything we know at that time that there's been more things that they've updated i i'm glad they're coming to more of an understanding on things uh you know because everything that's come about was is definitely new and and i can always respect where people are a person could say hey we got this wrong here but this is i can always respect that because you know why we're all human all of us and so i can always really appreciate that so let's just keep also one another in prayer and uh let's as we look into the word of the lord here tonight as we have our bibles open maybe we just bow our hearts in just in a word of prayer heavenly father lord it's just so good to be here tonight lord i am just so thankful lord whether i was a speaker or just a common just to set and pull on the word of god on the gift of god to lord to receive from you and just to be here lord with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and i know there's some lord tonight that they would love to be here lord but for certain measures and certain things that lord they're looking at and lord being precautious or different things lord i pray that god that you'll just richly minister to them those that are are sick lord i pray that you'll touch them lord as we thank you god for touching paul's body lord we thank you for lord your hand of mercy that's been on us as an assembly lord we love you and we thank you lord i don't know what i would do we don't know what we would do without you lord for it's your leadership that's so precious in this hour father we love you and we thank you lord we ask that you'll just come and be the speaker of the word now lord just help me to step aside and may you come down lord anoint that gift you've placed in my life and you just use it lord just take the words those things that you've laid on my heart you know how lord to unfold it it's your mind lord that you've sat lord upon my heart so i just ask that the mind of christ would have the right of way here this evening we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen luke chapter 6 and verse 46 and just read a few verses of scripture before we're being seated and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say now this word lord lord is his master is his ruler he that is has the chief of my life so why call you me lord lord and do not the things which i say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and do with them i will show you to whom he is like he's like a man which built a house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock when the floods the flood arose the stream be beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built and house upon the earth against which the stream did vehement did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just speak here just a few moments tonight just meditating on thoughts that when we were looking at before on that thought of unaltered and i just thinking of this pondering this it's just just inspiring to my heart upon this thought is like what i'd like to speak from that is being changed by the unchanging god we we look here in the scriptures and we know that james would pick up this very thought as well in that we want to be doers of the word and not just hearers only james would write about how a hearer is just someone who is like beholding themselves in a mirror but then they walk away and they forget about what they saw in the mirror and the mirror was actually reflecting or showing things that needed to be attended to and taken heed to and we realized in our own life and i just say this and lord willing will come to it a little later in the service god has not entrusted that you or i we are the ones who change our own lives it's god who brings about change in our life the only thing that god asked of you and i is where we can stand in his presence and really take account of when the word is dealing with our life and then open and surrender our life and yield to him and say lord change me lord is to be very open with god because god's being very open with us you know the bible says faithful are the wounds of a friend and how that you know that deceptive are those secret kisses of another we want in god we can always count that god is always going to be up front with us because the bible would tell us in another place in the communion chapter there in first corinthians 11 of how that that if that in our lives that god will come and deal with our life lest we be condemned with the world god's desire every time that he brings any form of correction or admonition or anything in our life is that our life there would be a further separation from the things of the world and that our lives would be yielded to him because we are put here for a purpose to serve him and to display his glory in every part of our life this as god would call us in this hour it's it's something us as the lord jesus would say to those who would say lord lord and yet he's not really the ruler or the master of their life we do not want to be people even in this hour in this time where we're just simply acknowledging the word or agreeing with the word simply because we know it's the scripture or we know it's the message but we want the word to change our lives because that's why this word has come to change us brother braham tells us in the time of martin luther brother ram said with the explosion of truth that was present upon the earth in that hour he said they had such an explosion of truth that it just could have sent the world and everything right into emotion right into a real motion where hearts were being so transformed and changed but there were many that as brother baby says were only hearing the word in a manner to debate it they were not hearing the word and this is how he says it that it might have a practical outworking in their life if there's one thing that we want to see we want to see this word having an effect in our life because we know that the word has within it transforming power that has that that has the ability to transform us and change us and so when we when we look here in the scripture we find that as it comes down to in our life and i want to just kind of lay a little precursor in looking at it like this that there must be a right foundation in our life a solid foundation in order to build upon because you can't build upon a wrong foundation there's got to be just like when they go to build a house jesus is speaking of this here to where you don't just go build on the ground as you see it if you hire a contractor they're going to dig down to a certain place based on the dynamics of the of the land and water and everything else but there has to be a foundation no matter how well a house looks up here if something's wrong with the foundation the rest of that house it'll never stand there'll be problems there'll be everything else that's why that in many times we are looking sometimes at what we see out here on the surface and it's not the surface that needs to be dealt with it's coming back to the right foundation and to recognize that anything that comes about should be tied in directly and under the influence of the right foundation so brother branham would take this and brother brown would speak about in this foundation because a foundation is so important of things in the natural as well as things in the spiritual and to think he says bill abraham says i'm believing that the day that we're living now the most essential thing that i could think of a minister speaking is to get the people back to the general principles of the gospel how many believe that that's the message of the hour the message of the hour is not mysteries the message of the hour is that reflection from the throne of almighty god that brings the church back to that foundation as a matter of fact this message that god has given to you and i it is a message to where that the holy spirit has come and has built the church under the very holy spirit the power of god has built this church into a dwelling place of god himself it's been the word it's the principles of the word because creeds can never produce this dogmas can never produce this but it's kind of come back he said to a place for if you're not built upon the right foundation it's no good what's the use of building upon a foundation that's already been condemned he said what would the use of trying to paper and paint an old building that the government had condemned that's what many people are trying to do today by reforming trying to reform the gospel is not uh a reformation but the gospel comes to bring transformation in our life so it's not a reforming it's a transforming even working in our lives as believers on the foundation of our life it's not god reforming us or calling us to reform ourselves it's god working to transform our lives into his very image now i want you to notice this he says all these other things would be just a wasting time i'm going to start a new page here i'm going to try to do a little bit better than than i've done here brother brown said it's even foolish to try you're wasting your time and he says you've got to start back to the foundation you've got to build a new place not patch up the old one build a brand new one you've got to come back and start right that's the reason you see so many faulty mistakes so many people in different people who profess christianity he said you are only the you are the only bible that many people will ever read you christians your life is the only bible that men a lot of men and women will ever read just the way you act and do so christians are supposed to be a living example of what christ is and if christ is in the human heart then he will certainly live his own life for christ is in you and the spirit of christ be in you then you become a new creature so we talk about a foundation there is no other foundation that faith can really rest on than the word of god we could go through and we have in times past with different subjects a litany of scriptures that speak and express where god is the inspiration of god would strike all of those down through time david writing many places in the psalms of the assurity that is in the word of god that the word of god is established forever if how that god's word it cannot fail whatever's gone out of his mouth he's going to back it up and perform it so yeah that's something we it's god that you and i it's one thing to look at that and say that is tremendous and you must have that faith to even present yourself before god but then to even rest within the assurance that he brings in our life by the holy spirit which is the word of god the holy spirit is not something separate from the word of god but the holy spirit is christ himself is the word of god it is the writings of the word inside of you you know it's not something that's different but it's a word experience that ties us into the word to where our lives are regulated and lived by the word of god and so this is why that here in isaiah it would write it would read like this in isaiah 40 verse 6 the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand forever hallelujah glory be to god we're talking about standing in this day when paul said having done all to stand stand therefore and the only way that we can stand is to have the living god the word of god standing in our lives are you with me oh my i just i i was going i'm just going to move from running some scripture but i'm just going to stay here tonight because we want to go we won't get nowhere first corinthians 3 10 according to the notice what paul says according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth their own for other foundation can no man lay than that that is laid which is jesus christ i'll say it like this the foundation of every life of every believer is the revelation of jesus christ to you dwelling in you amen and that's personal that's a foundation that's an anchor remember paul would speak of it as in hebrews 6 as that assurance we have as an anchor that enters into within the veil and we know what an anchor does an anchor is there to keep you resting solid in one place because waves are going to come storms are going to come tests are going to come trials are going to come disappointments are going to come mistakes are going to come but there must be an anchor that when everything is said and done the tossing and so forth but there is an anchor as it writes again in the scripture there is a rock that you're founded upon it in other words the question becomes very real and very clear that in that manner that are are you founded upon the rock are you anchored in jesus christ you see satan will always come to task brother rem tells us this and i think it's very very good in the message the contest we are made up in three parts body spirit and soul and the new birth is that which pertains to the soul the holy spirit can fall remember we went through that on the courts up here the holy spirit can fall upon the spirit and upon the flesh and even where a person could enjoy brother graham said can be in the outer court and enjoy the word of god why that and it looks good wow i see that wow that looks good but you see there's something that to a believer that it's not just enough to just say wow i like that wow i see that oh yeah this goes together here this goes together there it's something about it as they come near the presence of god for it's the holy spirit drawing them the desire becomes for the living god because there's only one thing that can satisfy that in a heart and that is god himself who put that thirst on the inside it's god alone that makes a man or a woman a son and daughter of god anchored in the promise no matter what test comes no matter what a hell could break around around them but there is an anchor in their life they are the same they are the same just as he is the same yesterday today and forever what is it they have an experience a foundation that identifies that they are connected with him who is faithful the same yesterday today and forever i'm not talking about if you get discouraged we all face discouragement at times we all can get down but i'm talking about a life that even in the midst of things that's taking place around it's a life that is remaining steadfast in the things of almighty god a life that is founded upon the rock it's got a foundation when storms come against it rain comes against it when temptations are sail there is an anchor on the inside you're not going to find that man or woman running around back in the world and saying well you know if this hadn't happened if so-and-so hadn't done this to me if that you know what it comes down to is they never went deep enough in jesus i'm telling you friends this is an hour we've got to be straight i've had to be straight many times in that back office there straight right here at this pulpit at times it's a time that reality is it's time where we're looking at things there's got to be a life that no matter of the tests and trials of life you can still look at that person and say that's a christian no matter it's not always a sunny day it's not always a a real happy day but down inside of their soul there is joy i'm talking about a foundation a foundation that cannot be shaken a foundation that's firm that that should just give us a rejoicing within our heart because this foundation that we are we are anchored to is jesus christ amen this word this word you know there's no way without without the word of god you see for us to come into the places that we have now that we are now dwelling in in christ god has laid all of this out within his word and when paul could say that i have laid the foundation where no other man can lay it was that revelation of jesus christ look when paul went up to the upper coast of ephesus when he went up there they were all you know john's disciples baptizing and john and all of those things they were right now listen to me now they were right in that place but notice there was a desire within their life to know more of god you say how can that be because god sent them the answer that they were craving for and paul came along to him and he began to talk to him and he realized wait a minute he said he said what what have you been baptized unto what and they said unto john's baptism and john apollo at that moment could recognize that they had not there had not been ministered unto them that the atonement the lord jesus christ being the paschal lamb it's already been offered up and now the holy ghost has come back to the church of the living god they they did not know that junction of time but you see this is why god sent his word because the holy ghost will travel with the word because it takes the spirit of god to give the word and so then what happens it's the holy spirit coming with the word to deliver the word and bring an experience where a life is founded upon the right foundation when paul walked away from them in ephesus after they themselves had been filled with the holy ghost baptized in the name of jesus christ paul never had to worry about him why they were founded on a true foundation this is why when paul when he could stand there or not paul but peter when peter could speak of how you know peter was speaking the revelation of jesus christ in the house of cornelius having the keys here here turning that to the gentiles notice when that would take place the holy ghost falls on them first then they are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you see it shows that the holy spirit will always work in accordance with his word to bring his word to pass it always works on that right foundation and this is why i just say it to you here tonight the foundation where we have been placed as believers in this hour we have not been placed upon the ideas of a man let me just say some things pretty straight this message is not the ideas of william branham are you with me nor does god need anybody coming in and trying to sort out and tell us what is and what is it that's plain and straight but we have been established brother brown himself would say that there is nothing that should be there in the church because then you know that's outside of that that foundation of god's word it's the complete program of his church as he would lay that down so this message that god has sent to you and i brother and sister i can tell you just like this and i'll say this i say it by the grace of god i i don't have to quote i could preach this message from the bible well brother samuel what do you i do because i'm inspired and i'm not ashamed to quote what has been said by the messenger are you with me i i'm not ashamed of that i'm given to this word how you've experienced it even as i've experienced it standing right here and reading because this message is not the thoughts of a man i'm telling you friends it's deadly when people want to start messing around and trying to take out and say this was brother branham slots it's deadly because you have to answer the question where does that stop are you with me it's like a disease that gets started preach brother samuel i think i will this is a right foundation we've been placed on is jesus christ this message has exalted jesus christ and brought back that revelation in the church to where when people see you and i they're not seeing brother branham they see jesus christ braham wanted nothing to do with anything like that this is why in ephesians chapter 2 when paul would write of it like this speaking of this foundation and let us know therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone see we're part of that foundation i want you just to catch this just for a moment we are part of that original foundation we were always a part of that original foundation that foundation is the word himself are you with me now remember the word itself it sets it rests brother ben talks about that masterpiece there resting on the pedestal of those four steps the four patriarchs you know faith of love and of grace and perfection it rests the whole work of god rest upon faith love grace and perfection and all of those four are are a part of whom god is and his working in our life that there the very image that comes forth is that of the word that is spoken by the prophets god builds his body is everybody with me so we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone so right now in this time this there was a promise given to the philadelphian age is that right i will make a pillar in the temple of my god is that right god also had said in that time that there is an open door i have set before thee that open door was a return to the original bible way of where god would bring a real experience into the lives of the people it was a missionary age but then through that it would further catapult on down into the age we're living in i it all comes down to just saying it like this god was even announcing that the return to the original way the real fullness of pentecost god had already begun to open and it would come forth in this last day we're not just here under a portion it's the fullness of god among us that's the revealing of the son of man i say it like this we are part as brother branham would say it we are part of that same structure in other words the same experience that peter had we have see peter peter those there starting out before the church ages ever began they were there in the fullness of pentecost is that right but you see then notice god promised i will restore not back to the ephesian age she was already a fallen woman but back to that of pentecost wherein christ himself was veiled in his fullness in a bright body god said i'll restore oh that's beautiful in it we could really dwell on that a lot i will do this i will do this thing notice in whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the scripture see this is where this foundation let me just say this to you before i read this quote to you the bible says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so before adam stardust molecule before it before at all the lamb was slain brother brown would say it like this in lamb's book of life when he wrote his name he wrote yours at the same time that's fitting as it is within genesis but to see that within that within this time as peter would write about he was the lamb who was for ordained who was and he ties it back in slain to be to be slain for ordained to be the lamb of god for you and i but he was manifested for us you see it wasn't just good enough that it was for ordained but it had to become manifest that's the same way in our life it's we it's not just talking about foreign nation thank god for foreign nation thank god for predestination but it takes the holy ghost to come down and inspire that in the heart to recognize and begins to deal with the life that yes there i am not the son of james and pat browning where it begins to deal with your life and call you back into what god had for ordained you to be that's not a work of a man or a church that's a work of almighty god what is it it's based on that foundation stone before there was adam stardust a molecule before the devil wherever was before the devil was ever the devil the foundation was already settled that's why when the uprising happened there in the church where some got a hold of things and started teaching that the resurrection was passed aminos and felidas remember there were many whose faith was made a shipwreck maybe high meanness of elitism you know in their day they would have made youtube videos too but you see what it is many people's faith were shipwrecked but here's what he said the foundation of god standeth assured the lord knoweth them that are his hallelujah that's kind of that's the sure foundation that we are built upon resting upon and dwells within our life this is why it begs the question being answered are you part of that true foundation has it been revealed and made alive to you you see because when it is then brother baby says in god's provided place of worship you're sealed in there you're beneath the blood you don't go out no more then what are you you're god's son in god's family sealed in by the holy spirit the devil couldn't get you if he had to for you are dead your old husband part is dead and you are buried and your life is hid in god through christ sealed by the holy ghost how's it going to get to you how's it going to get out you're there glory he said now he says now i'm just going to leave that for a few moments but he says then a new creation now think about it we don't need a building upon the old foundation brother said we need a new foundation is that right we we can't build upon that first birth because it's shaky sand a matter of fact it's under judgment already is that right but he says then a new creation not to a denomination but to the word you're a creation listen to these words you're a creation of the word you're not a creation of the church you are a creation of the word hallelujah because listen this now the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be sons and daughters of god the foundation stone was already laid in you what was that foundation's tone that predestinated to be a son and daughter of almighty god but once he comes he's the one that where the old foundation passes away all things are passed away and behold all things become new there now is a true foundation in your life a foundation that is not man-made but it's a foundation that comes clear back from the mind of god from eternity that foundation stone is laying in your life then with a foundation stone in your life what can be done it can build word on top of a word on top a word on top a word experience on top of experience growing into the full stature of jesus christ oh my just as when he came brother brown would go on in this quote and he said just as he came when he came let me just let me just go ahead and read it here because it just saved i don't have to paraphrase it upon this stone continuation upon this stone upon stone in each aid to vindicate that word that's coming up just exactly as jesus did in his age which is the capstone of it all in him laid every age and jesus was moses and jesus was david and jesus was the prophets is that right they all spoke of him when he walked on the road to emmaus is that right it was revealing himself in the scriptures oh my oh my we just got to go here he said look at joseph sold for almost 30 pieces of silver thrown in supposed to be dead taken out went to the right hand of pharaoh joseph was in jesus when he come he was the fullness of the kings the prophets that god had bodily rested in him he come to redeem listen to this now he come to redeem out of there a bride a masterpiece a masterpiece that says to satan when satan says days of miracles has passed there's no such a thing as these things you're talking about this masterpiece says talking about the bride get thee behind me satan see it's a masterpiece standing and guarding the foundation stone in your life that of jesus christ now just as he when he came he was the keystone to the old testament saints that then rapture resurrection followed likewise in the hour that we are living in he is not coming as as just a cornerstone but he is the capstone that that he now has become the capstone you see the work all the way through now he comes remember what the capping is the capping is declaring a finished time right the scripture said in this hour this is the finishing of the mystery of god it's declaring a finishing hour it's an hour of finishing touches it's an hour of the finish and he who was who is the author is also the finisher is that right he's here to finish to perform all that he said that he would do now when we look at that to know he was the reflection of all that was spoken of the prophets and the psalms and so forth so now inside of his bride body it is to be a reflection of him who is the bridegroom a reflection of this word remember what we read here earlier that that a christian is to be a reflection in their actions in every part of their life is to reflect almighty god i want you to think of this first corinthians 3 10 let me go back to this where we read and paul said according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation in another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he built their own depaul was not tooting his own horn but he knew his position are you with me and he knew being a wise master builder that it was not his wisdom it was the wisdom of god it was the same wisdom of god that would cause the earth to settle right here the same wisdom of god as it speaks in proverbs where all of these things were divided out it was the wisdom of god remember the wisdom of god it's so far above that of man but yet it's so simple and paul is speaking of the wisdom remember what what a wise is to be filled with oil so paul is saying i this is under the orchestration of the holy ghost right where israel selected another king and it took god from leading the camp and god bring preeminent in the camp now paul could say as a wise master builder where jesus christ is the is the foundation that has been laid the holy spirit has has placed himself back into his church by his word oh glory be to god and him and the church is in him now notice this and i want you i want to draw from this this last part let every man take heed how he builds their own for other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid which is jesus christ now if a man built upon this foundation gold silver precious stone wood haste double every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is you you realize that everything going back to the old testament everything that came into the camp after a spoil some cities they went in god said burn everything and don't take nothing is that right then there's other times where things could come back in the camp but it had to come through the fire because the fire was a purifier is that right and see this is the example that the holy spirit gives into our life that whatever you're adding into your life make sure it passes through the fire if it can't pass through the fire then we don't want it added to our life because it only is going to slow us down that's why paul could say lay aside every sin that does so easily set you lay aside every way it calls for then as the foundation stone is in our life to take heed to the material that's built in our life and see the material is god provides the material we don't have to go look it up we don't have to say does menards have it there's no no this is not earthly material see what's described gold silver precious thing wood hay stubble all these different things that you could look at and say my some of these things are fine and yet some of these things you might think well i don't know i don't think too much about it but when it all comes down to it every man's work will be tried by fire this is why the scripture could say that we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ not the white throne judgment but the judgment seat of christ and we will give an account don't let that scare you but let us take real inventory and say god what's being built in my life you see if any man's work listen this verse 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire now i'm not presenting to you anything that the scripture doesn't already present but i'm saying to you that for our lives as believers brother branham lays down we see it in the scripture that those there were people who were living for the first coming they were looking for those scriptures they were looking brother brahm takes us over in the message how can overcome and he's dealing with the election those who got up on easter morning with him and then he brings it into that the overcomers and and those who go in the rapture are those who are living for his coming loving his appearing loving is coming we're in the coming of the lord amen because before the physical coming you have to come into his fullness to draw a bride out and unite us for that time so i say it in this manner what would it be to stand there on that day and you say well brother samuel man at least i made it but there should be something more in your heart to say god upon this foundation i want to see added to my life things that glorify the foundation things that exalt this foundation in my life lord i don't want to add oh my you know god's done such a work in my life and then go become busied with the things of the world it'll never it'll never stand there on that day and you'll stand there in that place where you could have done so many other things you know you won't stand there through eternity and oh i wish i would have done that wish i but no no but to think there even in that moment we want to stand there in that place and i'm not even looking forward to that time this is my desire right now i want to be in step with him i want things added that please him and sometimes in order for things to be added well you know how it is sometimes we're sometimes we're not too good at this you buy another sweater but where's this water gonna go if you don't throw out another one right oh man these shirts five my goodness five for ten dollars well pretty soon there ain't no room in the closet oh we just put them in the basement hang them up down there and everybody's gonna just keep going keeps going keeps going in order to really add there's got to be some taken away and see the holy spirit if you just give me just a few more moments the holy spirit is such a gentleman he'll never come and just rip things out of our life but he'll deal with our hearts the bible said in hebrews 4 12 that the word of god is quick it's alive sharper than 82 edge of sword it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart this is why paul said let every man take heed how he buildeth their own because every one of us man and woman has decisions to what material that we bring in our life god doesn't decide that for us we have that choice just like when the word is coming forth we have a choice when we're looking at the word and we can look at the word and say my that was good that was wonderful or we coming or we can see where the word will show up our weaknesses it'll show up our shortcomings that's what we come to the house of god for the bible tells us that it's now now is the time that judgment must begin in the house of god we don't come here to know or we know our strong points but we come here that there's weaknesses that the parts were that are weak that it might be made known by god but god doesn't come down and pick on us and point things out but god he shows his word and you and i are standing there looking into that word and when you're really looking into the word the word will show things also in our life even in this even listen even as the services you can look and say oh my what a tremendous service but listen friends you can still look into the word of god and you can say lord make me more like you i'm gonna have just a few more moments let me just try to tie this little little thought up as the foundation and i think this should be something that we it should be the uh the mission statement if it were of our lives as the foundation as he is the foundation he should be the basis for all things done in the church in our lives and in our home he should be the basis if there's something being done that cannot glorify him then it's things we have to say lord this is taking away rather than adding two you see anything that comes that takes away from his presence and glory and victory in your life is not really adding it doesn't matter what it looks like out there but anything that comes that takes away from that it's taking away from that reflection of his own life inside of you this is why when when the bible speaks of abraham abraham met the king of that city melchizedek and from that time on he looked for that city melchizedek was king and priest of salem is that right brother branham picks that up in the message shalom and types that in to christ being put out of the church he said notice he said he was put out of jerusalem christ put out of the church but to pick up from that moment on abraham looked for that city he knew that cities around here somewhere because i had a visitation and here's how the bible describes that city he wanted a city he was seeking after a city that had foundations he wanted things what he was seeking after were things that were of principle things that were of standard look what it did for abraham's life you see abraham's sojourning after this place of meeting melchizedek look where it comes to change of the body the promised son arrives all because of that meaning that meaning gave him a purpose in his life abraham says once you meet him like that he says then you've got a purpose for coming to church you've got a purpose then for everything you do it's not just showing up to a service you've got a purpose you're on a mission why because it is the same spirit of god that has drawn you that is now working mightily in you see we're a reflection of that city this is why paul would write in this way romans 12 1 i'm i'm coming down i'm coming down i beseech you brethren by the mercies of god that ye do what everybody else asleep that you do what present see just as the sacrament god didn't come down when the worshiper came or the high prayer or the priest came and the priest had the sacrifice they had received the sacrifice you know if paul had come and paul had sinned and there was things he had to offer a sacrifice or or maybe it was just a peace offering or a thanksgiving offering and was not a sin offering but the only way that offering could be accepted by god it had to be placed on the altar of god in the right order god didn't come down and just take it out of their hands this is what paul is speaking to our lives we we are not it's not a separate offering but now it's the offering of our own lives oh man that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service oh brother samuel you just you just lost me right there if you're under the blood god sees you as a just person god called job a just man he wasn't looking at the man he was looking at the sacrifice that job offered you with me when the bible says a just man joseph was a just man simeon was a just man it wasn't that those men not that they were bad men but that just that is recorded in scripture it speaks of their sacrifice hallelujah we're not just in our own south we are just by a just god coming by his righteousness into our lives and bringing us under the blood so it prays it gives us we're not presenting our own works we're presenting our lives even in that place to say lord change me keep changing me notice added to this here brother brown would say it like this when he would read this text he said this is notice he said the conjunction and be not conformed to this world notice it's calling us to present ourselves right holy separated acceptable unto god and be not conformed to the world under the pressures the scrutiny there's pressures that we face in this age every age just face pressures right when brother brown talks about the pressures of this last day is soft easy living it's a pressure look how the compounding of things in this hour were things that itself how things have come about in such a way you don't have to wait forever for an answer how do i fix this hose on on the on on the sink there it comes pray i might have to wait a while when i pray you see the conditions of this age would try to affect us that's why we have to be careful how what we are building upon our foundation see just like even as parents i know i don't have all the parents here but as parents remember there are principles a city that have foundation there are principles that are laid in with the children the bible said teach them and bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the lord whatsoever you teach them now not just about what you say about what you do if it's convenient not to come to church they will carry on the same pattern are you hearing me now you see we must build upon that right foundation this is why there's things that should be no question in our life who is first we can say that god is first but our actions can speak otherwise it's okay to say i'll show me because this is god he'll come down and he'll change us are you with me many times we we stop shorting the place and we're looking at things and we say oh yeah man i made a mistake there oh yeah oh i failed there but remember confession is agreeing with what the word has said about it under the same nature of the word not just agreeing with the hell man oh yeah yeah no no no but confession is to say the same thing the word has said at the same nature of it in other words david said i hate that which thou hatest oh god that we're standing with the word though it smote us but then we can stand there and say god forgive me and let that area of my life be built let a testimony be built in that area of my life but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of almighty god brother bryan would say it like this he says he takes that scripture and he says now he says we've been saved as we are we've been filled with the holy spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of god by transformation of god's spirit by his word so you catch it's god it's his spirit transforming us it's him bringing change into our lives it's his presence that changes even our objectives you see i told you i was going to close and i am just so much that we could just upon my heart to say sometimes let me just say this in closing here i said that before but i really am you remember what we referred to in daniel where daniel he went when the commandment was given nobody's to ask any petition of any other source except the king the bible says daniels we went through that in a few services daniel he opened his windows as he always did it wasn't daniel wasn't going to do daniel wasn't doing anything different daniel wasn't opening his window so i'm going to defy this no the bible says he went and prayed as he had done a four time this is where things really narrowed down with really the thought as the holy spirit just really just just speaking to my heart here daniel he went about and there were things unaltered that he did his prayer life was unaltered no doubt it was challenged it was challenged now there's things that daniel he was unaltered he continued on i want to bring it down to our lives because in our lives we recognize that we are being changed by an unchanging god is him he's immutable in his nature he's immutable in his way in other words he doesn't change he comes to change us and transform our lives but these are things where we have to watch very carefully peter would say it like this gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you as holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for i am holy you see there's things that you can look at and even sometimes the process of time and life you go through certain things as we said before with the pressures of the age and the pressures of the hour i wonder how many of us could say lord i need i need i need more patience it's not the work has not been altered in our life but there's other things from the pressures of life that worked on us to alter us not as pressures of life can work on you when you say as far as the foundation stone you're still a believer i'm talking about with the work of god in your life where you know your life is under the blood but remember there's things that can come into your life that can alter the ways you think and the way you go about things this is why paul said let no root of bitterness dwell in you cast out all malice showing there are things that can come into a life not in your soul when you've been sealed are you hearing me not in your soul but in your spirit and that's where you have to look we all all of us are testing and trial no matter what season of life no matter what the things that's all around us but it comes into a place to where we have to have in our own lives evaluating god has there been things in my life that's been altered that's not allowing the reflection of the foundation stone to reflect out and if there is let the fire of god right now come and consume that i just say lord consume it lord consume me lord god our god is a consuming fire consume that see this is where paul could say and i i think this is so fitting for the time that we're in i've closed up everything i have here forgetting those things which are behind me we're coming into a new year rod terry's tomorrow night strikes 12 it's a new year right there's a lot of things that even as brother branham will stand and you hear it you hear brother branham will approach it in message after message and you can look and brother brown would ask god forgive me for the mistakes and failures of this past year because you can't go anywhere still holding the mistakes and failures of the previous year well brother samuel why would i have mistakes and failures well a person that doesn't do nothing doesn't make no mistakes but it's a person who's doing something who makes mistakes right god knows that this is how he could even speak to joshua as i was with moses so will i be with thee but in order to forget those things paul was letting it be known to us as believers we have an access to the blood of jesus christ and when we stand and confess our confessing lord what the word is showing up in my life i want to be changed lord i want to be changed and god isn't god isn't coming to where oh brother samuel i'll be this person i'll never have a bad thought i'll never make that's not what it is it's god coming to bring a change in our life to where more of us is gone and he has as brother brown describes it in the message contest that he would have more preeminence in our life in other words there's decisions every one of us have made at times and we'd want to look back and say phew wish i'd had some more input on that one right wish i'd thought that one through a little bit more but preeminence more of his preeminence in our life then it's more of his influence and we're looking more to him through the things that we've learned his grace has brought us through for all things work together for the good and we can look at that and forget those things that are behind us and reach reach for the things before see paul was paul was letting him know the power of the blood of jesus christ to loosen that god doesn't hold anything over our head but the gospel comes it brings reflection on our life evaluation where there's things that you and i we want to be men and women in this hour that can stand and we want the word preached to us we want to we want that word to come down and if there's things in our life that's not right on we want the word to deal with that life because when it's all said and done that's what's going to matter when we stand there that day and if there's something that's that's out of line now listen god doesn't hold anything overhead and say guess guess no no here's the simplicity of it maybe i need to just walk off the platform but here's the scriptures and one lord willing maybe if the lord allows it to pick it up next week the background that brother braham takes is the background of the rapture one thing have i desired that thing will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord to be behold his beauty to inquire at his temple you catch those two words to behold means you're fixed on something you're fixed on him and what you're seeing causes you now to inquire of him oh what a privilege to be in jesus christ what a privilege to be in this foundation what a privilege it is that the holy spirit would deal with our hearts to mold us to shape us and to call to you and i and say look at this look at this and you say yes lord and by his transforming power he brings change in our life let's pray i wonder if as we go to the war lord in prayer if we just just every one of us if we just couldn't as we think about this new year coming in and i think about this thought tonight i wonder if we just couldn't each and every one of us just agree together and say oh god in this coming year let me be a better christian let me be a better soldier let me be a better witness brother adam would pray in one place of the message god in this coming year keep all envy and malice keep sickness from us keep these things from us heavenly father lord jesus as we look into your word how thankful we are lord for a true foundation thankful god by the grace of god we are a part of that foundation lord the holy spirit coming lord upon that that foundation stone lord that was placed in our life [Music] that lord our whole life would be based upon that experience of the revelation of jesus christ and upon that foundation there would be building growing as peter would write under inspiration add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge add to your knowledge patience and adding to lord oh god as we look to you tonight lord i pray that god throughout this building and we look in this coming year lord we we want to stand in this moment and should you tarry in coming services and lord allow the
