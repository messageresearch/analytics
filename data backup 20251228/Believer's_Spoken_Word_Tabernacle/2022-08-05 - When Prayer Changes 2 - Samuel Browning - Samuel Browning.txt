come in a very special way tonight once again lord we need you lord there's needs that are here and we need to hear from you tonight lord we just give ourselves to you lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you i'm going to invite you to the word of the lord in deuteronomy chapter 28 and someone say it's good to have each and every one of you good to have amen mr lily's parents brother matt his wife amen god bless you all is your wife here with you she's she's not here okay okay amen well god bless her and the family amen you have your family here with you it's good to it's good to be gathered together tonight isn't it amen and you know the thing of it is is that no matter what you are facing or what you have before you i want you to remember moses ran from all of egypt but when he got in the presence of god five minutes in his presence it unleashed a courage and a strength to turn around and walk off of that mountain and face everything that seems so insurmountable and that's the god we're serving here tonight he's the same god right here tonight no matter what you have before you he's the same god tonight all he needs is just a moment that's all he needs amen so as we look into the word and i just want to remind you this coming sunday the lord willing brother jack duff will be here ministering the word of the lord and so we're just looking forward to that as well i ask you just to keep that in prayer and let's go here and we're going to read it's a few verses of scripture here verses 1 and verse 2 and then i'm going to skip to verse 13 and 14. verse 1 it says and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god verse 13 and the lord shall make thee i want you to notice that word the lord shall make thee that word make is it it deals with the creative work of god the lord shall make thee the head and not the tale and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them may god bless you bless the reading of the word i would like to continue to speak on that thought we were looking at the last time on the midweek service on when prayer changes this has been a thought that going into when we started with prayer there back in january this particular thought has just been one of those parts of just waiting on on the leading of the lord of when to bring and when to move into this avenue of it and we know that when we're looking at this here in in deuteronomy chapter 28 it's very important that our placement and our position in christ is that which is given to us by god before the foundation of the world and that when we see the book of deuteronomy you see the book of joshua it was a type of what we could come to as believers in the word of god in this day that we're living in that there would be a positioning and a placement in christ in our life and to think when we see this here that there is no there is no way to come into position or authority outside of the word but it is the word that brings us into that place that brings us into that authority and brings us to that position that god has for our life so god was declaring here the power of the word that would move in the life of the believer and i i want you to keep this in mind that when we read here in the scriptures as god has said through moses if you keep my commandments and it's more than just keeping a letter because you know you can you can take the bible home with you and we know the bible is the is the mind of god in printed form but i want you to remember that it's more than just a letter we're talking about the person of jesus christ see when you recognize that the word itself is a person that is not just something that you hear at church it's not just something you're hearing or you're reading but you realize he is a person and that he comes to work his word in our life see god is a gentleman he won't do anything in our life without being invited to do it and god speaks his word by his presence then it comes to us to invite him as we say amen to the word of god we say so be it lord we are inviting god to come in and to fulfill his word in our life and it's not something we leave at church but it's what goes with us it's a living god it's a living presence that's right here with us each and every day of our life it's god who's working and bringing about change within our lives so it's the person of jesus christ and it lifts you in authority it gives you dominion and it places us as a son and daughter of god and i want you to think of this scripture here in first corinthians chapter 1 and verse 23 and which says we preach christ crucified and unto the jews a stumbling block and unto the greek's foolishness paul's letting him know that if christ is not crucified we have no access into authority and into a position we we are we are still just going about just by by a word that is given to us there's no authority we've not come into position but because christ has been crucified and that sacrifice has been accepted the holy ghost has come back upon the believer to bring us into christ and just as he has been exalted and seated on the throne in our lives christ becomes exalted in our lives so we preach christ crucified and unto the jews a stumbling block and unto the greek's foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things this is weak things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that aren't now this is not this is not our way of thinking remember god said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways are higher than your ways if it would have been up to us we would have never chose a couple in whom the woman was sterile and unable to receive seed but god already not then but before the foundation of the world all of these parts that were there with abraham and with sarah i wonder how many times that sarai we noticed sarah after her name changed after god did a work in her life but i wonder how many times before that that she could look at other women and say why can't i have a child she did not understand why do i have this weakness about my life why do i have this situation why is this me and sometimes let's just be real we can get into pity parties this was not this this in sarah's life was not the result of a choice by father mother or grandfather this was not the result of a choice that she had made this how she came into this earth and you and i would not have made that choice you and i would not have made a choice to have a man be known as a mighty man and take down the midianites who was known to be a coward by the name of gideon right you and i would never have chosen when you read in hebrews 11 you're not reading when we read the heroes of faith you're not reading about great big people in this earth you're reading about lives that came to a place in their life to know i am nothing and i cannot complete this task that god has called me to because god's word is a supernatural word spoken by a supernatural god that must be fulfilled by him so it's a life that is born of the supernatural and yielded to the supernatural that's the working of the person of christ it's not you and i that make ourselves anything god has chosen the weak things of the world he didn't say that he did not choose any that were mighty or noble but even those like moses who were mighty who were noble god had to bring him to a place to where they realized humanness is a failure human ability can never accomplish the purpose of god if i could just take on that tonight i'd love to preach on that for a while human ability will never satisfy the requirements of almighty god we cannot serve his purpose on human ability on what we do this is why it's more than just i do this i don't do this i do this i don't do that that's a letter but the person of jesus christ is a living person that goes with you right it's there that dwell it's him dwelling in our life that we seek to please we seek to yield our lives and to his working so here god lays all this out in verse 29 it comes down here's the conclusion of it that no flesh should glory in his presence moses i'm calling you to deliver a message again to talk talk well the bible said he was of a slow tongue right he didn't have a speech language pathologist to help him out there god put it that way you and i would have said there needs to be somebody who can speak if he's called to deliver a message but god didn't call him based on his human ability god called him because he was a chosen vessel of god hallelujah and faith that faith that was so inspired into his heart that god is faithful that worked in moses life to where there is no flesh that can glory in his presence but of him this is where it all comes down to but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom he is our wisdom we have no it's not no wisdom on our own he is our wisdom he is our righteousness because our righteousness alone is filthy rags is that right i'm talking about his life inside of us he is our righteousness he is our sanctification he is like the oil in the dove where the oil works from the inside out to keep it clean when stuff gets stuck on it there's an oil of power on the inside that works to the outside to help deliver us from this sticky one are you hearing me now and he is our redemption all of these parts this is who he is outside of him there is no redemption and redemption is being brought back to the rightful owner you didn't belong to the devil you belong to god are you with me you didn't belong to the devil and all of a sudden god come down and paid the price and now you're redeemed that's not redemption redemption is you come back to the rightful owner and that's what god came to do through jesus christ and that's why he sent the holy ghost to bring us back to that rightful position that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord now brother branham takes this up and i read from this quote the last time to you all the questions in answers 59 i'm just going to refer to some places and he's letting it be known that why and brother ban will keep moving into this of when israel came into canaan they come into the promised land there were wars that they had to fight there were battles but yet this land is where they belonged it was the rest that god had promised he would bring them to but they had battles they had things that had to be overcome things that they had to fight through is that right and brother brown would say it in this way he says you know he says egypt is the world they were called out of and the wilderness is where they were sanctified a called out church and canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit because they still had wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the holy spirit once now listen what are you doing what do you do in canaan is there resorts in canaan here's the spiritual resort and you just go to this resort you go behind this wall they'll bring you kool-aid and tea and everything else you want you just sit around there's no resorts in canaan but canaan is there we're battles there's temptations there's trials there's and and we're not immune from those things but here is in time of occupying what belongs to us is that right they were possessing their rights they were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights till they got into canaan canaan being a type of the holy ghost is that right i'm just laying these down purposely very slowly they didn't own anything in the wilderness but when they come into canaan they had rights and we've got rights when you receive the holy ghost you're in canaan you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for every promise that god has made not one promise is ever and ever will be handed to us but every promise there is going to be a fight and satan is always there to stand as an opposition against the promise of god he's always there to tell you why you're not worthy why it doesn't belong to you he's always standing there as an opposition you say what do i do listen to the voice of the one who made the promise that has brought you face to face with the promise and stand there and call that devil a liar you've got a god who has spoke to you and you can stand on that word that's fighting for your rights it's fighting for what belongs to you the holy ghost is not just handed it is a gift but you've got to fight you've got to press beyond your own unbelief you've got to press beyond your own doubt you've got to press beyond humanness it's oppressing i'll tell you what that's what really shows whether and what really matters to us is when we're really ready to fight for it is that right the rapture itself listen friends the rapture is a war brother brown says this in a certain sound he said oh god may we be prepared for the battle of the coming of the lord and he deals with that thought because all hell has been released every demon spirit has been released revelations 9 is that right there there were there was one who came down he he fell falling down the star that was falling howarth they're falling from heaven on lucifer he had the key to the bottomless pit and noticed those spirits those demon spirits coming up out of there and pervading throughout the earth oh my but i love how revelations 10 1 says and i saw another mighty angel blue devil and i saw another mighty angel [Applause] god he lost control his right in sync with his word hallelujah when something comes your way and stands before you it's not out of the oh what has happened to me no it's not what has happened to me but god is standing there god is in control and when opposition meets its way before you you can say here comes a testimony right now here comes a testimony somebody go ahead and get me a sheet to testify on well it ain't over yet it is over because it's standing as an opposition and i've got a direct word from god that there shall not be a man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life you're even a possessor of death do you realize that brother branham preaching the message all things he goes into that right there he said do you realize death is even given to the believer it is your possession and he comes back and he preaches it and goes into it the very next service and he picks it up he said because some people just seem like they didn't understand it but to recognize what calvary has done and the baptism of the holy ghost you are not the tail you have been made the head and death is a possession of the believer oh glory be to god you have to fight for every inch of it now notice he said that's the reason that people can say brother branham you pray for me today he says you know you get over in the canaan once brother and you realize where you belong watch prayer start being turned around this is where we're garnering this thought you watch prayer start being turned around yes sir you say look here satan this is mine i'm a possessor of this god said so move out that's right move off my grounds your ground satan says i have an abstract deed to it move out you don't i'll serve notice on you by the holy spirit's guidance i'm gonna preach on that one tonight but there i will serve notice on you by the guidance of the holy ghost so to notice that prayer itself starts being turned around once we have come into canaan and i want to say it in this way prayer changes because now we are we are asking for what we are we're asking for what we are now i know many times we we pray and you know pray and we got sickness that comes up there's there's situations that you know there's different needs and you know job and all those things like that but those should not be the majority of what we're praying about or all we're praying about because we're no different from anybody else then we're not trying to make ourselves different but you see god makes known his word that you and i might pray about this word that's why when a person says well i don't feel any closer to god where's your prayer life at have you been praying have you been seeking have you been asking god to reveal himself we need prayer we need all revelation not brother baby said not just this book of revelation we need all revelation but as the word itself we we do not want to become complacent people we want to move within the word for this hour there are promises to be taken are you hearing me now notice you see it comes down to and i'm just going to say it very clearly you are the word you are the word hey listen you you can't get anywhere without there being a voice of authority that lets you know who you are these are your rights as a believer is that right in this hour it was necessary for a prophet under direct inspiration to say uh you're not getting it the way you should so i'm gonna call you bride that you might understand you see there's an authority in announcing and declaring who you are and it lets you know the rights that belong to you now notice this in philippians 2 verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let it be in you this is the working of the mind of christ the holy spirit in your life who being in the form of god thought it not robbery or a thing to be grasped after like oh oh i'm gonna try to be i'm going to try to be like god remember in the beginning when satan came to eve he said to her you shall be like gods they already were see what he came doing he came diminishing the position that god had already placed them in he sought to dis diminish it who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself now this is overcoming right here but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that's real overcoming right there he humbled himself to full obedience to the word of god remember the the declaration sacrifice and offering thou had us no pleasure but he says i have come in the volume of the book to do thy will o god right he is now coming to do the will of god god moving through his son through the redemptive work and hear this word how it's being fulfilled and coming to pass so humility if we look into ephesians 1 humility itself is to work work of the working of the purpose of god by the holy spirit humility is not somebody walking around and oh they're so humble they're so they might be very humble but given the word testing you see how humble they are right or they could be so humble or they wouldn't never just when you give the word test because remember cain was able to humble himself direct quotes cain was able to humble himself and worship but when the word came and said if you'll do like your brother thou shalt be accepted also his humility ended right there he said i ain't going no lower how contrary to the syrophoenician woman is that right hello somebody because the word itself identified and and identified that nationality and what she was a saphenishing woman a greek a gentile and noticed himself brother bram says like this jesus himself tried to discourage her because you see but the word cannot discourage the word on the inside are you hearing me now we can be discouraged because of our imaginations come on somebody our own thoughts and boy this don't happen that wasn't faith faith is right in god's word he don't try to figure it out faith just said god said it and this is how it's going to be it was made known to her and all of that that was being said at that time when she jesus said it's not meat to take the bread that belonged to the children and cast it to dogs watch what she did she said yeah lord but the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table she had the ability not by her dna she had the ability by being a redeemable thought of god that when the word would speak she had the ability to submit herself and come under the word be to god real humility that's how we overcome real humility it's not what we determine oh i want it done this way we don't determine how things get done you can hear testimonies in church but those testimonies are there to encourage us and it may not happen the exact same way but it's the same god doing it nonetheless right someone else you know here they can they might receive their healing and it don't even pass through the medical route but remember all healing is of god if it comes through the medical route it isn't because there's a lack of faith that work of healing is of god and god works through his ordained channels come on friends you see this is where we have to get that old thinking out that's prideful thinking this is why we have when people get around it well i ain't going to take no aspirin i'm just going to have faith that ain't faith that's called pride you know what the best thing you could do is get your glass of water be smart about it and take the town on get over the headache and go do what you need to do because it all has to be god bring it to past it ain't no more spiritual because well i said this and i said this listen if god inspires you to say it then say it come on somebody see it dismiss it because we see what happened the enemy wants to draw us out into a place show thyself remember there's oppositions in the land and the only way you overcome these oppositions jericho ai and on and on you overcome them by humility to the voice of god my my my this is why in ephesians chapter one let me read here for a moment in whom verse seven in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace how many partakers of that tonight thankful for that tonight wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is where we're at we're in the dispensation of the fullness of time there's not another age to come there's not another time to come we're living in the end time in the fullness of time but this is his promise that he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so he's speaking this verse speaks of the rapture it speaks of the resurrection is that right those that are in heaven and those that are on earth there's a gathering that is going on in whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember jesus never gave you an inheritance are you hearing me he never gave us one our inheritance was before the foundation of the world but we couldn't get to it we couldn't get to it you see there's a there was a a contrary between us and that of god we could not get to that inherent what inheritance are we talking about we're talking about the holy ghost that which brings about a real birth on the inside of your life that's an inheritance we have obtained that jesus himself brought us to that god came down he shed his blood is that right that you and i might come into that place that repentance would strike our hearts you know that's one of the greatest things that you can realize is that you're a sinner right that we need god to repent that i need god i'm i'm a sinner i need to be saved right then when that strikes the heart now notice all of that is made possible because the blood was shed and the holy spirit has come back to bring us to the realization of our inheritance being predestinated so this is not no willy-nilly event according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ i want you to look at this verse having made verse 9 having made known to us the mystery of his will the mystery of his will is the working of the holy spirit in our lives the holy ghost is the mystery of god paul would write in timothy great is the mystery of godliness is that right so the mystery of his will is the working of the person of jesus christ in our life a mind cannot figure it out remember when nicodemus stood right there and he talked to the lord jesus and jesus said except a man be born again he cannot understand see the kingdom of god right but whosoever is that is born of the spirit is he liking it it's like that of the wind you cannot tell from whence it came or whence it goes but it's like this nobody ever seen the wind blow oh yes i have brother say no you haven't what you saw is the effects of the wind on something out there right you didn't the only way you see the wind blowing is because there's an effect upon you or the leaves upon the tree and that's the way that the holy ghost does in the life of a believer it moves you in sync with god's word his will and this is why there becomes decisions and choices about your life that others won't understand now listen it'll never be contrary to the word you can never claim well the holy ghost led me to do this and it contrary to the word that's not the holy ghost is that right but the mystery of the will is the working of the spirit of god in our lives to direct us in the purpose of almighty god and this is why this is where prayer comes in this is why we're praying we're seeking god's will we're looking to the lord listen his word is his will being made known to our lives this is why we as we're praying and we're we're looking to god we are ordained to fellowship with the mystery of god we are ordained to fellowship with this mystery to have that relationship with the purpose of jesus christ and i just say it in this way the purpose of god it's bigger than you and me it's bigger and it's far greater than anything of this earthly life the purpose of god is is uh it's just so it's expansive it's beyond what we could ever bring it down and put it down just in a just in a you know something so uh minute but the purpose of god is so great how god moves a life and directs a heart and a life being led by the spirit of god you see with this reality he becomes the objective in the theme of our life let me move down past something here in second corinthians chapter 1 verse 18 i'm just going to skip just something here but as god is true our word toward you was not yea in name for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and salvenius and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was ye it wasn't something that was it might be it could be but the word has been preached with the certainty by the power of the holy ghost god has confirmed his word to your hearts in him in him every promise is ye not how that we don't have to figure it out how it's going to be but in him it's yeah in him every promise is certain is that right for all the promises of god all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us all the promises are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us now notice how the lord jesus places this here in john 15 and verse 7. if ye abide in me and my words abide in you if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you you see even within this brother brown would would say it like this that in his life he said i knew he says when i was reading in the word of god and i began to see in my life i needed an absolute begin to read the promises of god he said i needed an absolute in my life now listen the word of god is an absolute is that right let me say this the word of god is an absolute when god sends a prophet come on now it's an absolute because it's god's word his thoughts that are being declared remember every time israel when those that crucified jesus were packing around the law they had the psalms they had the prophets and they crucified him and they had all of this and this is why you read in the book of micah obadiah on and on and all of them they got israel got away though having the psalms having the prophets they had if you can say they had the law they had scripture but they got away from the word of the lord you see when you have the word of the lord you can't just carry the bible around as a sinner when the word of the lord is spoken it brings this word alive and you realize who is this that is discerning my heart and my life and uncovering the unbelief i'll tell you who it is it's the same god who gave his word that spoke through the prophets he is the word [Applause] hallelujah if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you ask what you will and it shall be done then can you hear me now now when that word has become in you you become an absolute whoo i got quotes on this one now hallelujah can i quote it to you i'll just quote it from my memory brother brabham said when he said when that was made real or behold a virgin shall conceive and she did it when it said behold better than manuel he said that became the typos of the scripture when it was made manifest and he said that's the same way it is with the believer that is born again of the spirit of god in this last day they become the type host of that scripture the ultimate it's not me it's not you it's christ who is the ultimate it becomes the word that's why it's an absolute that's why we're deoked to the word of god it's an absolute truth it's not something that's up for debate that's why we don't have no time for you know well this is brother brahms opinion i got one statement for that i got one scripture that'll cover that and back that in the corner and blow it out of here behold i send unto you elijah the prophet are you hearing me because if we're gonna go by somebody else's opinion then we've got that's all we've got is your opinion and you're trying to lead us back into the bible god's already done that god's already done that he don't need preachers turning around and telling us what well this is brother branham's opinion god never called nobody to do that are you hearing me church this word that god has sent in this hour it's made to believe and become one with and to live by that word oh my it brings the greatest rest and the greatest reality i'm not worthy of trying to figure anything out only thing i know is that god has sent his word this word is to become flesh and there are obstacles that's in front of us but we are more than a match through jesus christ for every circumstance that's before us you see that's why when you start tampering with the word where does it stop and our life becomes so entwined in that and it goes right off the beaten path of what god's ordained for it to be see this message this message is not the mind of a man come on friends this message is the mind of god i can't make that real to anybody but that is the mind of god when it's made real to you and you see it in that way like brother brahman says once you once see the message you can't unsee it [Applause] and then what do you do you're moving with a perfect faith in your life hallelujah oh brother samuel i don't know if it needs to be said that's wrong no it needs to be said that strong because at times there's other voices that are out there and they're voices of confusion but we've got one voice and that's the voice of god of the holy spirit that we are to be in tune with i don't care if they're buddy i don't care their friend as soon as you step across that line and you make that statement you're tuned out [Applause] that's where that's what i believe and that's where i stand i know this message works i'm a product of this message it's jesus christ that has changed my life hallelujah i didn't change my life jesus christ changed my life this message is not books and tapes this message is jesus christ revealed to you and i it's not another dogma or believe this and believe it's back to the word of god it's god's heart's desire to be united with you in a relationship if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will notice you shall ask what you will and it shall be done showing that the word and the spirit has come into the life of the believer because you can't have the word and not have the spirit i'm talking about in your life and you can't say you've got the spirit and not have the word right we covered some of that on sunday you can't say well i've got the father but i you know i i i don't know about the son and you know well i've got the holy ghost and i don't know about that part of the word no they come as a complete package they they are one that's one clear evidence where the holy ghost has come into your life not only have you been changed not only has there been well this went on in my life this went out of my life thank god for that but there's something even greater than just cigarettes going out of your life or less going out of your life there's something greater and that is you have been united with jesus christ and it has moved you into the word amen you shall ask what you will and it shall be done you see you shall ask what you will when that desire has been changed on the inside then what are you asking for you're asking for his will to be done thou will be done in earth even as it is in heaven you're in contact with god you shall ask what you will and it shall be done you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whosoever you shall whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you that's a that's a big statement there you've been chosen we've been ordained for what purpose that we should go and bring forth fruit fruit doesn't come up overnight is that right my wife she goes out there and checks in her garden every day looks to see if they're tomatoes you know or other things that's come up in the garden she looks at that and fruit doesn't come up overnight right apple trees orange tree all those it doesn't happen overnight it goes through a process is that right the bible says that they that receive seed into good ground bring forth fruit with patience patience is endurance taking the word in nourishing that word that this is why that when these scriptures apply right here in verse 16 it brings us to a place that we see we're possessing our rights in canaan we've not just come into a church and oh i go to believer spoken word tabernacle yeah brother samuel is my pastor i go there we recognize it's more than just coming to a church we recognize it's more than just well praise god i don't i don't smoke pot no more i don't run around no more i don't do there's more than that you can have all of that removed and still not be in fulfillment of the word because you must be born again it's where the word itself there's an evidence of the word that your desires have changed your desire is for him now listen it doesn't mean listen to me you don't grow up overnight but you mature so you can't compare your walk with somebody else's water just i'm just just feel the slow down there on this a moment you cannot begin to compare your walk with one of the veterans that's been walking here and you see them my goodness am i i want to be just like that remember it's not their flesh that is a product of many years of dying to self it's a product of many battles come on now it's a product of of many trials and many tests if you were to stop and to ask them at times are there times that you felt like giving up and they could say yes but it wasn't me holding on it's him holding me if you could ask them many times do do you do you you wonder about who you were yeah times i've i've wondered about sometimes i started to to look at different things and were there times that that that that that you felt so all the other times i felt alone because it's wrestling and out there's opposition that's always right here before us but it didn't come that way overnight but god told you and he told me as he told israel he said i will put the inhabitants of the land out little by little not big by big little by little what if you went into a house or you went into things being done and my goodness you know you you go in the house and you here they are they're building up they're maybe they're putting a wall up in some room and you go in there you're like wow praise the lord they got the wood and wow wonderful and you show up the next day and the wood's still there but they're laying out the plans did you go the next day you know what after a time you can go keep going and it seemed like i ain't seeing nothing but the work that they're doing is necessary for the wall to come together kind of like the song even when i don't feel it he's still working he's still working is that right but then you see little by little this is how the word is coming to pass in our life let me leave you with this let me leave you with this when we talk about in prayer and beginning to pray for things asking god to fulfill his word praying to the lord i know we've got many needs we've got my goodness i just had a prayer request that come in from brother mike walls here just just earlier today and different requests there's different needs that many times i it comes up from all over the world and different needs and sometimes just like they made mention of brother burley when i got that one yesterday early in the evening there and you know where brother burley was working and he he had a nail gun and that nail gun shot that nail right through his eye and uh you know they took him in for surgery they removed it and he just brother burley had asked that we just pray that there would be no infection saturn in his eye and thank god amen we still have brother burley amen love brother burleigh don't we appreciate him but you see there's so many needs that we have and sometimes let's just be honest we can become so caught up with the need sometimes i feel like when i'm praying sometimes i feel like that the needs and the list just right here in the church i just feel like the needs are just it's just so much there's times that i've you know i've come to a place in my life and i realize when praying for the needs of the people it isn't just of when i have my prayer time but i've asked god because there's sometimes and it isn't because i remember or somebody more i forget i tell you i live more and more seems like by posting notes and reminders and everything else but you know what i've come to the place and i don't bother me no more and that is if somebody comes to my mind and i don't care if i'm driving down the road i don't care if i'm walking through the store i just start praying for them pray without ceasing we've got a lot of needs to pray for sometimes we know this what i'm saying is that there's a lot of things that we can pray about sickness and needs and this one needs a job and there's we our whole time within prayer could be taken up with that and there's times we should be praying for one another when different ones come to our hearts that's all part of us taking possession in the land is that right it's not just about well i'm gonna get my mountain you get yours whatever no it's you need help let's go let's go take your mountain let's go do that god puts that on our heart but there's times as the word is coming forth just like when we get done when you finish a service or you're listening to the message you're reading in the scriptures it's things that as we're reading in the word of god i didn't get to this tonight but there's an effect upon being in the word of god our diet that has an effect on the way we pray the reason god shows us certain things as he will take us like he did to the disciples and they looked upon the field it was white ready for harvest and said pray ye that the lord of harvest will send laborers into the vineyard he knew what needed to be done but they needed to ask prayer you say it in this manner and i've got a statement i want to read to you prayer is an exercise of faith it's where we exercise our faith to pray if you have no doubt in your heart whatsoever you ask it shall be given unto you there's things that set before us listen when i say who doesn't want a closer walk with god all of us would raise our hands but we recognize going back to listen go back to philippians 2 who thought it not robbery or thing to be grasped after we're not grasping after something it's who we are but it's yielding to the god who's on the inside of us it's us dying to ourselves it's god speaking to our lives and things that become so clear to us and we're praying and saying god let it be in my life it's a it's a relationship with him you know if all it is is well i get up a morning and i read a chapter and and that's wonderful i think you know what you need to be in the word of god but you see if it's only i got up and i read a chapter and i prayed 15 minutes that's a religious duty it's not a relationship are you hearing me but a relationship is that you realize he's not only there waiting at the breakfast table or at your chair but he also gets in the seat with you and rides down the road are you with me he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age we could really preach on the house of prayer the real house of prayer right now but listen brother branham makes this statement who has more authority in the presence of god an angel who never did sin or a son and daughter of god a son and daughter of god has more authority in his presence because angels are servants we were never made to be servants but when the holy ghost has come this is him i have made thee to be the head and not the tail it is the work of almighty god in our life that lifts us into that place of a son and daughter of god that that we would recognize brother branham would take this time and i'm ending on this point right here he would take this time and speak to you and i to remind us what has brought this about in our life because he says within this he said to think of it when the holy spirit he said has come he said a sinner that's been saved by grace he son has more authority than a servant does listen to this statement here everybody listening listen this statement right after that when he's asked the question who has the most power before god and he said a son has more authority than a servant an angel oh we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are after we become what we are then we forgot how we got here you see faith itself oh it just starts moving in your life when you remember how you got to where you are we did not get here by our own self but it is by the grace of god his blood was shed with you and i in mind he made the purchase with us in mind and the holy spirit was sent to make our inheritance real to us and now we stand as sons and daughters of god you know sometimes our our mind can go this way or it can go that way but i'm thankful that god would so center our hearts and our lives by his word that we can stand upon this place to remember of who we are when needs arise situations come up remember who you are and who has made you what you are let me leave you with the scriptures it's okay psalms 100 verse 3. many scriptures we could read with this but let me just read this scripture know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture we have not made ourselves he has made us is that right so to remember that no matter what what opposition no matter what situation arises we are facing it by relying on what the word has made us to be see we're not relying upon anything else other than the working of what the word has made us to be in every anything that is that is there before us it doesn't matter if it's a jericho it's an ai it doesn't matter what city it is doesn't matter what giant it is it doesn't matter what matters is is we're facing that by relying on who we are and who we are made to be let me just say it very clearly we are the word it's not something we're trying to grasp a hold of see this prayer isn't oh i'm trying to grasp this prayer isn't doing that remember what real prayer is prayer is submitting ourselves to the will of god thy will be done lord lord let that word just so come into my life you see it's having a relationship with him can you imagine what it would be like in your home if after you walk down to the service those of you those of us that are married and you never talk to one another right wow you're quiet in here can you never talk to one another yeah my there would be a real be a real disconnect right now stay with me here keep your mind in here you see this is where the person of christ this is why it's not a code of laws he's a person he's one we have relationship with him we talk to him about everything when situations arrive even temptations that come in our lives we talk to him it's part of overcoming its part of walking in this promised land prayer changes because the one important thing is we're no longer praying when we're not just praying with a hope we're praying with this is mine this belongs to me god has given this to me whether sickness arises or whatever more we have the assurance of god we want to bring forth fruit don't we i tell you the one the one thing that is so key in every one of our lives in every life and i think we as we went on that for some time here back in maybe january february one of the things that you can never do we can never do too much of is pray and it's not just not just you know just words but it's actually losing sight of ourselves and really seeking the will of god and just staying in contact with him god's not asking you are you with me god's not asking us to become like monks walk around with scratchy brown robes on with a you know a robe or a rope around our waist that's not what god's asking us to do god's not asking us to become odd he's asking us to become sensitive more sensitive to him more sensitive to his will and praying about these things in our life i tell you there's an effect how many witnesses there's an effect when we're praying and we're seeking after god there's an effect in our life and remember it's praying at all times whenever something drops in your heart there might be a scripture that drops it might be something that you've read about something that that from a message that comes back to you and you can just say lord make that real to me i'm just expressing to you from my heart exactly how i approach things lord i know there's something here lord make it real to me there's things when god opens things to my life and i begin to see it in a certain way and i'm not talking about something of a revelation out here i'm talking about when i see myself in it personally i see his working in my life i see to where brother brian is melting down samuel and i look at that and i say lord jesus let it be in my life i don't just take it and it's a while i see it but that's i want that in my life lord let it become so preeminent that's when prayer changes it's praying it's asking for his will to be done in our lives amen heavenly father lord you are so merciful you're so mindful it just it overwhelms us lord when we think about dear god that as we read even in the first part of corinthians there that lord how you have chosen us in all of our weakness and all of our frailties in all those parts but it's not the weakness itself but it's that part of yourself that part within us that's really you god it's you working according to your word and lord through all of our weaknesses through all of everything lord god of our our humanity but it's the greatness of god that's working and moving in our lives and lord jesus may lord from this lord very simple thought of prayer changing may lord i pray that every one of us as we just looking and revisiting that that reality that lord in your presence even right now lord we have a greater authority than an archangel we have an audience with the king of glory lord jesus lord as you would just no matter if the angels were speaking at that time you would silence them at the request being made known of one of your sons or daughters lord i think right here tonight there's request that's not only here tonight but even as we would go from this place go from the presence of one another that we recognize lord of who we are by the presence of jesus christ lord who you have made us to be and the promises lord that you've given to us as your children lord that when we pray we're we're not praying with a perhaps or a maybe there's an assurance lord that you've given us lord and these these promises lord that we are praying over lord as we're praying oh god that we would be counted worthy lord to escape lord these things praying lord as i hear the prophet cry out there and that one of the last messages of leadership and he's speaking of the insanity that's upon the world and the condition and he says oh god don't leave me here lord lord jesus we're we're looking to you lord that god knowing that every everything that we have before there's a battle that god may we press that battle lord may we take a hold of every promise of god lord perhaps here tonight i'm lord there can be lies that's that's never really fully come into the holy ghost maybe there's lord been many things that's rid out of their life but they've never come to that place lord of a real a transformation lord to where that you're the very desire of their life lord to where it's been lifted to that place lord that oh god where you and them have been made one lord where you're the pulsation of their life lord may they realize that's their right tonight that's the privilege that's inheritance lord that you desire to make so real to them lord and that they would become one with that just like israel coming into the land father granted tonight lord lord perhaps here tonight there's one lord facing the lord an obstacle maybe it's a sickness in their body and lord we realize that sicknesses and things that come about in our body and lord things that that take place we also know that through that lord there's a molding of our character lord for it's it's gold that's being tried in the fire it's gold that's lord jesus as as our faith is being tried lord through the test and the trial of our faith it's more precious than gold lord help us lord i pray father help us lord as we lord even looking to you and praying lord over this over these things in your word oh god may you have your way father grant it lord we pray father we love you and we thank you now lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's stand if we could amend it on the new year go ahead paul saying what's on your heart hallelujah oh my god let's just worship him just a moment [Music] [Music] all of my days are held in your hands [Music] [Music] presence [Music] your holy spirit so teach me dear lord yes father [Music] and i'm captured by [Music] me to yourself lead me lord i pray oh take me and move me use me yes lord and fill me with [Music] oh lord [Music] yes lord jesus [Music] hallelujah and wonderful savior i know for sure that all of my days are [Music] hallelujah [Music] your holy spirit [Music] to live all of my life [Music] i'm captured by your [Music] me to yourself oh leave me lord lord i pray oh just oh [Music] me oh [Music] me yes [Music] says me [Music] myself [Music] the more i seek you [Music] oh [Music] the more i see [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me is [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] lay back [Music] is [Music] is [Music] all this [Music] we're praying there's times oh just wonderful times where we can just you know as you just worship him and you just get just how the lord just takes it don't you know when you're praying don't try to order prayer if you don't get all the if you don't get requests out don't worry the requests are getting out if any of it just moves into that place it's like abraham said when we all witness of this you just throw out prayer with a little bit of worship then you go throughout the day and let me say this to you when you're going through a test you're going through a trial you see this as we come into the land it isn't let me hurry up and get this test out of the way so i can really start praying about big things that is big things every test and every trial has come predestinated from the hand of god it's not by chance but it's come right tailored to minister to us that we can die to more to ourselves that's part of overcoming right there that's part of praying you know what's happening within all of that it's christ coming to the forefront it's more of us that's dying it's christ that's rising so it's not let me get the trial of the way let me get the test all the way so i can really start praying about these these are the things right here this is the working of the word in our life amen don't you love him amen god bless you we're going to let you be dismissed in the in the name of the lord jesus remember the service on sunday here with brother jack brother jack dove may god richly bless each [Music] i [Music] it's more than [Music] my god is awesome [Music]
