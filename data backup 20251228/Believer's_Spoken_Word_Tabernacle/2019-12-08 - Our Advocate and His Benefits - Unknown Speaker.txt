underneath his eyes and they're actually causing his Ida to protrude and to look upward and a few months ago they found out and he's got to go through another procedure to have the tumors removed so they're planning three surgeries on one day just before Christmas and I made me concerned of course fear sets in and he almost died the first time he had surgery so of course I have a lot of fears for him going into surgery again so I asked for prayer he had an appointment on Monday and I didn't know what to ask I just knew that the Lord knew whatever I was afraid of that he would solve so the the doctor said that the first surgery is going to be easy and it was my biggest concern removing the tumors out of his eyes but they said that they're estimating about an hour and the second surgery they're they're preparing him for braces and they said that's going to be a more complicated surgery but it's still an easy surgery they said and the third one is very simple they said his recovery time is only one week they said in a week that he'll be able to eat regular food and enjoy Christmas with everybody so that's all God that's all God [Applause] [Music] every Asian time they're stills

you don't know that this morning may your heart just yielded to God to know him in the power of his resurrection amen aren't you glad to be a Christian amen I'm so thankful for God's mercy this morning I want to remind you as we get ready to go into the word I think we have the mission offering this morning if the brothers will come to take that up we also have a couple requests that I want to pray over here this morning one where sister Linda my Aunt Linda had asked requested for a prayer cloth you've heard the prayer request that's been offered up there and as you've been been praying over that and even this morning we just were just looking to the Lord that God will move on the scene to know that God's already working and whatever Avenue that God chooses this is not this is not what we determine it's whatever Avenue God chooses even how brother branham would tell us by the Spirit of God he said God performs miracles through doctors surgeries and medicine and we know that even through the Scriptures there were things within that and yet there's times to how that God it just it all all healing comes from the Lord God can perform a miracle so it's all in the hands of God no matter what way what we're standing on is the Word of God that says by my stripes who you are healed that's where we're standing our prayer is not with the formation of this as how it has to be our prayer is this is what he said we stand here that settles it right there amen so we want to just remember her in prayer as we pray over the the prayer cloth here also had a request come in from a couple that's here this morning they had a special request that we did not get in the to bring as the when we were reading prayer requests this morning but this request it deals with remembering that one on one of their family members in prayer that their sins would be forgiven the reality is their sins are already forgiven they have to acknowledge what Jesus Christ already did for them Amen so that's what we want to pray is that God would bring that reality to them then they move within repentance to accept what he's already done so we want to pray for that for that situation as well and even as we we lift the the mission offering here this morning could we all just go together in prayer let's join together as a body of believers here this morning Heavenly Father Lord as we come here Lord and we have Lord assembled Lord under the unction of the Holy Ghost Lord to know that it is your word that draws us that we would assemble ourselves together we Lord our desiring Lord to see you Lord come through your word and speak to our hearts Lord you see the needs that are here before us Lord you see those requests that's went up Lord God here this morning the spoken and the unspoken alike Lord there are many needs Lord God throughout this assembly alone Lord if it was even just one need there that is more than what anybody can ever take care of but nothing is too hard for you Lord and so father every one of these requests Lord is we have Lord continued to lift Lord Lilliana before the throne of God and Lord we know that it is Lord your will Lord as we prayed your God that father you are the Lord that he loved all our diseases and Lord we stand upon that word it's your desire Lord Lord that we would be whole and so father as we take this prayer cloth Lord I have it in my hand the brothers and sisters Lord throughout this congregation Lord our hearts are united together Lord under the shed blood by the Holy Ghost and Lord God our faith Lord God is set forth that when this prayer cloth Lord would be placed Lord upon our sister Linda Lord I ask your God that the same creative power of Almighty God that move Lord God to bring about a change in a life Lord God that lifts a life Lord from the muck of sin and despair and brings about a daughter of God a son of God I ask Lord God right now father that that same creative power of God would move Lord God as it moved in Genesis 1 Lord that father for the needs in her body Lord we by faith Lord like David swinging Lord that slingshot Lord it was not David's accuracy it was his faith in the Living God that took the stone Lord to the forehead of the giant his accuracy was standing upon the saith the Lord and father were standing here Lord this morning as you're believing children Lord and dear God were asking for every one of these requests Lord not just for sister Linda but Lord for the request of that family member of the young couple that's here this morning Lord that that family member would come to the realization Lord God that their sin that has already been paid for Lord that you've already borne their sins away Lord I ask God that that reality would break upon their heart and they themselves would come to repentance Lord and to accept what you have already done Lord and that you will do a full work in that life Oh God Lord you can take the Lord what is covered in darkness and when light comes Lord the darkness must flee and so father we ask these things now even as we looking upon your word this morning o God we ask that you and anoint our eyes Lord our hearts Lord anoint our ears Lord spiritually Lord to be able to hear father what it is that the Spirit is saying Lord we ask that God you'll bless Lord the mission offering as it's offered Lord and given this morning we pray that you'll take it Lord with your hands and multiply for in your hands Lord everything Lord as we see in the scriptures is more than enough Lord and we ask God that you'll just Lord bless the worshiper bless the giver Lord as they're sacrificing Lord here this morning Lord from the love of their heart Lord may you just feel God take it Lord and multiply it and multiply we pray God in our hearts in our lives Lord continue Lord to the Lord move in our lives Lord even here this morning for every need we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you are giving us unto the Lord I want to read thank you musicians I want to read a portion of scripture here from Psalms 103 this morning and I want to say it's so good to be in the house of the Lord amen brother David good to see your brother amen amen so good to see you brother David was there a little bit of a car accident and some other things and with playing and he forgot his age on Thanksgiving Day he was out there playing and we're just glad to we're glad to have brother David here with us this morning where he's able to be here a many ancestor Danai in the family each and every one of you and I I thought about it you know sister Caroline I realized afterwards I kept on passing your brother Samuel on my way up here and I realized it last week afterwards I thought lord have mercy I didn't even I know they don't feel that way like you have to call on me but I just I I was so good to see him I think he has a wonderful name [Laughter] I'm just but I really it was it was it was so good to see him and have him here with us and and I trust that you all were blessed by his visit a man as he was here and if there's somebody else I am I'm bad because I can't only see everything and when I get up here I know you don't mind this but I am I am I guess what they call tunnel vision I have one thing on my mind and even with what was known that I had to do today my sweet little wife was setting out was waiting out there for me she was wait not there to catch me did you remember this our Lord knows I need that I really need that when it comes to these things here if I forget everything else Lord don't let me forget your word I just treasure his his inspiration and the things that he gives and and I just pray that I'd be able to to to get out of the way and that he can bring it the way that he's given it to me so well I love you I wouldn't keep you here I won't keep you standing I also won't remind you the fellowship dinner next weekend right after the service so we want to keep that in mind as well let's just we'll start reading here and then I won't keep you standing I'll read the rest of it when you get seated but verse one a psalm of David Psalm 103 sorry Psalms 103 psalm of David bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name every one of these scriptures we could just preach for a long time all that is within me not just a part of me but all that is within me bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases look at somebody and say all tell-tell the other neighbor all well your awakened that's good who redeemeth who redeemeth well anything gets redeemed because it belongs to that person who redeemeth thy life from destruction he don't just do that one time he keeps on doing it are you with me he redeems our soul and then time and time again as we come through tests and through trials he redeems us how many times were Paul said we had the sentence of death he said he delivered us and he will deliver us amen who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that value--the is renewed like the Eagles how many know sometimes here is this is not just where the Lord Jesus just dropping things here and there but an eagle when it gets down then other Eagles come to it and they take the meat and put the meat the meat in their beak he satisfied thy mouth with good things amen this is personal he comes personally to us and delivers to us his word to our hearts so that thy youth oh this is the power of the word so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles amen god bless you as you're being seated bless his word let's just keep on reading the Bible says in verse 6 the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities aren't you glad for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is the mercy of his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pitieth his children that word pitty affero means to be compassion we compassionate have tender affection like as a father pity of his children so the Lord pities of them that fear him for he knoweth verse 14 for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust now we know he doesn't withhold admonition and correction but rather with his understanding he approaches us he doesn't I want you to catch this he doesn't discourage us when he corrects us to the place as though we are nothing he knows the measure that is needed so that we are able to continue I want you to think of this year as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes for the wind passes over it and is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him now we understand that this fear is not a slavish fear that's the wrong kind of fear but fear the fear of the Lord the Bible says that's the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord and the fear of the Lord is the reverence of the Lord it's the reverence of his word the reverence of his presence it's referencing him upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his Commandments to do them now I want to just read another part of scripture just laying some things in here as a background going right back into a scripture we've been looking at in 1st John chapter 2 verse 1 now here John writes my little children these things write I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world now to think of that when we go back if I just take you just for a moment and take you back that it is always been the place where fellowship is between God and his family is under the blood when the fall happened in in in in Eden remember God Himself they came out with the fig leaves on and as they hadn't they made themselves aprons and they covered themselves and yet within the presence of God not to think of this they did not even have confidence in what they were wearing to even come out in God's presence and yet God knowing that that their confidence here it doesn't matter what they were what it was that they had clothed themselves because a religion is a covering it did not allow them to come out into the presence of God and yet that is what they were made to live in God's presence I mean what parent would want his children when he speaks that they would run and hide there is no parent that would think that to be glorious but the glory of that of the parent is that when the parent would speak that the children themselves they would want to be in the presence of their parent or parents they would want to be in the presence as we look at his sons and daughters of God we would want to be in the presence of Almighty God David would write of this of how that you know it would be the desire of his life to let me then I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever then this is where I would abide in the presence of God now when we think of this how God then he he he the Bible says he slave he took the clothing of an innocent one and he throw that clothing in there to Adam and Eve because what they had on they were not fit to stand in his sight but God took that of an innocent one that clothing of animal life and he gave them the garments that they needed in order for them to be able to stand in his sight because God is determined to have fellowship with his family so there's only one that can provide the right necessary condition for that of fellowship to be or fellowship to be restored and that is by God himself making the provision that you and I can stand in his presence and so when we think of this it's always been the blood all the way through the scriptures there's many of the types we see in the Old Testament but one of the types that we pull up is that of we're in in Exodus 12 remember when God sends an exodus message down there by the way of Moses and and to think of it Moses you know well let's just go on Moses he went down there with an exodus message there and he would begin to minister to the children of Israel that the God who made the promise I've met that God and that God is alive and well and listen to me he didn't leave that presence back at the burning bush the God who made himself known in that burning bush he came inside of Moses he was not left back there in the desert he got companied his prophet with a message because the message is not words the message is Christ it is a living promise of God that's become a reality and God takes upon flesh and God goes down there begins to speak because a man's word cannot create there's only one that can create and that is Almighty God when God speaks there are there is creation that comes forth it was not Moses ingenuity nor was it Moses the man that created the Flies and all those things but it was yielding there to the Living God who had told Moses here than that meant to live there under that shed blood of those offerings and to think of how that Moses had confidence in what God had gave to him in the shed blood that Moses could stand there under the shed blood and what God would ask of him to do he did not flinch nor pull back what was it it shows that there is power in that blood to bring a confidence of who we are as sons and daughters of God brother sister we don't got to take a backseat to no devil to no condition no sir we are ordained as sons and daughters of God I just say it personally like this you have not been called or made to be the tail you have been called to be the head given by God's grace to be a master over every circumstance you say brother sender that sounds way out into the carnal mind in ears to our minds naturally it does not seem possible here but something down there says I know what is possible what is it it's God working through a direct conduit with his children to where your act and stand with authority under the Word of God brother there is nothing that gives you an hour authority lack the revelation of Jesus Christ that comes through the works nothing gives us authority like that no mother here they come under in that Exodus message mind and then within that in order for them to come out of Egypt they've got to come out with blood and God makes known in exodus 12 take the lamb take the lamb for every household you took heal that lamb inspect it you're to kill it you'd apply the blood and to know when they walked out they were to stay there under the blood until mark to eat that and we're with the atonement was made that we're in that they could walk out of Egypt so they were now walking out remember the blood was applied as we as we said some weeks ago it was applied here above the door it wasn't it it's departed you can't you can't despise the blood and then think you're going to get by but notice you to come under that blood it was blood that was on the side blood that was over showing it was a type of showing that what God would do through him by the Holy Ghost coming up on the believer but repented one and Ana here God would so move by a divine work and bring them under that blood so much so that God would say when I pass through the land of Egypt to smite and execute judgment it said I will not look upon you why he can't see when the blood has been applied all he sees is the blood you see the blood has been applied by faith so they are under the blood now think of this in their journey when they came out they they they they they got hungry he fed on it they got thirsty he gave them drink they ran into even in times of their failures and notice even when it came to where in the scriptures where Balak would want to persuade Balaam that you can curse these people and he began to show them the honda parts of that of israel he began to show him all of their shortcomings in all those places like that but you know no matter what that that Balak could show Balaam Balaam himself remember how God how the Lord comes there upon Balaam and the prophecy that comes forth that that God has not found no such thing within Jacob how can that be how can it be when there was a group of people they were filled with faults and failures how can that be because they were under the blood I want you just to follow me here as we apply that God would not honor them and brother Brown would say like this he says God didn't have honor for them but he had honor for his atonement he was looking at his atonement rather if he'd have been looking at Israel he'd have killed every one of them but there had to be a blood that would stand for them and he would look at blood amen hallelujah this is why under the blood blue room says under the blood it all looks sons and daughters to give it all looks sons and daughters to him as long as they're confessed under the blood so if you've done wrong get under the blood today and confess your sins for if we fall from grace we have an advocate to the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ oh if it wasn't for that advocate we'd all be gone but in there notice in there were brought under the rich royal blood of the Son of God and before God we are pure and holy brought in under the rich royal blood of the Son of God and in there not outside of there in there we are pure and holy now think of this there you know when we think of thee or even around this earth right now because the Bible says what we read here that that he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world to know that there is the bumper of blood that is there around this whole earth while God himself if the Holy Spirit is still mooing and drawing hearts to that place of repentance and redemption he is working within that time that notice if it was not for the bumper of blood that is their brother Brad would say it like this he said when I do wrong it does not go to God he said what happens is it goes to that bumper of blood of the Lord Jesus he said God does not see my wrong now think of it listen to me now even when you and I were yet sinners and we were there within the world we needed listen we needed to know that we have been redeemed because in reality is somebody could have told us you're redeemed we could have said I'm redeemed and there is a power when it is believed and it's confessed however for someone just to say I'm redeemed and they continue to live the same life it shows that redemption of what was done for them it's really not become personal they're only saying something they know by acknowledge instead of knowing it by personal experience there is no substitute for a trip to Calvary no substitute at all every every individual must make a personal trip to Calvary where that the debt was settled the payment was made and must have within it but same resurrection power that came to confirm that I have accepted that sacrifice and you are accepted in it then you've got pardoning power brother pardoning power brings faith for you to walk right in the face of the devil and say you're not afraid of me but you're afraid of who I represent because you know where you're standing you're standing under the blood he doesn't I think this is very he doesn't see us as sinners he sees us as sons and daughters of God now you know brother Branham he he placed it like this I read to you the interview of sister Bruce that took place right before brother Branham preaches the masterpiece he's meeting with her in the back room right before he preaches that message and brother Branham right in the middle of preaching the message the masterpiece he goes into talking about how God is building that masterpiece and he says you know he said the only way he said that it it could be for you and I is that God the great sculptor he's seen that man not keep a covenant he just can't do it there is no way at all no man can not keep the Covenant man can not keep the word but it takes a word himself inside of you and me to keep his own word hallelujah OMA on an interview brother brems said I was talking to a a person that's present now and said brother Branham I have so many thing I know that's wrong a godly little woman but I said look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the Lord I can't shout that one loud enough if you really love the Lord you tried to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus see he made a way what's he looking at the desire of your heart he knew that in our lives the seed that he had sown he knew the desire was we wanted to serve Him but you and I could not make that possible that's why there had to be the quickening power of God only inside let me just preach for a few moments is that Alright well brother manna makes a statement in power transformation and he says the seed he said within that seed is the power for what he's spoken to become what he said it would be but you see that power it must work in unity with the quickening power of God so what is that power that's within the sea that is the power of submission and yielding to the quickening power that it's God's quickening power the life of the vine coming to produce what is in the branches is that Alright if we need the quickening power of God to release what is in the so to think of that he makes away he made away by the quickening power but what was there I want to serve him that it becomes a reality and you know what it's no longer you trying to do it its Christ in you doing it to a person outside the veil they look at that and say but I've gave this up I tried to stop this I tried to do that let me just tell you the whole problem you you and I that's the problem and they are not being me by being you it's your efforts I'm not in listen we're not I'm not against you I'm telling you you can't do it he has to do it but in him doing it it takes your heart lining up with the word and saying amen to the water because what happens is so many times that people come to a place and say well I'll do this and they're going up on their own strength but they never receive the strength of the Lord in their life and so after a period of time they turn loose when I'm talking to you this morning it's not where you've got a handle on it but where he's got a handle on you that's what I'm preaching about that's the real message that's the real gospel is where Christ has preeminence in your life if you really love the Lord now many people many people say they love God right but you tell you can see you can see actions if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus he made a way now the Bible says in Hebrews 10 verse 1 and verse 2 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscience this word desire of sin not to think of this here now when we look at remember what David would write David would write back in the Psalms and then Paul would pick it up in Romans 4 blessed is the man in whom the lord imputeth no sin is that right blessed is that man and notice this blessedness David was speaking about even though David himself could only know it in part under the sacrificial offering of that innocent animal life which was only spoken of perfect sacrifice that was to come and David would say blessed is the man and whom the Lord would not impute sin not to think of it brother Ram would pick that up and say not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer and he pulls the scripture I believe it's first John 5:7 he that is born of God does not commit sin the word commit means practice are you with me he does not practice sin he cannot sin it's not even imputed blessed is the man in whom God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin the worshiper once purged has no more conscious of sin you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be it be in a sinner when you're in a sinless one that's the real key you can't be a sinner and be in Christ no sir can in better person make mistakes when they're in Christ yes but they are not as bandage in Christ because the blood of Jesus Christ does not bring about bondage mmm now think of this right here how he says you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be a sinner when you're in the send us one and God only sees him who you are in this is the power of imputation this is where the very nature of God comes into our life and here that life I listen to me now that life being inside of us it ties us there into that sacrifice where this this old temple this temple in which that old man resided that old nature he is dead is no such thing as hanging him up he's dead that's why there's got to be a new man come on the inside that's why the Church of the Living God is not based on programs and self-help we can't do it on our own amen we need the power of the blood of the Lamb I believe in just as strong a man meets God face to face brother that man is sealed all the way to eternity you don't have to worry about it God they are in the hands of God God has controlled their life yes sir and notice this pardon me something something came up honey going there called it something just came up here about the security at home sorry I gotta get that off my mind is that Alright hebrews 10:14 now don't you all worry about it I got a big bad dog at home you look everybody to death I want you to look at this for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified now watch what watch how this verse starts about one offering where's our focus on the offering the effects of that offering comes back upon the believer it's not our perfection it's God's perfection coming inside of us bringing us in under the blood are you with me this is live brother branham with telus he said don't ever in the hebrew series don't ever get focused on that this being the glorified body in this earth right now now watch where of the Holy Ghost also he is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord who's going to make this covenant god is that right this isn't well that's not God no God said I'll make this covenant I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them glory well if he writes he's an author is that right and there's no greater privilege then when you get the author's book and they're at the book signing you're at the book signing there's no greater privilege than they had to have the person who wrote the book and it is a part of it for them to sign it let me tell you something you and I were always a part of the book the Bible says that our members in Psalms 139 our members were written in him yet being unperfect yet he saw then were we were always there in the Lamb's Book of Life but to notice the Spirit of God moves down upon our heart and what does he write upon our lives he's not writing thou shalt not do this now shalt not do this what does he write he writes by revealing his name by revealing his person because he himself is the lawgiver it is the very spirit of life and truth that makes us free from the law of sin and death or glory be to God no to think of this here and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more which I could preach on that aloud I will remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin glory be to God but the banner would put it like this he says I myself I will come down speaking of the Lord Jesus into the world and take on human flesh I'll pay the penalty that's required here and I'll take the place I'll make them perfect because I'll bring them in me and I imperfect jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect he said then here is that mangled body that was beaten and bruised for sin and every sin that the world ever had forever would had was laid upon him and he is the body of that jehovah raised up on the last day there on the third day after his death and if we are in that body we're just as perfect as the body is whoo this and a half I'm talking about your soul and remember that when if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead it dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body equipment it to the word of promise in this hour that's what the quickening power did old man the quickening power when it came upon that dead lifeless body of the Lord Jesus what did that quickening power do it raised it up according to the promise so when he came forward it was the manifestation of the promise that was made concerning him and that's what the quickening power when it makes its way to the place in the life of the believer you're not trying to be a Christian but brother your life now steps out of the pages of the scripture and it reveals Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever that's what the quickening power does Oh hallelujah well he says they don't care what the world says or what anybody else says even what their family says they walk in the Spirit of God in perfect divine love now I don't mean their flip it I don't care what you say it's recognizing you let no other word but the Word of God have three minutes in your life are you with me but say no I had a lot of feeling about brother so-and-so that's aware be preeminent the Bible said cast down imaginations come on friends retain many times where people let stuff go because they don't check it with a word come on somebody I don't care how many feelings or how many bags are how many dish or how many back it's gotta be checked with the word and sometimes listen to me brother bran will tell us over and over he said you test every motive and an objective and brother when you test something you don't just run it through the lab you test it in prayer you test it you test it you test it because why it is necessary you don't want to have the wrong motive and objective Noorie how did you get into it well you get into it by believin brother Bram is a prophet know that you need to do that yep but but but but that didn't bring you in you got to be brought in by the same Holy Ghost is that right he meant by you well how do we get in the body well I believe it by you know coming to believer spoken words have enough no you can come right here and still be a devil oh jesus where am I going home for the same you know I'm friends listen the reality is there's only one place of safety and that's under the blood of the Lamb [Applause] but one spirit it's good to come to the house of God but we need to be under the blood by one spirit he says notice then he says it's not what I've done what I am who I was or nothing about it it's what God has done for me in Christ and we are perfected with our sacrifice he says he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy I'm sure nobody in here feels worthy if you do you need prayer that pride Devils got a hold on you he knows your heart aren't you glad somebody knows your heart he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there are traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to do that God you know it he said you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrificed hanging before the throne of Almighty God 1st Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him 1st John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we are reflection in this world of what he is seated on the throne he ascended above every power principality and authority there is a reflection that comes from heaven down into earth has posted there I believe is in 1st Corinthians 15 as we bore hath borne the image of the earthly it is time that we bear the image of the heavenly as poet said again in the book of Philippians he said that hear our conversation our conduct our character our constitution is from heaven and he says we are looking to him who shall change this vile body our Constitution and where there's the Constitution there's some representatives there come on now they're not corrupt the Bible says that these bodies are under fire it's reserved in the heavens I'm talking about that feed off anybody's there to where that we stand we are tied back in by the Holy Ghost we are tied and identified without theophany which is representation there before the throne of Almighty God brother it is that life that is there that's reflecting out in our lives right here her because as he is so are we in this world that's a mouthful but we want it to be a heart for that scripture right there it speaks of that that slave where they came to by him is he for sale no I want to buy him nope not for sale I want to buy him he wasn't for sale and one time you and I had been sold we were sold to then sold to that sold in this sold to that but one day we heard our father calling amen and he called us to come back home we were wondering we thought this world was her home but then when he calls to us and draws us unto himself we begin we were come to the realization this world is not my home I'm just passing through I am a pilgrim and a stranger this is not level I've met that same God the living cloth the perfection I have met him and I am looking for that perfect place that matches the perfection of my soul and soon and very soon a man because we have met Melchizedek on our way back home come on somebody a man has not just been a part that's been unfolded it's not just been justification or sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now that has all come together and made way for the very Holy Ghost himself the very person of Christ to step into his body brother we have already met our milk hesitant and the same thing he did to Abraham blessed be Abram of the Most High God a man has revealed to you and I who we are where we come from and where we are going because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear aren't you glad for that and you know what it keeps doing casting it out things try to come cast it out you know what cast it out means you know what this word cast out means right here it means to actually to take something and for it to be removed and you don't care where it falls [Applause] simple that I think you got it you say what do you mean by that I'm not focused on that I'm focused on the one who is able to lift that hey man perfect love casts out all fear don't worry I got another one up here because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we left him because he first loved us I'm gonna have to skip something here I think for just a moment [Music] my momma huh hey what you're doing well I'm just waiting I want you to think about this for a moment and we talked about the advocate our advocate and his benefits when you look at Abraham and Sarah think about their lives think about the journey that they were on and they were in God Himself couldn't get to Sarah because of Abraham what I mean is is that when they came down there here we see through the whole process of their life their ups and their downs but God could not get to Sarah because Sarah was United with Abraham said alright now to recognize that within that how God would would see that in in in in that light of how that they were united together let me just move ahead and leave that point here this morning and move into the scripture where it says in colossians 3:22 obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord father's provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged now when we we think of this in here in light of the scripture remember how that we have looking at this with the advocate that we have he makes intercession upon our ignorance he's there pleading on our behalf as a matter of fact brother Branham as I read it to you last week he says when we walk into anything I walk like a little kid and he says there's he said like a little fellow he said there's there's things where there's a dark world that's full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything and I wish I could just preach this morning on traps because in your mind don't just get into traps oh well praise God you know I haven't had no traps of sin there's a lot of traps that would try that the Satan sets to try and what his objective is is to stifle the working of the Spirit of God in your life a trap is a trap is a trap anything that comes between you and the Lord is a trap it might have a family name tacked on it but it's a trap whoo preach brother sender traps are everywhere and remember a trap don't look like a trap it's setup and disguised and Satan knows his brother hidden let me tell you something he knows us real well he knows what's real well but don't be afraid of that you need to keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus amen he's constantly the the Holy Spirit is constantly making an advocate for us all the time even in a row he's there advocating on our behalf you understand the nature his life it's his life inside of us tied in their throat these are not two different natures it's the same it's the same what is here is what's that OMA Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ who began the good work in you he did who will perform it he is and he will unto the day of Jesus Christ now in numbers 14 11 because we realize when we look upon these things I want to look into something here a little part within the word on our advocate and his benefits the Bible says and the Lord said unto Moses now the setting for this is where you've just had him to go and spy out the land 12 of 10 of them come back with a bad report about the land two of them come back and said here is the gear as the great all that what God has said he will do that's what they were standing on did they know there are obstacles they did but that was not the focus faith is what conquers and here we find what has taken place another interruption in the journey I'm the Lord said unto Moses know watch how long will this people provoke me how long will it be err they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make a V a greater nation and mightier than they the Lord would have consumed he would have consumed them he's looking notice he's looking upon their sin he's looking on what is taking place now remember listen to me now God ain't separating things out God has let it be known I'll wipe every one of them out doc didn't say I'll wipe everyone except for this one no sir he's looking at our life every single one out and then I'll up from you imagination but verse 13 Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of the land you see just like faith can travel unbelief can travel and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face-to-face and that by cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar fire by night now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of Eve will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he has slain them in the wilderness dusty scriptures alone it has the red it has the prayer a true identity of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost there were many signs and wonders that were done the Red Sea was opened everything that was done in Egypt there were many things nature was disturbed darkness came upon the scene but we're healing all of these things along the way but it showed that was not God's purpose for sending the message was to produce signs and miracles but the purpose is to get man in position in the promised that's where Pentecost failed they failed to recognize what are the signs and wonders about that's the same way with the message that God has sent to you and I that's why brother Brennan would step back here in 1960 as I was with Moses so long I'll be with thee and brother Branham would drug back because he said if you can't believe by now to believe all the sands and the wonders that God has done he said if you can't believe by now nothing will help you so to understand what are the signs and wonders about you know as well as I do there's people that come and they're healed signs and wonders and they go right back out in the world when they fall on hard times pray for me but when they're going in when the hard times are over they go on live in Andrew forget about they've asked for God to move on their need God wants to do more than just heal your body he wants to heal yourself because your body if it's healed today it can be sick by next weekend but once that soul has been healed brother they can never be since it again God's desire when blood sins a word is to bring his people into position in the promise he makes his promise known I come down to call him out and to bring him into a land that floweth with milk and honey it was to bring them into position listen to me now God revealed that to Moses he told Moses that let me say this that word took such a hold in Moses life - even in this situation it was not Moses thinking by a cure of pure carnal thinking it was God it was Christ inside of Moses that was crying out on behalf of a promise what happened when Moses spoke it was Christ he and Moses that did what it took the attention from off the people's rebellion and put it on cries back on the blood let me preach a little bit here there's got to be an atonement there's got to be a perpetuation there's got to be that to where you and I that even in the midst of Rome there's got to be a way back hey hey man oh my to think of it then they in other words what ha ha the Spirit of Christ is speaking through Moses in other words he said when they hear this think of this can you imagine they will say you know yeah he was able to bring you out of Egypt yeah he's a murdering in my vision he opened the Red Sea yeah yeah yeah I heard this he and Burt brought water the rock yo he did he brought water on the wrong he fed them with manna yep he sure did that I understand that they're closed in well nope they're closed don't wear now my goodness how powerful and yet he couldn't bring him in the land you know what they were saying he can't keep his promise that's what the Spirit of Christ is speaking in Moses is to let us know God keeps his promise being confident of this one thing that he that hath become the good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ who listen inside of you it's Christ in you the hope of glory God don't amend his word God don't say what we're living up here you knowing generation pqi X Y Z we're living up here you know in generation silver spoon God don't amend his word for that the same requirements amen hallelujah in both areas the power and the advocacy of the Spirit of Christ working with the promise of the world Amen is the very heart of God himself and how Moses cries out here the Spirit of God verse 17 and now I beseech thee now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou has spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering in a great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children under the third and fourth generation pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of that mercy as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now to pardon is to forgive now there's been a breach in fellowship there's been a break in fellowship God cannot have fellowship with unbelief but there's gotta be one who's able to stand in the gap there's gotta be one who's able to stand in the breach the Bible tells I believe it Psalms 106 he said how that God found a man by the name of Moses to stand in the breach it was not the flesh it was the Spirit of Christ the promise word in that hour what was it doing it was stand-in there old brother and sister let me tell you something as we are taking in of that word living under that word living under the blood let me tell you what that is as you're heating the word it is drawing God's attention to the word and in that word is prevailing power he meant to move down in your life and this you and do for you what God said he would do oh my there's only one way how can fellowship be restored there's got to be a go-between to go between these two parties come on somebody amen there's got to be something to to bring it back together God don't like disunity that's why he gave a writing for the bill of divorcement back in the Old Testament God said I don't want people pretending I give him a writing for a bill of divorcement y'all got quiet on me now God wants you to be heart and soul all the way sold out to him hallelujah there's got to be one that can stand in the presence of the Lord on our behalf and be able to perpetuate on our behalf that through the repentance of the wrong the fellowship is restored I need a little bit more time I can't break this here and the Lord said I have pardoned according to thy word Moses word was God's Word Moses is not speak listen to me now this is not human compassion no sir this is not human compassion this is the compassion of Almighty God because we saw glimpses of Moses compassion it's like your compassion and mine he has limits brother Brown would say like this so we understand it he said then people aggravated him come on now you've got people that aggravate you don't look next door you got people differences it's not the compassion of Moses this is the compassion of God listen to me you cannot separate the messenger and his message to God here it is the Spirit of Christ within that think of how Moses would have felt let's look at Moses if it's just as a man he'd feel just like you and I do goodness' man what's going on what in the world's happening here but God's got it all in control amen in verse 21 but as truly as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord that's coming to pass I said that's coming to pass this is a millennial promise right here right here I have pardoned according to that word and then the very next scripture it ties into a millennial promise there's a the work that takes place between these two verses of Scripture come home somebody may remember there's a great big God who is there and has been lessened between these two scriptures to bring it to pass and that same great big God has made himself so small and so simple to come into your life and my life and brother what is needed from beginning to end there's a great big God moving and working to bring it to pass what is it our advocate and his benefits hallelujah oh my that's why when brother Branham would remember he would remind sister Bruce he said before God I'm not a sinner and neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ you hear me he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ will that say there is a union that has taken place amen this blood speaker this token life speaketh hey man he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore were not sinners no more as Moses said pardon happy seeks thee according to that word it was the Spirit of Christ in Moses brunet said what God saw when he look there he saw across in Moses what is the atonement has been made it has been accepted and you are included in it it is the voice of Christ the voice of the blood the Holy Ghost inside of you and me our advocate his benefits my momma fellowship is broken it's got to be restored is that right when we have grieved the spirit of God fellowships got to be restored I tell you this right now as a believer it troubles you when you're not having fellowship with him it bothers you it bothered me if I was in my house and my wife wouldn't talk to me they'll get quiet now it'd bother me I would definitely think something's wrong you know what I want to know what's wrong why so it can get made right have I done something dumb which prone to do have I not been thoughtful in this or this come up or this or that well we this is good preaching right now why because the love of God and the love within my heart is I don't want nothing between us and that's how I feel in the natural you and you and I on the spiritual level as sons and daughters of God you know when there's something that displeases him sometimes it's not even the action sometimes it's the attitude behind it you see it listen to me now if the Spirit of God through the word bringing us to that sensitivity as brother Ram would say to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks and then don't just stop with that first statement and then recognize that the God in you has already overcome that and greater is He that is in you well there's got to be a restoring of that fellowship so how can fellowship be restored when you have here when something has taken place there's got to come repentance is that right and repentance let me just say it to you like this maybe I'll just drop back and teach for a few moments repentance is more than an acknowledgment of an offense it's more than an acknowledging of an offense that is only the very memo Nisei taught that's the not even elementary but the preschool part of repentance but the goal of repentence what true repentance is is to remove the underlying condition in the heart you with me what is that the Bible says that the rod when the rod as it amongst it and for in Proverbs you take the rod the rod is a rod of Correction now when does correction come correction doesn't come from frustration or from us of how they did something I didn't want know if there's been teaching that's went on and they went beyond that then the correction comes and God is faithful to correct us he says that rod and thy staff they comfort me hey man he doesn't have it's not a rod and then a separate thing there's one end it depends on what's going on at what end he's using it but it all comes out to be the same because it's there to lead us are you with me so now that that correction comes to do what to do what the Bible says to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in the heart is to drive that out no longer in the heart is the purpose that has committed the offense oh my verse 22 because all those men have watch this watch watch how God comes down he goes because all those men which have seen my glory had my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it but my servant Caleb listen to me now this is why there had to be that on the inside of Moses that called out pardon according to that word come on now because what there was a camp in that bunch I said there was a cane up in that bunch come on somebody but my servant Caleb see God now notice what does the blood do indirect my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and have followed me fully him I will I bring into the land where until he went and his seed shall possess it so you can see how the Lord deals with is because of another spirit wherein he has followed me fooling him will I bring into the land now the Bible says in Psalm 78 it talks about the condition of the heart the Bible says concerning them when they were coming out of out of Egypt and through the wilderness their heart was not right with him neither were they steadfast in his covenant what was not right their heart you see repentance itself is to restore fellowship amen we need leadership to repentance are you with me we need leadership to repentance to be able to hear his voice again can I have just a few more moments the Bible says the goodness of God leadeth to repentance what does this the goodness of God in order for God for fellowship to be restored there's got to come then repentance which is full acknowledgement and acceptance of the wrong are you with me first John 1:8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins do you hear that he's faithful and just if we do what confess the confess isn't just I'm sorry it's from here I said it's from here confess if we confess not just with our mouth but confess with our heart confess with our mind confess in action confess means to say the same thing this is what he does he's faithful to faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen this is where the benefits come in oh my notice in second corinthians 7:8 paul is writing to the church here I'm coming down here let me just have just a little bit more for though I made you sorry with a letter I do not repent though I did repent for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season now notice what is repent repent enforce season you see them were than working true repentance is got to be a working out there right now I rejoice not that you were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death now what's this they received the correction from the Lord therefore they sorrowed after a godly sort did you hear me there's a sorrow there's a lot of times where people are sorry just because of the condition just because of the situation it's not a godly sorrow in order for to be godly sorrow you've got to receive it the word of the Lord the word brings godly sorrow and godly sorrow worketh to repentance aren't you glad it never worked just lip service in your life well Lord I said this but you know you know that any me I I just can't help it Lord you know no sir he godly sorrow worketh repentance it brings about a desired achievement you say that's impossible with our flesh I agree but with God all things are possible [Applause] so here is this group of people they receive the word of the Lord and they have confessed from within that same thing what are they doing addressing the root of the problem if you don't address the root that same plant keeps coming back up come on somebody the same plant keeps coming back up and you can't blame other people for the root in your life preach brother Sanders come on now there is a grabbing hold of the Holy Ghost that's able to take care of that root sometimes you got to grab it out with what godly sorrow where we side with the letter and say Lord I hate that which you hate I'm siding with the word what is it it's the Spirit of Christ in you the advocacy of the Holy Ghost that desires to be restored in fellowship repentance is much deeper than the acknowledgment of the offense it's true abhorrent from the heart this is worth taking the word of the Lord his correction and applying it by submitting to it will drive out what has ever bound up in the heart I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands because I don't want nobody to be embarrassed and I don't think you would you shouldn't because there's one here to help let me tell you something what the thought the power of godly sorrow will do when you side with the word it actually has the power to drive out complexes come on now it might be a wrong feeling it has the power to drive that out come on somebody new Branson when you begin to think you've got a right to get even with somebody the Holy Ghost takes its flight not even something you said but what you thought so what do you have to do you've got to come back into the world huh you don't know what they did to me you don't know what they said you know what they want you still up there on the perch well how do I get fellowship restored you've got to come back and fellowship from your heart it's gotta be a desire from your heart to come back into fellowship and here is the powerful thing remember as the Prophet said that advocate it has mercy it stands for us it does for us what we cannot do ourselves it's where we stand with that word and said Lord this is your word I making an excuse for this no more come on somebody it's talking about receiving the Word of God hallelujah and submitting to it hallelujah let the Lord through his goodness lead us to repentance the sorrow of the world many times people are sorry but it's worldly sorrow I wish this wasn't I wish this wasn't there's many people to come I'm sorry for doing this and I'm sorry in it and it entity it ain't from the heart this is how do you know well I'm gonna read you a scripture I'm gonna read you a scripture right here that shows it repentance is not just acknowledgment of what's wrong but the Bible remember listen to me now by the word of the Lord when Moses came down from the mountain after who and he had first made that that the time before this year when Israel had made the golden calf Moses came down notice it was a Spirit of Christ interceding on that behalf when Moses came down from the mountain remember here it was you know there was a consuming of that golden calf and then there came to that time where Moses here it rose up who was on the Lord's side and let him come and stand by me is that right brother there was judgment coming there's gotta come judgment and thanks be to God there is judgment that moves judgment must begin at the house of God thank God there is judgment that is lose to be able to do what bring about the removal of what the hindrance is so that we can be restored back in fellowship thank God for the sword of the word verse 11 for behold this self thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yeh what clearing of yourselves how in the world could they clear themselves by receiving the pardoning grace of god's word and siding with that word it moves within the life yet what indignation what fear what the hemming that desire yeh what zeal yeh what revenge uh-oh the guy who had been pulling the wool over the eyes had been exposed now that devil that cost me to believe mr. doctor whatever month what is it it's turning now on the very one who's had the wool pulled over the eyes come on somebody in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this manner let me show you one more place in the scripture you wish to take what is given when God comes there's not that we our flesh does not like correction but we need to be corrected we need to be admonished we need to be trained a man has we've been born in his spirit now we are trained to be conformed to his image we need those times just within child training there has to be correction that that's necessary is that right so it's it's it's what's important is its to take what is given let it go beyond the flesh and because the reality when our heart our heart has a believer it craves fellowship with God it craves fellowship with God I look at this with Esther she's brought in if here she comes in it comes her time to come before the king and remember Paul wrote you were made sorry for a season why godly sorrow worketh repentance now just stay with me now the Bible says in Esther 2:12 when every maids turn was come to go in to King has arose after that she had been 12 months according to the manner woman for so were the days of her purification accomplished to win six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women but 7 what are you saying I'm not saying you've got to wait 12 months I'm not saying that you've got to wait even five minutes for fellowship to be restored what I am Telling You is that godly sorrow worketh repentance and for it to work that working depends on do we want fellowship with him here come the little lady in the prayer line how many how many times here brother Branham here he is standing step off for a moment talk talk with the person and come right back into the microphone how many times you've heard me tell the story over and over and over of the one particular here here come here come a little a little little little young lady smoking cigarettes a lot that she was living she come up here on the platform and she prayed in her heart she didn't want her mama to find out about her smoking but what she prayed she said Lord take this smoking away from me nor Jesus forgive me she walked right up in the presence of the Lord that was accompanying his prophet and the Prophet could not even find smoking in her you know why her heart had yielded to the word of the Lord that's the power of the word as it works in advocacy this is part of the benefits of our life as a believer and I'll stop on that this morning it's the power of the word God wants and longs and delights for your fellowship and I think that one thing that we could really be honest and be able to look at that and say Lord I don't want anything I don't want none of my feelings my thoughts I want fellowship with you I'll tell you friends people that make excuses for things they stay in their conditions you stay in your condition I don't say that to be harsh I say that because there is no excuse to stay in your condition there is one who is actually able to restore fellowship and he wants to that's why he would even lay this and bring this on my heart for this service right here this morning if you're out of fellowship you don't got to do penance you need to confess it and get under the blood if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ in the powers resurrection you need to get under the blood you need to say this is what you need to say you need to say lord give me a heart that'll seek after you that's what you need to say first let me seek after you I want to seek after you it's not a church it's not an idea it's the person I want to seek after you the Lord Ascott be honest with him listen God don't look at it say oh your heart's not seeking after me no David said thou has said unto me seek after me and my heart said after thee will I seek Oh God align with the word and say nah it's you that I need that's that's the same thing with every heart in every life that is gathered here this morning you don't have to walk out of here even under condemnation you can walk out of here free you can walk out of here where Fellowship is restored you believe that they men there's up working power that is present not just to bring acknowledgement but to go to work to remove anything that's bound up there aren't you glad bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name you know David saying every part of me buses the Lord and if there's a chamber of your life that in blessing it oxy you gotta go I want to bless the Lord with my whole heart [Applause] j-man bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who healeth me of all thy diseases who forgiveth me of all thine iniquities who redeemeth thy life from destruction who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that your strength is renewed like an eagle you might be sitting here this morning and it may not be that you're out of fellowship because of something that there's been an interruption as far as sin you might be sitting here this morning because you've just not been given time to him you've not been putting him first in your life but all it takes is a little talk with Jesus Lord I'm sorry that I've put everything else before you and I've given you the leftovers you deserve you deserve everything he's here if you've lost the joy of his salvation he's here to restore it he's here to restore it let me just taste something to restore that joy you know the Bible tells us and they've been looking at that joy in the book of Joel you know what took away that joy there was some bug's that came in and start eating on the tree and bugs came in and they removed the crop whereby the mill offering was offered in the mill offering as Christ those bugs came and they began to destroy the vines from which the grapes are taken that makes the wine and their joy was taken because they said we have no meat or drink offering to bring to the house of the Lord but why had it been taken because they got their eyes off of him who is the creator that provides all things and there's no greater delight and greater joy for a believer than to be able to take and to say Lord what you've given me look what your life has brought forth look Lord what your life look what what you have done or look at the working in your life my lord I thank you for your working what is it it's offering up the meal offering and the wine and that's joy you might walk out of here you can walk out of here with the joy restored but you might walk out of here and you might be a little down but if you've prayed and you've made that restitution with God you have brought everything under the blood let me just tell you something right now it already starts working this starts working it starts working on our behalf that there would be the meat offering and the drink offering restoring to me the joy of that salvation I'm telling you this morning I'm not speaking down to you there's been times I've been down in my life but I think you can agree with me as sons and daughters of God when we consider what God has done for us what he has done for us what he's doing in us and where that we are going to when we get to looking at that I said Lord how can I be down looking at circumstances but lord let me look to You Lord Jesus I'm glad that he restores fellowship and it's the Spirit of Christ in us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's constantly making an advocate for us I say this morning if you don't have that in your heart why don't you receive it receive you have that blessedness in your heart why don't you just love him just love him tell him how much you love him how much you appreciate his care for your life you know thank you for watching over me you know you're my joy but same you don't know how down I feel but the Bible said let the redeemed of the Lord say so Amen I let the weak say that I am strong hey man let the poor say I am rich hey man we've got a promise here that God has made and God is faithful to his word to back up his promise hallelujah are you glad for that this morning let's pray Lord Jesus I don't know the Lord the knees that would be around this assembly I know of some needs I know of needs that we prayed for but father when we look into your word we know Lord God that you're mindful the Lord you minister to our hearts your God very directly Lord I ask this morning that has your word has come forth Lord we want to be under that word fully we want our hearts to be so in line with that word you know when correction would come and as it does come we want to say thank you for it thank you for correcting us in order for you to forgive one of the benefits is you correct in order to forgive you've already lord forgive it you forgiving all our iniquities but Lord to think how could there be any forgiveness if there wasn't repentance but you already Lord it's not something that you are going back to Calvary to have to offer up again you paid for past present and future sins you paid for it all Lord we thank you this morning Lord how that you move upon our hearts to restore that fellowship maybe there's one that's here it's Lord that they're out of fellowship what is a believer they're walking under the blood they're our soul they're under the blood but maybe they're out of fellowship with you and the Lord as your spirit would move forth this morning it would woo to them don't let anything stand between let it all be really put under the blood let let him remedy everything in the heart to really get to the heart of the matter Lord we need strength and you give a strip more there's not a person as a believer the Lord they are aware when there's wrong they're aware Lord even to that point that we spoke about even an attitude or thought they realized Holy Spirit within us they're drawn to that Lord I asked right now that God that they would just allow allow you very simply Lord by your word to come and to restore in a broken fellowship from their heart siding with that word Lord I say what you say i side with you I I take my part on the Lord's side I'm standing here with this word Lord ask this morning God for this congregation Lord in this portion of the word that we've looked at if it wasn't for the advocate if it wasn't Lord for that perfection of Christ within us where would we be where would we be without the Advocate of the father Jesus Christ the righteous Lord it's not our desire to do wrong that's not our desire our desire from our heart is to please you Lord once again I ask if there's one that does not have that Lord seated in their heart may they in humility just ask you this morning say Lord calls me to seek after you I know that I need more than a church I need more than just a knowledge I need you the Lord calls me to seek after you then my heart be drawn let it chase after you Lord your presence that keeps knocking at my heart keeps knocking and dealing with my life Lord may this be a moment Lord where Fellowship is restored may it be an application Lord in our lives in our hearts may we take Lord from this and to see it Lord o God of Europe as David recorded at the Lord like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pity them that keep his commandments aetherium Lord we asked this Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen you love him because he first loved you aren't you glad for that the brand would say it like this it's to be united with him his life to be separated from him is dead now we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to happen it's following his rules following what he said do but my servant Caleb he had another spirit in him because he had followed me fully followed from that inner man it's following his rules following what he said stumbling and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant are you a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of duty but if he's off the path of duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of duty obligated obligated yes because we are in him he is in us he's obligated to his word what's he obligated to do he's obligated by his goodness to lead me to repentance when I need to repent he's obligated to correct me when I need correction he's obligated to his word when I can stand on his word he's obligated to his word that's why it's so powerful when you when repentance is what is it it's there it's God coming now to honor his word Oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen let's stand if you would if you're not able to that's fine go ahead see you deserve [Music] my hand is [Music] yes store Jesus [Music] there is [Music] Oh [Music] No [Music] desert yes Lord [Music] and I bless you

that godly sorrow it's something that just takes hold within the heart that's more listen to me that moves more than just about us but the godly sorrow is to realize Lord I've let fellowship be interrupted and it realizes the value of his presence in our life we value him and there's when we can realize that and think about that this is where godly sorrow works is recognizing Lord have let something come between me and you I value your presence your presence all let our hearts just be so in tune with that let us look away to Jesus let us look away and that perfect sacrifice look to the one whose love never changes whose love doesn't go up and down whose love is not conditional but it's an unconditional love I'm glad about that [Music] ravit ecology a man sing that song with Ryan
