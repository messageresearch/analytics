encourage them dear god we ask in jesus christ's name amen turn me in your bibles if you would to deuteronomy chapter 31 i want to read verses 7 and 8. i have uh brother paul and sister susie from my church here tonight amen i want to read starting at verse seven and moses called unto joshua and said it to him in the sight of all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord he it is that doeth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed amen you may be seated would like to speak tonight on is be strong and of a good courage be strong and have a good courage when israel was on their journey to the promised land there was a process that they went through there was three stages to their journey and god had given abraham the promise and they were on their journey to inherit the promise and they uh the three stages of the journey is justified by faith sanctified through the offering of his blood which christ had not yet come he was leading them he was in the he was it was the logos of god in the pillar of fire leading them but he had not come down yet and come flesh and so they had to offer up the blood of bulls and goats for their sin for an offering but and it was uh uh it was very fragile and they had to keep coming back time and time again making new offerings but that was part of their sanctification and then finally they came up to the promised land which was the third stage of the journey the third stage of this process of coming and they had not received yet their promise but they were on their journey to receive their promise and the the problem then came when they come to cadiz barnea and we know of course they sent out spies and we know that there was ten spies that came back and said the land is full of giants the cities are walled we're not able to go over there and take it and we know there was two joshua and caleb said we're more than able to take it and they were able to say that because they weren't looking at the circumstance what they were looking at was the promise but the other people got their eyes off the promise and began to look at the circumstance and so they come through two works of grace they come through justification and sanctification but they like many people have done they failed to go on to the holy spirit and uh you know they uh they were always questioning moses everything that moses did why every decision he made they questioned it and there's folks like that today they question everything you do they question the pastor on every decision he makes on every stand that he takes why why is he doing this why is he doing that and i think if he ought to do this and i think he ought to do that and you know if if that would be the way god would want it then god would have set it up that way you know there'd be a suggestion box in the back of the church and you would suggest to the pastor what he should do concerning each and every thing and then he would read those and go by that and then we'd have a bunch of confusion because everybody would have different suggestions but god don't lead that way god is the leader he is the shepherd of the flock and he leads the flock through someone that he's placed there as a shepherd amen he doesn't lead brother branham's toddler says he don't lead through a board of directors he doesn't lead through a board of trustees he doesn't lead through a board of deacons god leads through a pastor a shepherd that he places there and we've seen what happened to those that constantly questioned moses they never went over because they came down to the promised land and as they had questioned him on everything else they questioned him about this are you i don't think we can take this moses mostly it's promised to us but they doubted and because they doubted they died every one of them in the wilderness there was two said we're looking at the promise we know we're able to go over there we're going to get the holy ghost because it's promised to us what happens you know there's three courts and i know you're all familiar with the three courts of the body and the three courts of the tabernacle in the wilderness there was the the outer court the inner court and the holies of holies and what a lot of people do they come through sanctification justification and sanctification and that just brings them into the outer part you know they and uh they eat there but you see the manna that fell out there why it only lasted uh for a day and then the next day it had worms and it cankered and so they had to have more fresh manna to fall but they had took some mana that fell on the very first day that it fell they put it in a pot and they took that into the holies of holies and because it was in the holies of holies it never tankered it never it never spoiled it was always fresh and see what happens is a lot of people are they only make it through justification and sanctification and they stop there and so they're out there in that outer court and they're eating the food that's only going to last so long and that's why they go from revival to revival while the revival is on they're okay once the revival's over they're back out into the world again they're they're pretty good one time and then the next year they're not so good it's because they're out there in the outer court where they need to do come on into the holies of holies in other words what they need is to get born again to get the baptism of the holy spirit amen pardon me you know the bible says that we are written epistles read of all men so it's better to live a sermon than it is to preach one. live a sermon every one of us can live a sermon we can live the word what a lot of people do is they they come through justification and sanctification then they profess a high calling but they don't live up to it they can't the only way that you can live that way is to have the holy ghost people say i i want to live right i want to do right but there's just seems to be so much hindrance like i can't do it it's because you need to press on in and you say what do i got to do receive it it's a promise see they had to go over there and possess the land and that's what we've got to do the bible says in ephesians 4 22 says that ye put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so burn every bridge behind you get on in there to the holies of holies and then burn every bridge that leads back to the world burning burn every barrier that was there to try to hinder you burn it and go on go forward god's promised it to you it's what he's calling you to it belongs to you just claim it amen now in joshua the first chapter god is speaking to joshua moses has passed from off the scene moses has already told joshua be strong enough of a good courage and you that you're going to take the people over to inherit the land which god has given them and now god's speaking to joshua in chapter in chapter 1 verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee when god told him that that was telling him a lot because moses was a man moses wasn't perfect moses made mistakes but god never forsook him god never left him god's not going to forsake you he's not going to leave you as he was with moses so he'll be with you through your failures through your mistakes through your shortcomings god's not going to forsake you because friends it's not on your power that you're going to make it to heaven it's on the power and righteousness of jesus christ he didn't say that you would present yourself he said i will present to myself amen be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant has commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper wheresoever thou goest be strong and very courageous listen what he's telling him to be strong and courageous about that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee amen be strong and very courageous and keep the word even if you got to stand alone even if it seems like there's everyone's tanning against you you know why there is a church here because god sent a man that was willing to stand alone if he had to to do the work that god had called him to do i'm not saying to glorify my father but that is the fact and there's many of you that were here from the start that can testify to that and that's what god calls every pastor to do be strong and very courageous to stand on the word no matter what nobody else says no matter whether they understand you or not stand on the word if they are seat of god they'll come to it we're human and because we're human god's got to have patience with us and god requires the pastors to have patience with us because we're human amen not everybody comes to at the same time at the same rate at the same pace there's a time for everyone amen god is long suffering hallelujah this book of the law shalt thou not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt give shall have good success have not i commanded thee i wasn't a suggestion it wasn't just a good idea i have commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god it is with thee wheresoever thou goes friends look this journey we're on we're not on it by ourselves he's with us he's already made the journey and he made the way he said to where i i go away to prepare a place that where i am there you may be awesome and he's prepared he is the way amen and he shows brother branham said he called it journey in mercy he shows journey mercy he shows us mercy along our journey because as i said before the the blood of bulls and goats was fragile but since then christ has come and he shed his blood once and there anyone that comes under that shed blood is cleansed until the day of redemption amen and protected through the sanctifying process of the holy spirit once you receive the holy ghost then you're sealed to the day of redemption not just from one revival to the next i've seen people come to service and it was like every service they had to get saved because they they know they didn't live right throughout the week so every sunday night they had to come to the altar and get saved again but i'm going to tell you this if you're truly saved and you move right along through god's process and when you receive the holy ghost you don't even need to get saved again david didn't need to get saved again he said restoring me the joy of my salvation he didn't lose his salvation he just needed the joy of it restored and i think that's the way with many of us we need to get back to the way it was when we first got saved back to the feeling we had then back to the attitudes we had then back to the to where we looked and everywhere we looked we could see god [Applause] that newness never let that wear off many times after we've been around a while sometimes we get old and cranky we need to bring back the new again amen praise the lord the believers anchored until the day of redemption now brother adam says here in the message he says although you sin you've got an advocate tell god you're sorry come back that's the way to do it don't think you're cast off forever as long as you still have enough desire to come to this church come on god's still with you that's right sure he is yes he will just keep moving as long as he's called you he's still in the saving business to call you and he's calling and he's still wooing at your heart come on no matter what you've done god still wants to forgive you and take you back and love you a little bit hug you up to his bosom give you a few spiritual vitamins put you back in church in your position again he came to redeem to seek to save that which was lost now maybe tonight you're in the process of conversion maybe you haven't reached that stage if you have praise god pray for those who are still in that process amen instead of looking around and criticizing people amen pray for them when you receive the holy ghost that's when you're born again you're converted but conversion is not complete until you're sealed now the boxcar might be on its road to its destination but it had not sealed yet until everything's put in place and once everything's in there then they seal it up and she's ready and she's on her way amen brother brahm says here in the message of what is the holy ghost he says there's a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian there is a christian professed to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in the process of being a christian he has professed to believe it he's working to it but god has not given him the spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet reached that goal with god that god recognized it now god made a covenant with abraham after he called abraham which is a type of calling the believer today and he called abraham and abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land and dwelt among strange people and that was the type of when god calls a man to stop his meanness repent of his sins he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd among new types of people and then after god found abraham to be faithful to the promise that god gave him that he would have a child and through this child the earth would be blessed then god confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the holy spirit once god sees your faith then he'll seal you with the holy ghost now this promise is to all them that believe as many as the lord our god shall call amen ephesians 4 and 30 says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now when i read that what that tells me is that after you receive the holy ghost you still got to deal with this flesh because the the flesh doesn't get the holy ghost so the flesh still has the same uh things that that that it drew you to before you came to the lord and you've got to die to this flesh the flesh can still remember the things you did the flesh can still remember what they felt like what it tastes like in in the whole experience of it so you got to die to this flesh so you're going to have to battle against bitterness and wrath and anger and evil speaking because this flesh is out to do those things but if you have the holy ghost then if you make a mistake the holy ghost will bring you back around to make you correct the mistake you won't just go on that way but you'll be putting these things off from yourself and be ye kind one to another now sometimes i find that people don't have so much trouble being kind to other people but sometimes they have trouble being kind within their own families they get to know each other they know each other's faults they they and you know what leave those things alone don't go back and dig that stuff up we know they used to do this and they used to do that yeah i used to let's not talk about that let's not talk about the old man let's leave that guy buried [Applause] amen he put your sins in the sea of god's forgetfulness and brother dan daisy always said and he posted a sign that says no fishing stay out of there amen don't be bringing up that old man now this cleansing process that that you have it's constant we need it to be constant not just one time or one revival but we're in this flesh we're human so we need a constant cleansing process and that's why the bible says we have an advocate with the father it's jesus didn't just take our place and that was the end of it but we've got an advocate with the father but if any man sin all he's got to do is ask forgiveness with jesus and jesus is our advocate before the father i like the way that god showed brother branham about that blood bumper you know god doesn't even see it because he's looking through the blood of jesus christ so don't let the devil condemn you you see there's a difference between being convicted and condemned conviction brings you to make things right get back on track but condemnation is to put you down amen so don't listen to the condemnation of the devil because god doesn't see it as long as you're under the blood now i'm not talking about going out and just living in sin i'm talking about the christian who's born again filled with the holy ghost but is human and makes mistakes that's under the blood and all you got to do to keep it there is just confess your sins and he's faithful and just to forgive you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness he's ever living making intercession for the christians praise the lord and that keeps the christian clean both day and night safely tucked in by the holy spirit he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into the judgment but it's passed from death and to life the bible says has never come into condemnat the condemnation but it means the judgment the christian doesn't have to go through the judgment because we're judged here judgment begins for the christian at the house of the lord and we judge ourselves by the word as it comes forth and when it points out things in our life instead of us going around saying man i'll tell you what he really fried me today instead of that just get right i've come and preached sermons years ago in my church and i'd have people come up to me afterwards and say man you really were whipping us today and i didn't even come for that i didn't even think i was but i didn't know i don't know everything that's going on but he does and you do you know what's going on with you you know where you're at amen so if you get your toes stepped on don't pull them back just get right amen christ is our attorney we mentioned that i think on sunday about what job said about is there a days man that can put one hand on a holy man and the other hand on us on a sinful man a holy god and another hand on a sinful man so he's our attorney and he took our place and he pled our case and told the father they're they were ignorant they didn't mean to do it he's our attorney now do you know why you get an attorney in in this natural life because they know the law and you don't they study it they went to school for it and you didn't that's why i think any man that says i don't want an attorney i'll just stand for myself here in this this day in this court there's something wrong with them because let he that thinks he knows so much he's going to get himself into a lot of trouble but you get you get a lawyer that knows and i'm going to tell you something we've got a lawyer that's been there we've got a lawyer that died for our sins he took all of our sins on him and he was sent to hell for our sins and he came back and he has the keys of death and hell and he's conquered the devil he's conquered death he's conquered hell he's conquered sin and he did it for you and i he took our place and pled our case amen that's why today you're free amen brother branham was talking in a message be not afraid and he was talking about a little methodist preacher friend of his and he said he brought him up there and laid in the room the other night until three o'clock in the morning and said he he went down the river some prayer praying and his wife had done got the holy ghost then last night he come through and he liked to tore up the place run out and got his brother and sister-in-law and they got the holy ghost i'm telling you the methodists are going to get a shaking down in kentucky in a few days it's real god's holy spirit and it's for the methodist and for the baptist let me tell you denominational people here of methodist and presbyterian when these people here call themselves pentecost that don't mean it's an organization you can't organize pentecost you can have a denomination but pentecost is an experience for whosoever will let him come whether he's baptist presbyterian methodist black yellow brown white don't make any difference what color he is how big he is how little he is how low he is how bad she is doesn't make a bit of difference it's for whosoever will it's god's cleansing process for his church god's not known by intellectual powers god is known by experience through the holy ghost i like that old song i was there when it happened [Applause] amen the devil tries to tell you point out all your sin tell you that you didn't get it but the song says i was there when it happened so i guess i ought to know amen it why it was an experience hallelujah the devil will always come and try to make you doubt that experience he'll point out this and point out that and point out this and you'll say but i had this experience yeah but what about this and what about this and what about this right when i'm saying these things i'm not talking about somebody just walking out from service to service and just living out in sin i'm talking about mistakes people make because they're human because we're in the flesh that didn't get the holy ghost when i got the holy ghost this outside body didn't get it this outside body is a reflection of the fall this outside body is a reflection of sin what sin did it's getting old it's getting it's already gone bald it's it's going grave with what it's got left you know and and and it's going downhill it's a reflection of the fall but one of these days this outside is going to start reflecting what's already took place on the inside amen the inside is a reflection of eternal life the inside is a reflection of another body that is to come yet hallelujah the approach to this birth is it's like any other process of anything that lives anything that lives before it can live again it's got to die first so we had to die first we've got to die to self we got to die with our lamb our lamb died we've got to die with it like abel died with his lamb on the altar we've got to die with our lamb die to self amen you've got to die like christ died you got to die on the altar hallelujah you got to die to your own thinking to be born again to his thinking now i have uh had the i say i always say the privilege of being able to observe ducks we had some and ducks are little baby ducks when you get them you know little yellow things or whatever color they are and they're cute and whatever you know and they don't know nothing and but the first time you ever show them water they go to it like they were born to it you don't have to teach them how to swim first time i put water down in there with them while they started diving under the water and swimming under the water and coming back up and just playing and frolicking around just little baby ducks brother brown talked about it duck that had been born in a chicken yard and he said you know chickens don't like water they they drink out of a little thing of water but they don't like to get in water chickens can't swim and not like a duck and it said uh they were going along one day and all of a sudden that duck caught a whiff of water and when he smelled that water he had never smelt water before in his life but when he smelt that water it called to him and away he went said that old mother him was cluck and stay away from there don't go to there don't do that but away in that water he went brother adam said we've got a big pool tonight and if you're smelling the water from heaven then you need to get to the water because that's the first step in the process is to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen for the remission of your sin repent and be baptized amen so he said if you got a whiff of heaven tonight that god keeps his word and you haven't received the holy ghost yet smell the water it's the first thing he said do repent from the bottom of your heart lay yourself on the sacrifice on the altar be con let the world be consumed born again of the spirit go through the right process not come and shake hands with a preacher put your name on the book but die so dead that you don't know the world no more now we spoke earlier about the three uh courts in the tabernacle now one time you know of it they brought aaron's rod into the holies of holies aaron's rod was a dead stick amen it had been cut down and no doubt whittled and hewed a little bit you know to where it would just be a good good staff you know for it and and so they i don't know what they did to preserve it but they would have done something to preserve it and then they brought it into the holies of holies and according to the scripture that dead dry stick butted forth amen blossomed and brought forth almonds amen you might come across people that you think there ain't nothing to be done about them but i'll tell you what i don't care who they are or what they've done or what they're in if you ever get into that holies of holies it'll bring dead dry sticks back to life [Applause] that's what people need that's how you you know you say well it seems like i just keep doing this and i keep doing that and i keep and i'm having such a hard time you need to get in the holies of holies amen take that dead life and lay it in the holies of holies a process of blood water and sanctification yeah hallelujah brother ram says if she's the honoriest woman in the city or the worst gambler there is you'll hear him stand some morning and give a testimony that'll shake the shingles on the top of the house hallelujah hallelujah hi some of you have known for years and years i know where you came from i knew your lives and i know your testimonies and you've got some great testimonies amen and you know there's some that have been raised their whole life pretty much around this message and that don't mean they don't got a great testimony they got a great testimony also because i'm going to tell you something there's a lot of folks that were raised around this message that are out there in the world not living it they don't want nothing to do with it they've turned their back on it not only that but they can't keep their mouth shut they got to try to find fault and that ain't good enough they got to post it on the internet god help them i would not want to be in their shoes because i'm going to tell you something friends i believe it's blasphemy i i that that's my opinion now i don't usually preach my opinion but that's my opinion i believe it's blasphemy because they're saying they're saying something against the work of the holy ghost once you come to christ i think we spoke about this on sunday then it's testing time it's time to be tested first come through a sanctifying process brother branham said then you must be tested in your life all of you had it see this testing time every son that cometh to god is first scourged chastened and chastised if we cannot stand chastisement then it shows we're not children of god we're bastards and not children of god but if you can stand chastisement knowing that all things work together for the good of them that love the lord everything i've been through things where i had somebody come up to me at the death of a loved one or something say i don't know what good can come out of this well the very person that said that to me got saved out of it something good came out of it all things work together for the good of them but love the lord amen i'm so glad he first loved me amen then he seals us with the holy ghost until the day of our redemption and then there's the things that we go through brother braham says in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals he said another thing a seal signifies is ownership the seal has a mark on it shows ownership and when you're bought by the blood of jesus christ and sealed by the holy ghost you're no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by god another thing is seal is security seal means you are secure now you that don't believe in eternal security i don't know but now but a seal signifies security to its destination woe into that guy that would try to break that seal and the holy spirit seal cannot be broken you've all heard me say that people said the devil made me do this no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in then because when you're sealed in he sealed out now you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way he could get into you is to come through the same process that you did he'd have to get saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then he'd be your brother see so he didn't do it no you just went to the borderline and came back lusting for the things of the world uh what he means by the borderline he's talking about cadiz barnea they came up to the border of the promised land and he said they come to the border line and went back lusting for the things of the world never went all the way over into canaan across jordan the death to self the devil can't get you he can't do it because he has to as brother brown said come through the same process that you did he can't get you he can't come through that so no matter how powerful the devil may seem he's just a bluff because he's already been beat now as humans we couldn't take the devil on one on one ourselves but we don't have to because god told us he was going to go with us he said he would never leave us nor forsake us therefore he told us don't fear the devil don't be afraid of me because i'm with you and jesus has already defeated the devil so he's already lost hallelujah it's like a young man playing in a football game playing on he's playing on the line and uh the other the other team comes up to the line and they start talking all kinds of trash you know and he just says look at the scoreboard you can talk all the trash you want but look at the scoreboard devil you've already lost amen praise the lord [Applause] now we're going through a process to come to that new body amen we got born again we got the holy ghost on the inside it changed our soul made us a new man made us new a new woman made us a new person one of these days we're going to pick up that theophany we're going to step from here into that theophany and you know the theophany takes the place of your human spirit and all those memories you have the whole human spirit are going to be wiped away isn't that right and what the bible says hallelujah you know you'll be sitting there at the marriage supper of the lamb and you may look around and say i don't see so-and-so but but jesus is going to come by and wipe all that away so you can be happy not worried about wondering why didn't so and so make it not that we'd necessarily be wondering if somebody don't make it wouldn't know why they didn't make it they never got born again they never got the holy ghost you've got to have the wedding garment on isn't that right and what the holy ghost types hallelujah one of these days the dead in christ are going to rise see they're they're in their theophany now they're in a dimension of heaven in their theophany and they're not feeling any pain they don't need to eat they don't need to sleep they're just fellowshipping there's no day or night it's this day and they're just fellowshipping and having a good time and if they if you gave them an opportunity to come back they wouldn't want to come back [Music] the only time they want to come back is when it's a time for resurrection because see they're not perfect yet they without us are not made perfect yet they've got to come back and get their glorified body they got to come back into a body you know what what is the body made out of anyway it's made out of brother and said petroleum and potash and cosmic lights and atoms and and that and you know i've often thought on the the the curse that was put on the serpent and you know we believe he walked around like like a man he was the closest thing to man but he was a beast he had a place for a soul but he didn't have one but he was the closest thing to man but then he was cursed to crawl on his belly now what happened to it god just changed you know we're made up of molecules so god just changed the molecular structure of the serpent and he no longer walked up right he put enmity between his seat and the seat of the woman so no longer can that boundary be crossed there's a breach there now and so he crawls on his belly so what's gonna what's gonna happen to us that are alive and remain you see our molecule structure is a little out of whack that's why we grow old that's why we get sick that's why we experience diseases but he's going to change that molecular structure and it's going to become a glorified body hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord amen hallelujah let's stand praise the lord heavenly father we're thankful lord to be here tonight we're thankful for your word we ask dear god that you've come and blessed us with your word lord that we would take it to heart dear god lord you know everyone here you know who needs the holy ghost and who has the holy ghost and lord this message wasn't meant in any way lord god to look down on anyone but lord to lift them up to make them aware dear god that if they don't have it it's still promised to them they can have it all they got to do is just receive it lord it's a a promise it's a gift it's not anything we do to earn it you've told us to repent and be baptized and then this promise is to everyone many those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call and if god's called him then lord that promise is to him lord no man can come except the father calls him and lord they wouldn't be here tonight unless you'd call them lord i pray to god those that need the holy ghost dear god that you lord god will come and by your word that lord god give them the holy ghost lord may they take this word in may dear god as they're set under the ministry of their pastor dear god that they be born again lord god by the word of god which is the way the way the gentile is born again dear god lord i ask god bless those dear god i hope that i pray that they were encouraged tonight those that already have made that journey and already have had that boxcar sealed but they'd be encouraged tonight because many times the devil comes and tries to convince us we don't have it but lord god like we said about the song we know we got it because we were there we went through the experience we know that we know hallelujah thank you lord jesus lord god it's we're not dependent on this flesh this flesh is not a reflection of the holy ghost but that inner man that takes control the control tower lord takes control of this outer man this flesh being brings it in subjection to the word it says no no no you're not going to do that lord why because the desire that's on the inside that desire for sin is gone lord the desire on the inside is to live for you lord we ask these things in jesus christ's name your blessings on the people in jesus name amen let's sing that song
