every one of you to see everyone here tonight amen we want to look into the word into Psalms 142 if you'd like to turn there with me to save it just had a was a very rewarding time there with the the pastors and wives get away I'm tired I'm refreshed in my in my spirit but with I know brother Paul sister Rebekah as well or are tired as well and we have been at it there and just hosting all of the other pastors that had come in and we just just had such a wonderful time just a lot of rich things that were really spoken in and said and that the Lord really used to really encourage us and a lot of a lot of healing and strengthening that had taken place we have pastors from all over many from the other parts of Canada clear down from Florida and all over that that flew in with their wives to be there and it just was a real time of refreshing and so even though my what to me I would rather have right now my spirit refreshed than my body I can get my body refreshed so I know that all that will all come together so we just want to look to the word tonight and just what the Lord will have force you love you amen in a wonderful hour to be serving the Lord a man it's just a wonderful time you know when we sing that song there I stand redeemed we're not that song is sung in many many many places but for some they sing the song I stand redeemed but they only think of Redemption as a term of just forgiveness and redemption is much deeper than forgiveness because forgiveness you still did it you still did it but Redemption it brings you back to where you never did do it because the real you on the inside is not the one who did those things that's what real true redemption is God coming to claim what is his own amen and that wonderful Amen let's just as we have our Bibles open could we just pray just here for a moment and I just like to remember sister Shirley crescent prayer brother brother Dave had actually text me here a little earlier and and asked that that we would pray for sister Shirley a special prayer tonight she's not the kidney doctor had said certain elevated levels within her kidneys and they're wanting to for her to see a specialist and in those things she's not been feeling real well she's also she wasn't here with brother Dave Crest's on on Sunday and service and we just want to offer up just even a special prayer for our sister tonight that the Lord will just be merciful and just touch her in a real special way let's just go before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we count this such a wonderful privilege and opportunity Lord to be able to come together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith Lord we are standing here father truly in need of you and Lord within that need Lord we stand here because we believe that Lord you are the one to minister to us Lord and give us the strength that we have Nita for you are our high priest Lord that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities Lord that throne of grace the Lord that we have meet of tonight in the time of trouble and we're thankful tonight Lord God the Lord Jesus for your grace Lord God and your mercy upon our lives and Lord we offer up Lord our sister Shirley offering up prayer for her tonight Lord you see the need that's there in her body and Lord we just pray tonight that you would just move upon her body and give her strength Lord Jesus I pray that God that you'll just take control of those levels Lord their and their kidneys you know Lord exactly Lord we're to take the stone Lord all we're doing Lord is giving ourselves Lord and and father to the sling Lord that you would direct the stone Lord to the giant's forehead Lord tonight Lord we ask it Lord for your glory and we just pray that you would guide us Lord in your word tonight Lord by your spirit father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's read here Psalms 142 of David it says I cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication I want you to take notice hear my supplication so the supplication of David is making his request known unto God what is what is the desire and he said I poured out my complaint before him now you and I in our in our thinking if I said you know brother joy poured out his complaint to me immediately in our thinking we would say well what's he complaining about that's not what this word complaint means here it means his meditation the things that's deep that's on his heart that's what he's been meditating about and so you say well God sees what I'm thinking about that's true God knows what's on our heart God knows even the troubles and the burdens of what you have on your heart or God knows all of those things but to think of it if you can come before him what an honor that is because you are letting him know you're the one who can help me you're the one who can help me that in itself is honor that's honor once you think of this I poured out my complaint before him I showed before him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed with then thou knewest my path in the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me I looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul I cried unto thee O Lord I said thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living attend unto my cry for I am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me amen may God bless his word as you're being seated tonight but look here in the word I want to just take a little thought here on that he is our refuge and when we considered this the Lord Jesus Christ being our refuge a place we see this in many in many different shadows through the scripture when we look at through the Old Testament that God had places that were reserved for his people that he would meet with them places that God even gave them on the other side of Jordan when they were preparing to to cross Jordan God gave them places of cities of refuge and then even after they crossed into the land there were certain cities that were not left to them but God designated these cities of refuge and they were places that they could go and and they when there were things that had taken place they were able to go there and not just when there were things that we could look at and say when one had you know the ax had come out of his hand and and against and smoke maybe a an individual and that individual died then they could they could flee to that that refuge and they would find safety there and they they were to abide there and they were safe within their because truly the desire that they had was not to slay that other individual so there was a refuge that was that was provided for them and you find that even in in our lives and in the journey of through the Word of God for God's purpose in our life there is one refuge and that is the Lord Jesus Christ we're in that as it says very clearly in the scriptures that in that day and that's that's this day since the offering up of Calvary and since the blood has been shed and now there's an entrance that we have into the very presence of God to actually come in to the very body of Jesus Christ we coming into that place of refuge it's a place of safety it's a place that everything that we have need of is there within him no matter what it is that you face or what you go through God's already provided everything that we have need of for you and I there's new circumstances there's new things that we come into that if we had known about it maybe at that time it would have taken us back but God knows exactly what and what it is and what we have need of as we come in to circumstances and situations in our life because you might and we have to remember that we belong to him and God knows exactly what he's doing in our life it's not us taking God and making God move according to our way but it's rather us submitted to him and God performing his word within our life and so even the pathways and even the tests and the trials that you and I would come to come through every one of those tests and trials as we've looked at those are not things that are just by chance or things that just happen but every one of them is uniquely directed and ordered by God because God knows what lays within each and every one of you he knows the potential that lay within each and every one of you and I want you to think of this what if an individual you know let's take for example maybe a medical student or someone you know maybe like a doctor you know they can read the books they can go through the tests they can mess with the dummies and do all the different things that are going on but there has to be a place to where that even as they're watching the other individuals in the room the doctors are speaking to them maybe the hand different things to them there has to come a place to where that they would have a confidence but in order to have that confidence in themselves there's got to be someone who's able to see beyond any of their nervousness their tenseness and be able to see that there is a potential there and the only thing that's needed is to be able to tap that potential and when one greater than them has tapped that potential it automatically begins to removal even that of the nervousness the anxiousness because they realize and they have to see this that someone who has already been down the paths of where I'm now starting has sees something in me that they're even able to place a confidence and say here do this and that's the same way that with God God knows what lays within every one of our lives as children of God as seeds of God everything that every Apple every leaf everything is within that germ that lays within that seed it's nothing now where there's being apples added to you or there's being leaves added to you and I but everything that is within us God already so that within that seed but it takes conditions it takes things in order to bring that out and as we're moving and we're walking in the Lord we find that truly he is an ever-present help in the time of trouble you might have found that scripture to be real when you're on your job you might have found that to be real when you're at home you might have found that to be real when you're driving on the road you say well I'm here I'm here but remember you're dwelling in Christ if you've been born of the Spirit of God you have the ever-present promise of the comforter that lo I am with you always whithersoever thou goest so God is watching over all of these places and the deployments that he has for our life sometimes you and I might want to go from here to here but yet God knows exactly what to win when to bring us into the place that he has for us because from here to here there can be many junctions along the way that is necessary to bring us into position so that when we get here we're able to move where God wants us to move and how he wants us to move so God has all of this it's already been planned out I'll tell you the truth tonight it's already your life in my life it's already been pre-planned and you look at and you say well brother send me how can you save that well it's really simple when we can just look at the word in Psalms 139 and David begin to think about the thoughts that God had toward him and David said you know they just did it just overwhelms me to think of them the sum of those and to recognize that now you and I can look in and say but what about all my mistakes what about all your mistakes you say well God you mean God pre-planned my mistakes no God did not pre plan as far as to make you and I make a mistake but the Bible does say that the them that are called according to his purpose all things work together not that all things are good but all things work together for our good so there's things that you and I are able to look at and to learn from and God will teach us the Spirit of God will teach us many things just like the Spirit of God taught Joshua when and when Moses sent 12 spies over Joshua was able to be taught and Joshua was able to look at it and he never thought of himself to be better than Moses it's just simply that the unction of the Spirit of God helped him to see that 12 is too many just send 2 in so he was able to glean from that and see something within the life of someone else and I I really believe that with all my heart that we indeed are the body of Jesus Christ and as a body we need one another and what I mean by we need one another we need the Christ that is in one another to be expressed because it's things that God knows that you and I that what's needed there's little things that you know you can't do it all on your own I can't do it all on my own you might say well buddy I mean you're the pastor I'm not doing this all on my own it is you and I committed together unto the Lord and God knows exactly within each and every part there's certain things that you might be praying for an answer and you're praying and you're praying and it said I've got to open my Bible today and you're opening your Bible and my you're reading us and my what wonderful things I've read today and yet you feel like I still don't have the answer to what I'm going through and then maybe you put on a message in you're listening to a message and you say my is wonderful things but I just still feel like I don't have the answer you're not doing wrong by what you've done what it is is just expect because God knows what you have need of and it might be that there might be a testimony that's given it might be a song that God will speak to you through it might be another brother another sister let me tell you something in all things its Christ himself moving and declaring to you and I that we are not on an island isolated to ourselves but we are a body of believers and we need one another and it's Christ himself of how that he will speak through one another that's wonderful in it he not puts us in a place of expectation to where that even if we go we're going to a place they even have coffee with one another let's be expecting because you don't know what God is going to do even in that moment so I look at this he is our refuge on we know this and we understand that that Christ it's not it's not a doctrine he's a person Amen this this message that God has sent to you and I did not introduce to us I'll reintroduce if I can say it this way our Bible but it was the making known and the introducing to us of the very person of Jesus Christ and through that he raises up and makes this Bible real to you and I not just something that we can read and say wow that's good my that sounds good but we're reading it not from that angle but we're reading it and realized that this is our script you with me this is our script now you might look at this verse tonight or another verse and you might seem like well I don't you discharge of that blood that paid a ransom that through that the life could come forth that's the same thing in you and I when the tests and trials come our way there is a part in our life there's a dying there's a dying there is a there is a real true discharge of our own life it's a releasing of our life but as interesting as that fading away and releasing of our life it's where his life then comes to the forefront God knows all of this he has this completely in his hands so it changes prayer it changes everything so it doesn't just remove but to think of it of how that really been remember he told the the the young man remember the young man had that prayer book you know and he said he took the prayer book and he had been praying those prayers and and he took that prayer book and he threw it in the fire he said it don't work you remember that Christ revealing his own word brother Ram talks about it I think was one of his relatives and nephews are one of them brother Graham talks talks to him about he said will you pray wrong now what you think of this he didn't say you know what the problem was was that prayer book he said you pray wrong he's getting to the principle not so much of what's said but the principle behind it he says we do not pray to change God's mind we don't pray to change God's mind he said we pray that we might fit God's will so that that takes it down to where it whether that's a prayer this long a prayer this long it always comes down the I will be done in earth even as it is in heaven what is already wrote out for my life to be expressed Lord give me the grace that your will can be declared and made owned through my life so here the Bible tells us in the book of James it says take my brother and the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of a tender mercy is any among you skipping to verse 13 is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing songs if he is afflicted let him pray you know there's a difference in how we pray when we feel we're on the mountaintop there's a difference whenever I mean when you everything just seems like my everything just your spirit everything's in order and maybe you're driving down the road a man is just a time that you know you're just able to pray just everything so easy but when there is affliction when there's things that comes our way our prayer is different and it's not that we're not sincere but our prayer changes and our prayer in the difference of that time is really as we're looking to the Lord we're seeking from God what we have need of now what you think of this as we said earlier we are a body of believers and there's a lot of things that times that maybe that you've go through and I go through there's times where you could come you could call me and say brother Samuel would you would you just pray for me I'm going through something we'd be glad to pray for you there's times that with things that you could go through and you could you know you could come to me and I could search brother I could search for words you know because I would want to try to help you to encourage you and sometimes you know when you look at it sometimes there's situations where you're in the middle that time and words fail you as a pastor I don't have a reserved rolodex of words then although this problem came up go to see 94 section 1 Part B and pull that word on death then we don't have that you might say this is the same situation that you had two weeks ago in your office it don't work that way God knows about the Scriptures tell us he knows his sheep by name that's deeper than on Bill joy Carmen Irma Carlos Richard we're not talking about name like that he knows your character your makeup your temperament he knows how to speak to you if you're a timid person he don't come and boom bullet boil it down he knows how to speak to you because what he's interested in is getting his word to you and helping you what humility by the mighty God that would come down and meet you and I that way I'll tell you that to me makes me want to go in the corner and just cry and rejoice a little bit and cry some more to think how he would come down that way but to think about it David said it right here in Psalms 142 he said when I looked around me I found no man for a refuge there was no one that could care for my soul what David is recognizing there's there's people around him that love him ain't that wonderful to have people around you to love you it's wonderful to have big body of believers it's wonderful to have a husband a wife and children other it's wonderful to have those to have people around you that love you and care for you but there is times in our life that even the closest of people that we cannot find a refuge we cannot find a release within that you know there's times that yesterday maybe I could sit down with my wife and the Holy Spirit will say something right there that'll just help me and encourage me but you know there's other times then that you may not come in that way but in the midst of it in at all it's got to be the Lord and in many of those times when you find that oh my don't resort to anything else but please resort to prayer and say Lord you know what I'm going through you know what I'm feeling and what are you doing you're pouring out your complete before he them you said why would I want to part my complaint before him there is no greater honor that you can give the Lord Christ than to take your needs to him in prayer and say Lord I got need right here Lord I need strength right here I need a direction right here I need answer right here Lord I need to know what do you think about this Lord my spirit seems all shaken up but I need to know what you think you know what that is that's honoring him for who he really is the greatest honor that you could give me as your pastor say pray for me brother Samuel the greatest honor I could even give you is walk up to you and not only say God bless you but say brother joy will you pray for me this week hi there just something that I just need God's help I need his direction that's an honor you know why because what I'm saying is I believe that God will hear your prayer hallelujah he is our refuge when I turned I found no man I found no one to care for my soul but he I poured out my complaint before him when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path hallelujah any afflicted among you let him pray but say now when I'm afflicted I I don't necessarily have maybe the greatest prayer say listen godson I'm worried about great prayers it would just be like if you came to me or one of my boys came to me and they asked me for something they don't say dear daddy my father you are such a wonderful daddy you you you know what their poor not dead dad I need help in here in the kitchen something just happened so they don't know there ain't no formalities like we got to read this much or say this or go through a doxology it's make contact with him you you got a need your need we'll bring Jesus on the scene just like that hallelujah because through those things he makes himself known to you personally that he cares for you hallelujah I look at this in the scripture I look at these these particular parts here as I as I look over this and I find within the church the early church of how that here God starts a work here the Ministry of the Resurrection that has a rose and after the Ministry of a resurrection remember it's pointing them to the oncoming promise he identifies himself among the elect of God that I am the promised Messiah redemption has come I am the promised Redeemer so he's opening their understanding to who he is and with that it also directs them into the promise of his coming when he will come in them on the day of Pentecost and so he's directing them in faith to this thing wanna what a great event and they approach it with such joy in their heart and to see how that God is getting ready think about this you think they're approaching it with joy as they return from the mount of all of that belief to Jerusalem they're going with joy God is going to meet them with joy because God has desire to get back inside of man and now through and by the provided way God is going to be able to move down inside of man but remember in this moving down inside of man it's God raising up his children by Redemption who it is that he foreknew and within that foreknowledge God knows each and every one of them God knew exactly where they would be God knew exactly where Philip would end up God knew exactly where Andrew would end up he knew exactly where Paul would end up God knew exactly where they would end up and God knows exactly where you and ass end up I'm not talking about heaven or hell when I'm talk about ending up I'm talking about God knows every part of the journey he knows every part of our life and that in the real truth about it is is that in the midst of it sometimes we get too comfortable and God knows exactly how to bring us out of that comfort within ourselves it doesn't remove us from the comfort in him it gets us out of our the comfort of our own selves but you got to remember God God is doing that because we're part of his program and want you to look here in the scriptures with me just for a few moments in Acts chapter 4 verse 23 and when you look at this here in the scriptures it says and they being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them now this is Peter in John they've just they've just been preaching great miracle things have taken place and now here they've been brought before the chief priests and now they're on their way back to come around the rest of the disciples and when they heard that there's the rest of the of the believers when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord thou art God which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is now what I want I want you to watch now is how that they when this persecution came when they returned and spoke to the rest of the believers what had taken place the rest of the believers were moved together in one Accord and what they did was a very important thing they recognized that the Lord Jesus Christ was their refuge and they said Lord thou art God you know what they did they took their situation the threatenings and all these things that are put around they took that and they said this is not above you this is beneath you Lord you already you created heaven and earth all of these things this is beneath you it's not above you it's not beyond you we place this beneath you you are in control Lord and watch how they look at this verse 25 who by the mouth of thy servant David had said who Christ who God said by the mouth of his servant David see how God's quickening this word to them right now this is in this place of refuge why did the heathen rage and the people imagine being things they're not out of place they're not out of sorts it's not like what Oz what's one the world's going on this is perfectly identified in the word you see the word being identified where they're at it's given them peace the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ forever truth against the Holy Child Jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for it to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council determined before to be done oh my and now Lord behold their threatenings behold Lord their threatenings and grant watch out they what's what they say and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word they take in the situation and what they're taking it and placing it there all of these threatenings not when it says Lord behold their threatenings I don't know I just happen to believe that they didn't have a prayer meeting of just rehearsing all the threatenings they just come ladies took it all together and said behold all their threatenings well or do you see this happening in my life you see this happening you see this happening now he knows all that and you can pour all that out but what I'm trying to say all of those things like that they took it all and said Lord behold all of this you see within it all it's not an it's not so much that we had a call everything out it's just that we're taking that situation and we're putting it before him and say Lord you're above this and grant to me Lord that the world what what is placed there inside of me but it will come forth in a greater boldness by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of that Holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with boldness and the multitude it goes on it says the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that that are of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and was great power gave the Apostles witness on the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon the night and we should deal with this scripture probably a lot but when you get to looking at this here this right here in that scripture how many events actually took place within that the Bible says with great power that that God the Apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus you know right now he would be like here saying right here in this assembly and with great power gave the believers witness and believers spoken word Tabernacle of the Lord Jesus Christ you a witness in your workplace you a witness in your home you a witness on the job you a witness it's cool you see what it is it's Christ witnessing out and thundering out his life through us because the reality of it is we're not here desiring our own glory we want to see him glorified neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as we're possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the Apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and what you look at this what has taken place here but here they've the Lord is so directed them to go and to sell their things and begin to they brought everything together and they distributed according to everyone's need the Bible says they had all things in common and here they were they're still at Jerusalem they're still here they're still dwelling in this time the Spirit of God is moving among them even when this first test or trial comes up the Spirit of God it moves among them has risen in them and they recognize that that resurrection in them has positioned them in the City of Refuge and they recognize there's not a destroyer there's nobody can touch them that can take their life there's nothing can happen to them until God is finished with them but had to be a recognition that God is above the circumstances that I faced him hallelujah he is our refuge here they are they're here gathering at Jerusalem but God's got a need that this word has got to go forth it's true the Bible says beginning at Jerusalem but it didn't say beginning at Jerusalem and ending at Jerusalem and staying at Jerusalem it said beginning at Jerusalem there's a beginning to your life there's a beginning in your spiritual walk is that right there's got to be a start in Jesus Christ there's got to be a place of where that you can put your foot down in know and recognize that my life has been changed that Christ is alive in my heart and there's a beginning but from that beginning then Christ God's you and I along to bring out what he has in our life he wouldn't matter all the attributes of a father all the attributes of a mother that isn't a man relevant attributes of mothers not in the man matter what they think today let me clarify that the the attributes of a daddy of a husband are inside of man but you know there ain't nothing can bring that out except his mate its spouse you know there's attributes that within a to be a mother to be a wife but those attributes can't express themselves just when she's by herself there has got to be things that happen to release those attributes and God knows the attributes all the parts of our life and how that there are things that must transpire all of these things in order to release that you see when we can look at it in that way by God's grace then our focus it shifts from the trial to him see when they were praying you see what prayer will do prayer will actually shift you when you're praying for God's will it'll shift you from focusing on just the trial and it'll shift it to what's his will because prayer is a is a divine communication that's given for you and I of a part for us to stay in contact with God there's a lot of things that as I said you could talk with me you can talk with one another and there are all times there's times for that but friends I'm Italian no matter what you're going through even if you get an answer you come and you talk to or text me or one or more and you would get an answer that God would give you through me that does not negate nor do away with prayer there's got to be before you I would suggest before you even call or before you even come I would suggest that you be in prayer and then even after the answer comes take it and be in prayer because sure is enough as you go rejoicing that I've got the answer the devil also he is intimidated by your reception of that word and because Satan is intimidated he'll try somewhere along the line to try to trip you up but remember you run like a faithful messenger that you've got a message from God God has spoke personally to you and you can take that to the Lord in prayer and I'll tell you this right here as you get before God in prayer those things that are taking place in secret the Lord God will reveal it openly what is that that is that third pole Christ in you what is it secret now coming forth persecution arose the Bible says let me just read a few verses here acts 8 chapter 1 and Saul was consenting unto his death the most even and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem now what you notice he notice what the scripture said at that time there's times aren't there there's times of trials or times of things there's times at that time there was a great persecution God knows all of this is being divinely orchestrated by God this isn't like God planting you and then God said somehow I hope there's not deal force winds I hope it's not so bad that it'll snap them tomato plants and snap them God I'm worried because the strength is in the roots god is not worried you and I can feel those things but our refuge is here it's him I mean to think of it what would it be like if I got sugar in my house and then my boys won't take the sugar from my house they got to go somebody else's house I got sugar in my house you need sugar there's sugar there you don't got to go anywhere else he is the place of refuge you need healing healings there you need strength strength is here you need to live it's deliverance is here I'm not talking about in so much in this building I'm talking about in Christ and Christ in you there lays everything that you have need of glory we're not talking about going up to Jerusalem to worship there's been a transfer it's no longer going to Jerusalem to worship but drawed has made from Christ being the place of worship now that the promise has been poured out you are his place of worship Christ in you the hope of glory it's in Christ that we are dwelling that's the great mystery at that day you shall know that I'm and the father the father and me I and you you and me dwelling in our refuge the Lord Jesus Christ he's dwelling in us and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles so God knew who to scatter all right now I don't it doesn't say that there weren't things that they didn't say him mom why don't we all gotta split up man we got a communal thing going here let's just build one big apartment building and you all have one B he'll have to be he'll have three C God didn't want a communal gospel he didn't want a communist come on somebody the gospel is to go out to reach his children and it's Christ in you and me that packs the message so here the Bible goes on to say in verse 3 as for Saul he made havoc of the church what I thought this was your church is this the same church where great power was upon the apostles and great mighty miracles and works were been done it was if this is God's church how could he louse all to make havoc of it he's not the author of confusion he knows just exactly what he's doing entering into every house hauling men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word no doubt about it that they may had to get over the place of leaving Jerusalem but when I look at the Bible it doesn't give a lot of very lot of space between verse 3 and verse 4 listen friends you know what it comes down to it comes down to us trusting the Lord when things don't make sense and that happens a whole lot we have to trust him because he does have our life in his hands there's some times where there's things that will happen and I'm not talking about because you know we've done something where maybe you said something on a in a certain shift and you got angry with somebody and you said bless God they're persecuting me no no you get moved to another apartment is God letting you know that he's not going to tolerate that behavior you don't care if you are his children but there are times when there's things that happens and God will move from this place to that place there's a purpose that's greater than what you and I can understand what should I do in that moment preach the word and say I'm a sister preach the word live it through your life sometimes you know the preaching of the word is not the preaching of all of the well you know sitting down and I'm gonna you know go through the Godhead with someone sometimes they need to see the Godhead reflected in flesh it's the revealing of Christ moving in our lives in these situations it's not about our knowledge if they win by knowledge they were not a went forth preaching the word if they would have went by their reasonings that when they went forth preaching the word but they were scattered and you see God knew God knew what he had placed in him he knew that within that seat it's just like in though in many things there is sometimes even when a message and different things that sent you know there's things that are points within that message that they can tell exactly where you were at certain little parts you were at this place at this particular time or more there's certain little things that can be encoded in there and that's why they go into all this stuff to encryption you know God's words encrypted God's words encrypt that it's been hidden in here the no amount of spies can get it out but all the Holy Spirit can reveal it and he reveals the encryption to those who are encrypted let's go what's happening everything else be it's a direct message see God knows what lays within each and every one of our lives and how that even this the one man remember the man that would tell brother Branham concerning the greatest mistake that they made in the early church was to sell everything they had he said they sold their homes everything he said they didn't have nothing to go back to you brother brems says the Holy Ghost would make a mistake he said I think you're wrong I want you to look at this this man's looking at it through just an earthly reasoning but what the Prophet is applying here is the program and the pattern of God that God there is a need to scatter that dust why won't you think about this if this had not happened Baker has still been preaching the gospel in Jerusalem it would have never got to you and I you said we'll send you it would have found me but notice it's not just about the gospel finding you it's about being in the place that God has for you you could have been in Africa you're gonna bet in Spain you could have been in Peru and received the word but God knows exactly where you and I are intended to be and it's not up to us that tells God I'm gonna be here you bring the word here but God directs us for what purpose not just not just hearing the word it's for the expression of the word in our lives sometimes God has things to where we can become too common with things we can become very common with with hearing the word you can become common with me I can become common with you that's a dangerous thing it's something that we have to pray about we can't take it lightly because we understand we're we're all human but it's to be in prayer and say lord I've got to go beyond that veil I don't want to get I don't want to be looking or resting on the veil I want to look to you find how that that God completely directed prevent says God scattered the gospel by it by that persecution let me close over the Bible goes in another place on this persecution how they were scattered it says in another place that has this gospel was scattered it comes into a place to where that you find Paul and Silas here they are in Philippi right here they are walking around remember Paul had to have the woman that was going behind him deeds men or mighty men of God and one or more and God had a walking billboard advertising his servant these are mighty men of God finally the Holy Spirit gave Paul permission to turn around and call and cast that demon spirit out of her and when he did that I want you to think about it what a Liberty it was for that into that individual it doesn't go on to say whatever took place with her but what that did was it calls them authorities to be roused up and Paul got put down there in that Philippi in jail is that right Lord why in the world I'm not down here I just came here to preach the gospel I just helped her out that was bound but you see that event look how all these things are working together it's not isolated events from that moment the authorities raise up arrest Paul and Paul at that time you know from reading in other places in the book of Acts there's times where Paul was led by the Spirit of God to pull out his citizenship card is that right like somebody was getting ready to you my passport says I'm an American citizen but in this time Paul didn't pull out the passport but say man why didn't he do that if he had done that he'd have never been down there with the Philippian jailer I thought prayer changes things it does Paul was down in that Philippi in jail but the Bible says about midnight or the Joey I can't help but think it I don't think necessarily them bills those wounds and things were still running they might have started getting scabbed up and think about some of the fabric that was getting caught in there and you know how but they begin to pray and sing sister Carmen they were praying a little bit then they would sing a little bit then they'd pray a little bit and sing a little bit well in that out of water that ain't out of order that's called wash up they prayed a little bit sing a little bit remember they prayed a little bit something keeps holding me and they sung assenting then they went right back into prayer then they they were worshipping God in the midst of the circumstance that that jail they could see those walls just they could feel those chains but what it was they made him their refuge when there was no man that I could turn to Christ is my refuge Ferrell area when it look like there was no off they begin to sing and praise because you know why they knew oh I'm with he always men knew he was present and they declared to him you're my refuge and about that time an earthquake took place God opened the doors and they walked out you see in any of these situations that we look at the trial itself was not their focus listen these were not supermen and superwomen it was not the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles and just exactly where God wanted Paul to be do you realize that Paul when God got ahold of his life he Paul didn't know that he was going to be in a Philippi in jail Paul didn't even know that time he'd be in a ship Paul II know those things God knew all of that but God knew that each one of those times it was a moment that another part of his life would be expressed right exactly where Paul was that said I've told you to be a light unto the Gentiles and let me remind you you are the light of the world you are city that's set on the hill God knows exactly where you're at he knows exactly where he's placing you and I and when things sometimes come up quickly quickly say Lord you know where I'm at you know how I feel right now Lord but Lord God you calmed the seas the Lord I'm asking you direct my way Lord help me here's this a moment Lord that I'm to go from Judea to Caesarea is this a time that I'm to make a journey from Judea to Caesarea is this a Time Lord that I'm to move from this part of the world into this part of the world is this a Time Lord that I'm the goal and preach the gospel just living this expression right here before the rest in this trial Lord you know you know and he does know he is our refuge let's bow our heads Lord Jesus throughout Lord this building tonight within each heart Lord we find Lord God that truly we have all been in these places perhaps tonight Lord but father we receive this direction Lord from you then Lord in these times when the church the Bible says that Herod would stretch forth his hand to vex certain of the church and he vets James and he vexed Peter it was certain ones that got picked out to vex and Lord to see how that the enemy Lord will at times and we know that he can't do anything without being given permission sometimes he can pick certain ones out Lord to vex but I pray Lord God may they look at it this way because every one of us can look at James and look at Peter and see how that you even in previous chapters would even testify concerning James in his life his character but to think what a great compliment that is Lord your prophet told us that when you permit a test or trial to come our way it shows you got confidence in that confidence Lord it's it's not our flesh that confidence is in that attribute that you have redeemed and raised up that's the real us this flesh this is not that flesh it's not the real me that's not me the real me is that man down on the inside the real one Lord is that that real daughter of God on the inside that longs Lord for you that loves desires you Lord to where that you are a living reality Lord unto them to where that Lord you've made yourself known and they can see Lord themselves more than you you're continuing to unfold this mystery in our lives and Lord it's through the unfolding of this mystery it is truly the mystery of God that's being unfolded in our lives they're not just trials these are not just trials there are deigned appointments for the expressions of God's mystery to come forth it comes forth under pressure the one nation of God it declares itself and prayer is that place of submission where it brings us into submission to the will of God to say thy will be done or how many times we could say it there's been many Lord that have been in dangerous situations but you know where you have led them just like when Paul would go down in the midst of Philip I when Paul and then when venture in certain places Lord God it would truly the safest places in Christ he is Lord you are our place of safety and your will unfolded for our lives when we are walking in your will for our lives we're in we're walking Lord in safety it doesn't matter what all is around us though the enemy rules [Music] it's sought to consume my flesh yay he stumbled and fell for the Lord he shall set me upon a rock in the secret of his Tabernacle he the Lord Jesus is my refuge nor what I pray tonight may you just in taking your word that you've spoke to our hearts may you just comfort your children tonight the Lord when the situation's that they might be facing things that even Lord within on coming days Lord even though we we enjoy being able to talk to one another we want to be able to ask one another to remember some prayer but father may we be people of Prayer prayer lord is our refuge a place or God that we can come and we can pour out our complete we can pour out Lord God of our of our hearts Lord make known
