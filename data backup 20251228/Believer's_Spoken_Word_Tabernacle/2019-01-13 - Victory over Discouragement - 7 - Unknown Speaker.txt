want to say thank you lord thank you father we ask it all now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen you love the Lord a man we I tell you God bless you musicians thank you just as you're turning with me to first Peter chapter 4 we just had just a wonderful time here on Thursday night and I tell you I I knew it was going to be one of those times where you leave out of here and you just time we got out of the parking lot I think it was about 10 o'clock and you know not that the service went that long but it's just the amount of things that was spoken and how our hearts were so touched and you know I set back there and it was setting back there in the booth and I thought you know what's so tremendous in this time it's it's an expression of the word itself being lived out and you know it's just as one thing was mentioned you know one one brother had mentioned to me said you know said I when the testimony was given you know concerning brother herb and the rest of them said I didn't even know I didn't even know and I think it's good for us to know and and I just I look at that and I think my you know it's just it's something you see that and you know our our testimonies and the things that we go through amen God brings it for a real testimony and a strength to one another and I believe that with all of my heart I know that to be the truth because I experienced that so let's just look into the word together and verse we're gonna just read a few verses and let you be seated Peter says for as much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God I think let's draw our attention back to verse 2 could we just read that together let's read it together that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God amen god bless you as you're being seated we look here in the scripture and as we read here in the first part of the scripture here with Peter and Peter expresses this of how that Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh and Peter is bringing this this part of it of the suffering that a life that has suffered as Christ suffered for us in the flesh is then armed with that same mind that same life and that that is where the very desire resonates from within us to do the will of God you know it's one thing when God as he begins to deal with the life and draw our heart to him because remember we are not drawn to an idea you can never marry an idea it's a person so it's that the person of Jesus Christ that is is drawing us to him and it is submitting and a submission to him and he is the one that's cultivating within our life the desire that is hidden there that only he can raise up and bring to preeminence in our life but the Benham says it like this and the message identification he says you and had a desire to serve Him and that's why he went to Calvary so that that desire could come forth in your life he knew that was there because he placed that in your life and so as he draws us to him then that desire as Paul would speak of it so expressly in Hebrews that the worshiper once purged have no more conscience desire for sin it's when that desire resonates within us to do the will of God and and I will say to you this morning that we certainly need his leadership in his will even when we think and it think it's good that we know where we're hitting on the target but as we looked at it the other night on Thursday that even if we be any otherwise minded in anything he himself will show us so that we're hitting right on the target and I'm grateful for that because when we look at the will of God its living by the word by the life abiding in us and us in it so then the purpose of our life begins to come into view or the secret of our life begins to be unfolded when God takes a hold of our life and this I want you to look in and hone in on this scripture that we read here in verse 2 that once a person has suffered has ceased from that of the of the lust of men from cease from that of the world that old nature has died now we are living completely to the will of God that's our desire to serve his purpose and so within this I want to just look here in the scriptures just for a few places here and I'm just gonna move quickly to lay this background in Romans 6 5 and 7 it says for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this how many glad you know this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that hint of the divine love of God that's moving in a life you know you could see the same temple but what you've seen being expressed out of that temple was not the same character that was there because what they knew of Paul you know even when the disciples would you know and in the very beginning you know they were very removed from from Paul what they had known of him but the testimony of Jesus Christ within his life it spoke for itself and Paul would go on to further mention that not just of the disciples but he would speak of that testimony of life that's been lived as that was the entrance or the commendation by which the ministering of the word could go forth and he said those things very clearly even and all through the letters that Paul had wrote by the Spirit of God so we believe it's living a life that truly is an expression of Jesus Christ Galatians 5:24 says they that are Christ's belonging to him have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts in Galatians 6:14 but God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world remember what Paul was speaking of when he's speaking of the world he's speaking of that of Cosmos the very origin and bringing forth of this world the system that's upon it he's not just speaking of attributes of sin he's speaking of the world the Bible says in first john loved not the world right and the Bible also tells us when Paul himself was there he said demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world demon Dimas didn't love drinking he didn't love running around Dimas did not go out to nightclubs you know what I'm talking about but it was the concept he's thinking it was not in tune with the light of God with the character with the nature of God Dimas himself could not understand suffering a man in position like this having a ministry like this how and why do you have only one coat and why are you suffering and we won't dwell on that this morning but you see the love of the world is much deeper than just attributes and this and that and this and that it goes down into the very depths the very very very foundations what it's based on now watch this watch out G the Lord Jesus places this in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and 24 and he said unto them if any man will come after me let him deny himself that's the first thing deny himself and take up his cross daily not just once not twice daily so his cross made a way for us to take up our cross without his cross there would be no cross there would be no there would be no way for us to actually become dead to the world the Pharisees all that they themselves could could do they could not die to the world and neither did they see than the necessary a reality of water Redeemer is all about they didn't see that they they did not capture that at all but to think his cross makes a way that you and I can take up his cross our cross daily and follow him how many of you know that following him it's not easy I'm not talking about the desire in our life I'm saying that it's not the easy way the easy way is according to the flesh but for his way it requires us and he'll lead us to where that we are continually it's a crucify and you realize to crucify is a slow death Wow so the new birth makes way that we can continue to die one death that we can continue to die to self by his life reigning within us for what for the purpose of the will of God oh my for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it first Peter 5:1 here Peter says the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed so Peter is letting a know it's not just all suffering but I am also a partaker I hold within my heart that which has got ahold of me that glory that shall be revealed Peters declaring that Peter was not just a witness here of the sufferings as an onlooker but now Peter had become a participant glory be to God a witness I'm a witness you know a witness you can't be a witness you know you might hurt a car screech and everything else outside of your window but unless you've been there unless you know it it's just something that you're surmising are you with me but if you're there it's different you with me it's different that's why there is no replacement for the new birth by the new birth then we become witnesses of Jesus Christ let me say like this we become true jehovah's witness then all right remember when we're brother brems talks about john sprawls how that you know he and his wife were looking at a statue that was in a garden and it was a statue that what that had been sculpted to portray the sufferings of christ and john Sproul he made mention to brother branham e says you know he and his wife were standing off and they were criticizing that statue it said why didn't they make it like this it doesn't look like there's any sufferings to this statue I mean he was criticizing but then the man who was their curator or whatever he comes over to him and he says sorry says I noticed that you're criticizing this statue he said but you see it wasn't meant to look at it at the angle that your King on it but he says what you need to do is come and kneel down right here and then look up at that statue and then tell me what you see and when he came Jonesboro came to that place and he looks up he says oh my says it just overwhelmed him it began to weep he and his wife he said because he saw at that angle the sufferings of Christ and it had an impact on his life and I want to just say to you this morning that God who is holy who has all knowledge who knows all things new the end from the beginning knew how much tallow that a flea would make knew everything but yet he did not have an understanding of what it was to be man he had a knowledge but he didn't understand it but notice God's way is that he might understand what it was like to be man not just to do this but he himself to really understand think of this now I want you to consider this he could have come and given his life walking right out of the River Jordan there and he could have went and gave his life right then it could have even been that's just saying if if it just was even before that time coming to an age of accountability coming to a place and then how the Spirit of God moving at he could have went and would he not have redeemed us do you understand what I'm saying he wants the perfect Lamb of God do we agree what was needed for redemption it was me and necessary for redemption that there would be a suffering that would be a blood that would be able to bring us back there was not a Sun upon the earth that could do it so God had to get himself a son and then through that son I come in my father's name here he comes bearing the name because there were many other sons and daughters that had lived down through the ages and there were many more that would come that they having the seed of life within them that when his life would come forth out of the blood cell and come upon this seed it would breed bad sons and daughters of God again that was necessary do you dream he could have done that and we would have been redeemed but then when you come to him with certain problems he would say I don't know how I don't know what you're talking about you said you're feeling how how is it you're feeling I don't know I don't know come on Hebrews 4 Hebrews 2 5 and 7 it says for unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come where ever we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him how many's glad he's mindful he's mindful he was aware this is what the word mindful means he was aware he never forgot the need of redemption neither has he ever forgotten what you and I what you and I had need of he is mindful I tell you this morning he's still mindful of us he says what is man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that thou visitest him that this word visitor has just been a word that I have fallen in love with through the New Testament this word visited remember it's the same word that calls John to say go ask if he's the one or do we ask for another because the Ministry of the Lord Jesus here we find God coming down Emmanuel becoming flesh the very word visited I love this it means to look upon or after to inspect examine with the eyes in order to see how he is to visit don't see one the poor and afflicted the sick to look upon in order to help or to benefit think of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus such I'll tell you this I think we can agree he had the most important job to do that's ever been but watch how he handled his duty the Bible tells us over and over in the scriptures when you look at the compassion of the Lord Jesus it says that he looked upon the multitudes and all that were sick he healed them it Bible goes on to say that he looked upon them and he saw that they were hungry hungry this is a natural attribute hungry you mean God is concerned with somebody me or you that would be hungry jesus was he took notice of it his job did not cause him to look at things and say that's menial that this isn't even important this come on now he didn't ignore us he never ignored the need but what am I talking about the God of glory the greatest he that is holy did not look over he was not even with this purpose you know how it is sometimes in our life we get so wrapped up in us that we don't have time to consider anybody else or anything else it sauce well if you had to do what I did if you did this if you did that if you did this if you did that but all look at the Lord Jesus the most important important purpose that could have never been but the Bible says he took notice and he says their multitude we cannot send them away hungry he said we must feed them what do we have here I'm glad he's mindful I'm glad that he's mindful and doesn't look at our needs and say come on dear in the revealed word of the hour but it's the revealed word of the hour that makes me know that the eyes of God are present and he knows my every need and man it is Christ Himself being revealed now think of this let's look at the depth of this visitation for a few moments and Isaiah 53 verse 1 familiar passage of reading but notice let us let the Spirit of God so impress it upon our hearts this morning who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm or the strength of the Lord revealed now think of it the way that the world has portrayed strength it's Superman all these great heroes their main heroes that's the only figures that are meant to be idolized that's not a real hero a real hero is one that can come to the lowest point and yet within it all stand true and stand faithful there's only one who ever homei neither one of them might have been you know as they portrayed the different things to where they can be beat to a pulp and everything else and here they come back and gain strength but I'll tell you there's not one that could ever die and raise up again but I Lord Jesus he revealed himself to us and said I am he that was dead and ever live forevermore I have the keys of death hell and the grave I have Poprad Satan's Trinity I'm glad for that revelation but notice this depth of visitation of our Lord for he shall grow up before him has a tender plant he knows what the teenage years are like yeah the Prophet said he knows what it's like to be a teenager I know different things come it's true there's things that right now that teenagers face that as far as things that they face it's different than even what I faced and I'm only a few years older than most of them some of you get that but what it comes down to listen to me now the temptations themselves do not come through all other kinds of gates there's still only three gates lust of flesh lust of eye pride of life those three gates are still the same avenues that he comes and uses all types of different devices and other things true but yet he himself shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground watch this he have no form nor comeliness he did not come in kingly decor kingly decor would have been that which was just on the outside but remember there is a woman that sets in the Book of Revelations that looks right on the outside she's clothed right on the outside but on the inside when he opens at all she's full o see satan's objective is to beautify the outside he even pulled that over on the Pharisees remember now to think of this he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him Jesus listen there's other places in the scripture that we could pull Absalon saw and the rest of them that the scriptures are detailed to let us know these men were of a handsome character they had a comely comeliness about them in their natural countenance Jesus did not have that probably be the God I could identify with that then there was no beauty sometimes you wonder well as my nose this way one of my ears this way and why not listen God knows exactly he knew even the color of your eyes the color of your hair there was no beauty so when you feel that you're ugly you can look right here in the scripture he himself there was no beauty let me just put it simple Jesus would have never made GQ magazine come on now he would have never run the local beauty pageant but you see it wasn't outward beauty it was an inward beauty oh my oh how we can draw strength from this this morning the Bible says he is despised and rejected of men he was in Isaiah's generation he was a nois he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows this was not the last few moments of the cross that's not what this is this was his life notes passed at school that's a drunken soldier sad you know his mama she's a man of sorrows acquainted with grief you say brother Sammy how do you know that they were saying it well I'll tell you this right here they're the people who standing in the pulpits were saying it and calling him Beelzebub and all those things like that what makes you think that the children wasn't doing that because the homes would have been doing it and everything else what they did not know God's program you say that wasn't necessary oh yes it is necessary a man of sorrows did he have to come exactly this way yes and no he could have redeemed us without being acquainted with any of these things right but he's in order to be a faithful and merciful hot wrist a man of sorrows acquainted with grief sickness sadness anybody gets that he got sad said he got sick hmm yet we did esteem him watch this now when let me go on and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not Jesus never fit in are you with me he was not the one who would have been picked for the kickball team he was not the one that any of them would have picked that he was despised they hated him come on somebody it was not a bed of roses why because this walk the Lord Jesus spent more time talking to you and I about our cross the persecution the suffering that would take place in our life on his behalf and would let you and I know why that when he himself would be able to stand there as the great High Priest and intercede for you and I and minister on our behalf this was not an act this was not an act this was not a precedent going down and putting on a hardhat and walking through this steel mill that is not the life of the Lord Jesus the life of the Lord Jesus if I can say it in this way is one who not only put on the steel hat but made in the likeness of sinful flesh he actually knows what it's like to work those 12 hours he knows what it's like to be hungry he knows what it's like not to have a place to lay his head you see some of these things you and I could look at and say well you know that would be very simple Jesus would have been more economically minded you know Jesus would have taken out the Excel spreadsheet and Jesus would have paid the pie chart and he would have calculated his expenses so he would have been the high priest of Excel is that what you're telling me but you see this is where Paul could pick up from the Old Testament and Paul could even say in the book of Thessalonians we will have the poor always there's needs once they're not needs that were needs in Jerusalem the Corinthian church took up and sent to the needs in Jerusalem there were needs in other places there it wasn't because they were serving God that they all of a sudden became just profitable and everything financial was just right as a matter of fact our prophet told us there are more 10 years than millionaires people who lust and desire and think that more gain will bring them more happiness it doesn't it'll just bring you more responsibility it'll tie you up more cause you got to keep up with what you have look at this here surely he hath borne oh I'm glad about that he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted let's look at this as the brother Brad picks us up in the Hebrew series he said that's the reason that Christ God had to become kinfolks to us he come down and was a man he suffered temptation he was laughed at made fun of and persecuted and what's it say ignored you mean they're suffering you know Jesus you mean to tell me he had to actually suffer being ignored I won't ask you to raise your hands but how many of you felt ignored you mean our high priest would be so subjected to where he would experience being ignored why because his children are ignored sometimes God forgive us we ignore one another we ignore the needs we just pass right on by ignore the needs of one another God forgive us and help us he was laughed at made fun of and persecuted and ignored and called Beelzebub and scoffed at and suffered death under capital punishment he had to be kinfolks to us look at this statement he had to be falsely accused anybody like to be falsely accused know what the what's the tendency out of our life is to prove our point that's the tendency when you're falsely accused you're attended to come out and prove your point he had to be falsely accused because why you're falsely accused so he had to be why did he have to be because of you because of me he had to experience that of what it's like to be accused of something that is not the truth how many times you find Jesus in the temple when he's accused where he stands there and debates with him where he will do all that he doesn't the Bible says he slipped out of their midst the Bible says when they pressed upon him vehemently with questions he dodged and moved out of the event this is why the inspiration can strike Paul to tell Timothy do not entangle yourself with foolish questions do not get into endless genealogy do not waste one moment of your time with foolishness why false accusations is where it must be committed to God right the Bible says in the book of Peter he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously he had to bear sickness because you're sick he had to bear sins because it was your sins he had to become kinfolk the only way he could redeem us was to become kinfolks to us and how could he become kinfolks he is by taking on the form of sinful flesh and becoming one of us and in that he paid the price and redeemed us back into the fellowship of the Father all water Savior words couldn't express it now think of this in the Simonian church age brother Branham is dealing with this and we started in a little bit on this last week on the purpose that trials themselves are not just erratic happenings that just fall out of the air trials themselves are predestined appointments by God that actually were to shape and mold us for the perfecting of the will that he has for our lives hello my god help us to just submit to it Amen can you say amen to that God helped me to submit to it and even when it's things that that is not a trial but simply a bad decision that I have made help me Lord to be submissive and to learn from my bad decisions teach me Lord blue bream says his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled has job said he puts strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8 through nine though he were a son yet learned well if you already know it why do you gotta learn it learning it is coming to understand not just know it understand it there's a lot of things that you and I can know as far as within terms and things that happens and maybe it's a disease maybe it's something that's spoken here we can know it that all that that must be a terrible thing but when you actually have went through something that's similar all that's different there's understanding then that goes out not saying that we can't pray for somebody and really have empathy for them but when we ourselves have actually went through something like that it's not just empathy but now it's sympathy were able to enter in having the same feeling but he by the things look at this though he were a son yet he learned by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him in plain language a miracle in language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering now look at him and look at us we are made perfect in our soul by that blood offering and the new birth brings us into that are you with me we are made perfect but he comes by the ministering of his word he comes through carried through trials and tests to do what for the perfecting of the Saints it's not about ourselves no that's not what it's about it's about our character being perfected this is why over and over in the message identification each time the prophet would speak of it he would let us know we are invited to have our character notice molded it's not a gift molded to his own glorious character the gospel sends out the invitation the new birth ours itself brings us into the body for the potter's house where the molding takes place remember we are ordained predestinated to be conformed to his image I want you to think of all of our different makeups and how that were a mess in all of our makeups but yet God Himself would so work through all of our makeups all the complexes over hurts all dispose of life and yet his life on the inside is it will actually an is triumphing in our life by subdue our own character to his will he's manifesting his victory in our life you see things become as we walk on with God things become more apparent to us it becomes more sensitive we become more aware of that thing around our lives that's the worst thing that anybody could have but it came because of the first birth and that's pride in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they to by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection no suffer no rain no suffering no perfection every one of us are desiring to be come into perfection as a rock we want to see the virtues continue to come into maturity in our lives stature of a perfect man but every one of those virtues do not come easy but thanks be to God when you're planted by the rivers of living water hallelujah scornful scorns all around you but you have a resource to draw from are you with me the streams of grace have made its way to the foundation in your life how does though how does that come out how do those virtues come out they come out through trials through hardships it's what brings this character of Christ forth you see it been nothing for a person to be patient with the things of the world but suffering for the cause of Christ that's a different story you've got to see the value have to know and have that love of God of the person of Jesus Christ hello brother Ram so why did he want this James in Chapter 1 to Thor for my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith look what he says knowing this knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I won't ask you to raise your hand but how many of you prayed for healing and you're still waiting how many of you've prayed sometimes you've went to doctors you've taken this medication you've taken this medication and you're still suffering here's a Nicole she doesn't care we're going to put the devil on notice right now we're going to back him up off of the shoulder to where he likes to take quotes and whisper things and say if you really had the faith Jesus had perfect faith and he experienced sickness booooo death come on somebody it's understanding your domain if he did everything for you the very moment that you asked for it we would not become matured sons and daughters of God we would become spoiled brats and God don't want spoiled brats so he knows how to perfect you and I aren't you glad for that because after all we're gonna rule and reign with him do you realize when we rule and reign you say I have a change your body but you will take with you the experiences the molding of that character so fits you and I to move into that place of the overcomers throne to where even in the Millennium where we and ourselves will rule and reign as sons of God it is befitting to us now not just for that moment but for this time also so this perfection this word perfection means coming to a completion full understanding his sonship didn't exempt him from suffering but rather is quite the contrary think of the story in choosing of a bride that brother Branham will tell and he that story is also there's inner parts that's inter woven and injected clear down in the early 50s but brother and we'll talk about remember that that family they owned a certain I think textile mill and then this family owns something and they you know got it together that this boy and this girl were gonna they were going to get married they had it made they didn't have to work for nothing brother BAM even begins to describe you know the faucets and the doorknobs and everything how it was and they sat around and brother van put it like this when he snuck up on the house one was in this corner one was in that corner I know they might have said the valise in sickness in health in the good times and the bad times but that's all they did all they did was save the house but in a union there'll be times of disappointments let's just be honest here there's times we've wanted our prayers answered there's things in our lives we thought Lord you've just gotta answer it right now if you don't Lord I had no way I'll be able to go through with this Lord every one of us have been there and he didn't and you look at it and say how am I going to do this how am I going to go through this but you'll find if you can just think of his faithfulness how would you know that he's faithful if there were not experiences for him to prove it well brother saying I know it by his work but he said love not in word only but in deed what he asks of you and I in the expression of love he is God is sending there Jesus three times prayed if it's possible let me put it in the words that the Prophet uses in souls in prison now this is the cliffnotes Jesus even prayed to dodge the cross it would have been an easier way hope you understand taking a Roman spear to his heart would have been easier than the crucifixion steel would have been hard taking a bullet would have been hard but the crucifixion nothing was instant about it and nothing is instant with our crucifixion character is not a pouch of cocoa that you warm up hot water or hot milk and then pour it in there and it has the marshmallows to garnish it and you mix it up and voila we have character no no it's a victory it was made complete through experience and obedience through suffering look at this in Hebrews 2 verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death the suffering of death this is not just the cross every day in his life there was a suffering of death death to will even to where he stood before those men in that day and they said yeah you seen Abraham why you're not moral you're not more than 50 years old he experienced death in that virgin born body reminded the Virgin bored body was not a glorified body it was not a glorified body if it would have been glorified there would have been no temptation James chapter 1 let a man not say when he's tempted that he's tempted of God for God cannot be tempted Jesus was tempted so there's a part of him that was caught that wasn't inted and there's a part of him that was tempted that part was not God but veiled great is the mystery of godliness we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor but all once again right after that comma brother joy there's a whole lot that took place before the end before the crown with glory that's a whole lot that was taken place a life that was left a character that was hoarded but look look at the outcome he's crowned with glory and honor and look at you and me one day we clown crowned with glory and honor oh yeah we receive a crown of life a new body and then we can say surely the sufferings of this present time seem as nothing as compared when we get to the end of the way go to be to God oh ma that he by the grace of God this was God's grace provided for us that he should taste death for every man he tasted it he experienced it but he subdued it he said I've tasted it for you and I stand triumphant over you you never have to be separated you'll never have to be departed from the presence I'll never leave you nor forsake you he knows what it is to be forsaken and he said I'll never leave you I'll tell you when you feel lonely Oh Simon you feel lonely Oh sometimes I do hope others Samuel do do we sometimes alone yes but then if you could just look at him and brother bantam says it like this he says when I get to feeling in my times of the hardest trials he said I faint back to Calvary sealed on Golgotha and I'll think of his suffering I think of what he went through he said and then about that time he said I just turn and say thank you Lord he said see that helps me in my trial thank back to what he provided for you and I that'll give you a victory gives us victory over discouragement let me find a place to get off here for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings plural plural sufferings headache sickness rejected despised made fun of ignored put down ridiculed depressed or you say Jesus wasn't depressed huh huh in the Bible in the Gospels where it speaks of him in the garden it says this man he was of sorrow that Bible word means it is the apex of what one feels in depression he felt it what it was like for who for you that's why that's why that's why that's why that's why oh no think of this here let me just try to have mom I'm skip would you I don't know if heard the slides up skip skip down there to Hebrews to 16 and 18 would just skip just a little bit and work I'll just come down here for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham wherefore in all things that behoove him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for him that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able like that can you say that with me he is able let's say it again he is able to secure them that are tempted but the Bible says secure means to sympathize the reason he become this is that he might be sympathetic with you now you and I maybe maybe you didn't have sympathetic parents you didn't have a sympathetic teacher you didn't have anybody who ever showed sympathy it's hard to relate to this because we're talking about sublime perfection be holy even as he is holy but he became and so subjected himself to be tempted that he would be able to sympathize with us that he might be sympathetic with you have your ups and downs and your ins and outs and your temptations get so great you can't hardly stand it how many say lord help me be patient lord help me be more patient you know what our impatience is sometimes we get to expecting more of one another but all God forbid anybody expect more out of us we get disappointed when we have certain expectations but remember whatever expectations you can measure out somebody can put expectations back on you but just remember we are a body and we are not ordained to be formed to one another's image we are to be formed to the image of Jesus Christ I know sometimes we take the word and this is the standard of the word but you see always the thing that you have to look for is what is it that's motivating how do you feel in there if I took your blood pressure under that time what is that so if there is a lacking and I guess what you have to do and I have to do is get the priestly garments on and go to interceding for brother so-and-so and sister sewing so we got a visit them seek to help to benefit what is man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that thou did it visit it and you know what as a high priest you can't accuse a brother or sister before throwing God's throne can do it you can't do it it's not allowed can't come from your heart Lord you know everybody else living at sin and I'm livid right Lord your outside even looking at the gate you're not even in the outer court when you're praying because you've got to see surely there's an interest surely to goodness the same God working on your life and working on my life surely to goodness he's got his hands full with my life and your life and through those experiences in our life what does it do it molds us to be able to sympathize sympathize in the medical profession when I begin to study some of these words sympathize and empathy you know you've had some of you've had nurses and doctors and whatever more they come in everything is strictly clinical and what's blood pressure okay okay I feel okay you tried this okay that'll be $50 and did it it it in on out the door but then you have somebody who spends time with you how you feeling oh my have you tried to certain things what types of things have you tried for this well there's Sam you know I'm not there for a social visit so do you want somebody who cares or do you just want to give fifty dollars to somebody who don't care you see they spend it the one thing that stood out that in all this research of journals and documentaries is how that they find that in the practice of medicine there is a loss of sympathy and empathy and let me bring it up today I think God we need it I think we need a good dose of sympathy and empathy I think we do you see this world and the way things are so set up it becomes so divided but remember to let us remember the very character and mind and life of the Lord Jesus Christ he wasn't too busy to look upon the needs of others but to sympathize and to have empathy this is what they said it does not mean that you all of a sudden that somehow you feel sorry for the patient it means that you're able to enter in be able to help go along with their feelings to help them through the process well I'm grad glad the Great Physician knows that aren't you I'm glad he knows that and where we might al act within our molding he makes up for it by his life being inside of us let me finish this he knows look at this he knows how to simplifies with you he sets there to make intercession he sets there to love you and though you go astray he won't forsake you he will still come after you and not at your heart there's not a backslider in the building but what know that God knocks at his heart daily and he will do it as long as you're mortal on this earth for he's loved you he's redeemed you now I could understand him being this way if I was perfectly faithful or you were perfectly faithful but you see when the new birth has come this man on the inside is perfect he's perfectly faithful but the character the part that's being molded it needs help and he doesn't say you mean to tell me you think I'm gonna spend my time and you've been so sweet no he don't even take that attitude aren't you glad because he could have done that for every one of us don't you love him let's just let's just close right here I'm glad for the sufferings aren't you I'm so glad thank God for the sufferings of Christ let's just pause here this morning or Jesus there's no way Lord that words can never capture it can ever be able to fully express it but a songwriter moved by inspiration would pin the words what condom sent you bringing us Redemption Lord from our hearts this morning we see Lord I know we don't perhaps see it the way we ought to but I I pray that God that you would continue to break it to our hearts throughout this day throughout the oncoming days opening it to our lives or the depth of this visitation helping us Lord to see and not just to see it with our mind our eyes the father from our heart because every one of us throughout Lord we've been at different points and some points we'll go through again but we realize that every trial it's becoming more clear every trial its ordained by you sometimes the Lord when things as we mentioned that sickness in our body sometimes the Lord even of things maybe we've experienced sometimes it can be maybe a reoccurring something in our lives like Paul for example he sought you three times and you told Paul my grace is sufficient his eyesight would come and go I wonder Lord I look at it Lord sometimes through things that I've been through things that others the Lord maybe have more pondered the same questions I don't believe for Paul but it was Oh it'll be three days and boy after three days it's gonna be gone sometimes it might have lasted for a week then Paul what if Paul liked us we could have the expectation I've had this pain before that is this discomfort my body I usually last about a week and somebody asks just two weeks later is I still there it shows what our expectation is not on a time limit but it's in you Lord we never know we don't know sometimes the length of time the scriptures say a season regarding the trial sometimes it says for a while or the things that you came to experience [Music] I think of that Lord perhaps sitting right here this morning there's someone Lord they felt ignored I pray Lord God may you help them this morning by that witness of the Holy Spirit that you would break that forth and cause it to stand out Lord to let them know that you know what it is to feel ignored Lord we've all been in situations sometimes we've been where a conversation is but it's like we're on the outside listening in talked all around we've been there Lord it's things that we we feel but help us not to make our feelings something Lord that we begin to dictate our behavior but may when Lord submitted to you Lord may we bring it to Europe your throne Lord those in here this morning Lord that are suffering in their body pain you bought our griefs you bore their grief lord I read over things this week your prophet would place it so clearly you know our pain what right here to think in this building this morning that one Lord that would be sick in their body if it was no one else you bore their sickness your prophet said it like this he said that you would be a faithful and merciful high priest to know how to reconcile us to Grace and to know how to reconcile our body back to health again more cheese's the only thing Lord God that we can do is say thank you we can say thank you Lord from our hearts this morning Lord whatever that need is maybe it's lonely maybe it's feeling lonely it's feeling all alone [Music] Lord God may they take Lord God the word of their high priest say he's sitting there you're interceding from me Lord what god you're my comfort I'm not alone Lord you're with me I know I I may not have company right now contact maybe with son but Lord how so remember that I'm not going to let the enemy put me in a corner the Bible says he that hath friends must show himself friend Oh God [Music] thank you Jesus what God for the sin 6ol this morning Lord God reeling upon the sea of life may this morning Lord God they take a hold of that lifeline that's pointed out to him Lord God and may Lord God their ship their boat as it were may it come to the harbor of Refuge in Christ Jesus rennet Lord God for you're not an idea you are the very King of glory Lord Jesus granted this morning Granite Lord for every need [Music] thank you Lord Jesus I want you to think of this as your eyes your closed your heads are bound the quote I just read to you to think of how that God would so anoint the Prophet in this hour to where these things would be so vividly depicted for us he sits there for your sickness he sits there for your temptation he sits there for your pain he sits there that you might come to know his grace say this morning greatest thing we can do is recognize that whatever that you've got a need that's pressing on your heart this morning he knows how you feel he knows what you you knows what you're going through you might look at it as a sister and say well God became a man how could he understand me but sis please remember temptation only comes through three gates and he conquered the gates of the enemy he understands just like we said about the teenagers today they've experienced different means of things coming at them but it is the same pressures why don't you right now just speak to your high priest whatever that need is this morning you know it's already touched your need has already touched him to draw him into this place of his word to speak this to you and I why don't you just take this moment I'd start off by thanking him that's what I do and I let my petition be known hallelujah all thank you Jesus thank you or God thank you or Jesus blessed should be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus [Music] well let's just continue to pray and worship you just now oh he became me so that I might become here by grain yes me became sure that I'm I become him [Music] me [Music] so that I rule is the curtain Oh [Music] oh I'm so glad [Music] you like to stand you're more than welcome to [Music] BTK I become by [Music] so that I might be coming by [Music] heeey [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he was wounded he was wounded my transgression [Music] he was rude my love me [Music] and chastisement of our peace was [Music] - right [Music] he was [Music] [Music] the punishment of our peace [Music] Dyess tribes - trust me [Music] thank you Lord Jesus don't you just appreciate his dissension appreciate how he conned in Cindy said Lord help me help me Lord context help me Lord oh my I'm so grateful for that no matter what we would feel [Music] you know maybe I could go to you about something you could come to me maybe I wouldn't understand maybe I've never been through that angle or that part of it but still would be a part of it to try to understand what it is that you're going through or what you're dealing with but I'm glad that he can reach to a level of understanding that's beyond what I could ever reach to as a matter of fact brother Brennan put it like this in different places and the message that I didn't get to and actually by him moving inside of us helps us to get to that place of sympathy that we need to be yet how can we do it how can we but I'm glad I'm glad to think about it when you've been able to sympathize with someone else instead of saying I can't believe it Jesus don't do that to you hey don't do it to Menza you've got to be know he understands and he's there to intercede he knows just what we need you know friends it isn't just about our failures that he's a high priest that's not even when I tell them what I'm done most suffering right now we do suffer even when we fail is that right there's a suffering even in our failing but I'm talking about even when we're looking at the word and saying lord I want to attain to that that's my goal he's setting there as the high priest to make good on our confession he's there to present his life to say well they have asked for is that their character would be so molded and the expression of this life in them they've asked for that and his life is there to speak on our behalf and it's through his vicarious suffering that he did that that issue comes to us to what we have been desiring he makes good on it were his workmanship he is our high priest I'm so glad about that or Jesus would you go with the sword as we go our separate ways this morning watch over a sword father it's so good to see each and every one there's some Lord God that we don't see here Lord would you just minister to the Lord touch them Lord not only those that are sick in their body but the backslider Lord they just read where your prophet told us you sat there on the throne Oh Lord God may you continue to knock at their heart may that knock become so pronounced that it takes their attention it draws them away from everything right now that Satan would want to give them to try to deaden that knock granite Lord may your knock on their heart Lord continue to knock Lord God granite Lord Jesus father for each and every other need and every request Lord the story we committed into your hands go with us as we go on the roads Lord help us Lord God father every mortal that we come in contact with not just out there but we do pray for that out there help us to be sensitive as your prophet Lord I think of when he was expressing of compassion he told the story which I know many did but know it Lord they listened to the message how did a man who was known as a bum he crossed the street and when there was a car that come in ran him hit him the doctors gathered around and they began to look at the man and then they had a private conference they said every bone has broken his body he's all he's a mess let's just cover him up it's not worth it we're not we won't get one bit of money out of it but he said that man spoke up and he said gentlemen just a moment I am worth something for my precious Lord Jesus shed his blood for me he purchased me he gave the ultimate purchase I am worth something oh god I pray this for may that not only be the resounding place of our heart but may we lo God be sensitive to the needs more sensitive needs within our homes needs within this assembly the local local body help us to be sensitive Lord even to those Lord that would be there on the job maybe someone in the marketplace that waits on us continuously or maybe we not take it for granted that it just so happens when we take that number they're the one that ends up waiting on us but may we be an expression and may our hearts beat Lord what can I do to leave this place better than I found it help us Lord may we be mindful may we may we display true visitation help us so lord I pray we want to say thank you our great high priest [Music] we love you Lord Jesus go with us Lord may you in Lord God nurse each and every one back to health Lord reconcile us back to health and our body reconcile the backslider reconcile the lost one Oh God we look to you father you are all things the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you dismissed as you slip out quietly they're seen with the right [Music] Oh [Music] Oh so [Music] Oh [Music] Shyne [Music] you know the Great Creator [Music] in mustard [Applause] [Music] well [Music] what [Music] [Music] God Justin [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we [Music] yes [Music] Oh [Music]
