Lord God to our needs Lord we pray father we just want to give ourselves to you Lord we ask the Lord that you had forgive us of our sins Lord and our shortcomings Lord Oh father no God how we thank you for your mercy Lord we just pray Lord have your way Lord in the further part of the service now in the name of Jesus Christ amen as you turn into Matthew 26 I want to just two things I'd like to remind you of is this coming week just to remind you that this coming week on Thursday we will not be having service here on Thursday because of the I now want to give you the opportunity to take care of whatever you need to because Saturday next Saturday and next Sunday the Lord willing brother Jeff Snodgrass will be here with us on those in those dates Saturday I believe is at six o'clock and then Sunday at at eleven so also the fellowship dinner right after the service this morning at North ins Depot if you're able to make it would certainly would love to be able to sit down into the fellowship with you and so we we certainly thank God for these times and opportunities I also wanted to convey to you I know next week Lord willing we'll be lifting the mission offering as usual and there's also a project that I had mentioned to you when I came back from the Philippines and brother Roel after I had been corresponding with him they have just let me know of it and that is they're in need of the boat and the boat was there's a boat that was actually damaged in the storm that they had had back in the late fall I think it was back in right after brother Jerry and I had got back and the the boat that many of the things that you realize when I tried to show you that on the on the the overheads is that that Philippines itself is just comprised of I don't know how many thousands of islands and so you know there's there's certain transit that they can take but it's a lot it's a lot more efficient to be able to move by boat and right now the the cost because they've got the brothers to be able to do this that boat and it's a boat like what you had seen that I was I was riding in and the cost of that to do that is right at $1,400 US dollars and so brother lol had just reached out to us and and I had wanted to to know that because when they're going from the place island to island there's brothers right now and what they're doing they're walking that when they go to the island they'll walk they'll go over the mountain and they'll just walk so it's not like they're not doing things now it's just to try to make it a little bit more efficient because there are needs that are there from the mystery expose where you've had congregations that have come to the Lord and they have just they have been struggling to get to them to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they want to further take the congregations on in the teaching of the word so there's a there's a need to be able to to get there to them so there's a brother OA has actually trained some brothers to where that they can they can go out and take care of that but he just had brought that to me so I would asked you if you just pray about that and and then Lord willing next Sunday will just take up a mission offering and I really just kind of want a thrust maybe to be towards that so that we can help out that that need as well so it's good to be here in be here it's good to be in the presence of the Lord and so thankful we had good weather to come to church to me the other day you know the other day you know when we can't left out of here and we got to driving on the roads I was I was rejoicing I told I told them my boys one of my boys was riding with me on the way home I said you look at this and the temperature I said stayed right at 32 and you know just slushie on the roads but I'm thankful that God kept his hand on us amen and so and you know Zachary he met me in the office after service boy he really enjoyed that service so dad you preached really short today and so I thought I'd tease him a little bit I said don't worry I'll make up for it on Sunday he was really he really enjoyed that service I mean it little as much when God is in it I thought that was really really cute you know amen Matthew 26 verse 26 and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink you all of it but this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom what a promise that we have and a promise to look forward to amen the same victory that it brought forth in his life is the same victory that it's bringing forth in our life when we sat there that day across from one another at the wedding supper of the Lamb and here we are partaking of this of this communion what a testimony it will be we will set there and the testimony will be by His grace by your life or by your strength or by your word that you sent Lord in season Lord o mighty talking about a time of worship amen let's let's let you be seated in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'd like to speak to you this morning on the issuing in the New Testament issuing in the New Testament many times we see it just in our Bibles that's given and we we commonly refer to it an Old Testament and New Testament in two books and yet we we recognize that without the Old Testament there would not be a New Testament but that the New Testament itself was actually the mystery that was hidden within the old many many shadows and many types that were laying there but a testament in itself is is a disposition or it's an arrangement it's a covenant it's a compact it's a will that one would declare like of their your last Testament and last will so what is what is there it's wrote in it's written out and like a person would go and have a will drawn up and when you have that will drawn up you have all of the wishes and things that are to be declared within there and who gets what and this one gets this and this one gets that and you know do that in those wills they can't put down in the little title sighs and no fighting and those no fussing and but in this Testament there is that but in in that in in the Testament that that when we look at just the will itself is is where that once a person you know as long as grandma or grandpa whoever may have been given you a a great heirloom of furniture but you can't have it until they've died because when they die then what is written now comes into for so there's there's a need for there to be a death that what is written then can come forth in force to those into whom it is intended to so the New Testament itself it is the fulfilling of the Covenant that and promise that God had made and confirmed unto Abraham and this is where I just want to draw some of these parts here this morning if we go back in the scripture into Luke chapter 1 verse 67 we find here Zacharias the father of John and it says and Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up in horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy Covenant the oath which he sware to our father Abraham aren't you glad that God has not forgotten God has not forgot his promise that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life we find that how that the Lord Jesus when he was standing here he was calling the attention of the religious the Pharisees and the Sadducees he was pointing to them regarding the Scriptures and how that they themselves though reading the scripture and those seeming to believe it yet they did not believe it they what they believed was and where there where their worship rested was not in the word but their worship rested within the traditions that they had made out of the word but God has nor will he ever receive warship through a tradition because his warship he only receives warship through that place where he has chosen to place his name so it will always be according to his character and I believe that's why that the character of Christ when we look at it and we can have all of the word but if we miss the character we've missed everything because the character is the very life it's the very person that makes the word live and yet you find that here among men that we could look at like Peter and Peter you know how brother branham described that he couldn't have wrote read his name if it had been wrote on a boxcar and it was kind of letting us know within it even how that when they had come Peter and John remember how they had come before the men in that day and been taken captive and the Bible said they took knowledge that these men were ignorant and unlearned so there wasn't anything they could they couldn't hide their ignorance and their unlearning but there was something about it that when the prophecy and promise begin to come to pass you know Peter had a daddy that would tell him about the promise and we know that there had to be something different to where that that where that he was communicating the promise that's the same way it was with with siming in the same way with Anna and I I believe with all my heart that friends that it's God that releases that that part of his word is releasing when that word is to be fulfilled it's gonna be fulfilled by God himself so it takes God moving ahead upon the hearts of the people God as always and God will have a people that are always prepared and ready for the fulfillment of the word it's not it's not something that it's based on our knowledge but it's things that where it's just something that resonates within our hearts it's something that even though we can't explain it but it's just something that brings us to an awareness and to an alertness in this hour and this is where that they were not being learned people but they could say we have found him who Moses and the prophets have spoke of and and all of those things that would be expressed they caught the witness just like the woman at the well who her her life in itself was not a life that any of them would have sat down and talked to with and fellowship with but yet there was something about it that she had a confidence by looking at the word and say we know that when Messiah cometh he will tell us these things so there was things that there was already showing that in the midst of everything that there is a people that God himself has prepared and they are the people of his choosing the people that God himself has already that is the designation that he's going to make himself known to yet he walked among all of them he walked right down through their temple he walked right down through their schools he stood there and he talked with him so it wasn't something that was done in a corner it was done openly so what is it it's showing that God Himself is not trying to be secretive but God Himself declares his word and his promise openly but there that promise is declared because God is fulfilling his word and there are people that are identified when that promise is made manifest they themselves are brought from death unto life that promise holds within it the very catalyst or key stone that brings them forth and so when we find that how that in the scriptures here you find how that even where a Peter you'll find Steven speaking of it of where that even Peter would would would speak to those who were gathered around after what had taken place on the day of Pentecost and and remember when Peter stood out there here he is in the midst of this time speaking to the Pharisees and these people in this time he's letting them know that you are the children of the prophets another covenant that God made unto our fathers and he lets him know unto you first God raised up his son Jesus and sent him to bless now watch this here's sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities but you see they did not need that blessing that's what they thought we don't need to be turned from our iniquities what do you mean in bondage we ain't never been in bondage then you look at this you see where you find Peter you find the woman at the well you find that the disciples here they were and those that had been looking Simeon and Anna all those here they were they were looking at the coming of the Lord the Messiah has a need it was what they had need us but here you find the religious and that day that's not what they were looking for they were not looking for something that they had need of they believed they had it all together but they needed the blessing and the blessing they needed was they needed to be turned away from their iniquities I tell you what that's the blessing that God gives that's a real blessing that's the real blessing in spiritual places that removes a life from the iniquity because you see the word was pointing out these things I remember as Peter stood here on the day of Pentecost you know the Prophet tells us over and over when Peter stood there and he's speaking to them right here at the end of Acts 3 the Bible says right after he said these things that the Pharisees in them rose up and begin to come against him and right there when Peter was preaching this message there was an issuing of an indictment upon that generation is that right but yet notice the mercy of God here is an indictment against that religious institution but the mercy of God gave a space of time before the Gentile ages started and here was an issue a mercy that was given to where eventually we find what even the Lord Jesus prophesied regarding that of remember to flee pray that your flight be not in the winter time there was an issuing that where that that Jerusalem was going to be taken and gonna be be gonna be brought captive and all of that was pronounced there in here Peter himself is issuing an indictment and after Paul himself standing there and the Jews rising up against the ministering of the work they weren't rising up against Paul they were rising up against Jesus Christ that's what they were against they were against the fulfilment of the work the very thing that they all have been claiming to the very thing that they ought to be rejoicing it was the very thing they were despising the very thing that could set them free was the very thing that they didn't want and here as Paul would say in the word though because you judge yourselves unworthy see God didn't judge them know they judge themselves unworthy low we turned from the Jews unto the Gentiles God gave a space of grace so after the indictment there is a space of grace amen there's been an indictment there was an indictment of this nation now right then the indictment fell upon the church the organizational system is that right but inside of that remember how the Prophet stands there they met at the end of the message indictment he says God be merciful because there's individuals so now what did it do it turns to the end of the lady OC and aids there in Revelations 3 2 where he's outside of the church knocking on the door and what's he doing he's calling his children out of there it's a space of grace that is given so here we are in this time because the Jews themselves you see while we are in a time a preparation is coming for us in rapture the Jews have already been gathering back to the homeland the only thing that's needed is for us to step out of the way and as soon as we step out of the way the inspiration falls upon those two witnesses and then will they begin to proclaim the same gospel that you I have been embraced and brought into Christ by that's all they're doing they're waiting there at their posts and all it all it is is God removing the Gentile bride out of the way so I look at these things here how that Paul would say regarding the the Jews in Romans 9 I'm just trying to lay this as a background here he says I say the truth in Christ and I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness and the Holy Ghost but I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh you see Paul's desire look now look at this he was one that remember when before God had got ahold of his life he was one that was going and making havoc of the Church of the Living God remember he's one that was we could say making fun of he did not see it but it just goes to show that you take an elective God and no matter where they're at and no matter what they think they might say things or fanaticism and everything else but you let him get into the presence of the light you let him get in the presence of Jesus Christ one time he's able to take a skeptic and make a real believer out of them because down on the inside here's a real seat of God oh how the Prophet said many times he said I've seen skeptics and seen those that would laugh at meetings like this and make fun of them but yet he said you get him in the presence of God he said God will turn him around and take something that you you and I would have said there's no hope for him but God reaches down because why there's something down there [Applause] hallelujah no right nobody all just lives the life get it up to you or me to put nobody out just live the life we're going to send you you don't know what they said but listen just live the life don't respond how they are you don't gotta argue with them you don't got to be defensive the gospel defends itself it'll defend itself by the life it produces through you hallelujah because what they may not hear in stop up their ears but yet there's a witness of a life that's being expressed that they've got to take knowledge that you've been with Jesus Paul said in this and here in Romans 9 for who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen now we recognize that Jesus Christ would neither Jew nor Gentile but he had to come through that promise of the word back through the house of David through that of Judah he would come forth but it could not be that of a blood cell that was already here but God created both sperm and egg God created a blood cell that he himself might come and and establish a tabernacle whereby he might redeem you and I back to himself all God's doing he came the Bible says it he came to his own his own what those who were after the flesh those who were of the house of Israel he came to them but they didn't receive him you see friends this is where it's very very very very important the word can come you know I can preach my heart out and a minister can preach his heart out brother bream says he can preach to his blue in the face he said but it will do you no good unless you believe it you've got to believe the word that's coming forth you've got to receive that word and unless the word take preeminence in your life it does no good I've been being able just to hear it but it's got to be received because the authority of the word remember the as a gentleman it's the person it's Jesus Christ he'll never override your will no sir he don't do that that's not surrender that's called dictatorship but surrender as he draws you into a place of surrender it's like a person won the holy ghost and they say well you know God I need you to give me the Holy Ghost so I can quit doing this and quit doing that you got a surrender God's not gonna come and fulfill what's not surrendered it's gotta be a surrender vessel to him and he Woo's you by his spirit to where he comes into a place of submission that he can place his life and his seal in you as many as received him to them gave he the authority to become the sons of God he's the quicken of the word I want you to think of this here as Paul has went through this in Romans nine paul paulie interjects throughout the book of Romans man I love the book of Romans I love the whole Bible but I look at this within the book of Romans and you find how Paul is so careful in the book of Romans to remind us as Gentiles from whence we have come he's mindful to do that because pride is a nasty thing you know brother Branham was speaking to a person on the prayer line and he said sister he said you were healed one time in your body he said but you got a little hotty with that testimony and God allowed the sickness to return so haughtiness and pride God doesn't like it at all and this is where Paul is letting it be known hey we got to be mindful of the grace that has come to you and I hear we look at this in Romans 11 verse 25 Paul said I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery this mystery lest you should buy by wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in so the blindness here to Israel we understand that it wasn't God forcibly blinding them but it was that they themselves were actually their heart waxed gross they actually turned their heart they stopped up their ears the Bible says in the book of Zechariah their heart became as adamant stone and we understand that wanted what it was is here that even when God was trying to call them back in line and back into the word but yet they would refuse to hear what God was saying but they gave preeminence to their traditions and to their Creed's they gave that preeminence to where that their heart became that of waxed gross or calloused or having like that part of fat around it to where God was not able to move that wasn't it was like a chamber of the heart that was damaged and it could no longer get in the circulation of the blood that takes the nutrients and the life it was no longer moving the way that it ought to be because the tradition had clogged it up and it separated them from the life line but here's the mystery of it they are blinded until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in I believe were there I believe we're there the fullness of the Gentiles be come in notice verse 26 and so all Israel shall be saved well who's all Israel the Israel of God not every single person who can declare I'm a Jew is going to be safe but there is an Israel that God has had in his mind 144,000 those that will be there God had them in his mind God knew exactly where they would be he knew exactly the dispersion that would take place in the land whatever country wherever they would be at but God by His Spirit would move upon the hearts to ensure if it wasn't returning it was their parents returning and here they are born in the land God himself is overseeing everything to bring in in position all my brother and sister that ought to give you an eye such a rest and a consolation such a trust it ought to be something to listen a rest and a consolation doesn't mean we don't pray for the fulfillment of it know we can pray for the fulfillment of God's Word when God has given a promise in his word then you and I ought to take that and pray about that and say well you know it's going to happen anyhow but your prayer is designated in declaring your faith and your desire to see this word fulfilled hallelujah amen so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins God God made a promise he's going to visit him he's going to purify the sons of Levi he's gonna purify like silver and gold he's gonna take them from when they're offering up on all of those sacrifices that are pointing to the true atonement and then that that by him revealing himself to his brethren how that the prophets there will be their notice how that Elijah would be there in Moses what will they be doing they will be pointing out that then identifying that Christ is the fulfillment of all things who they will be there with a ministry that's four running is coming and that ministry that's four running his coming will be the ministry where they will preach the same gospel the same baptism of the Holy Ghost and they will have the hearts of the people so turned to Christ - any steps on the sea to reveal himself to his brethren they will recognize him how will they recognize him because by the revealing of the they have seen his character and they have been united with him so when he appears they will recognize him glory be to God so how is it that you and I identify Christ it's by the word Christ Himself being revealed because he is always identified by his characteristics glory be to God ma then the offering shall be acceptable unto the Lord what's this in Romans 11:28 here's where Paul says for the Jews as very speaking to the Gentiles as concerning the gospel they the Jews are enemies for your sakes enemies now remember Paul has already been dealing with things in the Galatian Church you've got individuals Paul called and false brethren is that right not saying that there weren't some who were struggling but Paul identified how that these men you say well how could Paul call and false brethren because Paul was able to identify what their motive and objective was their motive and objective was to bring glory to their ministry glory to their name they wanted to be affected by the people turning and following them so here here there were men those in that time you know we've seen the Jews as they rose up they thought the Lord Jesus himself they thought that he had come to destroy the law then they didn't they think the same way with Paul they thought Paul was against the law they're right and there were men that stood there in that time that wanted to compel Timothy and Titus to be circumcised but thank God Paul stood there and said they will not no sir we're not bowing to what your opinion is we're staying with the word aren't you glad for that we're not bowing to the opinion or tradition just because you're not walking further fully in the unfolding of the word we're not going according to this you know what that would have done weakened the faith glory be to God so notice how concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election now notice what he's speaking of the Jews but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake so we understand there were those who were Judaizers were coming into the church but yet where Paul was speaking of this here he's recalling the Gentiles to the grace that's been given and how that we with Thanksgiving ought to be thankful for the grace that God has shown to us because there is an elect Jew that God is going to turn to now think of this mystery how Paul wrote this here he says this mystery think of the mystery with Joseph here Joseph in his life here he is in exile he's out of envy he's he's sold and sold into slavery and then how that we understand within that mystery here while he's away that there is a Gentile bride is taken but the Gentile bride he's not just given to Joseph without there being something that is that he's done but we find that there was a need to arise to where Joseph he steps on the scene and he begins to interpret the dreams he begins to interpret the word is that right and when that takes place notice it is there were favored recognizes this ministry that hey what was spoken before concerning what this man did years ago he's still doing the same thing today and as he was doing the same thing today notice he said he gave him that of a bride I knew with me he gave him a Gentile bride so here is Joseph he's taken a bride and the Brethren don't know what's happened to him they don't know what's taking place they're still under the effects of this but God has everything in place because God even would have it declared to where when they came to Joseph it would be known that he indeed was sent ahead as a preserver of life if Joseph would have just remained there there would not have been a preserving a Gentile life and listen now if there's not because the Jews were blinded rejecting it if there is not a preserving of life one that God Himself can take residence manifest his glory then there's no return to the Jews mystery of Ruth here is Ruth season wasn't born in the land she didn't come out of the land but here Naomi and them are out of the land in exile is that right but notice how Ruth makes a way that died God shall be my god Ruth doesn't know what lays ahead but think of this now how that the Spirit of God moving there and by Ruth moving in there under the direction there is a kinsman by the name of Bo ass remember Naomi herself she was in need of a kinsman but it was Ruth herself that she had sent out and Ruth through that kinsman through Boaz she was redeemed or taken there unto unto Boaz and then through that seed of life Boaz gives to her a child a son and that son has been given to Naomi and they only becomes a nourisher of that child is that right the Bible said he shall be a restorer of thy life his very gospel that came to the to battle Ruth and mystery it returns right back through from the Gentile right back to the Jew again the little book not of Naomi it's the Book of Ruth for chapters there were four riders of death but there's four riders of life well here with me this book of Ruth Oh My glory be to God so to think of it of how that with this design let me just dwell on this a moment here because the Bible said that that Zion out of Zion shall come to deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob so we noticed this Zion when we look at this in the scripture that Zion itself Zion being a type of the bride of Jesus Christ remember when David is coming here into a place to to take you know the the land there or coming to Jerusalem that there were Jeb your sites at that time who were in there and remember these guys were still under Confederate they had come there but under the pact that Joshua and them had made there with some you with me but notice what these guys say - - concerning - David they say you can come in here but you can't bring any lame blind or halt in here what a condition to meet but David David sends up and he says let it be the one who will get up and get the city and he said let him smite him and let him smart the lame halting black we're in there because let him not say that David can not bring in the late lame the Halton blind you know that speaking of you and me there was a dinner there was a separate that was prepared for when the Christ Himself came but that Jewish Church said we're not gonna come to your supper we got all kinds of excuses and all kinds of reasons and he said go out there in the highways and the byways and call the lane the hole and the blind let me tell you something he is the fountain that is Oakland in the house of David I'm gonna tell you something a person comes into him lame they don't walk out lame they might come and blind the eyes come open my walk in hope but they come out home why they're coming in with David who are David the anointed king who is this The Anointed Messiah whoa hallelujah no wonder the scripture would speak oh that salvation of Israel work come out of Zion when the Lord bring us back the captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad ala we're out of Zion and the bride Amen that Childress glory out of Zion oh my out of Zion how that it says is the perfection of beauty God has shined he is our light you with me this word this life taking residency in your life it's in this right here is in this word itself taking a whole and how the notice here how that God has been collecting his subjects down through the Gentile ages what's he been doing he's been collecting all of those whose names are written in Zion and what's he doing building up Zion a man and he's in here he is he's issuing forth life itself is coming out of Zion glory be to God there is beauty coming out of Zion what beauty is it it's not the beauty of man it's the beauty of his own life a beauty that the world despises but it's a beauty of his own character not us but him it's him it's his life shining through it's him bringing all things to a perfection out of our life this is this is the promise that he made in Joel the Lord shall roar forth out of Zion oh yes sir this is not an event coming this is the Lord roaring out of Zion this is his life hey man those seven thunders hear when those seven seals were open and the Bible said that he sounded and when he sounded there it was seven thunders of roar brother and sister those voices they did not stay out there but that same life that same voice is now sounding in the bride of Jesus Christ don't you realize the word itself it's coming to a maturity and a perfection it is not going to be our voice that calls them out of the grave but it is the voice of the resurrection the manifestation and ripening of the promise that will bring about the resurrection [Music] hallelujah Quinn the fulfillment of the promise of the Messiah what happened it had to give way and they arose with him in his rapture glory be to God hallelujah out of Zion you know friends where this puts it it's a god what a responsibility but you know it's not the responsibility that we have to perform it where we're not the performers we are simply vessels vessels that are given now what if you went into your house today maybe you're real thirsty and you went into your house and it just so happens that that here you are out working or doing something and you have a need for a drink and you come back into the house and you realize you open up the cabinets oh there's no vessels oh no oh forgot to run the dishwasher maybe there's plastic cups God don't want temporary vessels maybe their staff from God don't want temporary vessels are you with me god no one disposable Christians he wants a vessel that he can use a vessel meaning that we in our lives are so present and living our lives that whenever that he would want to use us if he would want to use us were available but it's enough just to be ready be ready stay ready but what's this how Paul brings us here in Ephesians chapter 2 wherefore remember remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh Gentiles we're not in the soul in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope without God in the world let me remind you even how the disciples themselves looked at the syrophoenician woman she was a Greek a Gentile stop bugging him and the Lord Jesus himself what did he call her a dog it's just like the word when the word has struck across our pathway and calls us a dog but yet there's something down beneath that it says he's talking to me true Lord you see what it is there's something beneath that that's able to submit itself what is that it's not the Greek the Greeks are all in learning and all puffed up but it shows that among all that could be so learned but if there is something beneath that that's able to humble itself to the presence of God God will come and meet that need for when she said that's true Lord that release to her who he was to her glory be to God think of it she had no hope coming to him that way she knew it was knew what he was able to do but she didn't have a hope right here within the covenants the adoptions all of those that were pertaining who was it pertaining to Israel as far as spoken over them but the mystery within it was the Gentile but now all glory but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ but now in not believing on in Christ Jesus baptized in to Jesus Christ are made nigh by the blood so when we look at this new testament the issuing in of this new testament the new testament church is none other than the bride of Jesus Christ it is that of his sovereign election and choosing those that he's already had be greed in the will or testament that was before the foundation of the world he chose us in Christ remember has the Lord Jesus Christ we read in our opening text he said drink of this cup for in this cup is the blood of the New Testament what was it it was the life of the New Testament who is that Christ so now the the issuing in of this New Testament now let's just move ahead here just for a little bit this morning and look at this in Hebrews chapter 8 verse 6 the Bible is speaking now sitting setting the difference between that of the erotic or Levitical priesthood and that of the priesthood us after the order of Melchizedek and he begins Paul is separating the difference between the sacrifices that they have offered which could not make anybody perfect but now through him by this one this great high priest this holy one undefiled the one who became us by his life he now is able to offer up and he's able to perfect and bring forth what is necessary but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry notice I places this here it didn't say that that the vertical priesthood and that were there that it wasn't a good ministry it was only a shadow and a type but now this is the excellent ministry because through this this is a ministry that Excel if it can do what the Levitical priesthood could never ever do but how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant watch these words which was established upon better promises so this better covenant this New Testament is not something that's new it's what was established before but now is coming to view glory verse seven for if that first covenant had been faultless none watch how Paul breaks on this if that first covenant had been faultless then shed no place have been sought for the second the first covenant that Paul is speaking of here is this covenant of where the law itself enters for finding fault with them there wasn't any Fault in the law the law was good the law was holy the law is spiritual come on so it wasn't any fault with the law because the law itself is God's own nature scribed into stone but God didn't want it the objective is not that it would become ascribed in stone but that it would be upon the tables of the heart but do you see how it was when the Lord Jesus came it was inscribed on stony hearts you with me they didn't have mercy for nobody laughs no sir they didn't have time for nobody if it's not according to how I see it in my eyes at all that's where it was what was it it was the law written upon stony hearts well was it bondage they were still in bondage they didn't know they needed to be free they were right there the way they were going about it showed the fault he finding fault with them he said behold the days come saith the Lord when I make a new covenant notice when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel at the house of Judah he found fault but look what he did look at his promises he found fault fault with what not the law but for with what that nature that was within them the heart was not right but he's most not condemning them he said because of this I will make a new covenant can't you see where God Himself barriers they need the people couldn't help themselves you and I couldn't help ourselves but not himself he knows what you and I had need of that's his grace not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind i will write them in their hearts and I will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest no respecter person the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost only recognizes royalty and that royalty is the royal seed of Abraham it doesn't matter what your status is in life and no matter how high you are or how low you are it does not matter about status what it looks at is that seed that's there when he came to the woman at the well oh my she had a visitation that day where she had the Old Testament prophecies and the Lord Jesus brought the match that was needed and what did it do it changed her life he did what she could have never done for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities well I remember no more in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old him that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away a new covenant a new testament yet if we take it just by or words that we use new it would seem like that this is a covenant that has never been before but yet this is a covenant that's already been spoken of it was a covenant that's traveled clear from the mind of God and God has given little glimpses of it down through time as a matter of fact when it has come to the fulfillment of this covenant there has always been an exodus an exodus comes to confirm and bring forth what is in this covenant it came down there in Egypt what was it it was a token that was ministered in that time then you find how that there was a longevity of time and how that the people themselves work everything got accumulated but here came the Lord Jesus in that time here he stands to minister the Covenant to Israel what comes forth out of that a token in that time there's a second Exodus leading from Judea Judaism into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now after the Gentile age the fullness of the Gentiles it's coming to a place now to where now has the son of man himself standing and revealing himself oh my in the lives of the people of God in this hour there is the token of the Holy Ghost that's given in this hour amen our token that whereby in this hour the third Exodus where we are promised a deliverance and that deliverance has already started in the hearts of God's people we've been delivered from traditions delivered from Creed's deliver from dogmas and because of that deliverance there's a life giver on the inside that will not allow a tradition to remain if our thinking is wrong he'll override it oh my he's throwing it all down this new covenant was was established was established on better promises look how this fault that he had found with them this fault was as though Israel could go about and could do the law think of how David said David you know that David himself he loved he loved the law of the Lord David David according to that that ability that was given in that time the Holy Ghost would come upon him and it would pull back and it would come just like the prophets he would come upon him and it would pull back is that right the Holy Ghost would come on and would pull back but you see when the Bible here was the declaration of the Messiah the visitation of the Son of man was is that when you shall see him descend from heaven and on whom he remaineth not cometh and goeth not cometh and God know who remaineth this son the same is he Oh glory so it's not a coming and a going an up and a down and an up going down but now within this here remember David remember what David said he said Allah put your word as frontlets on my eyes and I've put your word in my heart that I might not sin against you all those things are wonderful and David meant there was always heart those are things that at that time David did according to what the strength and everything of a man could do according to what God had released him in that time but that still itself no matter how good a person could be because remember you couldn't put a finger upon the lives of these men but looking down into the depths of their lives there was still a fault that was there and that fault was there was a fault that they had been born under and they had to be delivered of that first birth no matter who they're dead in no matter who their mama was they had to be delivered of that first birth and there's only one that could deliver them from the first birth there had to be one that would become one of us that would be born of a virgin no repeater God God had to had to get himself a son back God had to God had to get himself a tabernacle a temple a vessel alive but surrendered heart and so notice when the Lord Jesus comes a prophecy that rings out in Psalm Zo's I did like to do that will Oh God my law is within my heart it wasn't just something out here it wasn't just something here but it was here it was lived out righteousness was being lived out and expressed through this vessel now notice this need for mediator this need for a mediator let me just work with this just a few moments here because this covenant the Bible says here that we read in in Hebrews Paul mentions in multiple times the word mediator it was also that that Jesus Christ Himself being the mediator of this better covenant of this new covenant this new covenant that was established upon better promises now what's this in the scripture here him we look at what a mediator you know when you have a mediator it's somebody who is a go-between somebody that there's a begins there's a tie there's a tie that other tie the two together there's got to be somebody who can come to that can that can actually move to actually intervene between two right a mediator must come in order to to bring about there's a there's a there's a joining together or a compact or a contract that's that's to be entered into it requires a mediator to be there so there's a need for a mediator here is God's desire and knowing that everything that God has spoken but yet there's got to be a mediator there there's got to be one who can come and put his hands on sinful man and on a holy God and bridge the gap there's got to be one that can do that and so God Himself he sends a messenger before his face as I write and here John the Baptist his ministry is pointing out behold he cometh the Lamb of God here is one that's going to come that is take away the sins of the world John was so sure of that you know why because God had revealed it and it was according to the promise think of John himself as he stood there in that time and and the word was so alive to him that John could identify himself his place in the scripture there John was standing with divine authority by the word that had been revealed at him in that hour and here John was letting it be known behold the lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world his ministry began to cry out he's among you he's among you there's one among you now John's ministry was a ministry that could identify he is now here who is the one who could stand as a mediator the one who can stand in the breach Oh glory be to God why is willing to be known that there is one that's able to remove the curse that's able to remove the fault that's able to deal with the problem Malachi 3 verse 1 behold I will send my messenger then he shall prepare the way before me remember what John when we looked at that some weeks and weeks ago when John came John came to people he came to people to be Bible readers we could say that day they had the message of Moses when he came to him they said us repent what are you talking about we don't need to repent you see what 1 look this is not this was not what the word what God intended the law to do the law or the word was never given to puff somebody up so they weren't walking in the true meaning of it they had become so inflated in themselves too they see no need to repent dear god what a sorry condition Lord keep us from that keep us humble Lord whoa brother Samuel that's just given that's a haughty spirit right there it's not just given every day of our life we've got to make a decision to be humble let me tell you something friends Cain was humble you know that I preached that here the Prophet tells us Kane himself humbled himself before God but he could not humble himself to the degree that Abel could how could Abel humble himself to that degree because it was in him to recognize the word and submit to it what the word was calling for so everybody in this earth can be humble but what it matters is are we humble to him is it humility to him I'm so thankful that even when our pride can get in the way I'll say our pride that the Spirit of God can go to dealing with our life and begin to speak to us in such a way and we say Oh Lord forgive me because you realize pride it's not just things that we do pride it's not just things that we say pride is sometimes the way you think all you would never say it out but can they do stuff like this you never say it out but you think it and remember by your thoughts you create an atmosphere what a responsibility recognizing the grace that's given notice now the Lord noticed this promise and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he delighted he's the author he's the messenger of the Covenant so here you have John's ministry going forth but now and the Lord the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant in whom you delight in now we know that in that day that there were those who did delight in him when he made himself known to them the messenger of the Covenant in Christ they delighted in him is that right but then we find that there were those that did not delight in the messenger of the Covenant this messenger of the Covenant none other than Christ himself God are you with me the messenger of the Covenant now think of this here is the messenger of the Covenant what covenant that covenant that was before the foundation of the world that covenant that issued in to Abraham here he comes as the messenger of the Covenant the same one that was with them in the church in the wilderness the same one that was there in the beginning the same one that was with them in the exodus journey the same one who was there when Moses passed off the scene the same one who revealed to Joshua and who brought him into the land the same one that messenger of the Covenant you see Levi or Aaron himself this Aaron he was able to minister but he could not Minister up a better covenant Aaron can only minister of that covenant which spoke of bondage it spoke of a need for a deliverance hey Aaron himself had to minister he had to minister an offering of sin for his own self first but this one he didn't have to minister an offering for his own sin he himself was the supreme perfect offering the Lamb of God now by this he's able to minister those promises that are contained within that covenant I want you to watch this here this Ministry of the Covenant let me just let me just have just a few more moments here look how Paul picks this up in Galatians chapter 3 verse 7 and he's speaking now to the Galatian Church know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham remember how Paul has made this difference than just because they are seeded of Abraham does not mean that they are of the promise it's those who are of the promise that are of faith they are the ones who are spoke enough now what's this scripture in verse 8 and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham so God's a preacher God preached unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed you see what Paul is using is now how the administration has changed from the validity stood to that priesthood after the order of Melchizedek it's where the light has come and that ministry goes forth as the son himself is revealing himself through that ministry to call the children of God unto Christ not after the old order the old order is bondage right the old order is bonding is always pointing back to this old order no no the old order is bondage remember that's the same spirit that worked down through the church ages are you with me that wanted to set up a holy man we only hear this man we hear no other man you anthony friends back that's a wrong spirit that's the spirit of Antichrist no matter what's Pope or whoever people make it they can make it their favorite preacher they can make it this or one or more it's an antichrist spirit we are to hear the voice of God is that right and the voice of God is that voice of many waters is that right God has a messenger to every age but then from that messenger the light goes out is that right that pattern goes out in the ministry of others what is the ministry of others to call to speak to those and call them into the covenant with Jesus Christ not under an old order oh my you see when they came what they were wanting to do they going to keep pointing people back to Moses come on friends they wanted to keep pointing him back to Moses well you're leaving Moses you're getting away from Moses they kept on one to do that they didn't realize that was bondage if you don't continue in the word you're in bondage you must continue in the perfect law of Liberty glory be to God so here God foreseeing that he would justify the heathen he preached before the gospel unto Abraham now when God preached his gospel he came not inward only when he preached that they Abraham became a power and demonstration is that right he called Abraham out what he spoke to Abraham he revealed this is the land I was talking to you about who did it call it called the elect out God visited him in signs and forms and lights and dreams God visited him there was the gifts that were present with this visitation are you with me it continued to accumulate on down through time even how God himself would make himself known to Abraham now let's go on here in the book of Galatians where it speaks of how that Paul goes on talking about you know how it's not of its the law in the law it says by faith it's not not of the law and Christ he said was redeemed has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith through faith what's faith revelation it's not well I believe I got it I'll just go ahead no no that's my hope my faith is where the word itself is preached faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so it shows look the word can go forth and yet people not hear the word in the words going forth alright because the word itself there must be a hearing of that as the Spirit of God tunes in that heart and what's it doing it's drawing the heart onto Christ to a place of surrender to learn that even a person can say I need the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior I'm a sinner thank God for that that's a start that's the beginning but that's not what we're talking about there's a start to that there must be a call to but then that same Spirit of God works to bring a cleansing a sanctified life where it scours out be inside that he himself might feel it with his own life and that's not something that's just a faith it is something that is divinely vindicated by the overcoming power within your life you with me Galatians 3:15 something I'll probably think I'm making good on that promise I made exactly no though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dissin knows it or addeth there - it doesn't matter what's come after God confirmed the Covenant it doesn't annul the company once God has confirmed the covenant whatever could come after it does not dissing off the covenant now if we can apply this just even in our spiritual walk after God has confirmed himself in you his life has so transformed your life to where your desire is for him and him alone you can look back and say mom I've made mistakes here I've fallen short here I've fallen short there but inside of your heart burns a desire to please him when the slightest little thing would come along that seems to disturb him in any way quickly you're there to say Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord because you are sealed unto the day of your redemption now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as a war and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say look at this verse that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ oh my Paul is reaching clear back before there was Adam Stardust where it was in God's mine but then to Abraham God confirmed it in Christ to Abraham remember Abraham standing in Genesis 15 whereby shall I know I shall inherit and God and veiled Calvary right there this is how you shall know you shall inherit the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all it was Christ back there that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise so here he stands the messenger of the Covenant Christ the Bible says that he who you delight in he shall come suddenly to his temple remember there was not a temple even though that this in type could be laid upon David's heart by God but yet even how Solomon would express it that there's not a house that man can build you that she would come into Elian I think of how brother banner picks it up in prayer one time he said Lord there's not a building here on this earth that's worthy of your presence there's not one of us that's worthy Lord but he said how thankful we are that you don't look at that you come according to your word aren't you glad not according to our worthiness I'm so glad for that so here he comes suddenly to his temple it's his temple a temple that was not made with hands a tent that the Lord Himself pitched this was a body that he prepared for himself to come and dwell in a tabernacle a temple and here we find that down there that day at the River Jordan that here John had been proclaiming he's here he's here but there that day here it was the word walked out into the water to the Prophet and their eyes met one another and about that time here that when he went as his baptizing him the heavens were opened and how the heavens were open here came the Spirit of God descending down in the form of a devil my it was that same pillar fire but in the form of a dove because God was not coming into a building of stone he was coming into his human temple Alleluia here's the messenger of the Covenant here's the mediator that's here all my to think of it there's one relationship that you and I have to God and that is Jesus that's the truth without Jesus Christ you and I have no connection back and that's why they make Jesus Christ men less than God to make him the second person you're not redeemed you're still in your sins but it is the very God of glory the messenger of the Covenant himself that has prepared a body there was not no one who was worthy or could produce that kind of a body but he provided the body himself how did he provide it he provided it by His Word and he's done the same thing down through the ages there was not a church that could produce a body but he himself has brought forth by his word a body a masterpiece that he might step into and reflect his glory through hallelujah think of where we're standing in the sour at any moment any moment the change can come where we stand in line with the Scriptures the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses oh my if he were added more if he had imputed the trespasses that have been no hope is that right here were those that came and they caught the woman in adultery now watch this what's that prideful spirit they come in there and they had their stones they gathered together they weren't gathering to minister mercy I think then people like stoning people except today it ain't stones it's quotes or scriptures glory how am I getting ahead of myself here well let that marinate but they wanted him to condemn her he said whichever ones among you without sin let him be the first one to cast you you want to cast stones go ahead you're without sin go ahead oh you need my mercy then drop your stones you need you need my mercy then drop him I need his mercy I need his mercy I'm not talking about over there saying I'm not gonna be a compromise or the work be careful that that spirit is not an arrogant spirit that works to put people down that's pride but notice the Bible declares to us in this time then the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth here he is stepping forward stepping forward in his word declaring himself this cleric the covenant to you and I the Bible says for it please the father or in him to all fullness dwell look at this look look friends listen don't let this just be history this this right here is the pattern of the hour it's been the pattern that's been laid down through the ages because as the bride was taken out of the groom she is to reflect he is as the prophet told us an indictment the example son of what God intends every son and daughter of God to be so the way that he came to minister think of this in this time for in him it pleased the father it pleased him to move down in his life this wasn't an automatic it wasn't just automatically given well you know this is this is a temple that the Lord has made this wasn't just automatic but he found him in perfect obedience young with me this morning I know I've know I'm going a little bit longer but don't don't let this slip you don't let this slip by you don't let this just be that of old maja I'm thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ look at this this is a pattern this is the pattern of where we are to be in this hour we're not in the feet were not in the thighs we're not in the torso we're not in the eyes we're in the mind it's a full body that which he's able to have preeminence inside of it pleased the father look what this did it pleased the father did well having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled was there any way that you or me was there anything that we could do or produce that would bring this reconciling so it was all on him well brother Samuel we have to submit I know that but what is it that brings submission commands demands or is it is love his presence in this was his love God's love manifested unto us it requires us to come into submission but to think about it he'd we don't come into submission oh no oh no I don't want to go to hell huh that's fear that's not why we serve the Lord we serve the Lord because we love Him the Lord Jesus said if any man will keep my commandment love me and keep my Commandments we will come and make our abode he's drawn by the honouring of his word think of that how that God himself so moved down Paul puts it like this in the book of Romans let me just read one verse two verses to you here in Romans 15 7 and do you good to read that read the first few verses of Romans 15 look where Paul he would seem like Paul's so out of so out of context here he's not he just talks in the first six verses of how we ought to relate among one another as a body and after that relation you know Paul deals with that a lot the one Paul is a spirit of God but notice how he brings it in verse 7 of Romans 15 wherefore receive you one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God how am I to receive as as Christ received us remember what we were regarded as dogs heathens there wasn't any good title behind us but how did Christ receive us not imputing their trespasses unto them but he came to deal with it look what this says in verse 8 now I say this that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the father's but the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy as it is written for this cause I will confess the among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name and again he saith rejoice ye Gentiles with his people and again praise the Lord all you Gentiles and laud him all you people and again Isaiah said there shall a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust Jesus Christ was a servant a minister of the circumcision of the truth he who was the highest of the highest became the lowest of the Lost remember when he is speaking to those the sons of zebedee and he addresses and asked the question they go through things there is indignation that rises up among the other ten and the Lord Jesus speaks to them and lets them know been in the Gentile kingdoms the exercise authority over one another whoever is the great one exercises authority but he says this shall not be this way in the kingdom of God and it goes on to let them know that even for me I have not come the son of man has not come to be ministered to I've come to minister see wasn't about being ministered to he came to minister the truth of the Covenant not just Minister it he was the Covenant there was the Covenant there within him the promise the oath that was made it was laying right there is that right and then that day on Calvary when the veil in the temple in the top to the bottom was rent there he was hanging in plain think of how this here a servant when we bring it down to our own lives our own hearts how about in our lives the issuing in of the New Testament if the issuing in of the New Testament it requires one laying down its life then the issuing in of this promise requires us to lay down our life and it requires us to lay down our lives again and again and again is that right Jesus carried his cross there right one day one time but he said to you and I take up your cross daily and follow me remembering this not a man we're not here to be served we're here to serve we're here to serve to give our lives this is the whole this is one of the foundation principles here of the New Testament the New Testament is the issuing in of the New Covenant the better covenant the marriage covenant it's not serving one being served when it's us serving he took upon himself the form of a servant made in the likeness of man aren't you glad aren't you glad that he came to serve if he had come to be served we wouldn't be redeemed but you see it wasn't just the act friends he wasn't just the act it wasn't Calvary was not just an act this was reality he laid down his life why did he do that for you and me aren't you glad for that what a challenge then it comes to our hearts and our lives as the bride of Jesus Christ to remember it's not about me being served and I'm too sorry it's a serf you're to serve I'm to serve is that right I might have my needs I might have my feelings I might but it's about him is that right say lord help me help me Lord help me to override override my feelings oh brother Samuel the feelings feelings are very real I agree with that but let us not elevate them they'll glorify their let us not put them to a place to where they're greater than God but let us look to the Lord who is able you believe that this morning oh my even service have two servant it comes to serve serving think of this friend he serves what you and I have need of and that wonderful he knows what you're dealing with in your life he knows the pressures he knows everything that you're going through he sees it and he himself would so subject himself to come and minister to our needs there's a lot of things that he could say a lot of things that he could say and be really good be really good but if it doesn't minister to our needs and it's just serving him it's not him serving us but you see what it does when he comes down to serve and minister to us what does that do it draws out of us it draws out of us a surrendered willingness the issuing in of this New Testament surrendered life-giving over to him lord help us Jesus help us let's pray Lord Jesus or truly you are the quicken ER of the word Lord Jesus it's you Lord that makes you Word Alive and real to our hearts well Jesus we're so thankful Lord God for your great mercy so thankful Lord God as we go to look down through of your word here this morning Lord we look Lord God Lord just as Paul

I can feel like so many times if I look back in years ago I can think I felt like I was giving my all then but then there's things that you know Lord just in seasons the Lord will deal with certain things in our lives I didn't I didn't realize that Lord in that way but you know once he deals with something once he deals with something in our life it's different there's a there's a conviction
