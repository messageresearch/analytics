that lord that we would be edified lord in you father i ask o god that you'll just now lord have your way for every need lord whether it be spiritual need whether it be a physical need lord you're still god and we just asked lord that you would just lord take control now lord in the remaining part of the service ministering lord to the visible and invisible audience we pray lord we ask it lord in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god amen amen let's go right into the word here to first corinthians 13 4. and uh certainly i want to say those of you that streaming by the internet we certainly appreciate your patience uh with everything at times the way things sometimes the way things go um one of the great blessings about heaven will be there'll be no technology that's a small thing but you know technology is a good thing but it's a it's something else when you're trying to get it and trying to work with it so um and i'm about as ignorant as ignorant can be except when it comes to studying in certain programs and everything else so i was trying to get that back there and ben was working with it so i just appreciate your patience with us and we just want to turn our hearts to the word of the lord tonight and just invite him that you come and just speak to us you want to look here in this scripture here again in first corinthians 13 verse 4. the bible says charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up i'd like to look at that that verb that part right there in the middle of it if we we could here this evening where charity vaunted not itself you notice how paul he starts out writing with what some of the attributes that would be of charity but then here even in the middle of this verse he'll switch over to some things that are not attributes of charity and one of these is wanted not itself to be boastful to brag to glory in oneself that's not charity so may god bless his word and bless you as you're being seated the amplified bible would pick it up in this way in that particular portion without reading the whole verse would say it's not boastful or vain glorious vainglorious meaning that which is empty glory the word vantif here is it deals comes from the very word that needs to be a braggart and i don't i think that those are things sometimes that we to brag to be a braggart is one who brags and sometimes those are things that it's just something about it you don't have to have real sharp discernment to kind of pick that up and sometimes there's things that can kind of just go to a certain level and you know there's a lot of phrases that you know maybe you heard of and maybe you don't i know they're not just southern phrases i know i just didn't hear my mom say him but you've heard the things where people say you sound like you're tooting your own horn and you know these are things you know that you know there's a lot of phrases that go along with it but it deals with you know where a person would actually uh to vaunt oneself is to really to express things whether by words sometimes it's not even in words it's the way maybe the material of things you know brother brown would tell us over and over from that time he was in the museum and then he keeps using that example throughout the message and he brings it to a place of how they displayed that even a person i believe they were six six foot or maybe they were five foot ten i don't know uh but about 150 or so pounds and when you boil it all down they're only they're only worth 84 cents brother graham said enough whitewash to sprinkle a bird's nest so it's not very much and brother adam said you know here were some men that were standing behind him and you know he said they were kind of you know flexing and everything else that they were doing he said brother adam told him he said now that it says it's no that that our bodies it's not worth more than 84 cents he said but the soul in there is worth more than 10 000 worlds [Music] and that's what that's what god came to redeem that's what we've been looking at on sundays that's the part that god came to redeem and through that redemption that leads us back into the redemption of the body and truly there's things that when we can always have before us i believe it's god's desire that we always have it before us never forget where he brought us from you know he remember told israel before they ever went into the land he told them you know let them know there's going to be things that you will prosper and these things when your hands have been able to cultivate this and gather this and gather that but he said beware lest thou forget that that it is the lord thy god that it calls thee to get these things and to recognize that any blessing that we would have and i think that for believers when we look at blessings we we certainly we can appreciate material things but we don't but the greatest blessing and what we we afford is the blessing of god is the blessing of his own life in our soul because with that right there you know it really doesn't matter we can have a lot of even ambitions for our children and a lot of other ambitions but i say it like this if there's one thing that we should have and i believe that we would have and that's that that each and every one would know the lord jesus christ because once a soul has met the lord jesus christ they got the best guide of their life they've got one who will stick with them closer than a brother they've got one that when father and mother will you know go by the wayside i the lord will take them up we've got one who's faithful so much that brother branham when he would speak about even of the trophies that god had allowed him to have uh fishing and hunting and things like that you'll find brother branham in the message of god and brother branham will say he said i couldn't have done that without him he said any trophy that i have he said it's because that he gave it to me so brother branham you know you hear when you would hear a talk of different ones and brother branham was quite a marksman and quite a shooter and different things and even some insights that you would hear but even within all of that brother bannon himself he he did not really he did not rest it or put it to his ability that i'm a good shot and i'm this or i'm that but he winds it all up in that it's god that has provided it's god that's made away it's god that has given these things to me and i i believe that with all my heart that god you know with these things when we look at it you know there's some things in our life if i can just break it over in this regards there's times in our life of things that you come in contact with where you need to be able to have confidence in the abilities you have there there's a part where you recognize the abilities that god has given you but your confidence does not rest in those abilities or even the accolades or whatever has been able to be achieved you recognize this is a god-given ability and i'm trusting on god and it's god who's been able to work through me let me just bring it simple when you go in for a job interview people of the world are not going to understand when you say i wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for the lord i can't do nothing if it's not for god but what's important is it's not so much that that's said right here it's important that that is the characteristic of our heart because when that comes out in that manner whatever is said when you have to be able to relate whatever's on your resume or whatever the abilities that god has given you there's a spirit of humility that comes with it that witness is there even in that hour that even the people of the world can pick it up and say this guy's not tooting his own horn this guy's not you know blowing his own trumpet this guy's you know not not trying to lift himself up it's things that people are able to pick up that the that what is even behind the words and i think that when we would look at this we understand that there are times that we you know would come into it in in our lives and paul if i could just start it in this manner paul would pick it up in philippians chapter 2 the beginning of those verses where he would admonish our the the believing church of the living god that if there's any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind and let nothing notice where he goes with this let nothing be done through strife or vain glory so when the scripture says let it not be done this way there's a reality that that always lays there present yes but it must be brought in subjection let nothing be done through strife or vainglory we're trying to put oneself forward but rather in loneliness of mind esteem each each each uh each esteem other better than themselves this is the very character of jesus christ this god's very nature that is on display this is where the word is admonishing us in these scriptures for unity and in order to really see god move it requires unity and you know anything for unity when we come together in unity we all at different times we have our thoughts about something or our opinions or our feelings but in order for there to be unity it requires us to be able to lay those things aside and assemble for one purpose and there's one objective there's one goal that we have as a believer as even a body and that is to see the lord jesus christ glorified in our midst we might come into a service and it might seem like the text that's being taken this doesn't seem like this is going to apply to my need we've got a choice in that hour and then that moment either we can say hey we need to be about my mountain or we can say hey it's time to take your mountain tonight let's go get it we've got an opportunity right here when we come together we recognize that we're not here with pitchforks to pitch the word somewhere else but we always want to have a heart of humility that god is ever present to deal with our lives and that our lives would be molded and shaped that out of our lives it might come forth a greater consecration a more surrendered life we're more aware and we're more sensitive to the things that are around us we're also more aware of our weaknesses but we're also more aware of the god who is in us that's greater than every weakness you know paul was an apostle which we know that paul was also he was a prophet he was a messenger he would he would uh you know mention there even as i'm a minister uh uh uh to the circumstance or jesus christ was a minister to the circumcision but he would speak of how that god he knew his position in christ and what that position was that the gentiles the offering up as he said it might be sanctified by the holy ghost that that the gentiles themselves would be received by god and it would be by the work of the holy spirit so paul when he would would set this forth he was not only apostle he was a prophet he was a brother to to the body of jesus christ but he was also a realist as well amen paul was one that paul could he laid it out of the real redeeming work and the real plan of god in the election of god we find peter peter would would write of the of the election of god that was not a stumbling stone in the early church that was a foundation principle of the election of the foreknowledge of almighty god and how that the holy spirit comes to seek out and to bring in for redemption that which always belonged to god so paul being with that paul was able to set it forth where he would be even as i could say it tonight a realist where paul would even speak of his own self in romans 7 18 and say for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not paul was aware that every day at every moment he packed his enemy with him even though as paul would describe it that we have been redeemed from the body of of the sins of the flesh wherein that that old nature has passed away and now that new nature is set forth but yet it is a new creation in the same old temple and paul could go on and speak of this in galatians 5 24 it wasn't a daunting paul wasn't afraid of this but paul was posting the church to realize and to where this is our responsibility when paul would say let every man know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor i don't know about you but i look much deeper than a person or maybe a brother you know being weak and you know his head not being turned and look much deeper than that this right here comes into the same place where peter says let us sanctify the lord always in our heart that we might be able to give reason or answer of the hope that lies within us in other words bringing it down for our lives we always want to be available as an instrument that he can use at any [Applause] you know when they do a surgery uh you know i haven't i haven't been in many of those things at all but when they do it there are certain tools that's there but they may not use every single tool but there's tools that are available even when all of our sons were born on certain floors there were many tools that were associated with the birthing center it didn't mean they were going to use all those tools on one of our sons but they were there if they were needed and this is where our lives are to be available and lived in such a way to where it is a life that is sanctified unto the purpose and use of almighty god and you see these things that we're dealing with even with charity if any of the slightness of any vaunting or vainglory or boasting gets in there it hinders god from working how many times you hear brother brandon tell us he says once god will use a man he said he has a hard time finding a man that he can use and that man remaining humble because man gets to looking at and and they get to looking at what was done instead of realizing it's not the man that's doing it and even the ability to be able to yield it is god's grace that would even help you and i to yield to his uh desire and his purpose it's nothing that we can take any glory in i can tell you some of the services that would seem to be uh at times where maybe i have received uh the greatest or response from it it wouldn't be a service that i certainly would not count on saying i'm going to preach that one again i wouldn't think of it in that way i feel like i've just put together you know like shepherd's pie up here or something it just felt like it just come all over but god will do those things also he'll do it for me to keep me reminded that it's not you the gift is not you that gift i put in there for me to use you just get out of the way trust me so here's where paul would say and they that are christ bringing this this point they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust so what is still in the flesh but it's been crucified it's been brought into subjection who they that are christ where christ has established ownership and so if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit notice let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another you see when the scripture when you read in ephesians galatians and so forth when you see that give no place to the devil you find in the book of romans romans 6 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies that you would obey it in the lust thereof it is giving to you and i an admonition because our walk with the lord is not just something that's on autopilot the holy ghost has come by the new birth to quicken that seed of god on the inside then as a son and daughter of god we stand there to reign and to rule and to be able to bring our flesh in subjection that when he might want to pull this way but because that we are christ we have crucified the affections and the lust of the flesh it can want to rise up but there's a greater power there's another king who is present that's king jesus there's another desire that permeates our life so not not to be desirous of vain glory we want we want to work in the harmony with the holy spirit because it's him that works in us according to his mighty power paul would write of this um also in an era in first corinthians 14 and he would speak to the believers as they were coming together there in corinth and he would ask him how is it brethren when you come together every one of you have a song half a doctrine half a tongue half a revelation half an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying paul believed that the holy spirit should dominate the camp of the living god then it ought to be everyone is a participant in worship but just because you don't have a song tonight doesn't mean that you're not a participant just because it may not be your night to preach or to lead or sing a special doesn't mean you're not a participant we are worshipers let me just say this worship goes beyond these walls if the only worship is when we're here something's not right our lives ought to be a praise offering our lives are admonished that we would present our bodies as a living sacrifice that's ongoing that's daily that's moment from moment that is our reasonable service so here one you know they were coming together my goodness can you imagine poor song leaders in the church of corinth what are you i'm a master of ceremony oh you don't need song no i just called this brother he has a psalm this one has an interpretation this one has this and this one has this and this one has this and this one has that and this one has this was it really was it really what's that impression was that really god see this is where we it doesn't matter with everything it is to be checked by god i don't take anything for granted it's gotta be checked by god sometimes there's things that god can impress on a person's heart he don't want said he just wants you to be an example and live it edification is by the holy ghost it's not by great swelling words of a man you see this is where the inside man and we find this what was taking place here now we can you can deal with this scripture in a lot of ways you can have people that are dealing with complexes that they feel like i've got to do something i got to do this if i don't do this i'm not very spiritual no no no he that is spiritual is spirit-filled and he that is spirit filled heareth the words of god amen to be filled with his spirit so there was pressure if when you look at the scripture my was like the olympic games in the church of corinth maybe they didn't have pews maybe they had a field right here and they had bleachers all around you understand i'm being a little sarcastic it's okay paul did too in the scripture but you see what it was they were trying to outdo one another or maybe as the young people one-upping they were one-upping this person well i've got a psalm and who's got the best song tonight and who's got the they were doing it for the wrong reason first of all you don't have to have a psalm every time you don't have to have a revelation every time you just have to be available don't let the devil put stress on you just be simple be yielded to god god wants to use you he'll use you proverbs 27 2 let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth there's some funny stories but i won't tell them a stranger and not thine own lips now brother brown you a lot of you are familiar with this particular example in it brother branham tells it throughout the message in different places and i it always can't help but when i come across them listening uh i just kind of chuckle when i when i come across and i say that that's the truth you know what brother brown's talking about if he got done preaching at the tabernacle and you know brother neville had called him out to the platform and brother neville had now just given a wonderful introduction i heard brother branham say today you know regarding joseph uh brother joseph mats and mosaic came up to the microphone there when they were in saskatoon and he takes the microphone as hearing it this morning and he begins to talk just to get the people to realize what you're about to witness is a living god who's among us this is not just this is not just services it's a living god keeping his word brother brown comes up afterwards and he says well he says it'd be kind of hard to live up to those words he said he he says that because he loves me he said i love him too he said you know the swedes if they love you they love you see brother randomly just just you know to me there's a lot of things as we can see and can learn from that i tell you when you consider the ministry that god of the end time that god brought forth of malachi 4 and the fulfillment of many other scriptures let me just tell you something that ministry itself could not have been entrusted to just anybody that's not building brother branham up it just goes to show us whom god had in mind when he spoke that that particular uh uh promise god already had william branham in mind amen but you know you listen to the supernatural series you listen to that that they that brother owen jerkisson put together the life stories let me just tell you something before the redeeming work of the holy spirit this was a man who wanted nothing to do with god he was ready to fight you if you're going to call him a preacher come on somebody this was one who was ready to fight this was one he didn't want to serve god we're talking about an individual who had been a proud person he had been hurt in his life were you talking about a man and a person that there could have been riddled with complexes but the grace of god came amen and you it isn't that brother himself didn't have the hat in the battle but the difference was is when the holy ghost has come the desire that pulsates in your heart is to please god and when you've made a mistake maybe you vomited or you kind of you know put yourself out there but the holy spirit within you will convict you and it brings it back along why because it's not us it's to be glorified it's him that's to be glorified it's him that was crucified it's him that was buried and rose again and ascended to the right hand glory be to god this is why when brother branham would talk about even in one of the the newspapers the magazines he said one thing he says i think he says when you read it he said one thing he says that they're doing it seems to be they're glorifying the man more than they're glorifying the god who worked through the man let me just say this to you when that comes in that manner like that the ministry even that god had in this last day there were many people that thought him to be jesus christ he wasn't but many people thought it why because you see the same manifestation that was there in the in the corporal body the earthly body of the lord jesus he was so close to where the prophet could stand there in false anointed ones think of this friends here is a man with one burden and one desire and he would ask the congregation three quarters of the way through anointed ones at the end time he said oh can you separate the two he said he says i am not the son of man but i am a son of man revealing the son of man i was not the one who performed those signs those wonders those miracles i just happened to be standing there when he came and the closing paragraph in the resume of the church ages not for one moment do i bring a message that people would follow me or to start a church but there's one purpose that i have is to see a real relationship between god and his people to where men and women become new creatures in christ jesus i'm telling you this message came with the motives of heaven [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord let me get back to this quote brother graham talks about this introduction that brother neville has given him he said why he said that's such a wonderful introduction it makes you feel better if you're feeling bad don't let this just be a quote he said now that would make you feel good just to know the people like you how many know the scriptures say god dwelleth right in the praises of his people how many know brother brandon tells us in corinthians book of corrections he said if the wife didn't every once in a while come by the husband and tell him how much he appreciated he would think something's wrong is that right it's vice versa it's the same way i mean if she ain't burning the biscuits i mean start praising it i mean if they're only slightly brown give some praise if the mashed potatoes are thicker and not soup i mean come on you understand what i'm saying you see brother adam these are things to me when i this is me when i look here at the message i don't just wait and say when can you get to the text i look at everything there's teaching that's in here there's an example amen hallelujah brother van talks about this is the one you'll remember brother brown's walking out of the tabernacle one night after preaching and this woman said oh brother bill that sure was a good message tonight brother said i said thank you sister it made me feel good you know sounds like he's a realist too you know he walked and there's a walk to the door and some fella some fellow was standing there said you know i wouldn't put up with that what but then i said what said i don't want nobody to brag on me or say something here's some words of wisdom there's just one difference brother branham said to that man between you and i i'm telling the truth i like it [Applause] i ain't trying to drop no big hints tonight it really makes anyone look what he said it really makes anyone someone tells you you appreciate it the efforts that you make it makes you feel a whole lot better i mean let's just be honest there's somebody could tell you that was really good but because of their testimony or their cur it don't mean as much as you take somebody else there's a testimony there's a character that's behind it one thing i cannot have told my wife over and over i said honey i said reason it means so much to me i said the things that she would say or when we're talking and things like that i said because i know your character and the life that you live for the lord jesus that's what makes it powerful to me you see this is where we learn a great lesson brother branham would you know take us of how christ praises his own and god does it at the right time you know there's just the right amount of praise brother brown tells us in the church age book he said he knows exactly how to encourage us in the right things and discourage us in the wrong things he's not interested in crushing us he knows how to encourage us in the right discourage us in the wrong and when it all comes down to it from children husband wife and so forth there's one place that our acceptance should be found my wife should not have to seek the acceptance from nobody else right here's where it stops starts right here stops right here it don't matter nobody else in the world likes her that means she's arrogant it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what so-and-so says maybe you should wear this color right that's right she runs by me same thing and we know how it was you know some of us when we were teenagers and things like that goodness it depends on who we are and how our makeup is sometimes the pressures out there is to kind of fit in well they have this and why don't i have this or this or that and we know those things are real we we don't say oh that shouldn't be that's natural it's parts and journeys of the life well what's important how do you combat that then we come back to the scriptural principle that even in our lives as believers how do we operate we have been made accepted in the beloved it's to let it be known there's one place that you're accepted it doesn't matter your gifts talents skills your failures your mistakes but you are accepted at home that doesn't mean we're condoning sin you understand what i mean i'm talking about there's got to be a basis that when everything else goes around this gets posted or that gets downer or they're this or they're that there is an acceptance that keeps them grounded that's what keeps you and i grounded when we really don't know what's going on or somebody says some or this test or this trial let me tell you what gives you a nice strength that we have been made accepted in the beloved i am my beloved he is mine [Music] proverbs 25 27 it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own glory it's not glory searching for somebody trying to drop that twig and try to start that fire and somebody will start bragging on them a little bit well i'm not vaunting myself but but you're you're trying to get it started come on now these are where these principles and what we're looking at is what as as the scripture said it's not good for a man to search out his own glory what we just read here before brother branham once seeking out his own glory i mean he didn't take a survey after the service and say how many of you were blessed how many of you were this how many of you are that right sometimes right after the service it might be all on one end but it's like that sergeant who keeps the troops at arm when it comes to war they'll appreciate it if they can recognize that it's for my good this is where the lord jesus we looked a little bit into this life but notice here here in his walk in his life as we looked at that last week he did not make himself of any reputation the scripture here is his testimony in john 8 50 and i seek not mine own glory they wanted him to go to lazarus he wouldn't go until the father told him to go as a matter of fact i may just kind of move with this but you know the scripture you're familiar with it you you're not only as a believer but you hear it here a lot john 5 19 this is his testimony the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise hallelujah this was the testimony of that harmony you see even when jesus was on the cross and here they stood there if you're him come down off the cross save thyself right he could have done it like who is it who was it was it dotty rambo that wrote that song he could have called ten thousand angels maybe i don't have the right person but you got the song paul raider would say they ain't the angels were filled in the bushes just one nod and they would have come but he he glorified not himself what did he do it was glorifying the word and in order for the word to be glorified it required the greatness of humility that he humbled himself even to the death of the cross [Music] which was the cruelest and the most and i want to just say inhumane but it was an embarrassing way to go completely but he submitted himself he was tempted and let me just tell you something his flesh was pulled he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh i referred that to you last week from how can i overcome in different places he was tempted to take the kingdom without suffering but calvary was because a victory was already won he wrestled it out there was a prevailing that took place you know sometimes before you meet even in situations that you you know you're coming into that are hard situations like this now it may not be a situation where you're facing a cross but it might be where you need to crucify the affections and the lust thereof where you might have to crucify your tongue your feelings your attitude come on now and so you've got to wrestle it out but lord they have done this and you're wrestling but nevertheless not my will thine will be done and here it comes again it comes again what's happening there's a prevailing of the power within you that desires to walk in obedience and submission to the word that god would receive the glory in all things glory be to god how great is our god this is why jesus could say in john 5 44 how can you believe speaking to the pharisees my goodness you're talking about vaunting these guys is very much noted vaunted they were very much boastful these guys even prayed in a certain way they can't see me out here oh that's good view they can see me you know that's scripture all right let me see how my face oh i need to look i need to look like i've been fasting there's more people that over there let me go over and see all them people come on now there's one person you need to make sure you get attention from and he's willing to give you attention that's jesus he ain't never too busy hey man he don't ever have to say i need a little bit of rest you just go play a little bit nope he never slumbers nor sleep he's always ready to give you a little bit of tension that was free how can you believe notice what he said how can you believe which receive honor one of another these guys were like air pumps to one another honoring one another right this way it went about it wasn't about god it was about one another and they were receiving honor from one another that's what they were seeking after that's why jesus could speak to them they're hypocrites because they were seeking the honor of men more than the honor of our god is not of man amen our approvals of god amen listen i don't feel very well life he was despised and rejected but i can also tell you this right here that he that showeth himself friendly half friends my goodness where is this coming from and receive honor one from another and seek not the honor that coming from god only see that hinders faith that hinders faith when we when it's operated in that way this is why as jesus would say i can't in my own self do nothing in john 8 54 he said if i honor myself my honor is nothing as we referred to you last week you remember from the scriptures these are things that over the years i remember you know you just look at it brother carlos where jesus would say he charged them tell no man over and over he charged him don't tell no man he didn't say now go spread this if you do that i'll get invited to more places come on now go spread this he charged him not to do that because listen to me the attention this was to be drawn to the god of glory that was revealing the glory of god through the son of god [Applause] let me just say this to you it's not you it's the god of glory revealing the glory of god through your life our lives are a reflection of his work this is why when brother brown referred to in this way of the lord jesus and the just countless we could go through scriptures he never claimed to be a great person and brother brahma said it like this he only bragged on god constantly it's not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he do it the worst that's the kind of bragging we want to do that's the kind of boasting we want to do where paul could say that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen you see this is why that even you know to think of this even you know what he likes for us to brag on him dwells in the praises of his people you see even while the word is going forth sometimes you'll watch how the holy spirit will take a service and let's just talk about just here in our own little local assembly you watch how the holy spirit will take a service and there's things that how that god will take it in such a way where here the holy spirit begins to come and begins to brag on the redemptive work of calvary begins to brag on the power of almighty god it begins to what's he doing he said if i be lifted up i will draw oh men unto me and he he loves to come and fulfill that word when you and i brag on him and we're bragging on him because we know what he is to us you can brag on him as a healer because he heals you you can bank on him as a deliverer because he delivers you you can brag on him as a savior because he saved you you can brag on him as a quickening spirit cause he quickens you you've got a right to brag on jesus hallelujah you're going to bragging on him he'll come you go to talking about him he'll come hallelujah go to talking about healing he'll come amen when he's bred dog he'll come [Applause] but where man is bragging on man or whatever mark he stays away from yeah because he can't do nothing there oh my you see this is why brother branham as he says in the message and when he says in the message token he said he said in my ministry he said jesus christ had more success in my ministry and brother bram says notice i said he had more success not me he had more success in my ministry than he did in his own earthly glory be to god hey listen you know this should be the very testimony in this hour he has more success in the bride of jesus christ that has come to a completion than he had back there on azusa street the word has advanced we're walking in the fullness of the light and the fullness of the holy ghost is here it ought to be that way that ought to be the expectation that he's able to do more because there's believers that believe him that trust him that love him that know him and they that know their god shall do great exploits glory be to god in the highest this is why in he in john 16 jesus would say regarding the spirit of truth when he has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself you catch that he won't speak of himself in other words he's not there to highlight the vessel yet he comes as joshua was magnified in the crossing of the jordan but the magnifying was not to elevate joshua but it was that the people's confidence would recognize that the same god that was with moses is the same god with joshua because it isn't man that stabilizes us it is god that stabilizes us so then he's the holy spirit the spirit of truth he's the spirit of truth he'll never elevate or glorify the vessel that he's working through hallelujah because the vessel couldn't even hear couldn't even receive if it hadn't been that it got ears to hear and the spirit of truth comes and reveals the truth and truth is revealed in vessels of truth it's god hiding and revealing himself in simplicity it's not lies that can boast themselves right no you're a good builder you're a man you're a great boat builder me i never built paper boats before all i know is about hoes and shovels my farmer come on he planted a vineyard he was a farmer god don't call you because of your abilities because if it was by abilities none of us would be called but god calls us and sometimes the things he asks for it's very ironic and you look and you think me maybe you got the wrong guy maybe you should have picked this one god says no i chose you and i chose you for this purpose lord my brother so-and-so or sister so and so i've got a purpose for them but the purpose that god and where he places us it's in a place that we depend on him not trusting in ourselves that's why even in a real marriage we don't walk by marriage manuals we take our leading from the holy ghost are you with me that's why even when you know raising children and things like that brother brandt said get out of them books you understand i'm not understand i'm not saying that there's not good principles out there don't misunderstand me what i'm saying is that brother you get into such a place where you're trying to go along with that instead of just being sensitive god packed that attribute in you to be a mother to be a father husband and wife god pack that in tribute let him unpack it and just as israel knew where to stop and unpack and when to pack back up the pillar fire is present to lead to nowhere to unpack and set up camp he knows the stations and junctions of our life and over time all that we have to say is i'm following him i'm looking to him i'm waiting on him what is that that's a life that's not vaunting itself like i know this or i know that or i know that as a matter of fact the further you go on you realize the less you know many times i've told the lord in prayer i said lord i i think i'm getting kind of close lord maybe to my preschool certificate in preaching and pastoring i said i think i might be getting a little bit closer lord thank thank you lord for all the correction this time you feel that way oh i feel that way yeah i feel that way you mean you're still nervous oh i'm more nervous now than i've ever been well you ought to be arrested the responsibilities are the responsibility you recognize that it becomes greater and greater it was fearful in the beginning i didn't want it but the longer it goes along and it's realizing it's realizing lord what is it that needs to be brought how do we bring it's not a question of what to break well you know is there something to bring it's lord what's what's the purpose what do we need for right now what's what's the point for this season that's not me that's him do you understand oh my how i covered your prayers thank god we pray for one another this is why jesus said he shall glorify me let me let me just try to wrap this up he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and show it unto you this is why brother brown would we just speak of that there in john 14 or hear the lord jesus saying that if you ask the father in verse 13 if you ask anything in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it this is why peter brings it down and says if any man will speak let him speak as the oracles of god i got to looking at this word oracles maybe some of my buddies might like this one oracles mean brief utterances from god our two hour three-hour brief utterances from god if any minister let him do it as of the ability which god given why that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom he prays and dominion forever and ever amen this is why let me just let me just close here tonight this is why when brother branham when he he preaches a message called discernment of spirit i really well to me it's just it's a message that's a very key message because brother brahma he goes into this into this message and he's dealing with life and things that can be very gifted brother bran will use these words within it that no matter how great of a teacher somebody is or how powerfully or how intellectual he is how his gift may operate if it isn't trying to achieve something for the body of jesus christ it's wrong brother branham drills down here in this message and it is throughout even when you read um when you read go throughout the whole message and then you come into the church age book if you even just go to the resume of the church ages you find how the holy spirit picking up on the motives and objectives not so much of what's being done but what's the motive behind it brother branham would tell us he said something can absolutely be the will of god but if our motive is selfish or it's not right it's the same as it not being the will of god like you could take a person maybe that was going to be baptized and they're baptized maybe because their peers are baptized hey that's a wonderful thing to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but it's the wrong move this is why everything emotive and objective even when it comes to receiving the holy ghost see this is why and brother brown will make this and i i'm closing on this but he says no matter how accurate or how perfect it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of jesus christ see it should never be a gift that pulls people to the person a gift is meant to blend with the body so that real true edification doesn't put somebody up but it works to further bring unity and harmony in the body it's edification so this is where even in the scripture beloved try every spirit whether it be of god brother brahms really laying out in a shorter message false anointed ones at the end time because to judge that motive and objective he said what are they trying to achieve and this is what he says he said maybe that person doesn't come from your church he said but don't judge them where they come from judge them according to what are they trying to achieve for the body of jesus christ and i say it like this everyone has an approach we don't all have the same approach in the same avenue every church is sovereign there's certain ways that god has led me sometimes to approach to go after souls that someone else could have said i don't know if i would have taken that approach but they're not me and i'm not them i have to follow him as he told me to go is that right so it's the objective what are we trying to achieve for the body of christ and brother braham says see he says you get to a place he said he said the spirit he said that's in that man he's trying to point the people away from himself to calvary that's true it's trying to it's to edify the body of believers you know it's where brother brahma you know as he goes into that i i just really enjoy that message and brother brown he deals with it in discernment of the spirit there what would be the purpose of somebody saying well the lord showed me so so-and-so is going to be president brother branham he brings it out so clear what what's that to the body that's not edifying the body that's you or as brother brown says somebody comes up and says yeah you see this god showed me this and i knew this was going to happen and then see now on the other part of it it requires us to have a little bit of patience are you with me sometimes it requires us to have a little bit of patience sometimes if something has to be called out god will have you to call it out and maybe it doesn't mean that maybe that person hasn't seen that but it wasn't in that way for that to be made known because when it's stated even in that way who does it glorify the person not god god tests us things are put in our hands to test us can he entrust us with more he does that because he's a faithful father he knows for every one of us he knows we are but flesh that's not an excuse but he knows within our flesh there's there is a part that could you know if envy is where as the scripture said charity envy is not it's looking at what someone else has this portion of scripture is trying to make yourself have something or to put what you have out vaunted let me just tell you something he came to where you were and he sought you out out of all of the people persons that were around you talking about value he came to me he came to you he sent his word and brought healing in our life if there's one thing that we should brag on it should be that he came to me amen i was lost and undone he came to me there's no way i could be here today but he came to me i was in need of a savior he came amen i close i think of that one sister the one she said brother branham very good things that you said should only get one problem only got one problem with your preaching you brag too much on jesus i'm gonna stop there tonight we can never break too much we could never break too much on him for what he's done it's true there's a lot of things the way god uses us for what he'll speak to us it's about those are things that are entrusted to us and this is where we have to be we have this is where the word takes us when we look at these things in the scriptures this is where we have to really brother and sister be willing it's a it's a big journey to be able to go into that place and be able to take the word and reflect and say lord are there some things that really need to be rooted out it's complexes inferiority and superiority but god god's the answer to that he's the answer to that none of us can undo what maybe a father or mother didn't do or where they forsook you or what somebody said or how they belittled you or whatever moral or abuse or and we don't make the light of that but i'm here to tell you there's one who cares there's one who heals wounds that are in your spirit he cares for you you say why would that need to be healed because if it's left unattended he can't use you according to how he wants to use you but to be honest and say god just search me and if there's something that is there lord you're the remedy for it lord i surrender it to you because let me tell you something you're the apple of his eye hallelujah if i have in my hand brother brendan used this example over and over he said if i had in my hand a vial full of the literal blood of jesus christ it would be no greater than what i had before me because he was willing to give his blood i think of that song if that is in love than the oceans hallelujah oh he cares so deeply if there's one thing in our testimonies it continues to go musicians going to come it goes forth even from this time you have to come is that our testimony is it's god that's supplied even if we've come to a place and maybe there's a good decision you've made it's it's been a good decision but it's things that you realize lord you helped me to be sensitive for even that decision thank you lord because that was a great accomplishment on your part help me to be more sensitive help me to be more simple lord i need lord that my life is really consecrated in that in everything it can be said he's the one who's glorified in all things i don't know about you and it's not something we're trying to do but i i certainly certainly would want that testimony that it would be that maybe if the inside of hell could even stick up their voice and say you can't even stick around that that man or that woman i mean they they might be talking about car insurance for one moment and then they start talking about how god's provided for them and you try to bring a test up or a try you try to bring something up and point out or an obstacle and then here they stand around and say he's still a waymaker i mean it doesn't matter what goes on they brag on him that's the testimony that i want to have that's not a show we're putting on right let me just say it very clearly i think every one of you can identify with me tonight he's more than life to me he's everything he's been my he's my comforter when i've been distraught he's encouraged me when i felt lower than the padding under this rug he's picked me up when i fell down he's encouraged me he's given me strength he's touched my body [Music] and i didn't feel like i could make one step in front of another he came he said come on son i'm right here with you hallelujah but maybe i've taught all along in the midst of a situation felt like my prayers were going up and coming off but then through that moment it would be a place that would something would take place that lets me know he's been right here the whole time i believed it i couldn't see it i couldn't feel him i believed it but i sure am glad that he did that for me i'm glad that he let me have that little token and let me know i care i've been here the whole time [Music] oh my god we can't brag on him enough well even here tonight we could have a testimony service it could go all the way into the wee hours of the morning sister armor there'd be something you say and i'd say well you know what that reminds me of something over here i'd get up and say it brother bill might have already passed up here 52 times because you know what that reminds me of a time then about that time sister barb you've already been up here 63 times and sister bart said you know what that reminds me of another time we can never brag enough on jesus hallelujah he's worthy of all of our prayers amen hallelujah amen could you stand with us amen let's just bow our heads in prayer father lord you see every one of our hearts visible and invisible audience dear god the desire of our hearts is to see you glorified [Music] help us lord we're very much aware of what lord that is around us we're very much aware lord of pressures and no matter what age we are we're aware of it lord we're aware of that flesh but we're aware there's a god on the inside that's so much greater there's a desire that pulsates within us lord not that we would be exalted but that you'd be exalted give us the wisdom let us know when we need to say something and when there's things that's taken place that's just between you and us [Music] help us father we sure do need your help lord we need your guidance we want to say
