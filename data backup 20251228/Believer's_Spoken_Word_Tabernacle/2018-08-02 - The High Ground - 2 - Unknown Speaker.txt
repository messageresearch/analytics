the Lord Jesus Christ and to walk amen in him and with him it's real Liberty you know it's a great mystery we're to the world it it looks like to the one who's unconverted it looks like rules and regulations but it's a love affair that's that's the secret it's it's a relationship with God and it's a real love that enters in to our heart the love of God that we desire to please him that's a mystery you can't explain that but it's something that's so real you're loving tonight so good to be in the house of the Lord and appreciate the testimony and the songs tonight let's look in the word if we could to Ephesians six and I'm just gonna ask that you would pray with me tonight to see how the Lord would just take us through this stocked in Ephesians 6 verse 10 we read from here last week and I'd like to continue with that the Lord would help us Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand let's just ask his blessing on the word tonight amen how many have a need on the heart say Lord you know my need Lord amen Lord Jesus we just counted such a privilege and an honor Lord that you have called us to yourself Lord oh god that Lord in the midst of every voice and so many voices Lord oh god we thank you for your grace Lord that it's your voice that Lord has overruled every other voice Lord oh god we we just ask the Lord here this

encouragement Lord and we're lifted up Oh God and the currents of your presence Lord I pray that God this evening that you'll just move among us in a special way and speak to each and every one of our hearts Lord Oh God just reaching the very depth of our being lord I pray that Lord that you'll forgive us of our sin our shortcomings Lord and father we just want to say we thank you for your glorious working or God father in our myths Lord it certainly isn't because we're worthy of it Lord but father it's for your glory Lord that our faith might raise within you and Lord we're just so thankful God

yourself or God as the Living God Lord right through that need we love you and thank you Father and we just want to give ourselves to you tonight and I just ask that Lord God let me just be removed and would you just speak to us Lord what we have need of tonight I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen then God bless your being seated we'll say I just my wife and I just so appreciate early yesterday was twenty years twenty years ago and I say that's the best decision I made in my life besides surrendering to the Lord and that's the truth I really mean that with all my heart you know and I just really think God for it yeah I just don't tell her I tell her that all the time and she can tell you that I I look at it I told her I've told her time and time again I said if I knew the love that I have now I said in what I had when we first met I said you know I wouldn't swap that I said I would take what I have right now I said it's grown so much since then you know it's been a truly has been tests and trials and things you come through but God is faithful he is faithful and I just appreciate his His grace and His mercy I so thank God for from my wife she really has been such a such a help and she is such a help to me and within this in the ministry so I think God for her tonight amen I want to just look at this tonight on the high ground and once again looking at at this place in the scripture and we'll just see how the Lord will go I just feel like this just I have so much and I just want to say what he once said when you we take into account what we have just read for a text Paul is admonishing the children of God in that day as it is every day of what is present at that time the evil and he makes it very clear within the scripture that it's it's an evil that is there as he goes through in verse 11 he would call it the wiles which is the subtlety and the trickery of the devil then he goes through and he speaks for we wrestle not against flesh and blood and he goes into that in verse 12 of principalities powers rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places and when he read in Paul makes a statement take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in that evil day it's very very clear that there was standing in this in this day because that evil day it's in this day Paul when he ministered in that day he ministered under the inspiration in that hour and he could say in this evil day when I rainiest ministered in his hour it was God ministering the full armor of God to the children of God because in in every age there's always been a battle there's always been a fight you we see that clear that that battle first of all it began in heaven and that battle began when Lucifer himself rebelled and we know then he he led a third part of the stars away and there was a fall that took place but then that that what had their begin as battles there of angels then it it moved upon human battles when that bat when that Fortress of the word when Eve herself walked out from behind that word then it became human battles and I I want to just say this that when we look at it being human battles it is when we look at ourselves we within our own selves are unfit and unprepared to fight this battle we're no match as a matter of fact you hear brother brown say it over and over again anyone even would be addressing Satan he says now you know you're more than a match as far as from me said but you're not more than a match for him and you see that's it's it's it's who or identified in and who's identified within us and if we can just recognize that then no matter what would come our way it's to recognize who who we are identified with in Jesus Christ and he is over every power there there's not one thing can come your way unless God first permits it and if God permits a test or trial to come your way it's only gonna work for your glory as we will yield to him and in the end God is receiving the victory through our life and as our life as being molded and shaped more and more into his glorious image so without without without the Lord directing us there is no way that we could be able to withstand the very onslaught of the enemy but it takes the very working of the Holy Spirit to actually catch the working of Satan and be able not only to discern his working but be able to call it out and be able to make known what is the true path and when you you think of this thought of the high ground I you know I told you last week that I was standing there on the places in Gettysburg and I i stood around on the places where where it was actually where the union forces had made it in first of all to there in gettysburg and when you look at where what they defended and how that battle was won it wasn't it was mainly because of position they were positioned upon the high places the high ground and and when you look down through time you know you you see that many battles that have been worn and every army seeks to get the high ground when they're studying on a map they seek to get that high ground and maintain that high ground because that high ground is a place of advantage it allows you not only the advantage of being able to come at the enemy or or to maybe to shoot down at the enemy or to look but his advances but it it's a you're able at that place to be able look and see where the enemy is moving in his tactics and be able to to move so that you're in position to be able to defend that and there's no higher ground than the Lord Jesus Christ David said it like this he said he's my strong tower David called him my rock and my fortress and my shield as a matter of fact without him he is the he is the watchman of the Church of the Living God the Holy Spirit is and he has men but remember mass man and himself can never be able to catch things it would have to be the Holy Spirit revealed by a gift that he's placed there and it's God that brings the church on alert it makes us watchful in our lives and our hearts and through that it's not just a watchfulness but he also is giving to us the direction of which were to go within this hour we need the continual discernment and leadership of the Holy Spirit this is what when this is this is I'll say it like this this is the benefit of the children of God that we are led by the Spirit of God it's a privilege for the word of God to come down and to discern our lives in our hearts because we we cannot have confidence within the flesh we've got to recognize that what we're all around us of what of what things that even that we cannot see but there's spiritual forces that Paul is talking about that is at work and we need the discernment of the Holy Ghost so when we think of this I want to just draw your attention to the place where we are looking at last week on the program of God and when you think of that term of the program of God to know that God has has had a program and he still has a program God has never changed his program but it's just like when you know the program you're given a program when you would go into a play where you're going into maybe a school musical and there or where they're going to maybe have the choir that's gonna sing or orchestra there's a program that is laid out that that you would know I know many times when we would as the teachers we would have to hear all of the squeaks and squawks and everything else we were actually called the dress rehearsal audience and we would have to bring our our kids down there and and set for whatever the duration of whatever the entire concert was and to try to get that out and you know it was squeaks quacks and crowd control and and you know what helped is that when they gave you a little brochure and for me out there just constantly looking at it you know because we had to know when to take our kids out because it's walking them in the right door and I have to have a program that I could look at to know okay this this cord okay they're singing jingle bells and okay yelling okay here we are that's this class and now we're gonna be I got to get my kids over there get them lined up if I didn't have a program it would make it awful hard but because I've got a program then the program I'm alerted to what's going on and then I can begin to look at and I know okay wait a minute but the second graders have gone then the first graders are going to go then they want me coming next so I'm able to know when to get my kids up so I don't get them up too early neither do I get them up too late it's what we call that you know a dress rehearsal and I I believe with all of my heart that when we look at it now God's program is unfolding and yet we are also in the midst of a dress rehearsal and what I mean by that is is that there might be some notes that you squeak the wrong way but remember this is a dress rehearsal he who wrote the program he that's in charge of it is here to guide and direct us and make sure that we're right on the mark that we're coming in at the right time and we're ready to do whatever part it is that he has for us to do so the program of God it's something that is it's a continual unfolding and I want you to watch how that you know that that brother branham he places this here and the message the contest and he's praying here as he enters into this message now think of this the contest Heavenly Father's we stand here as many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and of the mistakes of last year and as we're approaching the death of sixty two and the birth of 63 oh God may we be one step higher up the ladder until we can see Jesus and his program may everyone here Lord in prayer while the old year is dying and the new birth of the new year is coming in may the old man sin and unbelief die out in our heart and the new birth come in with and with the 1963 like a rushing mighty wind that might fill our beings and make us new creatures in Christ what something goes on make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us Oh Lord God with a mighty hand Jehovah blessed these ministers here bless all the way through the visitors be thou with us Lord we are your servants and we give ourselves wholly to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence 'as in our life and in our being I believe that's a prayer that your spirit might have more preeminence is in our life and in our being help us God forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith notice the prayer I want you to catch this the prayer that is being made to God forgiving of the past forgiving our mistakes but yet here within that may we move up higher up the ladder to see Jesus and his program here you see it's a continual focusing in and whole the closer we get to the very moment and climax of the rapture the change of the body the Church of the Living God is is becoming more and more focused and with that it is also Satan's desire to try to bring more and more distractions there's challenges against his coming there's distractions as David described it in Psalms 27 he never described it as just facing one front but he said all around me it's surrounded on every side you got that you have you're surrounded you yeah you covered all around by those that are deniers and and everything everything that is surrounding but but here is the precious precious reality he have set me upon a rock and now my head shall be lifted up above mine enemies he didn't say he would take the enemies away but the preciousness of it is he has sent me on a rock and that rock had lifted my head above my enemy so it's in a high ground a place of advantage in Christ and he's asking God because only God can do this race up mighty men what someone makes a mighty man God with you when God told Gideon a mighty man about what makes a mighty man of Valor God you and God are the majority raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year Lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God and this is what I want you to I want you to see in the catch here notice this prayer friends this is a prayer that's that's interceding and asking God to open what God has promised to open in this hour you see that's part of understanding that we're not just praying but our prayers are in line with the understanding that's to be in this hour so in God is is ministering through his word there can be a lot of things that you can look at and say I don't fully understand this I don't fully understand that but yet when the Spirit of God is moving upon your heart these are the things to pray about and that's why it's important to pray for Revelation I believe if you pray for revelation I'm a witness of it God will see to it what it is that you have Nita and it's not just listen revelation it's not an accumulation of facts it's a continual unfolding and a peeling back of the layers of the very Christ of God the Lord Jesus Christ it's continuing to reveal him it's not just in the kids not an accumulation of facts its revealing the Lord Jesus Christ and the truly the more that he reveals himself the more simpler if it's that's a word the more simple that it becomes and you look at it and you're seeing the Lord Jesus Christ and you're seeing your South and it just narrows it down not into some great big mystical not able to be understood and Oh algebra trigonometry prop no it narrows it down into the simplicity that God intended for it and let me tell you the simplicity was not that we would be able to put it all together and memorize it here but the simplicity is to yield to his holy spirit and allow him to interpret that word in us and through us that is God in simplicity then we might see the program of God cap off the pyramids of our life Lord put the capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessings be upon us may the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us may the power of the resurrection be manifested God how we thank you tonight we are yours we give ourselves fully to you Lord that's your desire tonight Lord but I want to give myself more fully to you you know the Scriptures it says it like this in the book of first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 it says it like this for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for the to the battle is that right so when we look at this a familiar scripture to us but if the trumpet it can have a sound but if it's uncertain then no one knows what to do but it must if it gives a certain sound then one knows how to prepare himself for the battle so then when we're looking at this the Prophet picks this up in the message uncertain sounding I'm just going to refer to parts within here brother bran was talking about how that you find people asking the question what is this stuff that they're talking about the Holy Ghost reading minds in this day and seeing God working like that now listen people are wondering about that could people wonder about that how could that even be a question you see it shows the subtleness and the working of satan to move people away from the true Living God so then it becomes a question who is this what is this it becomes a question but yet there is a certainty to it that what God has said in his word it is certain that the Holy Spirit is a revealer and an interpreter of the very secrets and intents of the heart you know I know you can set right here and set right here at services here and you know sometimes you're gonna have people the first time you know they come in you know it's like oh my goodness well you've you've been telling him all about me it's not the man that knows about you it's God that knows your knee and why would God do that he is letting you personally know that he is still the same maybe maybe for your life it's just responding it and responding to a call from God and God's letting you know there is a place that you can come to this is a living God he lets you know it ain't a church it's me you see that's the fact that's the thing that is that has been missed within the ages and what has been where the Spirit of God will always come back and he's calling the people back to the relationship of the Holy Spirit because people would drift from that how does that relationship come it comes by the word being delivered by the Holy Ghost why all these big churches brother Rams asking this question wow these big churches because Christ said it would be that way I tell you right now there's some big churches I've drove by and I know he's not just talking about buildings we're talking about numbers we're talking about organizations that are massive but you know I want you to think of this you know the Bible says in the book in the Book of Kings that they have built a temple that could hold all of Israel you're talking about a mega church it had to be titled grace something I don't know what it was but you understand what I'm saying a temple that could hold the impact that that was a huge but what I'm sure I'm getting to is that people at least these questions how could this be it and where is this at but you see it is certainty that it's promised within the word when it speaks that denominations would arise they'll form themselves in the Book of Revelations I don't have time to read all of it but in the Book of Revelations chapter 13 it speaks of the forming of an image unto the Beast and it speaks of a Confederate of churches and yet where people can look and say how can this be how is this happening where would this be but listen everything itself that is happening you can see it identified in God's Word it's just like when they pass the different legislation and the laws you know the Bible said in the Book of Daniel that this man that Antichrist it speaks of that man it says they will close laws to be passed you see there's reason is it's something that we understand that the everything within this world there are two spiritual powers at work that manic image to the Beast the prophet called it the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the deals with this says there's a true sound to it he goes into that of the UN where people are having such faith within the UN will have the League of Nations and will and will really talk and get all this look at it where's it at consolidating together but yet there is nothing that can be solved within it one more after a war is passed then here comes another war we see it going on and on and when the breath brings it down to it like this and I want to read this part with you right out of that message he said there's only one certain sound that's the gospel prepare for the battle what battle the coming of the Lord this is what Satan has been battling against all the way down through time he has come against the coming of the Lord because remember the coming of the Lord his physical return is a climax of where he has come by way of his spirit revealing his word and moving and collecting his children his bride down through the ages after he himself the body is taken up to the throne the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost the life that was in our sacrifice the Lord Jesus Christ God Himself coming now to enter into the worshiper here is God coming and he's collecting his thoughts and what takes place when he has collected and here he is building his body his bride as it was when Adams side was open so in Christ side was open at Calvary out of him was taking the water and the blood and here the spirit all of that going together to bring about his church back to himself so then when he Church is coming to that completion of what he had in his mind then he himself is prescient to fully step in not just a part but the fullness of himself coming once again but not in groom form but in bride form don't want to lose you maybe New Orleans with that but if see it's God Himself is collecting those thoughts that were already in his mind brother Brent says prepare yourself for battle now against evil when evil is be setting the people on every hand everything going wrong home life going wrong the UN falling and the nation's breaking and the atomic bombs around and homes splitting up motherhood going low and in morals among the people distrust amongst one another and all the denominations fussing and stewing what you want to do be certain prepare yourself for the battle and you say it like this you see where the onslaught of where brother Brown will go into this of how that you see the condition and he was identifying it then we're by way of television these other things he says you find it's constantly on the increase the Tabasco the whiskey and all these other things immoral dress twinam dirty jokes jokesters on the television programs and America is falling for it this is words and in parallels that no what's this this isn't just statements it must there must be a parallel this is a book of prophecy so it's parallel to that time where King Nebuchadnezzar it's actually Belteshazzar where the vessels were taken when Israel rebelled in those vessels out of the temple were taken and they were taken into Babylon remember when it was time here all these things are working up it's time for Israel to come back into her homeland it's time for them to come up but seventy years are right there at the door to be up of what was prophesied and notice how that in that time you see how that belt - as our heroes up and they begin to take the vessels of God and such uncleanness and such ungodliness and here it was at that moment where God there had been an accumulating if we could say it a cup of iniquity had been accumulating to where God Himself was tired of it it it had reached its end and at that time there was a kingdom that was already ready to take over the Meads and pressure and that was already laid out in the vision of Daniel the dream of Nebuchadnezzar of which listen to me of which none of the wise men in Babylon astrologers and all of those men they could not tell and decipher the meaning of the dream that was given to Nebuchadnezzar where you list me they couldn't do it and never can answer told him you know they come before him and you know there's a haste and never connects is going to slay them off I want you to catch this he was going to wipe them all out he was gonna slay every wise man that would have not only been those men of Babylon but it would have also been those Hebrew children that were a part of the wise men as well but Daniel raised up in that moment and David Daniel said why is the king in such haste I ask you who was it that brought courage and Daniel to rise up the same girl who met Martin Luther at that altar that day the same God that has got ahold of your heart and of your life Daniel rose up and he said why is he being hates let us will we will go pray give us so many days and Daniel went and prayed he went and prayed and God revealed to him and when God revealed to him I want you to catch this I don't have time to read it you can read it in your Bible when you get home in the Book of Daniel but I want you to catch this when God revealed to Daniel that dream Daniels begin to worship hello that that which was hidden that which was obscure from all the other men it wasn't that Daniel himself had that understanding but Daniel made it clear in his worship and he made it clear before the presence of the king that it is not I who have done this but it is the Almighty God that has revealed himself and his plan to his servant Messiah to you like this that unfolding it didn't mean a whole lot it didn't have the meaning to Nebuchadnezzar like it does for you and me that meant making known there in that time it didn't have the meaning do a lot of down through time let me tell you something too many they can look at this and they can look back on certain things and now the scholars and different ones can look back up on this thing and there's certain things that they can go into and then bring you know look at certain facts and breaking those kingdoms but you see friends it's not an accumulation of facts the Bible itself is one glorious picture of redemption it is a tying together from Genesis to Revelation of the very program of Almighty God it's just another part it's another act that came on and every one of the acts are all leading up to the climatic act within the unfolding of God's great program here's Daniel Daniel's praying he's looking to God upon these things and you find how that here was the media sin purse they already those walls you couldn't Pam punctuate you could not penetrate them walls of Babylon but God look at this God gave wisdom to the Medes in purse so divert the river to divert the river you see there was no doubt days that went on months that went on when all this plan was being developed and they didn't know it inside of Babylon let me tell you something Babylon when we look at it in the scriptures do you know how it is they've tried to say where was Babylon at they tried to find all these places well it's in Iraq and they try to go through and excavate this but let me tell you something you could find a little place of Babylon but you wouldn't find Satan there because he's already moved from that seat he's already moved from there Babylon itself it's not a physical Babylon anymore that was only your tithe her characteristic the book of Revelation lets us know that Babylon itself is a very spiritual working it is that of a of a confederation of a spirit Satan himself moving through religion because remember the whole thrust and theme of Babylon Nimrods inspiration was after the flood will build these walls and they'll be tribute that's paid from Nineveh and rad all of those places can tribute can be played and if you come inside of these walls of Babylon you can live however you want to live let me tell you something when you come inside the walls of the Lord Jesus Christ then you can really live how you ought to live and you not only live how you ought to live you live how you want to live because your life has been change by the power of God breaking forth upon prophecy hallelujah it's a certainty in celebrity its mother I have to do this right I can't do that it's a love affair I do only those things that please him I'll tell you it might be a mystery to your soul or not but if you just open up and you'll just catch down that devil that devil that would be telling you it's not for you you can't receive it if you'll just call him a liar cause he is a liar if you just call him a liar and you just stand upon God's Word and say Lord open my understanding on how to receive you I'm quoting a direct quote I don't want mists of unity I believe it's where I believe it's something worth quoting God you opened my understanding on how to receive you what I might be talking to you I don't want it to be left in riddles I'm out telling you tonight there is a way that's the very same God that revealed to Daniel that dream is the same God that can bring things that are hard sentences that seem like hard things he can reveal it in his power of simplicity this is the high ground we have you may not see that but God has placed me I can see that there's other believers on that high ground that can point to the same thing it said he's still the same God glory be to God and one one man nobody could interpret it but you see what happened listen the interpretation God had a man that was there that could receive from God and that receiving of God the mercy of God stepped in and here's his yielding to God and standing on God's Word it gave mercy to that whole kingdom let me tell you something right now you want to know why that that that everything itself could still be standing the scriptures are true in the book of Thessalonians that he let it he let it he let it until he be taken out of the way its Christ in you its him fulfilling his program in your life he's not a moment late he's not a moment early he's right on time you might look at your times of your trip things and your failings but you got to remember God himself knew had knowledge about all of that and that's why he's provided in how that he himself would move and work and direct our life so that when it all comes down you are asked him look at it again and again and our faith is rising realizing that I'm not standing here by my own power but I'm standing here in the power of his mind it's his prevailing power working in my life ferma just say it like this his prevailing power working in our life is just like that of noah the bible said noah was warned of god he was warned of God why was he warned of God because he was of God and Noah preached the warning to that whole generation but why didn't that whole generation say receive it because they weren't of God but nor was of God I hope you see this God would regard came down and God don't look at things like you I look at it let me just preach a little simplicity now you might step over one penny in the parking lot but you pick up a quarter God will walk over pennies he picks up pennies and quarters close it all makes change come on somebody god don't look at things like you and I look at and we think three cents can you buy tootsie roll that nowadays gotta have my five cents or ten cents and how used to be back in the days you can get it with Chitti roll for one cent three for three cent and three cents you're about halfway there now leaders lemonheads Boston baked beans but we're getting to a head our lips are going to come out boy and just swaggin in a minute but you see God don't look at things that way he don't look at things as insignificant and he makes you and I aware of it but within our life there are not little insignificant things but it is God who is ordering all things Alleluia the Bible said faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen Alleluia so within this know up being warned of God notice he was warned of God Noah destruction is coming you know brother BAM tells it like this Lord Ram tells us that Noah he said he was a man that had his family together and he prayed together with his family he said a matter of fact he said no he said God he said Noah was out in the field one day praying and the Lord spoke to enough now you might look at that you might say well that ain't even wrote in the Bible but here's what I want to tell you God will speak to those who are seeking after him God just didn't dropped something down here upon Abraham Abraham himself remember there's relation going back to Noah and Abraham himself he receives a witness he receives direction where that stands out in his mind how many the rest of people that lived in his time the rest Abraham's relatives - what happened to Noah it didn't mean nothing it was just an event it was something that happen maybe if they had been alive and the ark they could have still had it there they would have sold tickets to it but it was something different with Abraham the Prophet tells us Abraham thought about it and he said God what you did in Noah and as real as you were to know the Lord will you make yourself known to me that way and he said when he prayed that prayer he said God came down and met him that day in that field and he called him you see there is a point of reference here so you look at this how that Noah being warned of God and to think of how that that word what's this what's this warning of God it was not something to where Noah could preach in a manner as though you just come on in but remember the word was it started out there was a rebuke men in that day the way they were living in that day men and women the way that they were living remembered what God said in the book of Genesis chapter 6 that it that it actually repented the Lord that he had made man because the imagination of his heart was continually upon evil and the Bible goes on to talk about how that the earth at that time that violence was filled through them you know they became channels for violence to come but no it was a channel for righteousness to come so you're going to be a channel for something a conduit for something why not be a conduit for the Lord why not be a channel for his righteousness and his life to flow through now no doubt there were many now listen to me now in the days of Noah don't think there was only one boat there were many boats but there was one who was God constructed come on somebody you see know about what's this intact playing out Noah's boat had three floors to it it had a justification a calling you with me it had creeping things in the bottom for us where that little serpent that made you do it in the first place can still be there even at the calling forth and you repent and say Lord receive me as a sinner the thing that made you do the things you did and still be there but then you come up to the second floor and when you come up to the second floor there's sanctification is that right and in that floor saying duplication is a cleansing is that right you have all of the the animals and those things move around but then you come on up to the top floor and on the top floor is the ceiling away and in the ceiling away there's also a window for the light in the evening time to come through but window is also there because through that window Noah will receive his seven sealed visitation he'll catch that rainbow coming are you with me it's a covenant he'll catch that bow are you with me tonight what island what I'm just following his leading is to show you these things belonging to the children of God on the high ground hallelu Jerusalem's not a valley Jerusalem is on a mountain we're a bit of God when that City sets down it will set down upon that mountain and that mountain that place it grower that stole that stole that strong that was huge out of a mountain without hands then Isaiah saw that same stone that comes down in smites that image of the Gentile kingdoms in the foot what's a feet foundation that stone groweth unto a mountain who is that stone Christ its Christ the Lord of glory here is North the receiving light I want you to catch this do you realize that out of that same window listen to me now out of that same window is where the Prophet tells us that Satan got up in that same window and he spoke down to Noah he say aren't you come on out I don't think you want to stay in here and look you said it was gonna happen on such-and-such a day ain't nothing happened this is patience patience cometh from the Lord you and me both have had misunderstandings come on somebody but you see what patience does the patience of the Lord that's why Jesus could say with patience position your souls because we're patience patience patience waits for the coming of the Lord there might be misunderstandings about things I'm not gonna let let's just make this simple tonight you know you've had things I hate honey I thought I thought you was gonna get this don't run a thought you really do hey I thought you said this honey you told me you picked up the water bottle or this or that or what no I never told you that you must have just thought I heard you heard me say that Wow I know y'all know you're with me now right you see it's misunderstandings but you'reyou're working to get to the problem and there's a lot of misunderstandings we've had in the message look the Prophet said Abraham there were a lot of misunderstandings he said but Abraham didn't focus focus on the misunderstandings of the promise he focused on the one who made the promise [Music] [Applause] when he who is the promise has been revealed then we wait upon his promise you might have your thoughts or your feelings but in whether this happens this way what that happens this way he will not move you because you are settled in him Alleluia Noah being warned of God oh my oh my what my timer Noah was warned of God and he moved by the Spirit of Almighty God is that right my goodness hallelujah you loving tonight let me just let me find a place to get off here lord have mercy any good let's read a little place in the word together they won't close up on this Psalm 62 1 for the dog I set my timer but I don't happen to it [Laughter] and I love brother Doug he comes to cut grass the next time I got a special water bottle for him I love you better duck Psalm 62 verse 1 let's let's look at this to the chief musician to Jeff a psalm of David truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation from him from him cometh our salvation our change of the body from him has come the change of the nature from him cometh the change of the body from him cometh our salvation listen how many times we've been in things there it goes how many times we've been in things and here he comes our salvation aren't you glad you you feel like you know you're you feel like Peter you're dropping down but he's our salvation from him cometh my salvation he only like that he only is my rock and my salvation he I'm not trusting in anything else not even yourself I'm trusting in him you see trusting in him I trust in the new birth the experience that he had brought to my life it brings him to a reality in me I'm trusting only that's a that's a huge word and only in him the job says like this you're going to an operating room there's a gondor's of somebody coming in there you got a surgeon you've got your nurses you've got those that are handing the instruments and things like that but the person that goes in there for the operation is not relying on a nurse or an assistant to be doing the operation they're resting on the surgeon who comes and talks to him and lets him know what he's going to do there might be a lot of other people in your life but he only but sending my husband no he only buttressing on my wife but he only if you have heat only in your life and he has he only in his life then it will be he only bringing the union to how it ought to be and then your expectation is on him when disappointments come when everything else comes he only is my rock I'll tell about the high ground I'll talk about the high ground no go on the low ground stay on the high ground you say how do I stay on the high ground you stay there in Christ and the Prophet tells us that last part of Ephesians 6 praying always with all supplications prayer is the radarscreen there might been a lot of things that can go undetected like when Israel flew into Iran and destroyed that reactor they flew only so far off the ground in that helicopter they went undetected they knew where the lines were at they could fly in there let me tell you something it doesn't matter what direction that the enemy comes from it doesn't matter how it tries to hit you the radar has gotten covered prayer but if you look at and say well oh been a rough rough rough week rough time my goodness I ain't seen nothing on radar screen I didn't even heard it beep I just think it might be ok just to kind of relax you better not you better not about town there'll be some prayer praying always let Stan he is he is my defense this word defense means my high place my refuge this is what it means in Hebrew my stronghold my retreat must secure height in him he's my defense the high ground I shall not be greatly it's Satan's desire it's his intention to try to draw from that high ground to try to prevent you coming to the high ground and to try you try to move you from the high ground sees a lot of ways within the high ground there's things that we can say Lord where we in ourselves know there's times where we've been drawn out I'll say Amen for you it meant for me and Amen for you there's things that where Satan knows each and every one of us don't let that scare you God knows you in the Book of Psalms chapter 139 David said he knows my uprising in my down city he knows all about you your makeup he knows you he knows whether you're the type of person that in your makeup you might be a more outgoing person never met him never met a stranger in your life that's part of that's part of a makeup but then there's other makeups temperaments that it wouldn't matter if they met another person or not they're self-reliant now you can look at that and think brother Samuel I mean shouldn't everybody know we're not to be like one another but were to let Christ be the same in each of us he knows what he's doing and there's things that you would have to war against in your life and I would have to war against a matter of fact brother Bram called himself a melancholy person is that right the rest of the fellas are down brothers are down there shooting squirrels or to shoot him and killing him he's not shooting them and hitting them between the eyes or in the eye so he takes his gun puts it on the tree and starts crying why am i this way you know what did God say I made you that way that wasn't his new birth that was not a part of his new birth that was part of even the star that was born under the birth path remember the bad thoughts about those birth past birth paths here's the sign they born under and all those things working up in the temperament but you see God made it but that's to be yielded to him but the banth comes back around and he says concerning his own self how that he can be very melancholy and that's part of being melancholy as a perfectionist don't start trying to identify people here tonight but what I'm trying to get you to see is this right here you could look at that and say man that's a wonderful quality and it is but that same thing of perfectionism can be a negative if Satan gets into it it can line your wife up and line your husband up it can line the pastor a blind the church up it can and remember our perfection is in him and he is perfecting us but the same time brother branham comes to this place and he says you know what he says I know how the how this is he says in my life it's hard for me to say goodbye and he said I can't let myself get like this because when I do Satan takes advantage of me brother said what about the power of the new birth the power of the new birth places greater is He that's in you to where you've got a Dominion and authority to be able to recognize Satan and every one of his tricks live from the high ground from the high ground that that ground that says Lord in you in you you're my rest you are my peace tempted tempted to be drawn into the low ground but stay in the high ground for the high ground says the promise is sure Satan will come against you throw everything against the promise that you're holding in your heart but remember hold it treasure it give your all to it and say Lord even in this teach me and help me Lord because I believe with him in our lives we we don't have an excuse but we have the mighty Conqueror greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world you love him tonight Amen let's just bow our heads maybe as the music is being played I wonder if there be any heart here tonight that say Lord I just want to so fully give myself to you Lord what I'm I'm hearing
