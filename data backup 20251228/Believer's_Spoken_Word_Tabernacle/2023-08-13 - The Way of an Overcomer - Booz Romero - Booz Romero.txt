you clean our vessels Lord may you clean our hearts may we come with the right attitude father so that you can come and speak whatever you have for us this morning we commit Our Lives in Your Hands Lord in disservice in your hands thank you for everything that you have done for us Lord the life that you have given us Lord the hands that we have the feet that you have that we have Lord the voice that we have that we can uh other Praises To Your Name Lord Jesus we're so grateful for everything that you have done for our lives father for the healing of our hearts the healing of our bodies Lord the healing of our soul father the healing of our spirit father we're so grateful this morning we thank you we commit this service in your hands Lord the the reading of your word and everything May everything be for your glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning is it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord how many can say I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord can you tell that the person next to you I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord amen so and somebody says like and you know you got to tell your face that you're happy to be in the house of the Lord amen you can put a smile in your face and say you know it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen if you have your Bibles let's uh go straight to the word of the Lord and we're so grateful to be here once again and it's been a little while but you know I was thinking you know when we go to different places is not how much you can say but it's like is what the church needs so I hope that I am fulfilling that purpose from the Lord that whatever word we say it is what what you need you know it is not what you what you want to hear you know because we want to hear you know good things or we want to receive all the good things from the Lord but sometimes it is Lord the Lord says you know I want to give you certain things and everybody's not what you want is is what you need amen so this morning let's uh let's see what the Lord has for us and we're gonna go from there amen so if we if you have your Bibles in the Book of Genesis chapter the 22nd and then we're gonna read in the book of Hebrews chapter five so Genesis 20 uh 22 verse 17 and when you have it you can say Amen sometimes you have it on the screen but it's good to hear the the sound of the of the pages of your Bible say man so Genesis 27 22 verse 17 it says that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies amen and now in the book of Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7 through verse 9 it says when you when you have you can say Amen Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7. it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered of prayers and supplications with strong crying in tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was was heard in that he feared though he he wear a son yet learn he obedience by the things we which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all of them that obey him amen you may have your seat so he's as I said it's good to be here amen so I was thinking today you know about what what does it mean to be a sacrifice to the Lord and you know the scripture says like that we have to present ourselves as living sacrifices and then I was listening to a tape and brother random says a priest is to make sacrifices amen and we give to God the sacrifice of our lips giving praise to his name say I don't feel like it how many sometimes come to church and you're like you don't feel like lifting your hands or you don't feel like singing But the prophet of God says do it anyhow and he says that's the sacrifice and then when you feel tired on a Thursday night you have service here on Thursday night but when you're feeling tired on a Thursday night but you're still calm that's the sacrifice Hallelujah he says I'll feel too tired the devil will tell you that till he takes you to hell that's right you're to make a spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name priests and Kings unto God the Bible said we wear he made us priests and Kings unto God so then if we talk about our sacrifice what is to be a sacrifices Lord I don't feel like doing I don't feel like coming I don't feel like praising but I will still gonna make it I will still gonna wake up on a Sunday more on a Sunday morning and it's kind of funny because like through the rest of your week you can wake up early and you don't have an issue even Saturday mornings you can like seven seven in the morning seven o'clock you're already up but on Sundays when you know especially in the time the winter time you know those uh the the the the code like you know the uh the the sheets and everything it feels so good but that's a real sacrifice that you can say you know what I'm gonna I'm going to be an overcomer this morning and I'm gonna make it to church amen so this morning by God's grace I would like to speak to you the way of an overcomer the way of an overcomer the way of an overcomer amen and then the prophet of God says he over again talking about Jesus he says he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only and we can leave right now and say what's the way of an overcomer by the word amen in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to The Temptations in those corresponded exactly to The Temptations in the Garden of Eden so now the prophet of God I was kind of studying this and he's now going to bring his and he's gonna connect Genesis 3 to look for and when you start seeing those scriptures It's like because in Genesis 3 if you read Genesis 3 it is the serpent coming to Eve and if we if you have read that is scripture the serpent was coming to Eve it was it was not when when he started tempting her but it was a a communication they've been having for we can say for months or they were they were in eternity so but the serpent was there constantly with Eve you know and and that's sometimes the enemy is coming against you like constantly until you give up amen so but here it then if if you go to the Book of Genesis it is talking and then when when it comes to specifics and it says you know but God said and she says but God told us not to partake of the tree but God told us but he's like but God knows because the serpent was quoting the scriptures amen and the prophet of God says the lust of the flesh the Lost of the eyes and the pride of life was what Eve was defeated amen those three things will be always coming against you amen but when Jesus came he was a different story because the same word that he that the devil was using with Eve was the same word that he came and was using with Jesus because he he needed to know he wanted to know who he was amen and Jesus but but the prophet of God says Jesus overcame by the word amen the Eve in Genesis 3 verse 1 through 6 through 6 it says she fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word because she had the word she she was created by the word but she didn't know how to use the word or she was not in church enough but right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer and that's why it says like this is the way of an overcomer and it is only the way that you can know if you're overcoming because the word of God cannot fail are you happy tonight that today that we have an absolute something that will not fail and that's the word of God that's the only way that you can be an overcomer this morning by the word of God and then the prophet of God it says and I was asking myself what is to be to be to overcome and then the prophet of God says it means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks that is when you're gonna be an overcomer when you're able to recognize your enemy amen because you know when there is going to be a fight you know a boxer or something they are stunning their opponent and the enemy is very good at studying you and know where are your weak spots he knows you more than you know yourself but greater is he that is seeing you then than the one that's in the world amen and then you know and then the prophet of God says a lot of people say that there is no devil why because they don't want to recognize that there is something wrong with them but when you recognize who you are and then then you're gonna be an overcomer because now now you're you can enter into that word and you can recognize your need and say Lord I need you this morning I need you in my marriage I need you in my home I need you to how to deal with my children you know I've seen some examples on how parents they are they are so blind with their kids and they're like oh you know he's an angel she is an angel but then you see the life of those kids and like no those Not Angels but until the parents recognize that those kids need the Holy Spirit then they will be like well my son or my daughter is not an angel they need the Lord because then they are blaming everybody else for the mistakes of your children amen that's not in my notes amen it's always good to be here I was thinking you know maybe I will preach in Spanish you have a lot of Spanish-speaking people here and then maybe we have a translator here but then like like no bill let's just keep her whole her peace amen and but the prophet of God says now he says and you must recognize him real who do you have to recognize as real your your enemy he knows you he knows you you know he knows you when you wake up in the morning he knows okay you know now this is coming but you know the prophet of God says you give me a person that when that person kind of wakes up or kind of opens his eyes or her eyes in the morning that the enemy's gonna be like oh no this is per this person is coming again wouldn't you like to live that life that the enemy is not pleased when you wake up in the morning because why you're gonna be making war against his against his kingdom amen you must know he's the devil and the same time that you recognize him and know that he's the devil that he is against you then then to overcome your rep you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than the devil that is fighting against you that is the one that is so that you have already that already overcame for you and by his grace you're more than a match for him why you know sometimes you know you can uh paint a picture you know you you see the little the the the child of a lion you know is there and and then there's the enemy coming you know they pray trying to make him a prey and then he starts you know just train to her but it's just like a little a little a little little lion you know but then his dad is behind him then the enemy is like ah you know the enemy gets a scare and and he thinks that and then that little one he thinks that he's he's the one that overcame that enemy but then there was someone behind him that was overcoming that enemy and then sometimes that's that's the way we see ourselves you know we we we can see ourselves as very small but there is someone behind us amen there is someone that is kind of watching for you that when the enemy that's as the Bible says when the enemy comes against you like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard and what is that is that is the god that is living in you because as we say here greater is he that is seeing you than he that's in the world can you recognize that this morning that you're going through sickness you're going through family situations but you can say Lord greater you are that is living in me that no matter my circumstance you are the god that gave the promise you are the god that says you I am the god that healeth all your diseases can we recognize the promise because the god of your the sir the god of the promise is greater that the circumstances you may be facing this morning what can you be facing this morning that he God already he doesn't know it he knows everything and that's where the Christian Life is rest because now you can rest and you can say Lord You're greater I Surrender that's what we sung this morning I surrender all I surrender all my life Lord or who I am this morning I Surrender it to you amen then the prophet of God he's talking and I was reading listening reading a little bit of quote one of these quotes in the message how can I over hike how can I overcome and he's talking about that little one and again always that's why the Bible says that he has to be you have to be like a child to enter into the kingdom of God because sometimes he's like that little one he's trying to put on his coat and he's trying to make all the efforts to put on the code and then Mama comes and it's like let me help you he's like no I don't want you to help me because I want to put on the code and then he puts one one is live on one side and then it's all twists all all twisted or or not in the right place but then the mom is like if you just if you your surrender and then you'll know that that code is is faded for you and then I was like how do you surrender it's like when you just lift up your hands and say Lord put your the code of your word in my life amen and then as soon as that kid recognizes that that Mama or daddy is the one that is putting the clothes on him then he's gonna be able to lift up his hands remember lifting your hands is a sign of surrender so as soon as he recognizes that he needs to surrender then he just raises up his hands and then the code comes very easy and then the prophet of God says that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself because we make many times oh you know my enemies here my enemies there the prophet of God says your greatest enemy is yourself it's this that is always fighting against what God has placed in your heart he says you have to overcome yourself you have to overcome your ideas you have to overcome your things and surrender yourself to Kim he overcame for you he knows the way we don't know the way that's why he says I am the truth I am the way I am the life if you recognize who is your opponent but also you recognize who your God is now you have life now you now you have the way and now you have the truth isn't that beautiful that you go and read the word and he's like Lord thank you for your word when I am in my lowest you can bring me for from from my lowest mountain in my lowest Valley Lord you can bring me from there and we were kind of hearing in church and I was meditating on this and it's not on my Note but let me tell you you know when you are going through a valley in your life many times we wanna you just want to have the Mountaintop experiences but you don't want to be in the valley why because in the valley is when it is your greatest trial it is your greater tribulation it is your greatest uh you know sometimes we get defeated in the valley but let me tell you something that it is only in the valley when you're able to produce the fruits you cannot produce the fruit up in the mountain that's what the prophet of God says you cannot produce the fruit in the mountain but why because in the mountain the fruit will freeze where do you have to produce the fruit when you are going through the valley but the Bible says even though I go through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why because you will be by my side you will be in front of me you will be behind me you will be protecting me Lord as I go through the valley amen isn't that good David was preaching was reading was writing about it he's like I'm going to ram Valley but it doesn't matter if I go through a valley because you will be with me and and now we have come to a different dispensation in in this last last age that is not God working with us now is God in you and that's why Paul writes in the people and he says Christ in you the hope of glory that's the need that's the reason why you're going through your Valley you say Lord if you're the hope of glory if you are the god of my salvation help me to go through my through my loss to to the loss of my child the loss of my wife the loss of my husband or the loss of my job or my marriage problems Lord help me to go through that Valley and he will help you because that's his promise I will never leave you I will not forsake you can we just think about it I will never leave you I will not forsake you if you feel forsaken don't feel forsaken no more because he says I will not leave him I will not forsake you amen but let me tell you something the prophet of God also tells you that the devil has a right to a final punch he says that in the message Christ is revealing his own word he says I was just he's giving an example he's like I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and wolf both of them were them are nervous just like the rest of the world isn't that the conditions of the day everybody's nervous everybody's that they don't know where to go or like then they come to church or they don't come to church then they deny the existence of God and then when they are dying they're like oh I I need God everybody's nervous you know the rest of the human being on Earth he says I remember Satan the prophet of God says I remember now remember Satan got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are I don't care if you're the most popular preacher in the message I don't care Satan has a right to get a punch at you but he he is he's the prophet of God says he's got a right to that one punch but which had you rather be that that punch be blind or be in in a tritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see the prophet of God says he got no he's gotten somewhere he can punch you he has a right for just one he he's got a right to that open place but then the prophet God that is he says that's the spot that you have to keep cover all the time that's the that's the spot that you have to be praying Lord these little thing here that that you know the as Paul says you know I have prayed for I have asked you Lord for three times to remove these these Thorn from My Flesh and the Lord says my grace is sufficient you see how can we overcome how what is the way of another corner by the word my grace is sufficient you know you have to be covered all the time and and then the prophet of God says you you you're gonna see a a an age that is always nervous about things and that's how the enemy you know a lot of people they have nervous or like breakdowns or they get burnt out why because it is a condition so those are the conditions of the day but guess what that's why you have to be praying you know the Bible that's why the Bible says that you have to be praying you have to be fast and you have to be reading your word you have to be coming to church you have to be around the correct the right Fellowship why because in in that way you're protecting yourself against the punch of the enemy because I said because your enemy knows you way better than you know yourself but God knows you better than that amen I can tell you the greater the weight the greater the trial the greater the victory how many can say Amen to that Lord I'm going through this but I'm being patient and I am praying and and the Lord says yeah because the greater the trial the greater the testimony is going to be the greater sorry the greater the trial the testimony is going to be even greater have you asked something to the Lord he hasn't given to you I I have asked something to the Lord he hasn't given it to us talking about my wife and I but we know we have a promise and let me tell you something the god that gave the promise he is faithful to fulfill his promise it doesn't matter how much you have to wait you know it doesn't matter how much you you have to pray he already gave the promise and if he gave the if he gave the promise he has to fulfill his promise because the Bible says that his promises are Jay and amen that's why when you read the scriptures read it with a different mindset that you say these are the promises every promise in the book is mine how many can say every promise in this book those promises are mine this morning Lord you are my peace you are my joy you are the the strength Giver Lord this morning if I feel weak you're gonna give me strength but also Paul says let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich lay let the defeated said I am an overcomer this morning amen because we are coming to the congregation as the Bible Peter is writing he's like we're coming to the congregation of the firstborns and if you think about a firstborn what is a firstborn he's the one that has two the right to things the the firstborn the birthright and and to and to be the heir of everything as the firstborn and that's what the why Peter is saying we have come to the congregation of the firstborn the the the the the the the the the congregation of the ones that are Overcomers who are those this morning I am one of them and then in Luke chapter 4 look at the first thing when when Jesus is coming here Luke Luke chapter 4 and then it says and Jesus being filled full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit unto the Wilderness now look Jesus was baptized right and then the spirit the spirit of God left him to the wilderness and that's you know in in Denver it's second Luke chapter 4 the second verse it says and being 40 days tempted of the devil just think about 40 days being tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterwards hunger so if you think about this script scripture Jesus was tempted for 40 days until these three specific challenges and it makes us think many times that when we are tempted once and we can hardly overcome Temptation when you ever come just once when you are kind of tempted once and you're not able to overcome now think about Jesus 40 days from the time he will wake up until the time that we he will go to sleep or even even in in his sleep the enemy was tempting him was kind of with all sort of you know what you are going through right now he went through that and and if you're if you if you think about and the number 40 in the numeral in the numerology of God it is a number of judgment so in other words all your Temptations everything that you may be going through right now it is already judged in Christ amen that's why he had to go 40 days why because he wanted to prove everything needed to be perfect according to the scriptures because where is this number coming from remember when uh um during the flood it was 40 days and 40 nights that that kind of the rain was coming right because during that time then after that they have to stay in the art for I think was like 300 like for a year in the ark but rain was coming for those 40 days if I'm not mistaken so that's where this number 40 is coming why because God was judging the Earth in the Old Testament and then Christ was a fulfillment of all the scriptures and guess who Jesus was maybe we can say during those 40 days he was going through through that flood but then after that he was able to be judged and he was the ark wasn't Jesus the ark yes amen amen but we can say you know that we're glad that he was tempted in no ways but yet without sin they they but now now think about this the enemy will always come and challenge you or temp you tempt you in areas of your life when you are tired when you are hungry when you feel defeated when you are sad why because that's where the enemy can deal with your emotions amen how many people have we heard that said that you know that when they were sad or when they were angry they just pull out the gun and either they committed a murder or they committed suicide why because their emotions were so high amen and in ways that it is because they gave their enemy an opportunity to work through them amen but look before Jesus was tempted and this is the key he was filled with the Holy Ghost and that was the only way he could overcome his enemy amen Jesus was a man yet he was a God but he needed to be adopted after he was baptized he needed to be adopted and that's why when uh John said I saw a spirit like a dove coming in and going to him that was that was his adoption so he needed to receive the holy spirit so then that he could go to the Wilderness and then be tempted in the wilderness and he was going to be an overcomer in the wilderness so that's why that's why the pastors the ministers is always stressing the importance of receiving the Holy Spirit same thing for you and me you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit to be able to overcome the enemy as Paul says you know Paul he's writing you know I Die daily in other words he's like Lord I ask for you refilling every single day you know you have to have that oil in your life if not you're gonna perish amen you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit and then you just think about your body your soul and your spirit God made us try and uh beings amen he made her body he made our spirit he made our soul and all of that all of these they have senses in your life but all of them they have to be controlled by the Holy Spirit amen and it is worthy because without the holy spirit is then the enemies when he gets a hell of us and he makes us fall or we choose to fall because the Lord gives us that opportunity you you are given the opportunity to choose whether or not you want to be in church whether whether or not you you will not serve the Lord you know that's the the free moral agency amen I'm trying to build something so please bear with me here for a few minutes and it says our body has five senses you know your sight your hearing your smell your taste and what you thought your spirit has five senses your memory your imagination your conscience your affections and your reasoning and then your soul has either one or the other it either has Faith or the Holy Spirit living in there or it has doubt amen but you just think about this when we thought when we when we speak about the spirit you know the imaginations memory how many times you know if you were in the world or then you gave your your life to the Lord then how many times is the enemy coming and trying to attack and bring to memory the things that happening in the past how many times why is that because he knows you know remember the testimony that brother random says about sister Nellie Sanders you know she had received from something from the Lord but then she started reasoning With the Enemy that's what we're talking about one of those Spirit spiritual senses is reasoning she started reasoning With the Enemy when she was passing by the ballroom and she was like you know what ah I may just go in and I'm just gonna hear the music I'm not gonna do anything that was the greatest mistake why because she started reasoning this Spirit hero Spirit was reasoning to something that she had already been delivered from or that was hidden in her life that near needed Deliverance so then she goes there and then she finds him she finds herself in the middle of the ballroom listening to the music and then she started she started dancing there and then she comes running to the prophet and says you know I don't know what happened then I can say maybe the prophet didn't say it but I can say it it's because you started reasoning with something that you were dealing with or because or maybe perhaps you were doing something or you should have confessed something that that you that you haven't confessed and that's why that thing was kind of following after you and then but you know the prophet of God pray for her and then she was delivered right but what is this we need the Holy Spirit In Our Lives to be able to control our bodies our souls in our experience to be able to control your memory your imaginations your conscious your affections and your reasoning but now look in this first challenge the enemy and and that's why you know the Bible says also in the book of Hebrews he says that he was tempted in all things yet without sin that's our promise amen it says in the in the first challenge the enemy came in in you know the Bible when the Bible is written is very specific so you can um the Bible is very specific so you you can kind of uh how do you say like um I forgot the word anyway so that you can uh familiar no not familiarize but like that you can um I don't know I don't even have to wear any Spanish we're getting old I guess you know the Bible is written in I'm just gonna go ahead okay but you know when when we're really here the Bible tells us that he was hungry why because the Bible is specific so that we can refer back and say you know what if Jesus was hungry was hungry I can be hungry as well you know and if Jesus was sad when he cried then I can cry amen because sometimes we hear you know and that's why when brother Branham will preach to the Pentecostal congregations he will tell them you know it's good to be always you know on fire but also you have to recognize where you find yourself so then you can be delivered from that amen because you if you think about many of of the preachers at the time when brother random was around a a Alan like all of them were fire preachers but how they end it is because there were things that were never fixed so now God or Jesus being in a human form he was hungry just think about it without eating for 40 days if you're if you don't need one day then then you feel hungry just think about now for 40 days and then every single day the enemy will come with one thing then the enemy will come with another thing but the that was and then there was a time for him to eat but not when the enemy wanted Kim to it right because the enemy came in the exact time when the scripture says and after 40 days he was hungry right but when he he wanted to and you know and one thing that we can say you have been you have to you have been called today to control things through the Holy Spirit you have been called to control things and you are not called to letting things control you and that's what Jesus was doing here he was not gonna yield to the enemy and say yeah I'm hungry yeah I can turn this these these stones into bread no he was like not not and he's in the the the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that either Made bread and Jesus answered him saying it is written that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God in other words there was something greater than a physical food there was something greater that was living in Jesus that could overcome the enemy and that was the word that's the answer when the enemy is coming against you that's how you have to respond certainly you have to recognize your condition in order for you to be the leader from something because if you don't recognize your condition then you're gonna be in the second same condition you can be praying over and over and over and over again but if you don't want to let go of that condition because the the prophet of God also told us that there is power in confession and if the arrival the Bible also says that we have to confess our faults one to another what does that mean when you confess you're exposing your enemy I have done that it works amen God has always equipped equipped us with something that will always defeat the enemy and that is God's word how many be left out this morning it is the word of God that is going to defeat the enemy amen the prophet of God says never use any power at all talking about Jesus bringing every divine blessing down to the reach of the homeless and weakest of Christians as long as you believe that's the word of God and it says it is written the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime and on any condition or under any circumstances that is the word of God that is the only thing that can overcome the enemy that is the word of God if you can take something out of this sermon this morning is the word of God will defeat the enemy under any time under any circumstances Lord because your word will never fail the word of a man will fail certainly we are humans amen but the word of God will never fail and now coming back to this thought that you have been called to control things you have been called to master all circumstances why the prophet of God also tells us that Faith Masters all the circumstances but we are not gonna We're not gonna let our circumstances to master us why because as I was saying God is greater than my circumstance and now the prophet of God says here now listen listen to this closely I love when the prophet of God says closely what does that mean pay attention because I'm going to say something that may help you then he says any Divine promise of God it says the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it right and believe it in that way that it is written God said God and you say God it is your word and take the right mental attitude towards that Divine promise he will bring it to pass because there is not defeat faith cannot be defeated amen there there is no defeat to Faith watch the ministry of our Lord he did not claim to be a great person he come by the way of a stable door he went out the way of capital punishment but he owned about one maybe one garment in his lifetime he never have a place to lay his hand he never went very far he traveled along uh humbly live among the peasants he spoke a very common language he was not a great person or claimed to be but the Bible says he took on himself of no reputation he made himself of not a reputation in other words he was bringing everything to pass through his attitude he always was saying always was saying you know I do nothing until I hear or I see the father to tell me to do something and that was the same the same with the ministry of the Prophet you know he will I need to wait for a vision I need to wait for Dasa the Lord so then I can say something and that's the same for us today until you hear from the Lord just keep praying keep pressing and as we read here keep having the right mental attitude towards the word of God because that's what happened with a lot of people that they get discouraged because you know they pray once or they made a five-minute prayer and they think that the Lord is going to answer their prayer no you have to yield you have to surrender you have to say Lord I surrender all I surrender my my thought life I Surrender my my body to you Lord use me help me but it has to be a real surrender a right attitude the right because why is brother when I'm saying mental attitude he's not talking about your soul he's talking about your spirit that you have to have the right mental attitude I've been thinking you know seeing some people that serve the Lord and then they come to church and then they leave and then they come back you know why why what is that it is because it is a choice it is a choice that you make as as we when we started this this this morning as I said it is a choice when you come here you bring a Living Sacrifice why because you are having the right mental attitude towards the word of God and you want and you want the Lord to uh to speak to you this morning and then you're coming with your little fire and then you're saying Lord I'm bringing my little fire and then the other per the other your brother your sister is bringing the same thing you're having the right attitude because when you have the right attitude the word of God will bring you to pass whatever your need is this morning he will bring the answer to you and sometimes you know like we are like but we I am asking Lord for these that and the other but let me tell you is better when you come with the right mental attitude to God that he even tells you no and you're gonna be happy isn't that the truth all or I want this better house where I want this other car or I want this other job but then he's like what are you going to be using that for had the right mental attitude where you can say Lord if you give it to me praise the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna use it for your kingdom but having the right attitude is a choice you are given a choice remember Calum Adam in in um sorry Cain and Abel they had a choice Cain was even given the option you know he was seeing how his brother was offering a sacrifice and he was given the same option you know you can bring the same sacrifice that it is not through a fruit of the Earth but he's through the blood that you can be that you can be redeemed he was given the same option he didn't want to take it but Abel took the right the right approach to the word of God it was a choice so it is your choice today to be an overcomer or to live a defeated life that was the first challenge it was coming through the lust of the flesh you know Jesus was hungry in in in Denver he replied with the word amen now the Second Challenge it was the last of the eye and he goes in Luke chapter 4 verse 5 and it says the devil taking him up to taking him up to into high mountains so he look how the enemy is coming first is it comes through the wilderness and then he now is bringing him to a high mountain why because your Temptations as your yielding and as you're surrendering your life to him to Christ the enemy is going to bring a higher one but guess what the word of God is greater than that so first brought him to the Wilderness and now he's bringing Jesus to a high mountain and he shows unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is deliver unto me and to whosoever I will give it if thou therefore will worship me that sounds beautiful and remember why because Satan was the one that was leading Worship in heaven you guys remember that and now he was trying to bring the same worship down in Earth with Jesus and he was like you know what if you worship me he if you sing to me I will give you the kingdoms of the Earth in Jesus answer and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve the first was not not only the men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God and now it's it's saying like thou shall Worship the Lord thy God in other words he's even destroying the doctrine of Trinity here he's like there is only one God and you have to worship that one guy what was the Second Challenge it was about power it was about Authority because it was about worshiping something and we know about the scriptures if you think about the word worship we always think that is raising our hands or singing or uh you know having a worse like a regular song service but we can say that that is the result of worship what is worship worship is about submission what is this as the enemy is telling Jesus I can give them to you but you have to worship me or submit yourself to me the first one was about bread the second one was about worship was about submission you submit yourself to me and I will give you the kingdoms of the Earth and that's what the enemy wants from us every day I can give you more popularity I can give you more more money more more more things that you get busy with that you don't have time to read your Bible that you don't have time to come to church I can give you all of that if you just worship me he wants you to submit yourself to Satan's bondage because that what that is the results of his worship amen he gives depression God does God is not the author of depression he gives anxiety he gains loneliness sadness bitterness those are the fruits of the flesh amen but if you read in the book of Galatians it is just think about it the fruits of the spirit is Joy love amen Temperance all of that those are the fruits of the spirit not the fruits of the flesh but when we submit ourselves to the right Kingdom as Jesus said that there was a kingdom coming and you know because when the enemy was coming against Jesus he he didn't know even who Jesus was do you do you know that he didn't know who Jesus was because he was kind of testing he was testing and see what he was going to be responding to because then if thou be the Son of God you know commend these stones and and and and or even at the cross if you're the Son of God now the uh called your Angels or like he didn't know until after he died because when he died he thought that he already uh defeated God's Kingdom but but it was what a great mistake he made because that's why the prophet God we were we were saying here he came in such a humble way that he was God hiding himself in Simplicity he was God hiding himself and then when he comes and now we we see here he's like I will give you all the kingdoms what Jesus knew all the kingdoms of the earth they are mine but it's not the time yet amen and he was then Jesus was saying you know there was a kingdom that is coming and he also said that there is like the kingdom of God is Among Us what was he referring to he was referring about the holy spirit that was among them and who was that the horse Jesus walking among them because those in the Bible says in the beginning the spirit of God was moving upon the waters and then when they were kind of afraid in there in in the little boat who was moving upon the waters it was Jesus moving upon the waters so it was the spirit of God moving among them there was the kingdom of God moving among them amen and he was referring about the holy spirit that can live in the heart of a person that they control that Holy Spirit had controlled power that can control your body your spirit in your soul that when you make a mistake you made a right right away there's conviction in your heart there is no condemnation that as the Bible says that those that are walking according to the spirit not according to the flesh there is not condemnation for you this morning there is conviction in your heart when you do something wrong or even like a a an evil thought come through your mind you're like Lord I Repent what is that because the holy spirit is bringing conviction to your life and this is something that the enemy wanted to take away from you because what if Jesus would have yield to this we will be here maybe but we wouldn't be Overcomers or we may not be here amen what can submission bring it will it will always bring good things because even when we pray and we don't get what we desire but as we are submitted to him we will be content with their results and you say Amen to that would you like to give God control everything would you like to even control in your life of everything that you are disappointing would like to say Lord I surrender as we said but in this mountain that he was going he remember Wilderness and now the high mountain but now there is a third challenge and it is the pride of life the verse 9 of Luke chapter four it says and he brought him to Jerusalem and he set him on a pinnacle of the Temple now it was the Wilderness now the mountain now he brings him to a religious atmosphere and it said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hands and then he's gonna quote the word for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up list lest at any time that thou Dash thy foot against a stone in other words he's quoting the word go back and think what happened in Genesis 3 it was the same thing the enemy quoting the word to Eve and then he says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not die but God knows that you will know how to uh discern from Good and Evil and she partook of that fruit but Jesus he didn't partake of that fruit and let me tell you something if the first Adam and the first Eve they fail there was a second Adam that was coming and there was a second Eve that was coming the first Adam the first Eve failed but the second Adam couldn't fail and then if you've seen this scripture it says now he he brings him to the temple and he's bringing the word and he's with that same word that he overcame the enemy and and he said look when and when the enemy cannot get you through your feelings you know because he started with the feelings how you feel you feel hungry you eat turn these stones to bread and you're gonna eat and if he cannot get you to your submission through your worship he will try to get you by using God's word but he won't use the fullness of the god of God's word he will use God's word partially so that he can bring confusion to your life because that's what happened in the beginning and that is he was testing and see if he can try to do the same thing with Jesus he's here what he quoted and now and now look he he here what he quoted sounded very good you know that he will send his angels and then if you fall you're in the angels are gonna pick you up and it's beautiful but then it says but he didn't he he did in this third challenge he's quoting a scripture from Psalms 91 right Psalms 91 chapter 11 chapter 12. verse 11 and verse 12 but the enemy didn't quote the rest of the chapter why because he was already pronouncing his judgment why because in Psalms 91 13 in the Amplified version it says you shall tread upon the lion in The utter the Young Lion and the serpent shall you trample under your foot so in other words the Judgment was in the next verse but he didn't want to quote it because he was just saying the angels are going to come and get you but then in Psalms 91 that's the protection for the believer that when the enemy is coming against you he you're gonna be able to stand and you're going to be able to trample over your fears over your your your your family family history amen you're gonna be able to stand on that and when people is doubting that it will always be because they cannot see God's word because the the word of God he always bring guidance to our lives amen so now in this third challenge it was a religious confusion he was Now using the word of God to say you know what he was quoting the scripture in Jesus verse 12 it says in Jesus answering and said unto him it is said it is said Thou shalt not them the Lord thy God now he's opening a different dispensation to tell him I am God look what it says thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God and when the the devil had ended all the Temptation it says oh all the Temptation he departed from him for a season 40 days plus three days 43 43 days there day and night and he was able to defeat the enemy with the word in Jesus return but look after what happened after here he returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee in other words after you overcome Temptation after all the challenges he faced there was a victory as you can see there was power of the spirit that brought him to Galilee after which we Face challenges in our lives when the challenge is over and we won through Jesus Christ we get more power of the spirit isn't it something after you go through a trial that then now you look back and you say Lord all through this time you were with me and I'm rejoicing and then there is more power that you you get it stronger and it's stronger why because you were able to overcome your trial your Temptation amen every service we attend every time we come to church the Lord is preparing us as we read in the as we as we can read in descriptions in the scripture sorry the Bible says that we are not ignorant of the devil's devices of his devices the enemy can take advantage of us if we are ignorant amen but we can be grateful that the Lord has not ignorant anymore because we know the enemy's devices we know that's what I'm saying we know that the enemy if he cannot attack me through my feelings he's going to attack me through my worship to the Lord if not he's gonna try to bring confusion using the word of God now we are no longer ignorance of the devil's devices now we can be over commerce by the word and now that's what you have to be immerse yourself in the word so that when the enemy is coming against you now you can quote back the word amen you can say you you know he is my God you are a defeated devil I know the end of the book and in the end at the end of the book it says that I am an overcomer and he says that you that there is a hell and that is prepared for you and your angels and after that there is no there is no more life for you but you have to read the book you have to be in you have to go there in the book amen and now you know laughs and as we are dead in Christ and we are Abraham's seed and we are more than conquerors through him who conquer everything for us Jesus conquer everything for us no reason for us to have to overcome anything because it is already conquered everything is already conquered that's what I'm saying that's what he was saying that he was sent to All The Temptations where Jesus went through all of those Temptations so that if you can go through something like that he cannot be he he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he already went through all of them but he was not defeated so if you go through something today you won't be defeated and if even if you have to die there is a greater Victory because remember that death is only the the the vehicle that is taking you to the other side who is the victor who is the victim the enemy is the victim and we are the victors tonight today amen the prophet of God says The Last Enemy sickness death temptation all things are put under your feet how many can say oh my Temptations everything is put under my feet and we are the Seed of Abraham being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed marching onto Victory to Victory to Victory to Victory how many can say this morning I have the victory Jesus Christ I am holding God's promise out before me and I am marching on I am not marching backwards you know like that little guy that was pla that was sounding the trumpet when they when they when they when that Army was fighting he was like when when they they asked him please play the song to go back and he just play was playing the song to go forward go forward until they were able to defeat the enemy and then after that they ask him how or why you didn't they played you didn't you didn't sound it or play the song to go backwards he's like because I didn't know it amen so what can we say today you know I don't know the song to go backwards I am not I am not a person that is going to be leaving this building defeated I am a person that is going to be living this field building Victorious because I know that he already defeated my enemies for me and the only song I know is I'm going forward I'm going all the way with the Lord amen your seed will possess the gates of your enemy it is not an option when as we read at the beginning Abraham was given a promise and it was said it said your your seed will possess what does this mean your seed will possess it is not a it is not an option you are possessing the gates of your enemy every day however you want to call it sometimes you're dealing with depression sure sometimes you're dealing with lust with anxiety whatever you want to call it you know and they they now they talk about inclusive language but now the children of God because we say my sickness my cancer my anxiety my depression well why don't you stop saying you know that's not mine that is not my sickness that I use I'm just taking that I'm just taking that back to the to their to the owner amen and that's the enemy that's the owner just take it back and say that's your sickness yeah that's your depression that is your loss certainly you have coming in you have uh kind of mingle with my mind and you have attacked attacked my mind but I know that greater is he that has seen me he had overcome the world he had overcome all Temptations so that I can walk Victorious today amen amen all right now we want to close just think about this if the musicians can come the eagles they don't fight the snake on the crown I don't know you have read have heard about this before or not but the eagles they don't fight the snakes on the ground they the eagle he picked it up in the sky and changes the Battleground you know that and then it releases the snake into the sky the snake has no stamina no no power and no balance in the air it is useless it is weak and is vulnerable unlike onto the ground when where it is powerful wise and deadly but that's on the ground and you know we are not Earthly creatures we are Heavenly bound amen so and I can tell you this morning take your fight into the spiritual Realm by praying and when you are in the spiritual realm God takes over your battles amen you're but you're flying you're soaring in the skies and now you're taking losses snakes that are coming against you and just take them there and say Lord they are just take care of them don't fight the enemy in his comfort zone change the Battlegrounds like the eagle and let God take charge to your earnest prayer and you will be assured of clean victory how many wanna have Victory today and say Lord remember me today amen let's buy our heads today just want to say thank you Lord thank you for your word Lord as we come before you just want to say we love you father thank you because the only way that we can overcome is by the word that is the key for us Lord the
