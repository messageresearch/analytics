I was thinking this morning as we got off of something brother Branham said a long time ago he said what a resurrection that that was but what a resurrection this is and so I say Shalom to all of these resurrected Saints out here that have experienced that resurrection for yourself this is a song many years ago that was sung at my sister's wedding and a couple years ago our pastor brother Todd was preaching on perfect love and how we tend to think of God's love with our figlio love with our bodies and and that's where our mind goes but God's love is not thought with our bodies with our figlio love and it goes so much deeper and that our love actually comes from our origin and that we originated from him and that's where our love comes from so on the way home from that service I thought of the song that had been sung at my sister's wedding and I hadn't thought of it she'd been married I don't say how many years ago but she's been married a long time and I thought of this song and then God just started dropping new words into my heart based on that sermon and gave me new inspiration for that song so it's about Isaac and Rebekah but then it turns into our story it turns into the bride's story of where we are now on this song and I don't even know why keep so I just started singing one day as I was doing what I'd done so many times I heard of someone and who lived far away I was asked if I would go and be his chosen bride I went with his servant twas in the evening time when I heard his servant cry behold your Isaac this man I've brought you to behold there he stands my promise was true and now Rebekah my time with you is done you nineteen time with your Isaac has begun are you in love with this wonderful word of life and are you living like a virtuous wife are you wearing the wedding band of unmerited grace do you know your Isaac is he still preferred above all that you've observed the Bible was written for his bride in the end time and now we can see what was always in his mind by Isaac and I are one it's an invisible Union this perfect loves revealed it comes from my origin this love will take me to my future [Music] behold your Isaac its Christ revealed to you in a cloud he came down and showed himself in view and now Rebecca just like the evening time and like Rebecca who in the evening time be hailed her Isaac so are you now little bra [Applause] god is good all the time let's make a little noise now okay god is good all the time he put a song it heart of mine is good [Music] all the time through the darkest night [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause]

God that your word or God would just fine Lord the mark in our hearts Lord we love you and we thank you Father the name of Jesus Christ amen amen want to just greet each and every one of you and some different visitors that are here may God bless you and just want to make a few announcements here I know that the sisters are warning very quickly to meet right after the service in the back conference room that won't be too long I know that this is Easter Sunday and you probably have other plans and plans to get to as well but the meeting itself will just be a very quick meeting just in regards to the upcoming meetings that we have coming up here at the end of May and the fellowship dinner that would be associated with that there will also be some emails that are coming out and regarding that but please set that aside on your on your calendar for that Memorial Day weekend brother Tim Humes will be here with us and we just want to keep that in prayer that the Lord would just just move and just speak to our hearts in a special way and also I wanted to say that if there's anyone that is willing to we always get requests for different ones that are coming in we had last year once again requests for those that were asking to stay with someone so if you would be willing whether it's a brother or a couple brothers or whether it's you know whether it's sisters they're in the home if you would just if you just let brother Shane know and then he can we can just kind of go from there if we hear anything because we usually get that on the Facebook and and sometimes there's just like I said sometimes it's situations financially it's a little bit more affordable for someone if they have somebody to stay with those that are coming in then there's other times where people just like to stay with someone else and if we have young people that's coming in one thing that I certainly we we like doing during this time this is where they have some some different older ones who actually can express to them what the Lord has not only done in their life but what he's doing and it's a little bit of a disciple and it's one of it's something that is just a very precious reality you know within our hearts because of what God has done in our hearts we we want to share and we want to encourage amen one another so we just we just thank God for His mercy for that I just want to also there's a car that we'd receive from from brother Greg and sister Suzanne as well as the gsella dawn family brother which would be sister Suzanne's father there for the Claudio we know that he went on home to his reward and they just were wanting to thank the church for the flowers and for just all that was done in the prayers during that time so he's already he's already went to his reward he's already he's already there amen but soon and very soon we're going to be united again amen soon and very soon amen so we just want to just approach the word here this morning and just see how the Lord will just direct us in mark in mark chapter 16 is where I'd like to go for a few moments here mark chapter 16 and let's just we'll begin reading at verse one and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and some salmi had had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted and he said unto them be not a frightened ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified He is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him as he said unto you they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated no doubt the these passages of Scripture they would be read throughout the world and for those who has already been within services would have been read whether early in the morning or even during this time but one thing about it we we believe that as believers that we're not just we're not just reading of history but we realized that the scripture all Scripture is given by inspiration and we recognize that that the Word of God the Bible the scriptures its prophecy what God did before he's the same God and he'll do it the same way and so when we we look at this they had they heard and there were reports that were being given to that of the disciples and but yet after even hearing they needed to see they were believers they were believers but they needed to see him there's nothing can ever substitute or take the place of seeing him now he's not going to come here this morning and make himself known with nail prints in his hands or his side Riven but he comes as he came to them there in the resurrection they were walking on the road to Emmaus with him in Luke 24 and the Bible says their eyes were Holden that they would not know him but he went through the word and he began to take the promises that identified and were fulfilled within the ministry all of the suffering and all of the promises that pertained to him and he unfolded himself by way of his word so that here that they would know him and it was then when he came in among them and he broke the bread when they invited him in that he did something there that he had already done before before he was ever crucified and they recognized it was him now you see the word itself it had to be where he would come and make himself known in the form of his word because there was a promise that laid for that of the believers where where the reason the whole coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it was more than just Calvary you know many times it's looked at and and what spoke of over and over is the cross and the crucifixion thank God that he was willing to go for you and I but that was in order to pay a price that he might be able to release to you and I that life that was needed in order to raise you and I up and when you you think of it of how that you know he he came among them here in his word and and he began to make himself known I want to just break in here for a few moments into John chapter 20 where it talks about where he Mary Magdalene was there and here she is coming to the the tomb and when she came there remember here the angels they asked her in verse 13 they said to her woman why weepest thou and she said because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had dust said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus now here is one who washed his feet this was not somebody who had seen him you know from a great distance and really just you know kind of had made something out fuzzy but she had seen him physically she knew him but then she also knew him as the one who where she had come and her life was all twisted up and and she and her self she was so bound as the Bible would would tell us here she was bound with seven devils but yet she came to the feet the Lord Jesus and in which she made herself there to his feet to wash his feet there was something in her heart that drew her there and remember it was there that when we understand she was actually set free of what she was bound with and and we know you and I there's no letter like she knew him to be the Messiah's she's seen this but here she is standing face to face and she doesn't know that it's him you see you can be standing face to face and the Lord Jesus Christ standing right there and speaking to you and you don't even recognize who it is but you see one thing that he'll always you can always count on he will always reveal himself by his word in his word and he will make himself known that he's the same yesterday today and forever the Bible said once again let me read it she saw Jesus standing and she knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus said unto her what's this words woman why weepest thou why seek us now her whom seekest thou shes supposing him to be the gardener said unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away so she's talking to him Jesus didn't change his dialect come on somebody but you see here there's a veil that's over her and even when he would address her in a general term woman that is not enough to break that veil from around her life but now in the next verse where he turns around and says Mary when he when he moved it from just a general term and he actually called her name he was letting her know I know you there was something that was contained within that voice the expression of that word that characteristic it broke the veil that was over her eyes and the one that she was searching for the one she was looking for she was talking to he had been talking to her oh girl repeated God he was standing right there before her and when she recognized he's the very one I've been searching for he's the very one I've been looking for it became personal and the veil was lifted from her eyes oh my then we understand you know how that it came in this hour the disciples you know and here they had they had walked with him and my you know that what they fought what they fought even when they walked with him on the road you know they didn't understand about the suffering they didn't know they didn't know that he was gonna have to suffer that they were veiled from that they didn't understand that remember they were they were cast down even in their heart and their spirit said we thought he was to be the Redeemer we thought he was to be the Messiah but you see it wasn't for them in that hour to understand that of the suffering because he alone is the one that would to bear the suffering he alone is the one that would bear the sin the iniquity the transgression he would bear all of that he would take all of that the chastisement of our peace would be laid upon him there is nothing that not one of them could help him out in that he had to go and take that alone all glory and he took all of that alone and now here they are they're going about you know in their life you you know you and I have we've been through times some situations in our life where events and tragedies happen and you just feel numb anybody know I'm talking about I never forget you know when when the Lord took my dad on I just felt numb they're just like a shock that just you just numb wasn't you know if there's other things that take place and and I think of it you know within this that no doubt you know when I look at that just in the little things that we could relate to here they were they were in a state of shock and a state of numbness but you realized that here of all the miracles they had seen a lot of miracles I want you to pay attention now they had seen a lot of miracles there was healings that accompanied his ministry the Bible tells us in the book of Acts that meant Jesus was a man of God approved among them was signs and wonders following his life now listen there had always been healing mental doubt were many others who had even came before him where there were healings and there were miracles but yet there were things that did stand out that even where the blind man would say that there's never been anything recorded where a man was healed in this manner even since the foundation of the world but you see of all the healings of all the signs of all the wonders yet the greatest proof that he himself was who he said he was was when he got up on that Easter morning when he rose up on that Easter morning brother that itself there was an announcement that could ring out in that hour that the sin debt has been paid he had already declared it is finished there on the cross he had stood there in the midst of all the temptation that the enemy had offered him he had stood faithful on that word and here he was now coming forward to sound that Jubilee trumpet that year is finished there has been a blood that has atoned for sin that there is little and there is a voice that goes out that says he can be free hallelujah never was in Easter morning never was there a sunrise like this sunrise that sunrise was a special sunrise amen there was a dual Sun rising that morning there was a Sun that broke over the horizon but at the same time there was a son that also rose and not just a son but the son of God he rose he he triumphed over Satan's Trinity of death hail in the grave and he rose up on that Easter morning to be able to bring it to you and I that I am he that was dead and I'm alive forevermore you see he who was alive he died you and I were in a condition of death but in order for us to be raised and I I'm talking about down in our soul for there to come a change within our life there had to be a price that was paid in order for that life to be released to you and I in order to raise that seed up you know how it is you take a seed you bury that see we see the plants even coming up right now you have to bury that seed and in that seed when the water begins to come around it it begins to actually rot all of that outer casing so that the germ of life on the inside can come forth and that's what the light will do the light will draw that that life it'll draw it up from the ground now think about this here because when we look at this in terms of where Mary was at she was standing face to face with him and he spoke to her but she don't realize it's him it wasn't until as we said moments ago that he called her name that she recognized who he was to think about how that Jesus now now through this word the the word that has come to pass he's actually now moving and he gathers together all of those sheep that had been scattered he's bringing them all together now they were so as we said numb and disheartened and downcast and you know what things didn't go as they thought it ought to go but everything was happening just exactly how it ought to be happening and he began to bring them together what was it that was bringing them together it was the fulfillment of that promise of the word that was drawing them together and the whole point was it had to bring them together so that they themselves could receive the promise of the Holy Ghost you see it wasn't just the offering up at Calvary but now through that offering now that life could be poured out upon the other children of God that it would bring sons and daughters of God that had been housed in there you know like seeds that were dead but now that life could come and raise up those sons and daughters of God nothing else could do it except his own life think about it how they were there you know on the day of Pentecost they were all gathered together and Jesus let him know that he said I I will send the promise of my father upon you he let her know that you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is poured out upon you is that right he let him know that he there was there was a declaring there of what would take place and to think about it how that the Church of the Living God in this hour in this time here here would would come forth there on the day of Pentecost and what is just stay with me here just a few moment how the church would come forth there where when he when he arose reading Goethe Caiaphas's he didn't go to the religious people in that hour they had already rejected him but he came and gathered his disciples he did not go to them and say see two canvases on the rest see I'm the one who was you know I see everything is true I'm the one who was he did not go to them because it wouldn't matter they wouldn't believe him anyhow if they wouldn't believe him before they won't believe him now but he goes together those who had believed on him and now he's gathering them unto himself now here will we recognize that within it that when you you consider and think about it that here of the Church of the Living God of how that God himself would give would give there on the day of Pentecost he would actually give the bride there that would come forth from that second atom from the Lord Jesus Christ remember his sign I know I'm going kind of quick but his side was open and when his side was open remember what came out of his side there it was the water it was blood and it was spirit is that right he released what was needed in order to bring you an eye back to his side when he laid Adam down in the beginning there he opened up his side and he took out a reel and he began to multiply on that rib and after there as he multiplied on that rib he separated the spirit there and he left the masculine part there within Adam and brought that feminine part original spirit brought it fair inside of Adam's bride is that right and then he presented Adam with his bride and Adam could say she's bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she's life of my life that was a pre figure of what would take place because of Calvary well that inside of the Lord Jesus there was a great mystery that was a longing there was that of redemption where he had within him his bride that which would be his body that which rid he was come to redeem and on the day of Pentecost here when the Spirit of God is poured out the church itself of the Living God was born there and the day of Pentecost given straight from the hand of God I want to just read this here it was given that last Adam was given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time this was before the Ephesian age ever started she was undefiled she was pure now when I refer to that of the fission Age I'm talking about Gentile Church ages there was a ages of which God would call out a bride but here and Pinnacle's when he poured out of his spirit there and now when we see of how that the bride herself she would come forth it was pure undefiled then there was everything about it for that space I believe about twenty years it was absolutely pure it was a bride age in that hour a time where in that we find the maturity of that life event of that one that had rose on that Easter morning here it was reflected within the bride in that hour perfect reflection they're the same life being made manifest again but then we find as you know as Bible readers you know you find within it that how that when the church entered they're in into the first age of the Gentile ages and I might just drop it like you know when we look at this to find that how God would actually through the Old Testament he spoke about saving the Gentiles he spoke about that through the Book of Isaiah on and on and on and on through all the minor prophets but what was not known was that there was going to be a bride a wife that he would take out of the Gentiles you see that type was hidden there within Joseph when Joseph was put away and rejected of his brethren like that of the Lord Jesus the Bible says he was given a wife a Gentile bride and this is where Paul would pick it up in Ephesians 5 and talk about the mystery of Christ in you that mystery concerning the Gentiles that mystery that was hidden in in God before the foundation of the world and he would call that mystery in Ephesians 5 said I'm speaking of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church so defined that how that then when the church here she comes forth she's pure undefiled but then we understand that you know the Bible is very clear that just as you see those twins that are work down through the ages and down through time we find that that Antichrist spirit was also right there working in the earth think about it it wasn't something way out here they under Christ fear we understand that that ain't something over here in witchcraft that Antichrist spirit is that which will stand right there with the word but it denies the living Lord Jesus Christ it's not anti-world it's Antichrist it'll look at the word but it denies the very power of the Living God who gave the word and to bring it to pass Laura betta God because as long as that word is laying there and how that Satan can keep people away from that word there is all sorts of confusion and muddled up and everybody is left to their own faults about things but when he steps on the scene he who is the word and expressed the word he silences all the other opinions and all the other philosophies and theologies why he declares what he said within his word he makes it alive and makes it real I'll think about this of how that the church when it entered there in that Ephesian age remember it enters in there as a fallen woman the very verse opening part in Revelations to remember from whence thou art fallen I have somewhat against thee see that spirit had already got in there now there was that of the elect that had been that stayed true with the word but remember this church in itself think of how that the Lord Jesus himself he even said concerning his self when he was standing there and the Greeks came to see him in John 12 they wanted to see Jesus we would see Jesus and the disciples brought the Greeks to see him now remember all the Greeks saw was a man oh it's just another man just another gift that's all they saw but you see that to the elect there was something that was beyond that of just another man they recognized sure they seen it was God veiled in humanity but it was something much greater than just just that of a man they recognized this is the very one as the attenion would say you know and and Philip would speak to him this is the one that Moses spoke of this is the one the prophets we're talking about we have found him is that right and it wasn't just them the new that Nicodemus even told the Lord Jesus he said that even those men that were in the Sanhedrin he said they and we know that thou art a teacher come from God we're talking about religious people you couldn't put a finger on their life but yet they themselves they knew he was a man come from God they knew there was something different about his life they knew that there's no way that things could be taken place unless God was with him you know what that means when God is with you his presence is with your life it means that his presence he himself is with you like he would tell Moses like you would tell Gideon and he would tell the different ones down through time and that is a comfort yet to you and I as believers where his presence going with you and I oh my here the church comes in in that time but remember here when we find within the church itself there's got to be there to wear the seed it would actually go into the ground a complete time of darkness to where the seed would actually be buried that life that original life it would go into the ground during the dark ages it would be buried right in the midst of that Fant IRA age but remember when you bury a seed whatever seed you plant you do not plant a tomato seed and expect to get a green pepper whatever seed you plant when it comes into full maturity it will have the same characteristics because the life will bring it forth in that manner so here even though when you look at the beginning who was that crucified him Rome all right put him in a to put a Roman seal upon that - so matter of fact they said make that tomb as sure as you can make it and as sure as they tried to make it but yet you can't you cannot overthrow prophecy because he said he said in the in standing upon the word there of what was already spoken there by the mouth of David that destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again those men were looking at the physical temple that was there but he was speaking of his own body is that right he was speaking of his own body because even when he said except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it died you'd bring it forth much fruit so to see how that you know down through the ages the Bible tells us in Joel chapter 2 verse 25 it speaks of how the working of the enemy little by little to eat away at this tree little by little to eat away at this bribe that was given through the Lord Jesus Christ there at the day of Pentecost but it would eat little by little and the Bible says in Joel 2:25 I'm to restore to you the years now think of it if the word restore is given it declares there's gonna be something that's taken and the only way that it can come back again is there must be one who's able to restore it and when you restore anything you don't mean that it's not partial partial it's not good enough you understand what I'm saying it's like you know I've heard it said before you know different ones that work on you know sometimes they work on cars and you're not I know some brothers that like they like doing that and they like taking you know some older cars and and remaking them you know and going in and you know redoing and they'll have it in their workshop but sometimes when you go to those shows you'll see maybe you know a Ford truck but inside of that Ford truck maybe they couldn't find a Ford engine and so they put maybe a Chevy engine well I know that'd be tough when there they put a Chevy engine in there maybe they were putting you know on the dashboard there you know inside of that Ford truck maybe they would find a dashboard maybe that was you know off of an older Camaro and they would put it in there now no matter how good that truck looks and you could look at it and say my that's a perfectly restored Ford truck it's not restored it's only restored when it has all of the original parts if it has one part that is not original it's not restored and here already what lay within the prophecy I will restore to you the years that the locust Hathi the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great army which I sent among you now the look how that this you know this enemy would work the locust the cankerworm the caterpillar Palma Lord this is all the same bug it's all the same spirit working little by little by little eats it down to a root but remember the life is in the root probably most of you right now I know around my house is you know I look out there looked out this morning when the Sun was coming out I still keep checking on it every day rose bushes and different lilies and things that are coming up right now you know what everything rabbits and other things hate those things down I cut them down at a certain time there you know and late fall or early spring you cut the things down they're cut down to the ground but you know the life itself I thought my perennials now the life is down there in the roots you start letting it warm up and there being a moisture that comes on it you'll start seeing shoots that are coming out of there why the life itself is right there in the roots and though that Satan himself he had off bark he ate off leaves he ate off all of this but he could not get to the roots in the roots is where the life was at in the roots is where and he said I will restore unto you all the year to think of it how that the church would bring under that characteristic of a lion that fed that kingship where the king himself was roaring out of their life where the kingdom of God now had moved within the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost it had moved in there and now how they stand out in that hour they're standing there under that authority but then as time would go on and his Satan would work to find that how that the enemy would work to where it would come to a place where then his his religion he would actually be joined together with the government with politics and they would actually be able to enforce things when stiffer ones did not want to worship the way they wanted to worship i'ma talk about the true church I'm talking about the false church where that spirit came in there and here are uniting and moving there in another ride but notice how the combat is of that spirit that would rise there that would want to you know it came against the Church of the Living God and the think of it that as it came against them this is where we have all of the millions that were martyred down through that time and remember in the Book of Revelations there's a woman that is spoken of in there she is called out about what she is she's a that means she's an unfaithful untrue unclean woman she claims to be the Church of the Living God she claims to be the bride of Jesus Christ but remember when her cover was taken off what was found in her was the blood of the saints come on church I'm talking about that Roman Catholic spirit that spirit of Babylon that what was inside of her she had persecuted it well Lou said it was Satan trying to snuff that life out just like he did when he came against Abel but even though Cain slew Abel there was a Seth that came forth every time that Satan thought he had that light but you see he could only come against the vessel he could kill the vessel when it was time but he could not take away that life because that life it is the spirit of Jesus Christ that was motivating them down through time to fulfill his word you realize that for you and me there's not one thing that can come and take your life unless called first per minute why because our life is being motivated by the Spirit of Jesus Christ you're even motivated by one spirit or another so to think about it how would they combat this this this power that was coming against him through sacrifice here comes forth the characteristic of an ox and they give of their lives they pour their lives out having loved not their lives unto death many of them went there and they stood there and they stood on the testimony of Jesus Christ in their life young people middle-aged people old people everyone all different Sall different classes they stood there but they stood on that testimony of Jesus Christ it was that seed that was going in the ground I want you to think about it the how that God had said I will restore how God would move here if you go with me to revelations chapter 14 and here in them in the Bible when we pick this up here recognizing that God his promise is that he would restore in revelations 14 verse 6 it says and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come and worship Him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water so here it is calling the worship back to the true and living God here is a Ministry notices I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel here is where the message rings back because remember in order to restore that life it's going to grow into the fullness of its power and here we find this ministry that comes forth is that where God would would raise up a man you know there were many men during this time but you know there is a season for this word and this scripture to be fulfilled no doubt Luther had read across the scripture are you with me many had read across that scripture but you know there came a moment there to where that when God would would have Luther to stand still and the inspiration would strike and think about it all his theology and all that he's been taught is that sacrament that those things are the actual elements of the body and of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ but the inspiration here in that moment it strikes Luther and Luther declares their that the just shall live by faith you see there was a message to go forth a message is not something that a man desires to bring it is God's desire and that message that God sends he has someone that's on earth to be able to reflect his desire and take that message and if he's got a message to give he's got a people that will respond to that message there might have been millions no doubt that was that would never have heeded what Luther spoke in that hour but yet there was an intellect group of God that was rising up out of those dark ages that was coming out of the well that model looks like he was just a little shoot it didn't look like the same one that went in the ground but hold on to be continued who was it that taught Luther we said he went to seminary he went the theology they didn't teach him this in a moment's notice the teacher was present the Holy Ghost who is the teacher stood right there and Luther threw that down and said that is not the body of my Lord Jesus Christ that is not the literal blood you realize what that is just a few little words like that can take away the power that God desires to release for your life for them look has all of that think of that church as they continue to put that forth before people what does it do it keeps people in bondage it keeps them in bondage where they're looking to keep coming back and you know confessing their sins let me tell you something there is one who rose from the grave and when he comes and moves into your life you don't have to worry about if I can keep this up if I can do this he comes in your life and delivers you completely who taught Luther the Holy Ghost it was revealed but here the Holy Spirit it was power but that was power to stand there in that hour and proclaimed that word it was the everlasting gospel it was a power of justification whereby that the faith of the people was not resting in a church your faith if your faith rest in this church you got in their own spot come on somebody there's one place where our faith is to rest and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ the just shall live by faith before God can ever do one thing for you and even for what he can continue to do it requires faith it moves on in verse eight and there followed another angel saying notice followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication you see what's happening she is being exposed that's exactly when the Spirit of God begins dealing with the heart in life you know what he's doing he's exposing that hole that's been upon your life what you look at and say I can't do this but if you only realize it's a spirit that's got a hold of your life that's why the drunker can get rid of drink it's a spirit a demon that's got a hold of their life but I'll tell you there's a greater one here right here this morning that even while you're sitting right there he can release that hold from around your life he'll give another thirst another drink in your life it'll inoculate you to where sin itself you will reign over it hallelujah so how do you know I'm a witness I'm a witness who was it you see Wesley Wesley in this hour here's another man no doubt he's right across the scriptures but the inspiration strikes him was it something that he earned in a seminary something he learned in theology no now he met her read it maybe he there would have been some that he heard read it but you see remember when the Lord Jesus spoke to Mary when he called her woman she didn't know him but as soon as the characteristic within the word was spoken Mary her eyes come open and to see how the same spirit of God now coming in more power when move there and Wesley would rise under inspiration and he would proclaim because the Bible points out her fornication it's pointing out there needs to come a cleansing flow a deeper life and just believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but now there is a cleansing power that comes from the blood that's able to release you and set you free this is God's working I will restore to you all the years and to think of this here it comes up a little more here's the same plant it's coming up a little bit more then here under this same characteristic under the wisdom of man the anointing of the Spirit the Holy Spirit would work in that direction and then you had find some saints of God then begin to pray and get together begin to strike their heart because they begin to see an outpouring of the Holy Ghost William Seymour some of the others that that were around some of the sisters and different ones how did they begin to witness the outpouring of the Holy Spirit you see there had been much of this had been spoke about as far as within the word the justification the sanctification but you know now once it come now to where that of Pentecost were the baptism of the Spirit and to where that gifts and healings and miracles were being done you see now there actually was a rumor that comes up and the rumor that comes up is he's alive before that time there was no rumor but now there comes up a rumor he's alive but now when we look at where where it moves to and we see that the promise here of how that there would be a return of light in this hour because remember God he he makes himself known in threes three sevens and so forth but to think that we even within threes of how that godness of perfection and now let's look here in the scripture here just for a moment in Revelations 14 continuing on in verse 9 and the third angel followed them and said with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb and the smoke of their torment ascends it up forever and ever and they have no rest day or night whose imaged the Beast and His image whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus so now here at the ending now we we have that aware the gifts all of that has been restored in that Pentecostal time but at the end of that day at the end of the third day this is where that it's not going to be a rumor but he would actually the Lord Jesus would make himself real to the people that I am indeed alive I'm not just alive I am the same yesterday today and forever he wouldn't let it be known in the same power same maturity I I know things have changed I know as time goes on things change but let me tell you something the power of the Lord Jesus the power of God it does not change it only becomes greater and greater and greater think about how that God would have it to where the prophet in this hour he would stand there and he would take that of Luther and he would type that with the horse and buggy horsepower right then it would move to that of the time of sanctification more horsepower the automobile right there's more power then it would come when there's more power where the gifts would be restored to where there would be an airplane they would be able to get off the ground but they can never escape the atmosphere of the earth is that right but you see God has promised in this day in this hour in his word that there is a rapture where that he himself is coming to take a bride that has been made ready by his life those who have received him have been that he has received them he is coming back in order to take his bride to where he is and it's going to take more power than just airplane power it's going to take more power than just jet fuel it takes rocket fuel it's going to be an astronaut that's able to break the atmospheres of the earth hello and that's exactly what God has done and is doing in this hour you see the power of God that is was released within this hour he will call you in justification he'll sanctify your life and he will fill you with his own life and what he does is not just a trickle but he pours the whole thing out this is the time this is the season of the seal of God the seal could not come in Luthor's day it could not come in Wesley's day it could not be kind could not come at the beginning of this last church age you with me the seal is where there is a finished work a seal expresses ownership a feel expresses security when you're given the seal like when Esther was given the seal as she would ride out what was there and then it would be sealed with the seal of king of Azeroth it had to be done or brother and sister we've not been given a title down through those other down through those other times right there but when the first angel went forth the second angel and forth remember they were still baptizing in titles in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost but he's got a name those are just titles of one person he's not three separate people that's a lot of the devil it's one one person it's God revealed in fatherhood God revealed in Christ and God in you by the Holy Ghost it's the same Lord Jesus Christ Alleluia and that revelation it breaks the hold up loanable lives we're safe in his told those lies it absolutely breaks the seals and the hold around the person's life because why you recognize there is a complete and perfect of told me that it's not three persons not two persons but it is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ he said in his word repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God come down and walk right among us think of how his life was hear his testimony when he would even express labor not in John 6:27 labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father see his name Han come in my father's name his name is his life and his promise and his word is that he would send the Holy Ghost in his name now think of this there would have to be as we were just looking at this here our return a return of what God had delivered there straight from his hand on the day of Pentecost it would have to be a bride that would arise in this hour that would come back to being that true word bride it would be that to where he would call her out of all of the the isms and the darkness and all of the confusion that's been you understand Babylon I know there's visitors and everything here as well but you realize what Babylon is you look the word up it's simple it's confusion think about what we're living in this hour people don't even know what they are and you call that Liberty it is the product of her religion they don't know who they are and look at how that even you know the Pope would stand within this hour let me tell you something it ain't just the Pope but it's also all the daughters that are underneath it where you got men standing in the pulpit that have no business to be standing in the pulpit come on somebody they were not to be a handler of the word they've got all sorts of things that have come in there but the Bible identifies it that she is a cage full of every hateful and unclean bird you listening now look at this here with the third angel the third angel here he's calling don't go into that don't go into those systems no watch out that mark is coming don't go in there receive the seal of God he's calling on that and the same ministry now watch this here in the scripture we'll just see how far the Lord will let us go with this here but in Revelations 18 verse 1 and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory another angel come down from heaven and as he come down he has great power and the earth was lightened with his glory now you know the calibre let's just read this here and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities watch how the brother branham brings us together here I know this familiar ground but in the first seal he says remember them last angels those three angels we just read that the third angel come across and says come out of her my people so he's he's bringing these two together the third angels message he is also one with this message right here when that angel flies at the same time that message drops here for the last trumpet and that last message that last seal opens all happens at the same time and all seals up and goes over into eternity now think of this last things or what we're reading about right here the Bible says as we were reading here that I saw another angel come down from heaven there's already an earthly angel here but this angel comes down from heaven and this one that comes down from heaven having great power this is not just you know horse and buggy power this is not just automobile power this is not just airplane power this is coming with rocket fuel amen this is coming with the full power of God that's able to bring that of the people of God that have been mixed up in this confusion now to think about it when here mixed up in this confusion people have been looking for churches been wondering what's right and here's this ride and do I believe this and which ones right how many different churches are there thousands I lost count but there's got to be one because the Lord Jesus he firmly declared it in the scripture in Matthew 16 that upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it so he himself was declaring he has a church and he's the one that's the builder of it there's not a man that built that church who would it be to God so to think the hound that this angel coming down having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory now when we look at this and to see that that great that great power that's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost here it's he's that light that lightens the earth and what's he doing he being the chief eagle he's calling out all the eaglets come out of her my people you know how it is I mean my wife calls my name I know who called my name when I was younger my daddy would call my name or my mom I knew their voice but you know even in that right there there might have been somebody else who had a similar voice to them but you see this right here it is something that rings so clear and so deep within the heart like it did that day where he the Lord Jesus was standing there and he calls Mary woman but when he says Mary that releases it right there and that's the same way when his voice speaks when the Spirit of Truth its calls out your name it deals with your life in a personal way I don't care how much theology I don't care how much sin I don't care what is trying to wrap you up but when that voice itself speaks to you there is a power in that voice that's able to draw you as you submit to it it'll take you from where you are to where you need to be it will place you in the body of Jesus Christ where he always knew you I wish I had a louder voice it exposes what's going on it lightens the whole earth you know what happens when you light things up you see things you see things that you normally didn't see y'all been walking through the house kids left out toys on the floor you thought you knew where you were going and you step on it you wish at that time boy I wish I had a light just I wish I just cut the light on but you see now here here is the promise within this hour and how that the Scriptures have declared that the coming of the Son of Man I don't have time to read it but the coming of the Son of Man would be as that as the lightning and that of lightning that lighteth the the sky from the east unto the west that's the coming of the Son of Man a man to recognize that in this hour when we think of that in those terms the son of man it's not just coming in a small portion but it is Christ Himself coming in the fullness of his portion the fullness of his life the fullness of his nature why because there is a bride upon the earth there is that which he is coming there to claim as his own and to fake his life with in this hour poured out upon the Church of the Living God to reflect himself the same that he was when he was here as in groom form he now reflects and manifests himself in Bradford the world is headed for a climax everybody senses it that's why the neurotic conditions that's why people are more appeal to get up peel to go to bed peel to live what it is these are conditioned you know the animals know when there's things going on the animals know when there's going to be an earthquake they know how to gather themselves there's certain things when you look at animals you know I hunt a little bit I don't claim to be a great hunter but I know when there's certain pressures coming in and there's a change in air pressure coming and there may be is a change in a weather front I know you get out before the front comes in or you get out as soon as the front is passed why the animals will move you and I don't feel I mean sometimes when you have sinuses you feel different pressure but we don't feel that like they do but they move and they respond upon that I'll tell you a brother and sister that's exactly the way this world is right now it's sense it sits in a nervous condition it's in an erotic state they realize the end is heading up but yet they don't understand they don't know all of these things but to look within this hour that God would illuminate he was sent for the light of his word that you and I might be able to see and listen it is just something that's exclusive if there's something tugging in your heart near this morning you might have looked at churches and everything else but yet there's something that pulls and deals with your heart that there is something more than what I have right now there's more from my life there's great there's something greater than just being a part of a church it's to be one with the Lord Jesus Omaha let me just try to wrap this up here there's no way to move through it all but to think this angel this angel here in Revelations 18 it comes to the earth he comes to bring light and he shines that light around the world it's a mighty angel he comes to proclaim a message he comes to call people out of that condition that condition that we read about we're such confusion not knowing if goddess is a one-two-three but then look at the confusion look at the confusion to where it stands within this hour to where even a man I think it was you know was that Pope Francis said here you know just a even just a few years ago well there's even room in the Church of the Living God for infidels pray theist how in the world do 10 an atheist be in the Church of other than God you see what it is it's about conquering it's about conquering and it conquers all the religions all the religions invites them all in and you know it's the kind of the spirit that moves behind it is that it no matter what kind of life you live but as long you know as you just stayed with the church as long as you just say you know that Jesus is your Savior as long as you just look to the church for your salvation you won the church that died for us then won the church that got up on an Easter morning you see what that lion does it keeps people in bondage amen but the Lord Jesus Christ this great angel the Holy Ghost loosed among the church in this hour it lets you and I know that there is Liberty it reaches out to the heart every Eagle of God that is setting around it reaches out to them that even when they might be in such a low and abound condition but there's something that resonates in there that I know I can be free why because there's a longing if there's a longing to be free there's a place where you can be free that great danger of the Holy Spirit moving throughout this earth and I think of this how that moving in such a manner bringing everything together brother Branham says it like this and I'm closing when this voice that was on the earth when it sounded come out of her when this voice was sounding remember there was a voice that echoed in heaven and that voice echoed in heaven was that a verse for where we had read or bear in Revelations 18 and notice mudram says it like this I love this statement he says this messenger on the earth talking about that earthly messenger was so inclined with God until when he spoke it on the earth God echoed the same thing out of heaven he was so inclined with God to God echoed it in the heaven what a harmony that was there who is it that brought that harmony with the seventh angel the same Holy Spirit that moved upon Luther that moved upon Wesley that moved there for the restoration of the gifts it's the same Holy Spirit moving now in a greater power in a greater measure what's he doing he's bringing all things in life to where the word itself that was expressed this messenger this that was given was so in line to heaven echoed it why because it was not a voice of the earth though that voice is is clothed or or borrowed that of an earthly voice to speak through but it is not the earthly voice that were attached to come on somebody because the earthly voice listen to me the earthly voice is a voice that God's voice the voice of God spoke through is there not and it is that spirit of truth that you and I would be tuned in to because we could hear we could hear a natural voice we could hear it all day long but you know friends if all that you can hear is that of the prophets voice and you cannot hear the same Holy Ghost speaking and dealing with your heart oh my I'm afraid you need to ask God open my ears or because you are the same Lord God you've never we can give never diminish but the word that God has given in this hour that same Holy Ghost is right here among us I think of this a heart I'm just gonna stop at that point but with this the angel of the Lord moving down here we were like Eagles trapped in the barnyard we saw chickens we talked like chickens but you see we had been told about Eagles but we needed something more than just somebody telling us about an eagle we needed to see an eagle seeing what an eagle look like that changes it had been talked about with Eagles but now here comes great momma eagle flying over she flies over the barnyard and she begins to scream out come out of her something grabs ahold of that little Eagles heart he sees that image that living image above him he can't explain it but it's something that just you know it just resonates in here that's what I want to be no doubt his life was full of confusion he could not figure out why did he not get the same joy out of eating bugs and worms that the rest of them did he couldn't figure that out what's wrong with me but in that day when that living image swooped over it took ahold of his life what was it it was that great angel with great power and glory it swooped over there and the darkness that was around about his life then it gained an echo come on I can't yes you can spread your wings but I can't they they told me I can but I'm telling you you can you see they didn't know how to speak to Eagles it took one it was an eagle that knew how to talk to Eagles hallelujah he came there in the barnyard he flew over there he lightened up that barnyard and all of a sudden that little one he just say he made a jump he jumped up on a post but that great Eagle was going on it's a now you're on the post come on now you're not out of there all the way you've got wings that you were born with you did not know those potentials lay there within your life you wondered why you look different why you were strange why you were laughter you wonder what was different about your life I have come to tell you the mystery about your life why you're so different why you're so odd and you know what it is something that is overriding everything that he's ever been taught it is overriding everything that has been crammed into him and telling him you can't do this the days of miracles has passed and all these things it is overriding all those other voices why this is the voice of the one that knew that he was an eagle and when that voice rises there on the scene within a lot it cancels out all the other voices that little Eagle rose up he always was an eagle he always was an eagle and he rises up in that rushing mighty wind he gets them feathers those wings they're probable as a dust storm came in there and that barnyard no don't dummies turn up this dust around here but it's something about it is he's he's getting loose he's recognizing what the voice is telling him it's true he's seeing it in his own life he's looking at my wings look like her wings hallelujah my feet look like her feet come on somebody what's he doing he's seeing the image that is above him and he recognizes that is me that is my mother that's calling me [Applause] that's what God has done and is doing in this hour and then that life moves within you goodbye Barnea heart appreciated to fellowship with the chickens while I was there but good Bob is there maybe for you but it's just not for me I never could digest that stuff but it's something about it that oh my he's got a taste of that fresh meat and as he began to eat that meat that meat that was coming down it was spiritual food that was in due season it was actually giving him strength to be able to spread his wings he was receiving divine energy how was he getting that divine energy from the great power that was being released hallelujah he was receiving energy to wear that he could have a lift off let me tell you brother and sister that's exactly what God has done in our lives you and I Hey the messenger came in line you and I were out of line you and I were out of line but the angel of the Lord came and sought us out he came and sought us out and dealt with our hearts I would say it like this this morning and I'm closing there's just no way to cover all that but I would say it this I would say this morning this is God's desire for each and every one of us this is this is God's heart for every one of us to wear that same power is working moving within our lives lifting us it lifts you out of sin it lifts you out of holes upon your life you might be sitting here this morning in your life you think what in the world would he even want to do with me hey listen he looks beyond all your problems and all of your bondage that you're in right now and he's the one to set you free no matter what that need is within your life he's the same yesterday today and forever if you don't know him this morning you can know him you can know him not just to believe on him but you can know him in the cleansing power and in the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost where it changes your life completely he's the same yesterday today and forever and I say what an Easter that was but what an Easter this is what an Easter this is it's not history it's present reality [Applause] let's pray Lord Jesus lord you're the one Lord in your great mercy you give understanding to our lives Lord no doubt here this morning perhaps Lord there are things that maybe Lord that was spoken or ministered and Lord maybe lord i understanding would not be bored the same lord i pray may there not be one heart that god would have failed to recognize your presence and you speak or Jesus it's not that we have to understand everything Lourdes what was spoke this morning you would speak to us to help us see what God what you've done in the south what you're doing in this hour or Jesus I pray Heavenly Father if there's one Lord that's here this morning maybe they're not even a visitor maybe it's just one Lord God that in their heart what you're calling too Lord Jesus their desire is that Lord God that same power when moved in their life they want to be lifted from the things of this world they want to be changed or
