[Music] [Music] hey aren't you glad we're gonna let you have your seats here this morning a man just want to certainly greet you in the name of the Lord and so good to be in the house of the Lord with each and every one this morning and so thankful that God has provided for us that we can be here and a reminder I think they mentioned the fellowship dinner here willing right after the service at the North ins Depot and we certainly would love to see everybody there I know it's a sacrifice and it's a sacrifice for everybody but it's just so nice to be able to have a a time where you can sit down and have a meal together and believe it or not the food is not really what I go there for I know I've made different requests from certain ones of you but that's really not live and go there sometimes the the real purpose of it I I like being able to be with the people being able to shake your hand some of you I don't get a chance to talk to you and I you know and be able to spend a little bit of time with you and and the people all together to be able to fellowship with one another I think that's wonderful don't you and I think that's very it's very important the Bible would say when we look at the book of Acts when when the Holy Ghost came among them the Bible would speak of how that they were so moved by the Spirit of God to wear that the things that they did they moved in such unity and harmony to where the Bible says they sold what they had and they distributed it and they had everything in common now and this is what I believe if the Word of God has been restored in this hour to restore us back to that point then these are also the things that brings us back to there's nothing that can bring unity among the people of God like the revelation of Jesus Christ among his people matter of fact this testimony is over and over in the scriptures but I love it and believe it's in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 37 where it speaks of how that God would take the house of Israel that is divided and he said take two sticks and you make them one stick how in the world can you take two sticks or make them one well the same God who said these two shall be one is the same God who does that by the unity of the Holy Spirit coming through his word it's more than what our minds can conceive but I'm so thankful that we have the experience of what it means to be united with God amen and that that love within our hearts it just longs to be where other believers are at to be in fellowship with one another I have a little something that as I'd like to do here this morning I'd like to ask brother Bill and sister Mary to come forward and there's some things that I want to be able to express they are not expecting this and they get on me afterwards it'll be worth it it'll be worth the whippin but I want to do this for all of their labor of love and their sacrifice and and I'm not going to start talking till they get up here but how many just appreciate brother Benno's sister Mary well we want I want to just start in in this year and say like this I feel very much there's more that could be said than what I will say but the thing that I would like to do here this morning is I'd like to celebrate their sacrifice their labor of love where they have and they continue to serve the body of Jesus Christ the scripture says for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister most of us are aware of brother Bill and sister Mary being an instrumental part of this assembly you see him at every event you see him in every service it doesn't matter if it's midweek prayer meeting whatever service it is you see him there we you know we've seen brother bill as he continues to faithfully lead song services and in the early years you know many things that some may not know but for the bill he led in song service in the midweek without any instruments whatsoever so you know that well I could say a lot about that with the musicians right now but he stood and he led within that time and those were in the early years and brother bill would have to you know at times as a song leader there's things that brother Bill had to do that some of our song leaders now have never been faced with where brother bill had to tell people who stood up and thought they had a word for the church sit down and brother bill would have to you know also encourage the he would encourage the people brother bill was always one and you all know these two words that he would say over and over what are those two words go forward and those are things that brother bill would mention and he still mentions here in into this time and we so appreciate brother bill in in leading the songs throughout all the time and as he continues they've been responsible for setting up fellowship dates securing the NORs ins depot a various other used for the fellowship of the Saints since the inception of the church in 1982 they were the ones that responsible for setting up those things whether it was out at new hollow or where if it Rover it might be and now I'm not going to ask the question every one of us have enjoyed it but I feel like that this right here sometimes things take place and we don't know how they take place and and I believe that that's that's important that we would celebrate this you know when we look at it the church even in its early beginnings in the year of 1982 they were one of the first homes among other believers that opened their home for Friday evening tape services and a fellowship gathering for the believers and many of the new converts when we rented the building of the YMCA over there off of Tower Boulevard here in Lorraine and then later moving to the wings of faith it was even within that they faithfully came in with their family very early to set up the church to make sure that everything was ready for each service now if I remind I look at this right here but Marlena I think is a year younger than me or something is that right sister Mary okay so so Marlena was a six year old little girl I would have been a seven year old little boy and brother Dylan sister Mary had had had had three other teenage boys angel Willie and Leo let me tell you something when they would come in now you say how do you know this well because sometimes I stayed a week with them and when when they went when brother bill went to church let me just tell you something Wednesday church started at seven but we got there to the building at like five o'clock let me just tell you this when there were times when right over here that I would drive straight from work and I would come in right over here and come in on a midweek service I'd get here many times at about 3:30 or quarter to 4 by 4:30 brother bill was already here for a midweek service not just brother bill but sister Mary also both of them were together and I and I I look at this year they came in and they would come in early to make sure the church was set up to make sure everything was ready for each service don't you appreciate things being ready appreciate that and as the Lord blessed the assembly here with a building where we started to come here and meet in July of 97 and then finalizing everything with this with with with the bank in November of 97 they would continue to arrive here early to open the doors of the church and they would ensure that the temperatures were fit for service there's some of them are laughing to kind of know some of the behind on that right there they would they would as a team let me say this they would as a team clean the bathrooms and sweep the floors dust the pews and gather the trash all this was done for 22 years at this building this was done so that by the time the saints of God would begin to come together to worship we could walk in and be able to sit down and make ready for service I'll tell you I don't want you to clap right now where I got more to go but I also appreciate that now I've talked about brother Bill now I won't talk about sister Mary so in this time I guess it's appropriate that I'm talking behind her back right now sister Mary and I have made this known over and over to brother Bill and send it to others sister Mary is truly gifted in her life not just with little children I mean the little children love sister Mary they don't like sister Mary well you might need help sister Mary has truly gifted in her life to organize the various events such as the marriage banquets we've had in the past she had she would had help with she would help she would receive help from those who worked with her but she truly would take the idea and the theme and put it forth an action I remember the first time when the Lord laid on my heart to have a marriage banquet sister Marian said brother Samuel all you have to be responsible for is you pray and find out who God would have come speak for us we've got the rest of it covered and it would order those things and you know sister Mary is a very crafty and honest that that's not a right right word to say here and very we're able to work with crafts well because I don't want to use word you understand what I mean that she can sister Mary can take two ribbons and make a bouquet of flowers out of it is that right amen now you know in one particular vent and I'm gonna say this in one particular vent I've said this one many times but it was a wedding that I had just performed and you know we had performed it and you know here sister Mary she went to the reception as one of the guests of the of the wedding and everyone began to arrive and as everybody begin to arrive it was soon evident that there was no organization and there was at least 200 or more people at this event now I'm gonna call the name because I remember it very well but but here it was because I performed the wedding here it was 200 guests or more and and and they needed to be served and fed and I witness sister Mary walk into the kitchen and those of you worked in the kitchen sister maid you know how she did took the shoes off and she started walking in the kitchen and when she took the shoes off she meant business things are gonna come in order in that in that kitchen amen so I witnessed her walk in that kitchen and she began to give direction where there was chaos after a short period of time tables were organized to place the food on an orderly flow established for the guests to obtain their food as well as for the helpers to replenish the food on the line with a clear direction and flow from and returning to their seats now you can look at that and say that's amazing that's what I thought I sit there in the midst of time and I thought I don't know what's gonna happen here in this situation I was only to perform the wedding I didn't I didn't know about anything else I thought this is already but it was amazing when I seen that and then once everybody was done Sister Mary she picked up you know her items and for her I don't even believe she ate that time I watched brother Bill and her went ahead and left and they went on out without anything being said at all but I think I'm so thankful for that because what we do for the Lord and what brother bill sister may have always represented they have never done it for any acknowledgement or done it for anything at all they've just done it as unto the Lord at the beginning of the special meetings that we would have here in May a few years ago sister Mary would be very instrumental in establishing a menu for the event that way we didn't have a little little bits and pieces brought of food and you run out we had a menu to where we could be able to serve people that were even coming in not only our own but people who are visiting for these special services brother bill would assemble in though with those events brother bill would assemble a crew of brothers to help prepare the venue many times they had to go in and prepare it before we could ever go in there and as well as those that would help to make sure it was cleaned with the gold or the bill would always strive with this the goal let's leave it better than how we found it and this is the thing that you other other parts of it I maybe appreciate when we we go to the Fellowship's and the depot appreciate ya I really do but along with this brother Bill's sister Mary would organize the utensils and the supplies that would be needed to have a fellowship dinner you know fried chickens alright to eat with your fingers but I don't want to eat rice with my fingers I said alright you got to have plates for the food and you've got to have serving I don't want people just reaching in with their fingers and getting everything and so forth you know the same we ought to be able to chew h1 or bubble gum you pray for me because I ain't there yet they would they would they would need to do that the large yellow tubs now I don't know if you've seen them or not but these tubs are big the large yellow tubs that we would see and many of us would help to pack them back into their van along with many of their supplies for the fellowship dinners they would transport to their home after them after it was over they would go in the van and many of us maybe had helped them put him in the van but remember when they got there they took him out of the van they got everything set up then they would take him home and after they would take them home they would thoroughly clean them because singham off just didn't good enough you have to thoroughly clean them and dry and organize the utensils and they would make sure that the supplies such as plates silverware napkins cups and coffee were ready for the next fellowship dinner then they would transport the yellow tubs from their home and other supplies and they would put them right back there in that closet and make ready for the next fellowship dinner now I've got a few scriptures here this is not what I'm preaching by the way but this is like a few scriptures here Paul would write to the Saints in first Corinthians 16 15 and say I beseech you brethren you know the house of stephanas and it is the firstfruits of acacia and they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints that's powerful they addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints eternal life is living for others Romans 16:1 all not Paul Paul you know but this was meant necessary Paul would write of this over and over in the scriptures Paul would write at 6 in Romans 16:1 Phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is in Orencia that ye receive her in the lord has becometh Saints that he assists her in whatsoever business she hath need of youth for she has been a helper of many and of myself also and I thought about this this portion in the scripture here and it's throughout in every letter that Paul would write and I think it's fitting for brother bill and sister Mary when Paul would write here in verse 3 of Romans 16 and it's other places in the scripture well greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in Jesus Christ and Paul would write in another place in 1st Corinthians 16 he would write to other churches to think about this what it would mean to the churches when Paul would write and greetings from these people too Paul would write the churches of LA and Asia salute you Aquila and Priscilla salutes you much in the Lord I'll tell you what when brother Bill and sister Mary send their greetings it means a lot I'll tell you what means a lot because of the life that they live and continue to live it means a lot when you'd see him at different events when things would take place I think of when you know we had different needs we're different ones that passed on they were right there for that and I thought of this sister Mary in Romans 16 6 Paul in that same greeting he said greet Mary who bestowed much labor on us when sister Bruce was there in the interview with brother Branham I always loved this statement sister Bruce you know she was she was concerned that she might be passing on here brother Branham you know among that and we know the other question she had but brother Branham would would say concerning sister Bruce he says sister Bruce I've prayed constantly that God wouldn't let you die because you're a value to the church that's what I want to be said about me that's what can be said about brother Bill sister Mary you're a value to this church for the bama dawn and the like and sister Bruce in the same interview he said she is like sister she is like Dorcas of old how that she'd been such a blessing and he says Lord and brother ben goes in to pray for her and he's asking god to heal her in a condition in her body he says for we need her in the service Lord and you know you might you know look within this brother bill and sister Mary they've come to you know they had expressed and some time ago about wanting to make you know a transition because it's it's what I've mentioned to you with the tubs and things like that that in itself has been very it's been very hard and has time and things has went on and so they've made a transition within that you know brother bill was was praying about it and we really hadn't talked about it but then when we came together brother bill already had somebody on his heart that he had been praying about for months I had the same one but I asked him who it was first and so we like to I'm thankful brother Aaron and sister Amanda they have stepped up to take on that responsibility so I played golf today and now as some tokens of our appreciation for all that sister Mary and brother bill all that you've done for the assembly as well as countless others brother bill in foreign fields for the bill has been one that many times with knowing what's going on in the foreign fields as far as this offering this needs needs to be taken brother Bill of times if you don't see brother being homeless Sunday if you don't see brother bill on a Sunday I'll tell you what he's doing he's in the house of God somewhere yeah he would be interpreting many times and even here this past year he went and when I found out he was going different places to interpret I asked him I said who's driving with you now the roles have kind of turned here I am a 44 year old boy speaking to you know one of my older sister who's driving you you make sure you got somebody to go with you you take some of these brothers with you you let them drive you and then when they want it to do you know take them then yeah they want him to do a morning service then interpret for an evening I said don't you force and Lenny by force you to to do to services in one day now these are tokens of our appreciation here and gratitude for your dedication to the service of the Lord in his people truly what you have done has been a rule sacrifice through the years and what an example that is set for us as children of God that would so challenge our lives indeed these have been and are still pillars of this assembly that are a blessing to us thank you for your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister amen god bless you all you know how I feel about you I hug you mom dad I love you all we love you brother Bill sister Mary we so appreciate you [Music] amen could we just could we just pray and just offer to the Lord just a prayer of thanksgiving this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I thank you dear God for your mercy and grace thank you Lord for brother bill and sister Mary Lord it's been things upon my heart Lord just to be able to to recognize Lord they never would want this they've always been behind Lord behind the scenes but Lord we want to say thank you for the burden that's been on their hearts because I know many times they didn't feel like doing it but they did it because it was a burden for your people and I thank you for that Lord what an example what a challenge it is to all of our lives might included Lord and how we thank you Lord God for brother bill and sister Mary thank you Lord for the strength the health that you've given them in Lord we pray Lord God as brother bill would say many times go forward Lord that's the same thing here this morning the Lord O God that they would continue Lord just as you continue to give them health and strength in their body Lord to know that God even in this Lord the continuing days as we are looking for your coming Lord to know that God that that gift that even when lay-in sister Mary's life Lord God of the so many times of organizing things that still lays there Lord and father it'll still be a blessing to us Lord and father we thank you for a brother bill thank you lord old God for our brother Lord who stood there Lord at the door to encourage the people to check on the people to call the people Lord O God I thank you for that Lord we just love you so much Lord we appreciate Lord the lives of our brother and sister thank you Father thank you for brother bill sister Mary we love in appreciate Jesus and I'd say probably even today is we have the fellowship dinner and then even throughout it you know to be able to just express your thanks to them just how much you appreciate them and loved it let's let's look in the Word of God this morning I want to look here in a place in the word in numbers 15 and we'll just see how the Lord would help us this morning some things we want to just begin to look at and I have kind of a lengthy reading of Scripture but I think I'll just read a few portions a few passages of it and then I'll let you two be seated and what can keep on reading after that but in numbers 15 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you become into the land of your habitations which I give unto you and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a free will offering or in your solemn feast to make a sweet savour unto the Lord of the herd or of the flock that he that offers his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of the hymn of oil and the fourth part of a hen of wine or a drink offering shall prepare with burnt offering or sacrifice for one land may God bless you as you're being seated bless his word maybe for sake of time you could read this when you get home because there's no way that I'm gonna be able to probably even touch a part of it we'll see if I can get to where we even this morning but where where Moses goes down through here is notice the the the statement when you become into the land in verse 2 of your habitations which I given to you and you make a fire and make an offering by fire unto the Lord and it goes through of the of the different offerings the burnt offering the peace offering and the freewill offering because when we when we look at all this in verse 13 he lays everything that is to go with it how you to offer them meat offering with it the oil that is to go with it the wine that's to go with it and all of the the necessary proportions of which you're to make that offering and we we understand that every one of these parts it speaks of Jesus Christ every one of these parts within an offering and verse 13 is where I'd like to draw your attention of the same chapter and all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner in and offering and offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord and if a stranger is sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord as you do so so he shall do now I want you to notice how this is expressed regarding these offerings that would to offer these offerings with a fire and they are a sweet savour unto the Lord verse 15 would go on to say this is looking at this one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that's sojourneth with you and ordinance forever in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the Lord so God is letting them know that these these outlines of had the offerings that are to be made when you come into the land of the have your habitations that I bring you into that this same thing applies to you as well as to the stranger and in other words God said I'm not going to have a different word for you then I'm going to have for the stranger you see God is making known here even the hidden mystery of the Gentiles because it's not a different word for the Gentiles it's the fulfillment of that same word of promise and so in verse 16 he would go on to say one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you now when you look at this portion of Scripture you-you-you remember the the chapter right before this is the chapter where that we've seen in that chapter and the ones before that is where you had the supplies were sent out into the land to spout the land to see if it be a good land there was no question it was a good land but there were ten spies who brought back an evil report and there were two that brought back a good report they they said God is for us and and the Lord will be these enemies will be bread for us and here they stood in the midst of this time and then in the beginning of this chapter in verse 15 you find that God would take the direction and from from chapter 14 where he has pardoned according to the intercessory Word Spirit of Christ in Moses he has pardoned and then God here remember he removes those men who brought up the evil report God removes them right away and then there's others that have joined along with and God lets them know that you're not going to come into the land but I'm gonna bring your children into the land and so when we see all of this when we look at how that God would move here in the very beginning verses of the scripture and this chapter it is very evident that it is the Lord declaring that he is and will fulfill his word and he's going to continue to fulfill his word through his children that believe him because he looks upon his children like II looked upon Caleb he said Caleb my servant had another spirit he had followed me fully and to him will I bring into this land and this is where Paul would say in Romans three three four what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect god forbid yay let God be true and every man alive as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged now I want to speak to you on here is the offerings in the land of our habitation and when we look at these offerings that are mentioned here in numbers 15 and we think about the last few verses that there's not a separate statutes and ordinance for those who are born in the congregation and then those who are strangers but it is for the same the statute is the same in the ordinance that are the same so as these offerings were given in tight to Israel they are given to us through the anti-type the Lord Jesus Christ himself and so when we look at this let's move over to Isaiah 56 verse 1 and we find here coming into this verse of scripture is prophecy that is being worked out and yet is to be worked out even towards Israel thus saith the Lord keep a judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that lays hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil verse 3 neither let the son of the stranger that had joined himself to the Lord speak saying the Lord had utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold I'm a dry tree for thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my Sabbath's and choose the things that pleased me and take hold of my covenant even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place a name better than of sons and daughters I will give them an everlasting name that they shall not be cut off let me just tell you right now we have been given his name we have been given his name in a marriage ceremony we have been brought into the land of habitations this land called Beulah this land of the invincible Union this land of uniting time inside we have come into our land of promise where this land can no longer be called hepzibah or for Satan but this land is called buta for envy the Lord the light of his we are given this place as his pride it's the hidden choosing of Almighty God what Israel has their place as his servants and we all are to be servants of the Most High God is that right but the Bible would recall it and it would refer to Israel's two servants those who are right there you know has attendants that are present and would say in revelation 7:3 hurt not the earth hurt not the trees hurt not these things until my servants have been sealed in their forehead so God has not forgotten Israel in verse 6 also the sons of the stranger that joined themselves to the Lord to serve Him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will not bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer hallelujah their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar notice their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar how shall we know what is acceptable God makes no the acceptable way and the acceptable sacrifices it is God's desire at work that we would be in fellowship with him and we would dwell in the walls hallelujah inside of the house of prayer inside of the tabernacle of the Most High God that we would glare inside of Jesus Christ it is God's provision even then will I bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people the Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith yet will I gather others to him besides those that are gathered unto Him I'm looking at the work of the Lord gathering his children unto himself in Malachi chapter one here God would speak to that of Israel remember they were offering offerings but they didn't care of how their offerings were being offered up they were offering offerings that had were MAME lame and blind and halt and and here God told him through the book of Malachi he said you go take what you're offering here and you go try to offer that to your boss I mean go try to offer that to the to the person in your city he let him know if you can bring things and offer greater things to your boss then you can to me I will not accept a sacrifice that is less than first place are you with me now notice how God would come here in Malachi 1 verse 10 who is there even among you that would shut the doors for not neither do you Kindle Fire a milder for not I have no pleasure in you saith the Lord of hosts neither will I'd accept an offering at your hand for from the rising of the Sun this is talking about us for from the rising of the Sun even until the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and his name is reputation cuddle somebody hallelujah when that one Simon would hear the woman came into Simon's house she was a prostitute and everything about her life she came into his house and Simon in them dispatched her but it was there it was in cases like that that his name is made it was in situations like that that his name is made here his name among us as heathen who were found we had no promise as Paul said we weren't even among the Commonwealth of Israel we have we were strangers to the covenants but through him by the blood of Christ we have been made not [Applause] hallelujah as Rahab was brought in as Ruth was brought in as the daughters of salafi had were brought in shall pass Christ brought us to the Covenant and the Commonwealth of Israel Christ has brought us you by what by as Union Oh glory my name is great hallelujah Paul would write in Romans 15 15 nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of God that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Ghost amen so here we understand that how that that the church started there on the day of Pentecost and perhaps there might be some in your mind and maybe even whether you're new or whether you're not why do we when we talk about the term message it's not something outside of the Bible but when we talk about the term message we're talking about the promises that God made in his word for this generation we recognize this the promises of God - to you and I for this generation this is not just another age going by but we are here in the time where God is fulfilling not just one promise but God is in in now to fulfill every promise that he has made where all of them down through time have looked forward to the fulfillment in the sound here God on the day of Pentecost remember God started that church he poured out of his life of himself then the church age hadn't even started yet and here we find that God he had so moved and poured himself into the body of believers he it was the revealing of the son of man in the body of believers in that hour they didn't just have a little portion but brother they had the fullness of his spirit living through their lives is that right so much so that when Paul remember what's coming against him remember when Paul was on his road to arrest some more here that same angel of light the angel the Lord the same angel that met Moses the same angel that was sent to John there in Revelations one that same angel that came to the Prophet that same angel that's not here that same Matty angel that same Lord that then moving among the people it was the same lowered and how that God would move down through his word and there was a people who were moved there by the holy ghost where where Christ himself was living fully through their life to where on the road there to Damascus remember when Paul saw that life brother the Bible is clear that that light it out shone the brilliancy of the Sun you know why because that was the very one dwelling in that light that had made the SU n it was right there are you with me now and Paul asked here in Paul Paul knowing that when this happens God's going to reveal his name who are you lord he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors as L write the body of Jesus was already seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high that ain't talking about God's got a right hand in the Sun setting on it we recognize better than that the Bible said there was one who sat on the throne we don't accept those Trinitarian doctrines that want to beat the people of God down and take from the people their inheritance and their liberty we don't accept that remember the prophet saw that Trinitarian doctrine he said it was a three-cornered stick and it was beaten that woman down but brother let me tell you something when the rod of God has come with the power of the deity of Jesus Christ it will beat her down it lifts her up in rapture embrace it brings her in position and judgment is measured to live the bondage the oppression the darkness that she's under that she might rise in the newness of life Pentecost I'm talking about not a Zuza street thank God for what he did there but that was not the promise restoration are you with me the promise restoration was not the gifts the promise restoration was that the word would return but gifts were to bring the people to a place to recognize that he steal the supernatural listen God is that right gifts are not toys to be played with like we saw here on Thursday night God sat down God used the gift God use the gift part ain't need are you with me they're not toys they're not things that I've got to have this in the service no no we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst gifts are just like the pots and pans in your house you don't need the same pot to make your grilled cheese that you need to be able this pan over here but when you need to make spaghetti you need that pot is that right we believe it and brother let me tell you something Myles you can tell by looking at me pots and pans are readily available and sohave Ulster will hurt my feelings a bit at all I've already got my sweetheart [Laughter] will hurt my feelings a bit no sure you can tell that we've got plenty you can tell that they are available you can tell that sister Kim is not just you know well we don't have anything we don't have anything to cook cook the food in you can tell by looking at me I'm eating pretty well you can tell that there are pots when she needs a pot to mentor correct to cook up the potatoes it's there when she needs the saucepan for the grain we better get off this it's there that's the same way that dips are in the body they are there for the Lord to use in his body hallelu for what purpose the edification of the body now to return back to that place of Pentecost as it was in act coming out of the Upper Room and acts acts 2 remember Israel went out of this land they were taken out of this land because they begin to get careless about the things of God that begins did you know well or the sera sera things just became casual like well you know then the Lord just loves me and God just understands about my needs and the Lord knows why then they just begin to become relaxed about all of their life they didn't even they didn't care and how did sin begin to come into their life and so God gave them over to a bondage but here they are in Babylon under bondage and then God here after 70 years would bring them back in the land but while they were away the land set dormant the land just set dormant in the land now why won't you understand this God could have had it that the land would go on but God was letting it be known that you are part of this word he's letting Israel know I don't got the land just for me the land is for you this is for you so God will bring them back in the land and even in God bringing them back in the land would be a type of the Church of the Living God in the end time where there would be a revealing of a son of man there would be a returning back to the same original power and glory of Pentecost are you with me now and God would also make it known in the Book of Jeremiah even through they return back the first time God would also let it be known this is how I'm gonna bring Israel back into their land I'm gonna bring them back home I'm gonna get him in a place and get him ready for my coming amen we know a lot of that part I just said the last part he's after the bride he's taken in a rapture once it's finished here with the Gentiles it turns to the Jews and those true witnesses take her and begin to preach the message of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they begin to preach there of the true atonement and I'm telling you under their ministry there is a hundred twenty-four thousand that are sealed with the same Holy Ghost that you have been sealed for and you know what it does he had made some ready for his corporal visitation because at that time God said there'll be a fountain Oakland in the house of evening for all that is unclean they shall be made clean I'm telling you right now the fountain is in the house of David for us as the Gentiles that we can be made clean amen wash from all the filth oh my it's a return back to the land of Pentecost where Christ is dwelling fully in the body believers as sons and daughters of God God let it be known here in Jeremiah 33 verse 10 thus saith the Lord again there shall be heard in this place talking about the land which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beasts even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabited and without beasts the voice of joy and the voice of gladness and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of Hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endures forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord for our calls to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the Lord and the lujah now here we're brought into that place as sons and daughters of God first John chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God we were strangers but remember everything I've read that could read a whole lot more within it but just reading what he's inspired for this service it was laying there in the Old Testament the whole time that God was going to visit the Gentiles so I think the only thing you can do yeah the best thing is accepted and then do what Paul said in Romans 16 or Romans 15 he said praise the Lord you Gentiles with his people praise the Lord for what he has done you know what you know why you can praise because you've been born out the Lion of the tribe of Judah and Judah means praise you have been born of the phrase of Almighty God there is no praise in ourselves that is worthy but the praise that we bring is the praise of his own life and his ala knows I wish us twice as big I could shout twice as loud hallelu prayer repeat of God hallelujah behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because they knew him not you see what are you what church you go well organization I'm Blanco organization I'm a son of God either what what you want one you're asking me what this is part of our pure language you're asking me what what's the son of God this is language that belongs to us as the Hebrews of God this is language that belongs to us language that was lost among the Church of the Living God you know how was lost he was lost in a manner as though well if you pray hard enough and if you do this enough and you do this enough then you know you'll be a son and our God you are always a silent dollar bond it's not what you did you could make yourself worthy he has made us we have been accepted in the beloved blob once yes we have been baptized into one body and that is the all sufficient sacrifice it is our Passover Billa beloved now somebody say now are we the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure did you catch this every man that hath this hope this expectation in him purifies himself even as he is pure that word purify it means to make pure to cleanse to offer to burn as a sacrifice now let me just drop this in yonkers I'm not going to read it but you can read it when you get home in another part of the scripture here in numbers 15 verse 22 through 36 the Lord God comes down right after these verses Scripture we read he makes a distinction so that Israel will know that there is a difference between sin that is in ignorance ignorance by the congregation ignorance by the individual it's different than someone who would that Bible use that they use the term presumptuously or rather they despising li I like the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath that he knew better but he went ahead and did it anyhow what did he do he despised the law of Moses and God let it be known for ignorance there's a sacrifice come on somebody but for somebody who's just walking around and I don't care yeah I know what Moses said yeah I know what brother Graham said yeah I know what the scripture said and don't care about it that ain't ignorance hello somebody because there is mercy for ignorance the Bible says in the book of Hebrews that he ever liveth to make intercession on behalf of our ignorance seeing those who are out of the way is that right so you see it's different God listen me now God is letting them know you think well why in the world why wouldn't God put this at the beginning of the chapter of numbers 15 that's a good question it's because when they come into the land this is the land of fighting it's a land of battles let me just put it like this as a prophet would say you can look it up on your own because I'm not going to read all the quotes to you it's a land field there's all traps all around you but we're not focused on the traps the Devils got traps all around to try to beset us is that right now but though the banner would tie it up like this and say and bring it to you and I just among many of the places throughout the message he would let us know you've got to repent and die daily to live in Jesus Christ every day you've got to die every day to live in Christ Jesus and you know brother Graham would go into you know letting it be known how that you know just a little joke is told in brother Graham would talk about right here he said you know I would tell it was joke but what he's saying is he said you'd better watch it he said because after a while he said it believes for another joke another joke another joke another joke - we're all that person is is nothing but jokes come on friends there there's times there's certain times I'm not going to go through all this there's a whole separate message on all this right here because I know you've got people say oh they'll take this to a certain place in a certain limit then you've got other people who will take it to another place and because he you know brother Brandon would have people tell him jokes woman you know he's out haunting the things like yeah they just feel like if they need to live their life like that the whole time that is error that is you are misusing examples that's been given to you but hopefully by the grace of God if you've been guilty of that you won't be guilty of it after today you'll be able to say lord help me but the RAM says but if you don't watch look at the words he uses if you don't watch so we have to watch you know David will talk about set watches upon my mouth is that right set watches upon my mouth and brother Dan would talk about you know he says and the next thing he says just he said shun that thing stay away from that then brother Ram would bring it on down he said you know he said there could be somebody come along and he says you know somebody could say how did you hear about mrs. Dolan and you know and her husband and I'll tell you what you know this deacon bill ref says here to say I don't want to hear it and just walk on what my ears are not trashcans my life is not a trash bin it's a temple of the holy ghost who said you know what I got to say is true but is it edifying and doesn't minister grace to the here I don't want to hear it and just walk home but the bread says after a while they'll cut it out you see what you're doing you doing what the Bible says provoke one another unto love and good works so I'm brother ramesses the way that you fulfilled that scripture you get around somebody it talks about somebody negative you say something good about that person in that presence of that individual are you with me so blood Ram comes along here he said you know that somebody else will say you know brother let me tell you what happened I think they should get rid of this preacher I think you should do that prevents this shun that thing and then he says you know he said I've seen a little thing of three little monkey monkeys you know three little monkeys or the bill got me one of those things for my office before one's got their fingers in their ears one's got it upon their eyes and one's got well maybe for some it's good using two hands everywhere else remember brother Brent says I think that's a good thing hear no evil speak no evil see no evil you just keep your mind on Christ and look this is very good admonition he says now he says now you're never gonna be able just to say said you've got to watch this you're never gonna get to a place you said if you keep on thinking that well that your being you'll live see you can't live so perfect to you don't make a mistake now he's not talking about willful sinner that ain't mistakes you can't live so perfect til you don't make that mistake now now don't you think you'll ever get that way coz you won't no sir you're not sinless but you'll say you'll certainly get off the track if you go in that way but what a soldier how many soldiers we got here now put your hands down for a nail we got any cowards here so brother Ram would use those two terms to describe it over and over the real soldier when he's knocked down gets backed up again but he said a coward when the cowards knocked down he crows up back into the water come on somebody soldiers get back up again nobody raised their hand I ain't preaching the cowards I'm preaching the soldiers the graham said you get around some man says that example you get around somebody doing that he says you know he says just shun them now he says and then he goes he says don't shut him but mark her may knows the Bible says mark those are called divisions among you how many knows that's the truth I know a lot of times we don't believe those scriptures anymore - somehow or another those things are taken out of context or as far as where people look at it and they have so projected the love of God - the love of God as nothing but sappy but honey but God's own character is never classified as honey God will never he told them in Leviticus don't you ever offer anything with honey come on somebody there's a part within it we can't go into that this morning but you notice that within this very thing notice what brother Bram is saying over and over this really struck me in this quote he says here they would say you know he is saying these things he said but don't shun them just mark them so how do you mark somebody how do you mark somebody this is the examples don't pay any attention cause you see what it leads to he says when they say mmm he said just read them say hey how you doing - then keep on going there's some people you greet and got to keep on going well hallelujah his life in us it is the oil of that dove life that comes forth it brings conviction in our lives and once you think of this the closer what we just read right here that just referring to those passages of scriptures in verse 22 through verses 26 36 I do not want that to be the focus of our life we tell my brother Samuel I don't want I don't want it to be a continuum of the focus to be a continual sin offering and a trespass offering thank God for the advocate but we are called to live as overcomers come on somebody how am I going to have to repent daily you have to repent and die daily why the closer we live in him the more we see of our humanity and the distress of ourselves so much that Paul could say I have no confidence in this flesh it's to live closer to him to where the dells is not grieved that's the goal of our lives not where he can be grieved and he'll come back on the trailer got now that's not the focus the focus is I want to live we'll stay here tonight know if there's a nice little thing that bothers him Wow I don't want to displease him but I want to serve his purpose I don't want to just be known as a sin offering and a trespass offering Christian I want to be known as a Thanksgiving offering a peace offering a burnt offering I want to offer some offerings that are sweet savor in his nostrils brother ramen Emma and a message he said shun the thing I think that's so important shun the thing not the person the only time we're - um the person is if the blood has been loosed from their life then we're to have no fellowship that's the scripture but but notice the offerings that are mentioned in numbers 15 these are offerings than were given in type 2 Israel and they Anna type to us through the life of Jesus Christ now I want to draw your attention back here just for just a few moments this morning and remember in verse three the first thing it tells us you make an offering by fire unto the Lord it's the same fire the same fire that wholly consumes the sin offering is the same fire that manifests the sweet savour of the burn offering of the mill offering of the peace offering all of that the same fire for that of the it manifest and that sweet savour speaks of the perfection of Christ's own life want you to think about this how that it would be offered with every one of these offerings the meat offering where that Evan which would be a bit of the meal offering where every every part of the meal of the green it is so ground to there's not one part that's bigger than another every every part is just the same amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen everywhere the were to stand for every word he met and so they're not to offer you know God made it clear don't you don't you offer this with leaven or with honey and notice every one of these offerings on what you just to draw this for a few moments every one of these offerings that we just read about and there's some we didn't read about in that chapter but every one of them are free will offerings they are not offerings that are required or mandated they are offered freely from the heart of the worshiper they have their feast days the solemn feast those are appointed times of the Lord that the people would make themselves ready to go up to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem is that right but there are feast what we read about right here that they were freely offered as the Lord would move in the heart of the children of Israel being that when they were dwelling in the land of their habitations the land of our habitations is in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you understand that no matter where we were my place was always to be in Christ [Music] nobody could take my place number could take your place you say brother Samuel he saved a lot not included I'm included in that offering hallelu hallelu gain for this hour taking not robbery we were ordained for this word for God to given thus our will our gain for this baptism of the Holy Ghost we have been ordained for the revealed word of the hour we have been ordained to take the rapture we have been our day to set with him in heavenly places we have been ordained to set with him it is true even as he overcome we have been ordained to be with him in the palace in the future hold we have been ordained for this I know I look like I was a million miles away I secured a little I've still got a ways to go but let me tell you what he said when you be coming to the land that I bring you into he's brought us into the land of the Holy Ghost and this same Holy Ghost he's bringing us into the land up in my father's house are many mansions the same age of the Lord is here with us that same angel that has his name in Hilma that same angel that's here I will keep thee in the way I will watch over you and I will bring you into the place that I have prepared for you if I go away I will prepare a place for you [Applause] glory high feel like there's a little bloke better believe I feel like I'm back in Ghana where they get out down here that's right feel like I'm at that's how I feel in here when I'm walking in the morning whether treading mirror on a path that's how I feel in there mmm-hmm things like here the public Wow lord have mercy glory be to God it's time what you doing have a good time having a real real real good time hallelujah in the land they would they would come in there and they would offer these offerings why would they offer these offerings because he is worthy how started you finish we love him because so the life that we are living is not because we have to it's because we love him because he first loved us don't get on me if I get it in fast rephrase in him I once was lost but now I'm found I was black but now I see hey I once was bad but now I'm free hey man so what do you know it's free will offerings peace offerings unto the Lord Thanksgiving offerings unto the Lord burnt offering unto the Lord these are voluntary voluntary offerings you can set voluntary voluntary they're not mandated voluntary of the perfection of Christ's own life in the hearts of the believer what's his life his life listen his life his life there was no fault in him no blemish let me tell you something Pilate in final folding send him out there in the Herod Herod and find no fault in there was a no fault in this lamb this lamb was examined it was kept up for examination hallelu they had to testify there's no felt in him and that life now in the believer that has brought us in the blood cell it is not our perfection it is the perfection of Jesus Christ only tonight living out through us and that's what Paul would say let us go on to perfection we'll keep on baptizing people will keep on during this but let's go on to perfection I'm just gonna stop right here in a map I closed it up it's already all right there it's a free will offering free will offering the same Ian works don't say it's a view I know that but they show the appreciation of what His grace has done for me when he tells me watch it son watch it right here watch all right there under watch that right there why because I want my life to be an offering unto Him when he tells us don't dress like that we want to be an offering unto Him we are a separated people by the grace of God that has come to you and I that has transformed our lives the Holy Ghost came to quicken the sea to make the difference and in our lives it's called to be a free offering unto you I want to offer the burnt offering which would speak of the devotedness of his life you know what I want to do your will the depth of that goes clear down to where things that can absolutely be right on the word but the Prophet would pick it up and say if our motive and objective is wrong it's the same thing as it not being the will of God I want to offer the peace offering fellowship between he and I how I appreciate this fellowship because you all know why I was empty but he came and knocked on my door of my heart Lord I believe this message is true but am i part of it I've been raised in it as a young person but I'm not part of it lord I don't know I failed many times I've made an attempt but alone are you still merciful that's your answer he's knocking on your door that's your answer he sends his answer fast personal presence you want your answer if it steal that ship you want your answer if you're a part of him you want your answer he's knocking on your hearts door halleluh halleluh and opening up that door he said out come in I'll come in hallelu and I will sup with you and you with me what she said we'll have peace offerings together we will eat up this word amen I will take up that word and I will open it to your heart Thanksgiving offerings unto the Lord no wonder David could say I won't enter his gates with Thanksgiving in the heart I will enter his courts with praise I will say this is the day that the Lord hath made and I will be glad and rejoice it how about it this morning throughout this congregation you know even when God dealing with has dealt with our lives you know even in him coming to manifest his saving grace he's already done the work but you know what it takes our own freewill let's just say Lord I accept what you have done for me I can't get these leopard spots off of me but I accept the one who has done it for me the one who is not in my heart see your whole walk our whole walk has been birthed on free will and then after God moves down it never stops it's still voluntary isn't it it's voluntary the things that we do it's voluntary it's freewill were admonished to do many things but yet God does not hold it over our head he doesn't want us let's say we're in one example he don't want us to come to church because all the preacher will get mad at us and you know no God wants it to be a free will offering remember what a free will offering comes from it comes from your heart and if you can just take your heart and take the knock on your heart and just put it in his hands watch what he can do with your life what's what he will continue to do with your life let's pray Lord Jesus throughout this building this morning Lord you have spoke and you're continuing to speak you've not you've ministered to our lives Lord hear we are called into the land the land of offerings from our habitation Lord what a privilege it is to walk in this land lord I ask you this morning if there's one soul Lord here this morning if they can just look away and just Lord release our themselves to that knock on their heart if there's something that's out of line lord maybe Lord in their heart God your goodness the Bible says the goodness of the Lord leadeth us to repentance Norden they they just Lord in their heart right now Lord whether they want to come here or there in their seat but I pray that their heart because no matter where they're at it's got to be from the heart but Norden may they just right now every fear lord i bind every devil of fear Satan you're a liar we take the 40 and the jurisdiction over you in the name of Jesus Christ you have no right no right here Lord I pray this morning may hearts come to know you and from our lives more god I pray that for every one of us Lord has free will offerings voluntary lord help us help us to see Lord help each and everyone to see that that's what the real life of Christ is all about it's not a law it's a love affair it's not something I have to do I don't have to go to church I get to go to church I want to I don't have to worship you I want to I don't have to live for you I want to live for you I don't have to obey your word I want to obey you Lord how we thank you this morning I asked Lord God have your way father in the name of Jesus Christ a man all bliss should be the name of the Lord all how to do you what it means I'm sure it probably means same thing to you it means so much to be able to raise my hands to his name David would say but my hands be like the incense Oh God I think your Lord you give me a hinge to raise to your name a voice that can say thank you Lord I always say it has to be for my heart but I'm so faithful that God would allow me to worship Him say brother Samuel are you still worshiping him for how that he took a hold of your lap oh yeah I've never done over that I've never got over that but even yet in this week in these days
