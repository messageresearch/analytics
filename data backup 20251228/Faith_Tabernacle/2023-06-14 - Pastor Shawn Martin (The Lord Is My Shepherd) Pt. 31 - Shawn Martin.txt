that's what we want amen whatever he has for us to do and we know that um in this age he's he's going to have the preeminence in his church and there's a people that's going to give him that preeminence and they're giving it to him I believe now in this age and we thank the Lord for that amen so glad to be a part of that group amen and knowing that we're in his hands and amen the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn there to Psalms the 23rd chapter and we want to um as was mentioned to keep brother Jerry in our prayers is he's having some difficulties there in his body and Lord just be with him and bring him through this situation and also brother Josh binens having his meeting starting a week from today um so this I guess next coming Wednesday there and so we've any of you would like to to attend and be blessed I'm sure you will amen he's going to be having his church dedication and got a beautiful Sanctuary there that the Lord blessed them with and um and so he's got a wonderful lineup of ministers and so I'm I'm sure you will be blessed as well as be a blessing to them amen well it's good to be here house Lord and trust you all had a good day today it's hard to believe that we're in June and um already getting I guess close to the middle of it and um thing Brother Sam was saying two more weeks and the day starts getting shorter that's just hard to believe that but you know what every day that comes it just brings us closer to the Lord or the coming of the Lord and Satan is fighting harder than he ever has um against the the bride of Christ but I I believe that there's we're going to endure and we must endure we must keep pressing pressing on Amen no matter what you go through no matter what uh things happen we've got to keep our eyes upon Christ amen amen can't turn back he that endures to the end the same shall be saved and uh God never promised that he would make it easy for us but he did promise we'll go through he'll take us through amen and so before we go into the word may we just bow our heads our hearts to the Lord and talk to him Lord Jesus we counted an honored to to be gathered here this evening father we thank you Lord for allowing us to live in this age Lord there's just so many things that are going on that your scriptures have talked about and we have longed and waited man has longed for these days and here we are Lord scripture is being fulfilled but you're bringing your church to the finale Lord all that was in your mind Lord you're bringing us to this and we're so thankful Lord to be part of it so glad that we have the heart to believe the eyes to see the the understanding and father we humbly just ask that you would help us to understand more and May Lord you take all unbelief out of his father I pray that you just your character be molded in every one of his father oh God that's our cry that's our prayer Lord when the Trials come upon us Lord may we may may we not uh have an evil heart of just our heart become hardened to them but Lord may we become more pliable in your hands more soft into your hands as you the Potter molding your clay and oh Father we ask that you would move among us this evening take what simple words we have and Lord as you did the the fishing loaves you multiplied it I pray that you would do it for us today Lord and let it be planted in each and every heart we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen we want to just go back to Psalms 23 and starting at the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen you can have your seats this evening we we can look at the scriptures here and identify with what David is speaking of and for we know that we're walking in the Valley of the shadow of death and yet David would tell us and of course he would be the voice of a bride for we would agree we would say it wholeheartedly that we feel fear no evil amen David says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil this Valley of the shadow of death is not a paradise it's it's a it's a place where darkness is present David is surrounded by corruption so are we surrounded by you know sickness and disease and subject to failures and you know Temptations and the trials and subject to discouragement to weaknesses and all of these things because he's in the Valley of the shadow of death his life was not without problems and neither are ours every one of us we have our challenges we have our issues we have things that we face I mean that's just a given and and yet David says I will fear no evil for thou art with me that's the key so we compare this with today we are living in the evilest age ever trouble is on every side we've we've read it we've heard the prophets say it but the lid has come off of hell and streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere's it's conquered the Nations it's conquered politics till it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches until they know nothing but denomination it's it's that's it's actually been prophesied that the world would go completely insane and and brother Branham would say complete complete total insanity complete total insanity this world will go into right away and he would tell us it's almost there now and that was what 50 some years or so ago or more and he says you see the footsteps of it and he said there it is it's marching right out on the street right down the church pew Total Insanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being civilized we know that in this Valley of the shadow of death That Hideous things are coming upon the Earth and it's only going to get worse and and worse and and these things are not natural things as the prophet tells us but they're spiritual things it will make people scream for the rocks and the mountains and everything else to fall on them we look today in this in this world that we're walking through uh the homosexuality is is taking over the world transgender and and and these things and and brother Branham speaking of homosexuality and uh he explains the reason why it's it's coming at a rapid pace and he said it's because men has run around with women and women with men so much until the sacredness between a man and woman has lost its values so so this this this goes back to uh how valuable you sisters are uh of of keeping yourself holy uh undefiled your morals in keeping Holiness and not not allowing yourself uh to dress in a sexy way to where men will lust after you uh you you you you are a rare specimen if I could say it that way uh men Brethren you are uh you're not cheating on your wives you're being faithful you're being loyal uh you're you're not getting caught up in the the the the sexualities of this of this age and all of these things and you're you're keeping your relationship clean and and pure and sacred whereas as it it caught up with with them now when they you know they all these divorces that we have today and and uh you know it but but what it is the marriage has lost its sacredness relationship and has lost its sacredness and it is cause perversion to come to become predominant in the world today now the prophet says we know that this is a wicked and adulterous generation there's never been a time since Sodom that homosexuals and perversion was on the March as it is now he said you go in my office and read the mail of mothers from California and around about their boys living and it's terrible he said I picked up a paper a couple years ago flying over Los Angeles where it said that the great sin of Sodom was on such an increase there until it had increased 20 percent over the year before and all out through even to government officials and it's everywhere now we can truly see that it's everywhere it's it's in schools it's in churches it's in government it's it's everywhere and it's because that women has made themselves so cheap they have brought it upon themselves it's it's become a cheap Affair used to be you took off your hat to a woman on the street and you do it now she'd Laugh In Your Face see we've made ourselves a bunch of corruption so degrading ourselves another place he said they are taking these uh teenage girls out and give them marijuana you know um it's it's uh uh it's amazing how people you know religious people think marijuana is all right because they've legalized it and but yet brother Brown said here they're taking they take these little teenage girls out and give them marijuana why what do they do they tell them a little friendly drink it's got and it's got to a place they know that raises passions in human life now don't don't don't you know don't tell me that that Satan knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing and it goes all back that educations of the devil Sciences of the devil and I have to tell you technology is of the devil if and if you're not a Holy Ghost Field individual a man them things will take over your life to where you can't control what you're doing what you're looking at what you're listening to what you're what what is dominating your life it's all of the devil ain't that right amen and we know that God can use them things he's used he used television and and and them things but but it but nonetheless it's of the devil it it comes from all that it just comes from the devil ain't that right and so but but we're finding that it's it's these these things that the world is producing and and they're anointed of a spirit I believe it and and because I see the product of what the what's what's producing but I believe that Hollywood is of the devil I I believe you know these men and women that that that have have come up with all of this technology and all that I believe it's an inspiration from from a worldly spirit I just believe that and and it's it's because uh Satan knows and and look look at the increase of our of of how many men how many good men Godly men have fallen because of that stupid internet you understand what I'm saying uh how many good preachers have fallen uh uh into sin because they got trapped and they got hooked up on the technology and I don't care if it's Facebook I don't care if it's Instagram I don't care what it is uh there's more passions that are running out uh uh uh being being dominant or predominant or whatever you want to call it in the people today than it ever has before ain't that right amen and so here now and and I believe that they I believe that the world knows what they're doing I believe they know they've marketed human beings they've marketed they know what draws they know what appeals they know what attracts they know that them sexy little old clothes attracts them young people they know these things and so now see they've got it so they they're they're getting these teenage girls he says out give them marijuana and what do they do they tell them all just a little friendly drink till it's got to a place they know that raises passions in human life little boys and girls till they're becoming completely insane so the world knows what they're doing can you say amen and and if they don't the devil does ain't that right the devil does and so in the message and knoweth it not a man brother Branham says there will come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane and the Bible said so they'll scream and haul a great hideous things in their imaginary mind and and how does it get to that point how does it get into the imaginary I believe it's it's by the production of Hollywood I I I believe they they began to work upon the people's minds and and even brother Branham talks about the comic books and and how that it's preparing the little children's mind for a blast that he's going to give them down the road and we're seeing that blast take place we're seeing what he's doing to the young people of the day ain't that right amen and so they'll scream and haul or great hideous things in their imagination and they remind behind the radials and things are television programs are producing it ain't that right there will be such things as ants raise up on Earth and and that will be as high as 14 trees a bird will fly across the Earth with wings four or five miles across and people will see them they will see them they'll scream and holler and cry for Mercy but it'll be the plagues ain't that right now it ain't going to be a literal thing it's it's an imaginary thing but that that's that's shows that people are going insane ain't that right amen I mean we we know it's the insanity if a man can if if the world is calling a man because he wants to be a woman they'll call that guy a woman and and identify with that guy as a woman that's got to be Insanity you understand what I'm saying so so we're understanding how dark and and what this Valley of the Shadow of death means as we're walking in it this because we're in the most evil age ever what David was talking about we're experiencing in in its greatest form uh uh today ain't that right amen you young people you're fighting things that I never had to fight you're fighting things that Grandpa never had to fight and and and down down the road you are fighting things because it's a it's you're walking in the valley of a shadow of death ain't that right but notice what David said I will fear no evil for thou art with me ain't that right now Jesus promised that he would come to us a man and and now remember David said the fear was gone because he recognized that that Christ was with him the shepherd thou art with me amen and so we're looking in this age and how that Jesus promised he gave that promise that I I come and and in in Matthew 12 and 39 Jesus said an adulteress or an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given it to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas ain't that right for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Will's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth now what brother Branham tells us is that that that is the sign that we would be given and that would be the sign of the Resurrection ain't that right the sign of the resurrection showing that Christ is alive and well and he is among us today you believe that so now brother Brown says see in that very hour of that Wicked and adulterous generation you believe we're in that living in that Wicked and altruous Generation Well brother Brown says we are amen this is the age he said Jesus Christ rises in the power of his resurrection to prove that he's Alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever but Jesus said the world won't receive it amen they cannot receive it they will not see it and and neither do they know him ain't that right so so in this coming amen uh when he comes uh there will be a the majority of the people will not recognize him will not see him you can preach about him you can show the signs you can they could see it right before them and they still won't believe it they won't receive it because it doesn't know them no him that neither does it see him amen but John 14 20 says but at that day at that day the day of his coming you shall know that I am in my father you and me and I in you ain't that right so it's more than just knowing that he has come amen but knowing where he is at amen I am in my father you and me and I in you ain't that right so it's a personal revelation and the world will not believe it it will not receive it no matter how much evidence God has shown that he is here today the world will never accept it but how do we know that he is here amen well well brother Branham he he said uh uh you know that the the purpose of his ministry was to make the presence of the Lord known to us ain't that right amen that that's the purpose of of the the message of the hour if there's ever a time a man that we need to understand the purpose of of of the ministry of brother Branham and that is to know that Jesus Christ is here Among Us ain't that right we're walking in the Valley of the shadow of death but there's one thing a man that takes the fear away from us is knowing that Jesus Christ is here with us ain't that rhyme amen and we find that the same sign that Melchizedek performed to Abraham is the same exact sign that Jesus performed to the Jew and the Samaritan ain't that right amen and that same sign has been performed in this last day to the Gentile church or the race amen I want to just read it here but Genesis 18 and 12 a man Melchizedek standing there before Abraham and he's telling Abraham about a promise the promise I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and and these things and and and and it says therefore Sarah laughed within herself a man in herself she didn't laugh out loud a man but she was in the tent behind Melchizedek amen and she chuckled with inner self amen and and saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord Melchizedek amen said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which am old see is there anything too hard for the Lord at that point in time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son now Sarah heard heard what Melchizedek said Abraham him and she went out and she denied that she laughed she says I didn't laugh amen and and for she was afraid and Melchizedek said but yes you did laugh ain't that right well then you find that same sign that Jesus did uh he done it many times but but it's a woman at the well John 4 4 15. uh Jesus talking to the Samaritan woman and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not and either come hither to draw and Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou uh now has is not thy husband in that set us thou truly and the woman said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet she recognized him as the Messiah the prophet that they had been way waiting for it by that sign ain't that right so Jesus Promised at that same sign would happen again and I know we know these things but I'm going back over it Luke 17 20 likewise also as it was in the days of lot amen now this is a a scripture that is a mystery to many many people a man likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they did drink they uh they bought they sold they planted they built it are we not here living in that age see so this is a prophecy speaking of this age but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so by looking at the the condition of the world we can say that this scripture is being fulfilled and has been fulfilled right before our eyes in this generation ain't that right so the world the the church nominal uh most of them they'll look at that scripture and then they can agree with it we're here amen the building that's going on all these restaurants and and uh uh people are more chubbier than they used to be and and just eat eat you know and and we got all the entertainment and we're building in in all of these things and we can we can identify the condition of the World by that scripture and say that we're we're here but then the prophet would let us uh on in in uh on a secret and and he tells us but Abraham was in that day as well Abraham was not in Sodom and Gomorrah he was outside of it he was not partaken of all the sins and the filth and all the the nonsense that was going on ain't that right but he was up there talking to Melchizedek and he was receiving a promise us and he was seeing the sign of Melchizedek a man see he was fellowshipping he was talking with the king of Salem which is the Lord of glory amen and so Jesus says As it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the revealing or in the day when the son of man is revealed ain't that right well Melchizedek did not reveal himself to lot he did not reveal himself to Sodom and Gomorrah he only revealed himself to Abraham which was the elect of God ain't that right so I want to say this Abraham did not go down the lot and Sodom and Gomorrah and tell them about Abel about his experience with Melchizedek amen see it was to Abraham and and and and and Melchizedek gave him a promise ain't that right a man say so so we find that the son of man is revealed only to the elect of this day a man says so so what I'm saying is we believe that he's here and only the elect will know that he's here by the sign that they have been shown and has been revealed to them amen we we can say well I dance but that don't mean he's here well I prophesy that doesn't mean that he's here well I I I've ran the building that doesn't mean that he's here you understand what I'm saying but when we saw the sign of Melchizedek a man performed in this day then we can declare as the scripture says he is here and he has come to us ain't that right amen says so this bride is taking refuge in the fact that his presence is here his presence aren't you glad that the presence of God is here amen now notice a man stood before brother Branham in the prayer line and we could go through a lot of these and and I didn't just one amen because you've heard it many times but he stood before brother Branham in the prayer line brother Brown says see the man's a stranger I don't know him but Christ does see but sir I see you're Shadow there's a Darkness I see them taking you into a building it's a hospital and then you had an operation then you had another operation and they were for cancer and the cancer remained the doctor has failed to get it but he cannot hide from Jesus you're not from this city you're from a smaller city than this uh looks like he said it's Rockford Illinois is where you're from and your name is Leonard I believe they call you and your address is 3034 8th Street see what was it the same sign that Melchizedek performed that Jesus performed is the same sign that has been performed in this day can you say Amen so now we can say as David though I walk to the valley of this shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thou art with me aren't you glad he's with you amen yes sir brother Brandon would tell us he says he tell the people he said now you don't have to have a prayer card the prayer card has nothing to do with it just give you a lot and a number to Stand Here by sometimes we call from one place then another no matter where it's at no matter where we call a man or and all these things we just call a few people up here so that the presence of God can be known in the audience ain't that right so by his ministry by that gift amen it was allowing the people to see that the presence of God was here he says see and when the people realize that Christ is here that he's not dead but he's raised from the dead and he's the same in principle and power thousands reach up and accept him and that's when the healing takes place another place he says I've seen him move over the people and show himself over here on the side of a wall and went down upon a man and come down here and up through the building making known the secrets of the heart which is the identification of his presence to show that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's in our midst aren't you glad he's in our midst amen why because someone tells us that why because you felt a goosebump why because you shed a tear that has nothing to do with it at all see amen everybody's got the presence of God identified with something where I spoke in tongues I got the holy ghost that don't mean nothing amen and and so they put the they they put all the emphasis on gifts they put all the emphasis on shouting and the jumping and the dancing and the hollering and the music and all of these things it has nothing to do with it amen but he come and he revealed himself by showing the sign of Messiah it's a scripture signed church can you say amen amen why so we wouldn't be views as to what we are and who we are and where he is and and what's going on around us I will not fear for thou art with me can you say Amen as a parent I will not fear over my children because thou art with me as a preacher I will not fear over the church because thou art with us can you say amen amen and that's the stance that we all take amen as message Believers as those that have seen Christ revealed in this age his presence is Among Us do you believe that a man's seat now brother Branham says when we read it last Wednesday I believe there cannot be the presence of God without Supernatural things happening never did Jehovah ever appear without the supernatural following him now so God never comes on the scene unless it's to fulfill his word he doesn't come to show off he doesn't come Amen to tickle our fancy he comes for one thing and that's to fulfill his word amen and if you're part of that word then there's going that word is going to take effect upon you he come for you do you believe that he come for you if you're part of the word for this age he come for you amen that's the whole reason he didn't come for brother Branham it in alone amen he didn't come so we could all ooh and all over brother Branham amen that that's not the whole point at all amen we look at the ministry of brother Branham and we can say that Jesus Christ is here that he didn't leave when brother Branham left amen the supernatural didn't leave when brother Branham left amen that word is still being effective today because he's here to fulfill the word of God and so no matter how many years go by God remembers his word and keeps his word now in in Exodus three and seven the Lord said unto Moses I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrow you understand that God knows your sorrow God knows what you're going through how many believes that and God knows God knows God knows what you're going through amen God knows that the the situation God knows the discouragements God knows the Mind battles God knows the the the the testings God knows the battles God knows the The Temptations that you go through amen don't think that God doesn't know about you God knows all about you can you say Amen now amen Satan will lie to you and tell you that God doesn't understand and God has nothing to do with you but that's not what the Bible says here God remains silent all these years because he was waiting for his word to be fulfilled amen but he remembered his promise he remembered his word amen and he says I know their sorrow and I have heard I've seen the Affliction see I know their sorrow and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey aren't you glad for that amen now see that's why God come that was the sole purpose is God remembered his promise God had heard the Cry of his people he saw the Affliction that the enemy was putting upon them amen he's knew their sorrow and he says now I'm come down to deliver them amen and you to think of this that God has come in this age Amen to deliver a people again I believe that now God has come to deliver amen and so Moses went down to Egypt where the Crooked stick in his hand amen see going to take over and brother Brown said he did it by the power of almighty God the most ridiculous thing what would its Crooked Stick be to ten thousand Spears but you see God is in it God is in it he takes what is so simple and so little to the world that God is in it amen see what looks funny to the world but God is in it oh my don't forget that now amen see God is in it and it depends on where his word is can you say man God's word wasn't in the ten thousand spheres God's word was with Moses ain't that right and Moses had his word Pharaoh had his Spears but Moses had the word of the Lord ain't that right amen and and the world has traded amen the word amen and and despise the word and went for the technology went for the glamor went for the popularity when for all of the things that thought that the devil is given to their children and to the uh to the churches today but there is a people that have taken the word of God and God is with his word now just before Jesus left he gave a promise and he said there in John 14 and 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not soul I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen and if I go and prepare a place for you I everybody say I will come again so Ares promised already to come again amen now remember that's what he promised Abraham I had to end as so many years I'm going to come and I'm going to deliver your people amen and when a Time came time to come he had a prophet on the earth called Moses amen and he told Moses I've heard the I've seen the Affliction I've heard what they've done I've heard the Cry of my people I've seen their Cyrus I know all about it now I'm come to deliver them I've come to honor my word aren't you glad for that oh my see well here we are again Jesus the Same God Amen in flesh promise to come again unto us amen and receive you he says see I go prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself so this coming amen that he promised this time would be to receive us unto himself ain't that right that where I am you will be there also oh my amen see amen so then we understand uh this is what Revelations 10 1 is all about it's Redemption claims ain't that right what he redeemed 2 000 years ago he comes to claim them amen see this is what first Thessalonians 4 16 is all about none and and so forth the Lord himself shall descend with a shout which is the message of the hour ain't that right so so I want to tell you this if we can identify them scriptures amen with the coming for uh today amen and realize that the Melchizedek has come this isn't just a Ministry of a man it's the ministry of the Lord himself amen but he's come for one purpose and that is to receive us unto himself that where he is we can be there also can you say Amen yes sir so I say to you this is a message of Deliverance do you believe that it's a message of Deliverance if you can just believe that with all of your heart watch the supernatural take place in our lives amen see so so we find and it's what brother Branham calls the Third Exodus ain't that right it's a it's time for a Third Exodus it's what's happening uh uh here in this age so though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me so he's come to receive me unto himself now now watch uh First Corinthians 15 50. now I say this uh Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption but I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed want a time of Deliverance then you say Amen this isn't just coming out of a natural land but this is a time that he's going to receive us unto himself and in order to go where he's it we've got to be changed uh do you talk about a Deliverance now amen seat behold we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed you realize that the dead you're going to rise by the message of the hour true amen it ain't just got the power to Quicken your your your soul and bring you out of Dead traditions into life it's got the power Amen to Quicken those that are already dead and bring them back to life again and it's going to happen and I I just believe we're just near this thing can you say man that's right amen see so he says see we for the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen Victory can you say man he's come to take us out of this death a valley of shadow of death to where death can affect you sickness can affect you amen cannot torment your mind no more mind battles no more Temptation amen no more things to discourage you amen no more sickness to to paddle and all of these things and I say to you it's in this day that God has remembered his promise God has remembered his promise and and and and to be honest we didn't even know the the full effect of that promise we we didn't understand the timing of this promise we didn't understand really what God really meant but God would bring a prophet in this day to open it up to us and give us an understanding as to why he's here it's time for a body change it's time now David said the Lord is my shepherd you realize the prophet said it's a disgrace for the Sheep to lose one sh or the shepherd to lose one sheep it's a reproach on the shepherd if the shepherd loses one sheep it is a disgrace on him for all the father has given me will come and none of them are lost can I say that again all that the father hath given me now this is the great Shepherd all that the father has given me I've not lost to one they will come to me can you say Amen now though you walk to the Valley of the shadow of death or youngins are walking to the valley or the shadow over there there is a promise that's right Amen brother Brown said any good shepherd is a watcher of the sheep the shepherd can't afford to lose the Sheep that's the reason you backslider tonight he's still he's still honking hanging or still hanging around your heart trying to draw you back to the fifth fold because he once kissed you and you kissed him and told him that you loved him raised your hands and praised him and you backslid and went out there and got all butchered up and wounded up in your spirit but he still holds around you see all the time come on back wandering sheep see I just can't afford to let you be lost maybe the little sheep that he had to go way out on the mountain to find see all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out there wounded somewhere but the shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep amen think of what Jesus says uh about the shepherd and the and the Sheep he says see Luke 15 4 what man of you having a hundred sheep if you lose one of them does not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he be found ain't that right and when he found it he layeth it upon his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home all he calleth together is friends and neighbors singing to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say to you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 99 just persons which need no repentance can you say Amen so I'd say to you that not one of God's sheep is going to be lost not a one ain't that right now churches come down he's come here to claim his own and I don't care how bad that the battle rages I don't care how dark it gets I don't care how it looks like the devil is having a Heyday a man not one of the sheep is going to be lost he come here in power he come here Amen to get everyone that he put on the Lamb's Book of Life ain't that right not One's Gonna Be lost Brother Brad I'm at the end of his sermon on one one of his sermons asked people to raise their hand if they wanted to accept Christ and and different ones did and he says he said you know what calls you to raise your hands it was Jesus for God said in his word listen no man cometh to me except my father draws him first and God is here and he's drawing by the Holy Spirit some 20 or 30 put their hands up he's drawing by the holy spirit because that you love him there's something in that see you you that you just can't help it there's something in you you just can't help it ain't that right I don't care how discouraged we get I don't care how low we get I don't care what goes on what happens in our day and how many Trials come there's still something in there that's Paul Satan God I gotta have you God I need you what is it God the shepherd ain't gonna lose his sheep ain't that right when Moses went and delivered them people not one was lost that's what the prophet said not one was lost now we know Jesus is our great Shepherd ain't that right so he he told us he's the Good Shepherd brother Brown said God selected the great Shepherd of the flock the Lord Jesus Christ and gave him the authority the Shepherds got the authority over his sheep amen and our Authority brother Brown said is Jesus Christ you believe it our Authority is Jesus Christ amen so now we see that our great Shepherd has a rotten staff or he says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me a man see now sheep are defenseless and need a Shepherd to protect them so from from what I understand the shepherd's Rod is used in different ways but for different things but but one of them things is that it's used to defend and protect the Sheep from from the enemy and the rod conveys the concept of Power Authority discipline ain't that right so we see uh the importance of the rod and staff as we talked about it Wednesday I believe but the importance of the rotten staff when Moses went to deliver Israel out of Egypt and to bring them into another land that was the first Exodus amen and and and Moses was called of God he was sent by God and God gave him a supernatural uh signs as Vindication to his message now the prophet said Moses was a perfect type of our great Shepherd the Lord Jesus and Jehovah displays himself uh uh in this Shepherd Prophet Moses now Moses LED every genuine lamb all the way from Egypt to Palestine he never lost a one of them neither did they go hungry or their clothes didn't even get threadbare Moses the shepherd LED them ain't that right certainly he was a type of Christ see so those who will follow will never be lost those who follow will never be lost ain't that right sometimes we don't understand the leading but we know that that the shepherd is here to bring a Deliverance so we can find courage in the story of Moses because we see that God two is going to bring every one of his sheep out as well not his word his word is not going to go idle his word is not going to fail what what God intended what every person that God intended to come out of Egypt was there on Earth at that time that Moses was there God wasn't wasting his time he didn't bring them all out of Egypt and then say Oh My amen uh uh this one was left behind because it was in the hospital or or whatever you know the Bible says that they all left well they they left there was not a sickness there so that Rod now he brought them out the prophet said by that Rod now that Rod was just a Crooked Stick yeah uh there but the prophet said the power laid in that stick look Exodus 4 and 2 and the Lord said unto him what is in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he casted on the ground and it become a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it become a rod again see now Moses wasn't out to perform tricks he wasn't out to say look what I can do it was there to bring Deliverance ain't that right see there was a message behind what he was doing in the natural that stick that Rod was just an ordinary stick but the prophet said when the supernatural Came Upon it it was God's judgment rod 's judgment Rod now it become a serpent it turned into a serpent as we just read and the serpent represented what sin already judged ain't that right remember when Israel sinned against Moses by complaining sin against God sin against Moses they complained they griped they said it'd be better off of we we we just go back to Egypt and eat the onion and leeks and whatever see uh the garlic and all that stuff and and God was Wrath with them and numbers 21 and 6 and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looked at the point shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived ain't that right now the prophet said both in both cases when Moses threw the stick down and become a serpent and the pole that the serpent was on Amen it represented the cross see it was just a natural substance it was just a stick of wood ain't that right but the serpent represented Christ so brother Bram says now he said the serpent as it was uh a reptile a snake it represents it represented sin already judged for Satan had sinned in the serpent in the Garden of Eden yeah come on see which was not a reptile he was the missing link between man and animal and he stood there or walked upright and was the most subtle of all the beasts not reptiles of the beast of the field and when he was cursed his legs went off of him and he went on his belly right then and that showed that he was already judged when he became a reptile ain't that right and then Christ was sin in the serpent already judged ain't that right so God was joined by that serpent that sin was already judged and it was showing that that was Christ Christ the serpent was a type of Christ are you with me now see then Christ was sinned in the serpent already judged the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so another place he said the serpent spake of divine judgment to appease God his judgments are Divine and the poll represented the cross and the serpent represented Jesus the lovely Lord Jesus he came down and was made sin God himself revealed himself in a body made like unto sinful flesh to take away sin and sickness from the world how beautiful in there he made a way Jesus said as Moses lifted up the breast serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up now what was the breast serpent lifted up for for a compound compound reason they had sinned and were sick and then Jesus was lifted up wounded for our transgressions and went to stripes we are healed a compound reason ain't that right another place brother Brown said the serpent was an atonement for the people we're getting somewhere now see so the Judgment was not laid upon the people it was laid upon the serpent showing that the Judgment was not laid upon the seed of God it was laid upon Christ and you say Amen see so brother Brown said the serpent represented sin already judged God judged the serpent in the Garden of Eden God already passed judgment upon the serpent oh he was beautiful walked up right he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field but God judged him and put him down on his belly for the rest of his days see judged and Christ was our sins judged he said you see it beautiful my sin your sin justly should go to hell and be punished for our sins but Christ took our place and the serpent that's why it represented Christ see brass the serpent being made out of brass meant Divine judgment now the serpent was already was sin already judged the breast meant Divine judgment so see God's Divine judgment was upon Christ not you ain't that right see he took your judgment God put all your sins and my sins and all of our field upon Christ that you could go free you realize that's the only way the message of Deliverance could happen if there was nobody to take our sins we would never be able to hear a message of Deliverance we would never be able to hear a message of Freedom we would never be able to be comforted in this Valley of the shadow of death that's right brother Brown said now see while you're in that body talking about the body of Christ you're just as free from condemnation as he is you'll never have to stand any judgment aren't you glad for that you'll never have to stand any judgment now that means something does Church because look around you look what's happening in this world but you'll never have to stand the judgment see God calls judgment to be struck upon his body and if you're in him God cannot everybody say God cannot judge me God cannot judge you brother Bill if you're in that body amen by one Spirit are we baptized in that one body you're safe you're secure you can never be judged again because Christ took your judgment now what you're hearing is a message of Deliverance come out of her my people ain't that right he's come for Redemption claims because he's already took your judgment so you can't just go around you remember if you go listen to that uh sister Bruce that the the interview of sister Bruce you know and she's trying to tell brother Brown however rotten of a sinner she is and how this and she's no good and all this and the proc she's trying to convince the prophet that she's a sinner she's no good and the prophet looks at her says but I've checked your life you're not a sinner you realize that's what God has done in this message he told us that you're absolutely Justified as though you never did it in the first place you're no longer a sinner see you can't be see so he says God cannot judge you he's already judged you when he judged Christ he put the judgment on Christ not you aren't you glad for that yes sir and you can't be under judgment no more Christ took your judgment and when you're baptized in that body of Christ you're free from God's judgment the wrath of God will pass over you church we ought to be happy tonight we ought to be rejoicing tonight to know that the wrath of God Is Passing Over Our Lives it's passing over it you can't be judged there's that song was saying you know Jesus Took My burdens and rode them in the deep blue sea now I have a piece that he has given me all because he's took my burdens and rode them in the sea can you say Amen oh yes yes he so the rod was Christ you believe it so what the prophet said the rod was Christ the substitute for sin and sickness amen so now when when Moses went and he threw that Rod before Pharaoh turned into a serpent it was a sign of Christ coming and taking the Judgment for the people ain't that right see being our judgment and yet Pharaoh rejected it not it gave the people comfort if they could see what that Rod meant they know what it meant see that there it was a testimony of Christ's coming Pharaoh rejected it and he tried to do the same thing he called his magicians magicians and and and and and and and they done the same thing that Moses done they threw down their rods they turned into a serpent ain't that right brother Brown said so does the modern pharaohs of today and make Believers carnal impersonations impersonators of the message try to mimic the same thing without knowing where it's coming from and they throw it into some denominational something when it says free uh from it as the air is from being pinned up but you try to mimic see brother Branham in his prayer he said I see all things that you promised I see the impersonators I see uh you said that as it was in the days of Moses how this uh jambers and Janus would come back to impersonate and still remain right in that same dump that they were in see they couldn't follow Moses through that word and take those children out there Into the Wilderness amen because they was associated in Egypt that's right they couldn't do it though they'd done the same Works he did isn't that the way it is today we got him dancing speaking in tongues shouting using the gifts and all that but they ain't got what it takes to deliver the people because they're associated with the world ain't that right see they're associated with the world so they ain't got what it takes Amen to to bring him in uh take them out see amen but they're Folly see their Folly was made manifest brother Brown said now watch this spirit in the last days go to impersonate the real Spirit that's where your trouble is coming just like it like the the the one that's real but he couldn't make it manifest he couldn't make it hold he couldn't make it last pharaoh and his uh uh magicians done exactly what Moses done but they couldn't make it last it didn't last long it it didn't it was as though it was just a a vapor Mystic can you say man that's right see do you realize that brother Brad said he historically a Revival will last about three years or so and then it dies it goes off the scene he said but this revival has went on for 15 years or more not one denomination has come out of it Luther had Revival went into denomination Wesley when denomination Alexander Campbell went into a denomination all these other great John Smith and so forth denominations Moody all along but here's been one usually Revival lasts about three years but this has been going on for over 15 years and I say it's still going on and not one denomination has sprang up see has sprung up from it for this is the sea time [Applause] isn't that wonderful there's no more shot after that one the one Chuck is gone it's seed and God is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to Perfection by his word Jesus Christ ain't that right so this revival is still going on why it's the promise of of God that he would come and take us home amen now it's true they ain't a man-made thing Moses Revival wasn't a man-made thing he had what it took to get the people out and this message is what it takes to get the people out we're leaving and the shepherd staff noticed Moses Shepherd's staff he was the shepherd Prophet his staff ate up the other snakes amen and there was the rods on the floor but only one was picked up ain't that right that's right brother Brown said it speaks of true atonement coming for sin there's only one way for an atonement for sin ain't that right and that's Jesus Christ there ain't all these other ways there ain't all these other things to get you in a Rapture there's only one way there's only one voice there's only one message there's only one power ain't that right now as we read and I'll get rid closed but Isaiah 11 and 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and she'll make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked now I'll say to you that Rod is Jesus Christ can you say man now the prophet said Israel was offered deliverance from the bondage of death by the prophet Shepherd they were brought out of bondage by a prophet Shepherd see what was it he said it was speaking of the Israel's future deliverer from death and Hell by the great Shepherd prophet ain't that right amen but we all know that Israel rejected it they rejected their deliverer they rejected it and want nothing to do with it but God has sent that same Shepherd prophet in our day to bring Deliverance to us his people his bride and there's going to be people to receive it aren't you glad you're one of them that's right see and notice when Moses the the shepherd prophet in Egypt there Pharaoh rejected the the the the the the the sign the the the serpent and and he uh therefore it become a rod of judgment to him and to Egypt Moses waved that Rod amen over the waters it turned into blood he waved toward the sky and the sun went black ain't that right turn dark everywhere that Prophet Shepherd put that Rod before him it was judgment judgment went before the rod because it was a judgment Rod the prophet said and it brought judgment Upon A disobedient people but yet that Rod was bringing a Deliverance to the people all depends what side of the the corn you're on ain't that right when Moses wanted fleas the prophet said he just raised that Rod into the air and sprinkled some dirt amen and as the dust blew on the fleece came from everywhere what was it it was divine judgment he brought fire out of Heaven lightning upon the Earth he brought hell stones and everything that killed the cattle and killed the Egyptians and everything else it was God's judgment that went before Moses and what that stick was to Moses Jesus Christ is to the church in this age in this hour as I've read last week if if those Egyptians could have ever got that simple stick out of Moses hands they'd have whooped him and when the devil ever gets the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's with the church can you say Amen and as the Judgment went stick went before Moses to take the judgment to bring the Judgment so does the name of Jesus go before us to take our judgment and stands our Judgment of sickness it stands our Judgment of death stands our Judgment of trouble can you say Amen it stands at everything that we deserve that Satan tries to put on us there's a rod that takes our judgment why it's time for deliverance amen take the rod he's taken our judgment and there's power in the rod can you say Amen you're not a victim I think we ought to get out of that victim mentality speaking negative mentality woe is me mentality can you say Amen we are the people how many believes you're the people you're the people he's come for amen he's come for it he's come he sent a message and there's a rod Jesus Christ is here and our Authority is in that name every problem that you have is there in that name it's your judgment it's taken the Judgment for you now you take that name of Jesus and you defeat every enemy Satan cannot stick to you he has no right sickness has no right to stick to you problems have no right to stick to you oh yes you're going through this Valley of the shadow of death but you will not be overcome you will not be subdued by that devil you believe it amen don't let this message become common said when when sickness begins together breathe that name of Jesus what is it it's God's representative of judgment Christ already judged for your sins Christ already judged for your Temptation Christ already judged for your sickness see what I mean it was God's judgment rod and as long as that Rod waved on it was God's judgment ain't that right amen Moses that night after leading the children of Israel out there come Pharaoh's Army the pillar of fire went down and hung between pharaoh and pursuing Army into Israel it may lie to Israel and darkness to pharaoh and kept them apart a go between and I'm so glad today that he is our goal between in sickness in between death and life he's my go-between he's the one that takes death in one hand and life in the other hand he's that link that connects man to God to go between ain't that right he come down as a go-between he made light on this side for Israel to march on and darkness to hold Pharaoh back isn't that what is happening to day there's light with the children of God and there's Darkness with the world he made light see to hold him back they said that same angel of God is in the church tonight giving light for the church to walk on and darkness for those who were rejected we are the children of Light how many believes that amen see how can you see when you walk in darkness you can't see you don't know where you're going but if you're in the light and Christ is the light he's given light to those Believers and while he was giving Darkness to the unbeliever see so he's given light to you and I and he's given Darkness to those that that disbelieve and that's why they can't see the message that's why they can't understand amen and what little fire or what little Revival amen they have and they say oh see we're doing just great it goes out it it cannot last but that believer is going to allow she's the she's predestinated for a Deliverance she's predestinated if the musicians will come today before see so he said see we're marching toward the promised land God's throwing light on the path of Divine Healing speaking with tongues shoutings and glories of God see manifesting them to the children of the light and throwing Darkness back there that they stumble not knowing where they're going remember that same stick that hand that held the Judgment Rod when he came down and there was God's path see running through the Red Sea he waved that over the Red Sea and the Red Sea seeing the Judgment got scared and moved back on either side and made a pillar see and the Marchers of Israel walked right across on dry land in the bottom of the sea and when the uncircumcised trying to pretend they were something when they were nothing started to do so God discomforted them took the wheels off and scared the horses and down there in the bottom of the sea in a great big uh bit of conglomeration and on the other side that same judgment where sin was in the valley praise God you know what that'll do see that same pillar fire that had been showing them when it come down to this Valley it moved right over the top of that water
