know that he is directing this amen and I just thank him for it amen well good to have everyone in the house of Lord trust you at a good day today I was able to stay somewhat warm especially the brothers that had to work out in it but the musicians can be dismissed but tell you what it's good to be on the inside in the house of the Lord to worship Him and sister Lisa it's really good to have you back praise the Lord and glad you're feeling better amen and so glad that the Lord watches over us and that he's our healer amen amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter today is Ruth's birthday today she is turned 10. amen so we wish her a happy birthday and and of course she's my daughter so I really appreciate her very much and just feel blessed to have her praise the Lord growing right up man but he heard uh before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father our desire is to please you Lord and to walk with you hand in hand that you would lead his father and take our hand Lord father we don't know what road to take where to go but Lord we're just asking that you would just help us and Lord you see the the things that I have on my heart tonight and I pray that you would just help me to be able to express them to the people and Lord that you would take the words and plant it into every heart this evening and Lord we're just commit ourselves to you Lord pray that you would just forgive us of all of our sins our failures Lord and may we be more sincere than we ever have Lord pray that you would just bless your people now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen we want to look again in Psalms 23 starting at the first verse says the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul and he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake amen you can have your seats this evening and again I want to just continue in the last part of the third verse and he leads me in the paths of righteousness and this may be more of a a sobering subject this evening but I pray that will help us all but here uh first of all as the psalmist said he leads me the Lord leads in ease we've said and he's he's the shepherd so he doesn't he doesn't drive he doesn't follow but he leads he's he's our leader and he leads the sheep and David uh as a sheep of the Lord he he said my so followeth heart after thee amen so he was he was showing what was where his he is following came from and that was from the depths of the Soul my soul followeth heart after thee which shows that the soul had been restored ain't that right and so we we find that the Bible says they who are led by the spirit they are the sons of God so the children of God are going to be led that's just a given fact but a woman a man boy girl has to be meek if if they're going to be led it it there there's a a cry uh uh a standard or a specific um uh people uh that God leads and that is the meek and and here Psalms 25 and 9. it says the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way and all the paths of the Lord are mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies for thy name's sake O Lord pardon mine iniquity for it is great what man is he that feareth the Lord him shall he the Lord teach in the way that he shall choose not what man chooses but the Lord chooses his soul man's Soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth ain't that right so he guides the meek in judgment and teaches the meek his way and and and that man is one who fears the Lord not not in in the way of of of of uh trembling in in in scared but in in reverence or respect um all and so him shall he teach in the way that he the Lord shall choose now that word meek means humble lowly submissive so those that are submissive and humble the Lord will will teach and show his way and and so we we look and one writer in speaking of of meekness said meekness toward God is that dispensation disposition of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good and therefore without disputing or resisting see in the Old Testament the meek are those wholly relying on God rather than their own strength to defend against Injustice thus meekness toward evil people means knowing god is permitting the injuries they inflict that he is using them to purify his elect and that he will deliver his elect in his time gentleness or meekness is the opposite of self-assertiveness or and self-interest it stems from trust in God's goodness and control over the situation so so when we're thinking of paths no wonder that that that it God can only lead and guide those that are Meek uh because again his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and so it it it takes someone that is submissive and humble a man that is willing to trust God Amen to follow rather than to argue with God and and buck against him and and these things if you understand what I'm saying and so this is why we're considered sheep uh uh uh with the Sheep like nature so David says he leads me in the paths of righteousness and and God God's leading is so different from from uh leadership of man ain't that right now also here we we find that God did not call us just to stand in the paths of righteousness but he is ordained us to walk in the paths of righteousness so whatever path you're on and and uh we've talked about the paths and we will do it again tonight but whatever path you're on or in then you are walking and not standing you're not just set in a path but you're walking in a path he and this is what David's saying he leads me in the paths of righteousness so there's movement there's forwardness there's there's uh progression and that rhyme and I I don't think that God ever allows us to stay uh the same uh individuals or church I I just don't think that God you you will never be able to be the same individual a man that you was yesterday or uh uh or this church will never be able to to to remain uh uh the same um I just saw sister Lydia God bless you sis good to have you praise the Lord and and so I uh we we find that people are either advancing more in God or they are advancing more in the world in other words getting away from God Amen either way you're either you're in your your own life uh uh this church or uh uh your home your family you're either advancing toward Christ or or you're you're you're actually leaving and and and advancing more in the world and and and what determines that is whatever path you're walking in and and so see one path takes you into the things of God and the other path takes you further from the things of God so what's in the heart reflects what path we are walking our attitude towards uh both God and the world uh because if you're walking in the paths of righteousness then or or in in in the other path then you you will have an attitude toward God and you'll also have an attitude toward the world but it all depends on what path you're walking and and so our attitude towards God and the world will reflect as to what path we're walking in our ambition towards both God and the world will show as to what path we are walking in now we we look at Jesus he's our prime example and so uh he he walked and and we'll get more into that but he walked the paths of righteousness and and so then let's look at at his attitude uh here when he says there in John 6 37 I came down from heaven uh uh not to do mine on will but the will of him that sent me amen so now this was his attitude a man on Earth in a body of Flesh was that I've I've come to do the will of of my father ain't that right I've come not my own will not my own will but the will of him that sent me he also said to John the Baptist and and and if if you've listened to the message it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness uh uh and and and and John is actually trying uh uh Jesus come of course we know for fulfillment here as as he's the word John's the prophet the word comes to the prophet but he come to be baptized of John and John don't want to baptize him he he's like no I ain't even worthy to to and to to loosen uh your shoestring in other words your latch it of your shoe and yet Jesus would remind him suffer that to be so but everybody say but it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness see so so this this was the the attitude this was the thoughts this was the heart that Jesus would portray as he was here on this Earth even even in Matthew 26 and 2 uh Jesus uh there when he's praying In The Garden of Gethsemane and and he knew that the time had come for his uh to be crucified and and as as his flesh he did not want to be crucified I don't think any of us would would want to do that but understanding that this was the wheel for him understanding that this was the path that he would walk this was God's will a man that he would give his life for for other Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right and so so he's there and he's praying and and notice the prayer oh my father if if this cup may not pass us from me except I drink it then thy will be done amen see he was humble he was a lamb he he was submissive he was Meek ain't that right and and so we know even in in another uh uh some uh uh description of the prayer he says father if it be possible let this cup pass from me amen he didn't want to but I am so glad that that he was walking the path of righteousness and and he knew that that the word that was predestinated for him a man had to be fulfilled and so he was willing to say not my will father but thine be done so we can understand how and why God can only guide the meek the paths of righteousness is only for the meek and and the humble ain't that right and those that fear uh the Lord and and so uh uh uh Jesus uh uh as he walked the past well David a man it was the same paths that David was talking about it was the same path that David was walking in and and and and and look at at David's heart Psalms 143 8 calls me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do I trust he's he's not he's he's not saying God you know I'm so glad you picked me because I got some good ideas for you and and and God I you know or maybe there's a lot of things in David's life that he did not understand and he could not explain and and maybe as his life was a uh uh uh uh uh perplexity to others maybe it was a perplexity to him as well that maybe he just didn't have all the understanding amen I thought even like sister media when she'd tell brother Brown brother we just don't understand or Billy I don't understand you he said well I don't even understand myself a lot of times but but that's the that's not the point it's not that we understand uh uh the way that God leads a lot of times it but but it it does require a heart of trust it it it does require a man our soul to follow hard after him and so he says calls me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust cause me to know thou the way wherein I should walk a man for I lift up my soul unto thee and then in the tenth verse he says teach me to do thy will amen there's a teaching involved involved and I don't care how old you are in the Lord there's always a teaching there's always a schooling there's always God is infinite and our little old peanut brains Canary brain uh so to speak it it it it can understand God you'll never get a man live live to be a million years old and you'll still not understand all of God but yet the prayer of the righteous is teach me teach me to do thy will so for thou art my God thy spirit is good lead me in to the land of uprightness now you go to First Peter 4 and 1 it says for my for as much then as Christ has suffered for us so we're talking of Christ now David and now us as suffer for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God Amen so this is why God Saves us this is this is the this is why God uh doesn't you know uh save you and then just take you home amen it would be nice if it was that way but but that's not it there's a will a man of God to be completed and and we are to live our live our lives this Mortal life not to the lust of men anymore not to our own lust and flesh and desire but it's to to to to live uh uh to the will of God even Jesus taught us to pray and how to pray and in that prayer we we are to pray thy will be done in Earth and and we know what that means Earth and vessel it we are of this Earth ain't that right a man thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven ain't that right and so see God's going to lead his sheep into the paths of righteousness and and all those who are walking the paths of righteousness Echo this prayer in their hearts thy will be done thy will be done can you say Amen so we we find here the path a man as we had read last week it means a course a root a way of life a thought or conduct amen and so the path we walk is reflected in our character and our conduct uh um the center which includes the make-believer uh uh uh to he's just a a religious man but he's just a religious sinner but but the sinner has a a certain conduct which shows the path that they're walking in amen and and also Sons and Daughters uh uh of God also have a certain conduct that shows the path they're walking in I I sought of Proverbs 12 and 5 thought it to be fitting but it says the thoughts the thoughts of the righteous are right but the councils of the wicked are deceit so so you'll never find the councils of the righteous having deceit amen and you'll never find the thoughts of the wicked being right can you say man because it's the path that they're walking in it what what they are reflects a man the path see and so now we know that Christian conduct comes by the word of God it doesn't come by rules it does not come by codes it doesn't come by any of that a man but it comes by the word of God let's look at Ephesians 5 and 3. it tells us to not let fornication and all cleanness or covetness be named once among us as becometh Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking or nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger or unclean person nor Covetous man who is an idolater and and we know idolatery does not have to be setting up an image like they would in India or Buddha or or where Buddhist or whatever wherever they are there's many idolaters that are in a church today that that have have have got God as a figment of their imagination they have formed a god of Christendom in their imagination can you say man amen see but but so who is an idolater or he has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God ain't that right amen see so let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience so this is the trait of children of Disobedience and this is why Paul would tell us as as Believers don't don't let this these things be named among you can you say man he says be ye not therefore partakers with them for you were sometimes Darkness you used to be in the darkness you used to be like that but now are you light in the Lord walk everybody say walk as children of the light can you say man so so when God changed you amen and filled you with this Spirit there is a new way of life there is a new way of thought there is a new nature there there is a new there the conduct a new character everything about you is new can you say man you might have the same body a man the same color of eyes same color of hair or uh same flat nose or whatever you got amen but there's something a man that is new that controls this body can you say man so he says now you're you are like you are light in the Lord so walk as children of the light see not everything is acceptable amen as children of the light there's things that belong in the light that that that that uh Christians amen bear witness of and and then there's things that are in the darkness that children of Darkness bear witness of ain't that right but Paul would say you're Children of the light don't get that mixed up don't get the traits mixed up don't get the character and the conducts mixed up you are children of the light can you say man walk as children of the light now Titus 2 and 1 says but speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine sound Doctrine see a man and if it's not sound Doctrine leave it alone that the Aged men so now he's got something for Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience the age aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things ain't that right that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet Chase keepers at home good obedient to their husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed can you say man so Christians amen Sons and Daughters of God they want to be careful that they that their actions don't blaspheme the word of God or or that that the the Sinners out there and and the people that doesn't understand amen the Bible that they won't look at your actions and say and he says he's a Christian she says she's a Christian that's it's nonsense can you say amen and then they start blaspheming the very holy ghost that you claim to have can you say amen amen so so we find then he's got uh uh uh uh exhortation for young men young men likewise exhort to be sober minded can you say man don't be double-minded don't don't just be letting your mind wander around and and and and and uh to where you can't be planted and and you can't be established uh uh be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorrectness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned then you say amen and I want to say this now amen if if people are looking at your life and thinking your life is a joke your Christian Life is a joke and they're not really taking you serious don't you look at them people and blame them I know there's always going to be critics don't get me wrong on that Jesus had their critics and his critics they called him a devil and all of these things but but then if there's a pattern there then you've got to look and make sure that you're following the very scriptures can you say man that's right having no evil thing to say of you so he says exhort servants a man to be obedient unto their own masters and and and yeah that that might have been served but but we could even look at employees and uh uh you know them you know the same thing back talking mouth and being just irreverent disrespecting and all of these things any kind of leadership whether it's in the church whether it's at home whether it's at the job or whatever we are taught to conduct ourselves can you say Amen to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not being smart Alec not being you know mouthy not being I don't care if you just agree or disagree that that has nothing to do with it can you say Amen see not purloin but showing all good Fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things ain't that right for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us everybody say teaching us remember this is what David had prayed teach me thy ways amen the god the meek will he guide and and and these things teaching us Amen to Meek that denying ungodliness and worldly lust desires and we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world the world may be doing something but we're not to be doing that thing the church nominal may be acting ridiculous but we're not to be acting ridiculous can you say man amen they may be pulling the world into their church and into their home but we're not to be doing them things I don't care if it makes you an oddball I don't care if it makes you part of the uh uh the minus uh uh the very very uh whatever uh small minority a man we are walking on the paths of righteousness can you say man looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ so there is a conduct there is a character there is a a thing that we must live by can you say man man you're you're not to style yourself after the world you're not to try to Fashion yourself after the world Amen I I don't care if they come up with a certain kind of a haircut Amen brother Branham got on talked about the Fashions ain't that right and it doesn't just apply to women it applies to men it any Christian should not fashion after the world if they've got their little skinny jeans that want to look like perverts I hope to God that a holy ghost-filled person will never do that I don't think they will unless God condemns them for that can you say amen amen that's right amen but it's the same way sisters you are to honor your husbands can you say man you are to give them respect whether you understand them or not whether you believe in it or not that back you you might be the most smartest woman on the world in the world and the most brightest individual in your own home amen but God put you as a uh put the man as the head can you say amen and I understand a lot of times a lot of men just want to keep acting up and and and it's hard I I just be honest it would be hard to respect someone that stays on video games uh uh when they get home it would be hard for me to respect a a man a man it's it's hard for me to do that you understand that that they would watch the movies on their phone and got all that cussing and swearing and all these things you understand what I'm saying amen I I what I would say is get right with God and really get converted until them desires leave you it'll make you so sick of it until you don't want it again can you say man for how are you going to lead amen if you ain't going to get respect out of your amen I I know you know uh uh men men sometimes get get it to where well you know I'm the head so you listen to me anyhow amen and and that's wrong too and you're going to answer for that ain't ain't that right see there is a conduct men are to be spiritual heads of their home it's it's sickening when a man's supposed to be the head of their home and and and and letting her family stay home from church it's disgusting it's sickening and I just believe it's if it's sickening to God as well amen that that uh you know that the the man will teach their children that work is more important than the house of God damn and and the same see Christians have got a conduct have got a character that they've got to display Amen to show the path that they're walking on you can't walk the path of righteousness and disobey God's word well it's true so now brother Branham would tell us see you you see yourself conducting yourself unlike a Christian if you see yourself conducting yourself unlike a Christian then you know that that's wrong can you say man well how am I supposed to conduct like a Christian because I watch system so and so or I watch Brothers well you should be honest you should you young people should be able to watch our elders amen and see how they behave in the house of God you should be able Amen to watch the Elder sisters how they treat their husbands and and and what's the the the the the these uh older men and how they rule their house and and they're not just bullies and and all these things but yet they're leaders ain't that right you should be able to watch them things amen but a lot of times you can't because a lot of people are just so backslid and lukewarm and and they're going to do just what they're going gonna do amen so so let's get it back to the word amen you see yourself conducting unlike a Christian you know that's wrong ain't that right be why why would you know it's wrong for one the spirit of the Lord would convict you for that ain't that right amen see and hopefully you got a preacher that'll condemn them things amen but look go back and check up with god with his word here with this book and get right with God can you say Amen so you don't don't you you see someone acting you know some sister treating her husband and bossing him around and all that don't you look for that as a pattern look for the word of God can you say Amen you see someone just missing church and disregarding the house of God don't you look at that as a pattern young people you look at God's word amen and study it by the word of God can you say amen amen there's a conduct you young men amen you hanging around these other men that hate man all they do is watch their videos and play their games and and then they just talk they don't talk anything about the lord they're just just talking about all kinds of nonsense and breeding demons whether it's in their home in their truck on the job or whatever don't you look at that as a as an example amen there is a word to file like can you to say man and I pray that you would be able to look at our deacons amen and say that's an example right there I pray that you can look at our Our Song leaders and say that's an example right there I pray that you can look at this old preacher amen and say I want to be like that that's an example there can you say man I pray that you can look at us our Elder sisters amen and see some Godly examples that say that's what I want to be wow there's a conduct there's a character and it reflects the path you're on but not only do our thoughts and actions reflect the path we're walking in but our decisions reflected as well every decision that we make as I've told you many many times through the years you're Christian when you make a decision you do not make it upon anything but you're a Christian are you listening to me people make these decisions and expect amen expect you know and come up with these excuses why they made the decision except expect it to be okay they'll take their families away from the house of God and move hours away from the house of God and then they didn't come into church they ain't just whenever they can they got you know uh uh children that need God and all of these things amen that that to me you didn't make that decision as a Believer can you say amen I think as a Christian amen I don't care where you're going to move to I just don't care be at a church whether it's this church whether it's the church next door or whatever be faithful in the house of God Amen support that Pastor support that Ministry amen lift up their hands amen when trouble tries to come around there be the first to stifle that trouble amen and say let's pray about it can you say man let's be an example of the believer ain't that right so now David makes it clear to us that he is being led in the in the paths of righteousness not only by telling us that he is but let's watch the decisions he made notice what he said in in Psalms 101 and there's a lot more but I got a lot scriptures to go so I'm not going to to go in all of it but he says Psalms 101 3 I will set everybody say I will set no Wicked thing before mine eyes and you say Amen this was not optional to him he was walking in the paths of righteousness and he knew this was not the conduct of a believer hello see he's walking and in the paths of righteousness and as he's walking he's getting closer to God and you know as he gets closer to God he's getting further and further away from the world it's true he's departing that from that which is wicked first Samuel 24 13 tells us that wickedness proceeds from the wicked wickedness does not proceed from the righteous ain't that right wickedness proceeds from the wicked then then it must go to show that righteousness proceeds from the righteous if wickedness comes from Wicked then righteousness comes from righteous ain't that right now notice proverbs 10 16 the labor of the righteous tendeth to life notice that the labor of the righteous tendeth to life everything that a righteous man does is for life can you say Amen but the fruit of the wickedness to sin so the labor of the righteous tendeth the life the fruit of the wicked descend ain't that right fruits of the wicked sin labors of the righteous life ain't that right so the labor the righteous labor labor to stay in life labor to produce life labor to Project Life can you say man I I hope this is okay now look Psalms 91 and 9 because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation now what's he saying a decision was made ain't that right if you look brother Branham had to make them decisions ain't that right and every one of us have to make the decision yes sir so because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation look at the blessings there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any player come neither thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways now do you understand what that means that does not mean that it's going to be a life of luxury a walk of of ease and on all that but this is one good thing about it you will not be destroyed you will not despair you will not come to not for on these Paths of righteousness are the Angels of God with that believer now as we said there are basically two paths to walk according to Jeremiah 21 8. and there is there is what the Bible calls the way of death Jesus said it is a broad way which leads to destruction we talked about it last Wednesday and the other path is a way of life which is as Jesus called a narrow way but it leads to life Jesus said I am the way the truth the life amen he's the word ain't that right so last last Wednesday I I spoke about the contrast between the two paths the Broadway is a way of Darkness and many there be which go in there at but notice God gives a warning in Proverbs 14. in or not into the path of the wicked now now as he's reading this then apparently he's he's doing more than just assuming he knows that whoever he's talking to which is us we know what is the path of the wicked we know God sent us a prophet we know can you say man the book has been open we know right so inner not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men avoid it pass not by it don't even get close right turn from it and pass away if you go to the 19th verse The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness they know not at what they stumble so it's a way of ignorance of Darkness blind Psalms 82 5 speaks of the wicked and says they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness they know not they perceive not and neither do they understand and neither will they understand they just walk on in darkness it reminds me of a couple scriptures but of first of all Hosea 7 and 8 Ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people Ephraim is a cake not turned strangers have devired his strength and he knoweth it not yay gray hairs are here and they're upon him yet he knoweth it not ain't that right he's weak and he don't know it he's gotten old and he don't know it now Ecclesiastes 10 15 the labor of the foolish weary of everyone because he knoweth not how to go to the city now I thought of that as I was just pondering and I wasn't trying to come up with something it just came there is a city that John spoke of right the Bible even says Abraham look for that City and yet we've got the foolish that is is wearing everyone for he's laboring to get there and yet he knoweth not how he has the Bible he has the message he has the faithful Ministry that God himself has placed in the body and yet he knoweth not how to go to the city now that that that's just the thoughts that come to my mind now here are other scriptures that speak of those who walk the way of Darkness Psalms 92 and 5 oh Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish now I looked up that word brutish it means foolish stupid so a foolish a Brutus foolish stupid man no it's not now notice what he says O Lord great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish foolish stupid man noeth not neither does a fool understand this they just this they they just regard God as just someone of him but his ways are deep his thoughts are great his works are great and yet that foolish ignorant man understandeth is not blames God for everything yet doesn't even believe in his existence most of the time unless he needs someone to blame right so thinking of this of not knowing way of darkness in Revelations 3 15 Jesus speaks to this laodicean age saying I Know Thy works right Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I'm rich and increase with Goods now notice this they're saying this and and and and and so and have need of nothing and no it's not everybody's saying no it's not so these people are walking the wicked path a way of Darkness they know it's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked ain't that right they say they're right but God says you're not they say God is with us God says I'm not they say we're walking the Christian path God says no it's not ain't that right so if the whole if the spirit of God knows that these people are lukewarm then it would go to show that Holy ghost-filled people know what the difference between hot cold and lukewarm as well if the spirit of the age is crying again out in this age what do you think that spirit is that you got hope you understand you say well I got the Holy Spirit and live in lukewarm nonsense for the holy spirit says I condemn that thing the Holy Spirit they're telling God we're okay and God's answering back no you're not I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth then wouldn't that go to show that The Same Spirit that is crying out at these people Amen in this layout of sin age if that spirit is in you it would cry out the same so see hear the holy spirit in this age is contradicting what they're saying because why why is he contradicting he's the spirit of Truth they're not speaking truth the spirit of Truth is crying out and telling it just like it is you're blind you're wretched you're naked you're miserable I don't care what you tell me this is what it is because it was the spirit of Truth ain't that right and believers who are filled with the Holy Spirit know the difference no matter how much people say they have a genuine experience with God people that are filled with the Holy Ghost know the difference Watch The Life watch the conduct come on now you say well you're talking too hard if you've got the same spirit of God that is crying out in this age it'll it'll do you the same that same Spirit can't tolerate lukewarmness that same Spirit cannot let's just say it that the Holy Spirit does not like professions he just can't stand the fact that people can't get over the pornography he just can't stand the fact that people can't get over their selfish ways he can't stand the fact that people just so materialistic minded money-minded everything about this world and they'll make sure they're there on time on the job come to the church they walk in late constantly all right man all it is is laodicea but the Holy Spirit cries out against it and you say Amen so see the believer is not walking in darkness why he has the spirit of Truth do you understand church if we had not the spirit of Truth what do we do we accept homosexuals like all the other churches are doing we have broken up families broken motherhood like the world has not if we have the spirit of Truth it'll keep motherhood alive in the home ain't that right it keeps dad as the head of the home it keeps dad as a spiritual man in the house ain't that right keeps Mom and Dad praying for them children true why we're walking paths of righteousness who's leading us a goat is a goat leading us to slaughter absolutely not it's the spirit of Truth oh is okay but this is why the elect of God will not be deceived they're not going to be deceived can you say man so notice how dangerous this way of darkness is Proverbs 9 13 a foolish woman now woman in the Bible symbolizes Church so a foolish woman is clamorous and and so I I believe this types out not just the natural of course brother Brown says look at the natural and you'll you'll see the spiritual as well implication so a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city to call passengers who go right on their ways whoso is simple let him turn in hither you know simple without understanding and as for him that wanteth or lacks understanding she saith to him stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is Pleasant but he knoweth not that the Dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell Direction ain't that right and I would say to you many there be that go in there at now notice the paths of righteousness is what Jesus called the narrow way it is the way of light and few there be that find it is this all right brother Graham said the paths of righteousness were Paths of light and life is that right now in proverbs 4 8 Solomon called this path the path of the just it's as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day so if you notice the light gets brighter as we walk not dimmer it gets brighter it gets stronger not weaker ain't that right so now notice II Samuel 22 and 29 for thou art my lamp oh Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness so Thou Art remember the Lord is the shepherd he's the one that's leading Us in the paths of righteousness he does not lead he's not the one leading in the way of Darkness amen he does not lead people to where you know they have no understanding now come on Church I don't care how long you've been serving the lord if the Lord is leading you there's something about it you will start getting understanding right I've met people they say well oh you know we're just getting too deep too deep too deep not here but other places they get onto the preachers for studying too much and preaching deep things just stay with simple Jesus loves me if you're walking in the paths of righteousness he the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all everybody say all all truth so the Lord will lighten my darkness John 12 35 Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk everybody say walk while you have the light less Darkness come upon you you refuse to walk in the light the darkness will come as I said you cannot remain the same you either walk in the dark in the light or Darkness you will walk in darkness can you say amen and I tell you what I appreciate the message of the hour I appreciate the Revelation that God has sent us can you say amen and we must not take that for granted because you could sit in a message Church Without understanding you can focus upon the world you can focus upon the wrongs you could focus upon the negative of the Church of the world of the politics you can focus on the on the negative of the of the of the music you can let everything else bother you and you could come to church and sit in darkness without understanding why you feel your mind up you feel your heart you feel everything up and fill yourself up with everything else that does not matter has no concern whatsoever amen hello walk while you have the light less Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth now are we ones that know where we're going I hope you do I'm going in a rapture I I know there's a millennium head that I know just any day where we're going to break through to this thing we know where we're going all right while you have light believe in the light that you may be children of the light can you say Amen so one walks in darkness which is a sign that there is no understanding revelation they walk in darkness they're not seeing the word manifested it's it's remember that's what light is is the word of God made manifest that's why we we look at brother Branham we can identify him as Malachi 4 not because he said he was there's all kinds of guys out there that that we could have followed and and the followers of Jim Jones the follower of David koresh the followers of of John Alexander dowey and and all this I thought he he thought he was Elijah amen but we're not we're not as those that are walking in darkness we we've seen the light because we've seen scriptures come to life can you say Amen so so we find one walks in darkness a sign that there is no understanding the other walks in light showing that there is an understanding a a revelation ain't that right so Proverbs 15 and 9 and I'm getting ready to close but it says The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination I don't care how religious it is their actions their conduct their way of living is is its Abomination but he that followeth after righteousness he loveth so what kind of people are walking on this path of righteousness people of understanding Colossians 4 6 let your speech be all the way with Grace season with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man first Thessalonians 4 2 4 you know see you're not in the class North at not for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor can you aren't you glad you know we know see we're not on the extreme of of legalism we're not in the extreme of this way of making Grace a disgrace we know amen how to possess our vessel I hope this is all right second Thessalonians 3 and 6. for now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he hath received of us for yourselves know how you ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ain't that right so see there is a people that know they they know it's not because they're smarter than others it's because they're walking in the path of light are you with me they're not turning themselves into blindness no no no Darkness has not come upon them gross Darkness has not come upon them amen but yet in in the grow and the hour of gross Darkness upon the Earth and upon the people it would say but arise and shine amen for thy light has come ain't that right so walk in the light while you have the light that you may be Children of the light and as you're the children of the light you're walking in the light then you know the difference between right and wrong you know how to possess your vessels you know as we go along in the other services you you and in teaching or talking on this you'll understand that Jesus stayed with the word because he knew what was written of him and he was he he was Meek he was a lamb he was humble and his whole purpose was to do the will of the father right so he stayed with the word so he wasn't saying well I'm I'm here to do the will of the father and then not knowing what the wheel was but he was walking in the light for he was the light but then he turns around says but you are the light can you say man you're the light Children of the light now notice again we're not a people that that living life and not knowing knoweth that not no that's not us first John 5 18 we know I like how they just put these certainties there we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one toucheth him not and we know how many knows that we are of God see and another thing we know that John says the one the other thing that we know is the whole world lieth in wickedness so so that there there's no gray area ain't that right we know that we're children of God sons of God we we know that we're born of God we we we know these things and yet we know that the world is lying in wickedness my a lot of people don't know that lay Odyssey if people don't know that and go on in the 20th verse what does he else does he say and we know everybody's say and we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true I'm so glad we're not in the class of North if not that we are in the class of we know we know that the Son of God Has Come we know that he is true can you say man he's given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we know we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life notice what John 15 15 Jesus would say and I don't know this you meant something special to me yet he says hence to Jesus is saying henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends oh look at even the Walk we're not walking as strangers we're not walking as a servant he even he changes the the our relationship those that are walking in the paths of righteousness he calls friend not stranger because the stranger knoweth not what his Lord does but he says I call you friends for all things everybody say all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you what a relationship I hope it helps as I get ready to close in Deuteronomy the 28th chapter one of the things that God told Israel would happen if they turned aside from his word and you ought to go and read that 28th chapter but one of the things that God told them would happen if they turned aside from his word was Thou shalt grope at noon day as the blind gropath in darkness turn aside from my word and this would be what will happen you will grope in the noon day as the blind groupeth in darkness and again Jesus tells or God tells them the Commandment is turned not to the left turn not to the right stay in the path and and as I I read this uh um this tells us then that the paths of righteousness is a balanced way because he tells us don't go left and don't turn aside to the right stay right there it's a balanced the middle of the road ain't that right now we can't stay in the middle of the road without a prophet you start being led by Sensations you start being led by your feelings you start being led by whatever emotions you have and you will either go this way or you'll go that right this route stay with that message can you say man that's right see so the bride of Christ is walking in the middle of two extremes in the middle of the road stands the bride of Christ walking between two extremes right now brother Brandon says right in the middle of the road there's a true sound where's it at in the middle of the road there's a true sound unadulterated gospel and power of God that's right see right down through there taking the Kings and monarchs where where anybody can stand and search and they can see if it's the power of almighty God uh see that it's the power of almighty God not a fanaticism not a formality it's the power of God and where is it in the middle of the road ain't that right I'm going to close but I hope it's the help I hope it's all right Proverbs 15 10 correction now notice correction is Grievous to him that forsaketh the way when a man turns aside in all reality he's gone the way of Darkness correction is Grievous unto him and he hateth he that hateth reproof shall die there's one thing about children of God they love reproof they love correction because what's the purpose of it keeping us balanced keeping us on the straight and narrow ain't that right but a person that don't care about the things of God they don't care truth they don't want to know they don't they they don't care about how they conduct and and how they they that about their thoughts or their nature or their character they they're not out to build they're it's only a kingdom for themselves they're not here for their own to build their character because if you build character there's a lot of shaping and there's only one character that will be accepted and that's the character of Jesus Christ which is word right and so a person that is not interested in building the character and moding that character and that nature and their conduct and everything to the word of God in other words walking the paths of righteousness then reproof he hates that reproof correction becomes Grievous to him and be honest it's because there's a rebelling and Rebellion is the sin of witchcraft right so there is a quite a a contrast quite a contrast between the two paths and if you'll notice each path affects those who walk in it first Samuel 2 and 9 says he will keep the feet of his Saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail if you look in John 8 12 Jesus said I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life can you say man do you love the Lord if the musicians will come I've got a lot more to go but I I don't want to keep you I appreciate your patience but we find that Jesus promised that the spirit of Truth when he would come he would lead and guide us into all truth ain't that right and we know that's Jesus Christ himself where he said I'm the great Shepherd so you don't have two leaders you have one Proverbs 2 6 and I'm going to read this here chapter that Proverbs 2 6 it says for the lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler looked up that word buckler it's a shield protector he is a protector a shield to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints aren't you glad he's preserved it now how would he have done that through Malachi 4. through the opening of the seals he's come to he preserved the way it had been so contaminated throughout the ages and the church ages and we we wouldn't have known what to believe but he preserved the way can you say Amen he preserveth the way of his Saints then then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and Equity yay every good path when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul discretion that word discretion means good judgment able to make responsible decisions now look where we have come to church we we've not come to infant children we are we've come to maturity this is the age of maturity and and you you and I know good and well the difference of responsibility that a little child would have versus an adult totally different responsibilities and and here so so we're finding that when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy soul good judgment discretion one that is able to make good decisions responsible decisions shall preserve thee and understanding shall keep thee in other words you're not going to be wrapped up somewhere I wish I wish I could just talk to the world about that wish I could talk to so many young people when you see them starting to head off of a path and you know if God by God's grace if they don't if somehow he doesn't get their attention they're going to go off somewhere and then the Perez and end up in in a mess but here he says see the understanding shall keep thee discretion shall preserve thee you're not going to go to get to the end and only to find out you run in vain why you've been able to make responsible decisions you've been able to make good judgment for you're walking the paths of righteousness can you say man so discretion shall preserve the understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speak it forward or perverse corrupt things can you say Amen oh God bless you amen pray that it was a help to you tonight made some sense I love the Lord Lead Me Lord I will follow Lead Me Lord
