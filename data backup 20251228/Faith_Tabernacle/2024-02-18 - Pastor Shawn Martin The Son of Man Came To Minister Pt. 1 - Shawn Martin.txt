Junior and sister Brooke would like to come amen uh bring them in bring them in bring the little of s bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] [Laughter] Jesus amen I'd like to uh just read the U scripture here in Mark 10 and 13 but it says and they brought young children to him to Jesus there and that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God and verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them you know brother brandom talking of the um of this he said you know Christ may not be here in in flesh he said but we represent him here this morning and um I think it's an honor that we're able to to uh bring our children at the beginning of their lives and dedicate them to the Lord starting them out on the right foundation and of course dedication doesn't uh save them but it starts them on the road right Road and and brother Junior and sister Brook being Christian parents and determin determining to have a Christian Home their desire is to uh present their little one here to the Lord as he has given them to give him back to the Lord and and um just asking God to protect him and amen praise the Lord now this little guy is just a handsome fell amen now if he'll just not cry while I'm holding him will be all right amen but we can just pray and ask the Lord to to help this child father Lord we stand here as helpless individuals Lord in our human efforts Lord and dad and mom they realize that as well there's times Lord that we as parents are just perplexed we don't have all the answers and especially in this day and age Lord there's so many things that are battling our children not only our children but Mom and Dad Lord we Satan just comes in every direction that father we come humbly before you and Mom and Dad here comes humbly Lord before you asking Lord that you would take their child Lord and that you would just keep him and protect him father that you would bless his little life Lord even from this this age Lord just a uh couple weeks old Lord and that you would just put your hand upon him and direct his life Lord and that you would Prosper him Lord not only in the physical natural real but in the spiritual realm Lord that you would just uh use him if he were to grow up Lord I don't know how much longer we have on this Earth but father that you would use him to win souls for you Lord that you would walk with him that you would talk with him Lord and when the Temptations of life would come that you would protect him Lord oh Father we're just asking it and I pray Lord that you would be with brother Junior and sister Brook father grant them the wisdom them Lord when they come up against um challenges Lord I pray Lord that you would just help them to always lean to you father oh we ask it father bless their home in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise the Lord amen God bless you Sister Brother in oh bring them in praise the Lord bring them in well do you love the Lord from the fields of or bring them in oh bring bring them in bring the little ones to Jes [Music] Jesus amen let's just stand to the reading of the word of the Lord amen as the prophet told us it's it's out of respect and so if you can stand stand to the reading of the word the um the musicians can be dismissed and before we go into the word uh I do want to say that brother Mike walls is having his annual meeting uh March 15th through the 17th and um this will be his 27th annual meeting and uh brother Danny steeman is to be ministering and so if you can go I know you'd be blessed uh by going and we certainly love and appreciate brother Mike and um uh just a good brother uh there and uh doing a work there in um in I guess near Washington and um so uh I know you'd be blessed and you'd be a blessing Amen to him as well uh The Book of Matthew the 20th chapter and uh going to start at the 20th verse praise the Lord uh Matthew 20 and 20 it says then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what will thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons May sit the one on the right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto them you shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority over them but it shall uh not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever shall be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen let's just bow our heads and ask the Lord to be with us today Father Lord we know that your word is is already anointed it's it was given by inspiration but Lord we're asking that you would Inspire us Lord not only me that it would be speaking but also the hearing Lord and that you would just Elevate us into a Heavenly atmosphere father and that you would open the scriptures unto us father and Lord that you would give us the words to say and Lord Lord may it just be an edification to your people Lord and that we when we leave this place we'd be drawn closer to you and more determined Lord to to serve you father I pray Lord that you would forgive us of all of our sins and our failures Lord and father we commit this service into your hands those that are sick and are afflicted father in their bodies father I pray that you would touch touch them Lord make them whole is our prayer we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can have your seats this morning amen and [Music] um I want to uh just talk along the lines of ministry and um I I can't seem to get away from this this thought and um but uh when we thinking of minister to minister it is to wait upon others to serve the need of others to supply what is needed to care for so that that's what Minister uh uh to to minister to waiting upon others to serve the need of others to supply what is needed and and to care for and so uh Jesus in speaking of the parable of the Good Samaritan he he he gives us an idea of what Ministry is or what it is to minister and you know he talks about the Good Samaritan walking along the the road and he he finds this man that had been uh robbed and and been beaten and been left to die and he he talked of how that there was the the priest that had walked by and looked at him and just kept going on and and he talked about the levite that had come and looked at him and and saw him in his condition and just kept on walking and uh they did nothing to help but the the Samaritan looked upon this man and and had compassion and you know what what it it takes compassion uh to minister it it it uh when when there's no uh compassion then there's no Ministry and we know that brother brandham separated human compassion to Godly compassion and and uh uh so so this man uh uh the Good Samaritan had a a Godly compassion and uh you know brother brand I'm talking about this compassion he said Godly compassion it's in the reals of the spirit which means to do the will of him that sent you and so in another place he said you know people say that Jesus was full of compassion and he was but Godly compassion not not human sympathy but Godly compassion and and he says see human sympathy just throws everything in a puddle it just it just puts everything in in one lump sum but this this Good Samaritan uh he didn't you know he didn't have this uh uh uh type of compassion uh just to sit there and and and and talk to him and try to you know befriend him but just leaving him there and uh getting acquainted with him and and maybe getting to know his name and his telephone number and and all that and then walking away but there was a compassion to to to help this man and and so you know the church claims to have compassion the the natural but uh but we find that the natural Church doesn't have the type of compassion that this Samaritan uh uh had uh because they're they're leaving the people lay where they're at without the the the burden to restore them back to Sons and Daughters of God and and and so this this this Samaritan as as as Jesus said um uh he he bound up this man's wounds and and poured Jesus said he poured oil and and wine uh in into the wounds and of course uh uh the oil represents the Holy Spirit and and we know what wine represents it's it's it's stimulation of Revelation and and so uh uh this is what Good Samaritan is today is is pouring the oil you know he he had oil and wine which which uh that's that's what he was using to minister to to this uh uh uh this this this poor man and and and so there's all kinds of ministry but the church to to Really depict this and or be be this uh uh have the ministry that this this Good Samaritan had they've got to have the oil and the wine excuse me and and then the Bible says that that the Good Samaritan picked this man up and he set this man on his own Beast the Good Samaritan set this this man on on his his his beast and and we know what Beast represents it represents power so it wasn't a political power that the Good Samaritans set this man on it wasn't the Church power or uh whatever but he set him on his own his own power that the power that he was riding on he set this man on on that power and and and so uh uh the church has a a different Power uh uh so that's part of the ministry is is putting him on the in this hooking him up so to speak with the same power but uh uh he brought him to to an in which the prophet he said that the in was the house of God and and took care of him and then as he was fixing to leave he he gave two pence um uh to the inkeeper um uh which brother Bram says the inkeeper the pastor and and and and he gave the two pence and which was he said represented the spirit and the word amen uh not not programs and and not not uh talents but but the thing that he gave him was the spirit and the word amen and and told him to take care of the man and if he needed anything else he would give it to them uh when he came ain't that right and so uh brother brandom said you don't have to worry about you know the minister uh he's already been paid you know and and and and so he's paid to take care of of of of the the individual and and I I think that that goes with every minister of the Gospel that that sets behind the the the sacred desk or stands behind this the sacred desk is is is the spirit and the word ain't that right so so uh Christian Life the Christian life is all about ministering to others and uh this has just been something on my heart for for a long time and uh and and I pray that it'll it'll help us in some way but God has given us the ability uh to influence others and I've been listening to uh brother Brandon preached several sermons on influence and excuse me but he he didn't just preach one sermon but he preached several of them which which tells me there there's a reason that he's preaching it and he's he preached it right before the SE opening of the seals and then he preaches it after the seals and so it's something that uh God is is trying to get to us and and and so he uh God gave us the ability to be an influence and this word influence means to impact uh to affect to sway others by what we do how we act what we say it's it's an influence and so most of us all and and I I'll just say all of us are going to be an influence in one way or another uh by the way we live by how we act by what the things that we say uh uh because as the prophet said somebody is watching your life amen and and and help us God someone is watching us and and no matter if we don't want to be involved in the church no matter if we don't want to be involved with people or whatever somebody is going to watch us uh in in whatever way true uh we no matter how isolated you want to be or or involved or whatever you're being watched and so uh brother BR says then when we profess that we're Christians then that magnifies it magnifies of the of what people are going to watch for and so he says see what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us the moment we say we're Christians and and and and we'll even say it the moment we say we go to church well that's going to identify you that you're supposed to be a Christian if you're going to church the moment you you you uh uh so he says and your life life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody see and so they know as what he says now their Eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do for they watch you now brother brandham said in one place a lot of time people won't go to church but but they'll watch you they won't read the Bible but you'll be the Bible that they'll you may be the only Bible that they'll ever read amen is you so so and and so uh uh you know as parents we we we I think it starts at the home that that parents uh uh we we we the brother Brown you know and we all know it so it ain't no new revelation we may just try to keep it as a secret but our worst and our best that we live is at home how we how we live uh it's going to be our our worst and best will be manifested at home because that's that's that's our home we're more relaxed there we're more that's that's where we're at every day you know and and so then then our children our children uh uh uh are watching us he says even though that they may act like they're not but they are noticing it they notice everything that we do so you know a lot of folks say well if I could just you know uh if I could just be an evangelist out in the world and evangelize the whole world well you know I don't know what it is but we'll get there uh brother brandom said you may not be called to uh uh uh how how was he said this uh to make his reputation known around the World by by ministering the gospel but you can make his reputation known by your life right now God may have not called us to to evangelize Around The World God may have not even called us to be an evangelist period uh and to minister behind uh other pulpits or whatever but a lot of times we we we forget that even the greatest influence that we could ever have is at at home because our wife is watching our children are watching or we could say our husband is watching our children are watching and and so but but so he says see don't don't never think that the children are are not watching or the wife ain't watching or or that that you you you're not impacting the home uh because they are watching they're they're watching everything I i' I've lived away from home for for many year now and and and I still watch my parents I I their life still affects me by by how I see them in their troubles and in their trials and this Parkinson that Dad has has had and I've watched him I've I know that he's been uh a true true man I've seen him in his flaws I've seen more flaws in my dad than anyone would know uh because I'm I'm his child and so we've seen behind the scenes of thing but what has stood out more than anything is he was a man of God and he reflected Christ and so now I'm looking and I see him in his condition and and and and and you know basically if God doesn't do anything for him in the way of healing him he's got a death sentence it's a it's a slow death but it's it's just what it is and and so you see him deter deteriorating but every time I'm around him he talking about prayer and how we need to pray more and and and and how that he just loves the Lord and and and he's confident and and and always just talking about the things of God well see that's an influence in my life that that if and I always pray God God if I go through things don't let me complain and I know I have complained and I know I have shed tears and I'm not saying that he doesn't go through struggles I'm not saying he doesn't go through his depressions and and things like that and there's times that you know uh uh I I will you know send a text and because he can't talk much so I send a text and I'll just send scripture or quote or just something positive he says I needed that you know thank you I needed that see so so uh uh but but uh there's an influence and but brother BR says it's not only the children that watches it's our neighbors that are watching he said everyone that you're associated with they're they're they're watching you people at your church are watching you uh uh the times that you know the people miss the times that people you know uh have lousy excuses as to why they can't come to church well they're being watched you know and and when they're Church hopping and going here and going there instead of at their post of Duty and well the people are watching it's everything is is an influence and and uh um you know people you do business with they're watching the children that you go to school with they're they're watching your life especially when you say I'm a Christian well they they're looking for something that would set separate you from their worldly Associates so they're they're really watching and a lot of times they'll antagonize you sometimes they'll test you sometimes they'll make fun of you just to get a reaction and see what kind of a genuine Christian you really are see because it's an influence people at the grocery store wherever you go they're watching you and and and so therefore it should keep us on our toes uh uh as to what things we say and and and what we do and what we listen to how we act and and and these things we should not be one to try to fit in with what they're doing amen they tell the dirty jokes we shouldn't laugh with that we shouldn't we shouldn't try to uh to make them feel comfortable around us in the sense that we don't want to stand out amen God called you to stand out and if you're ever going to have a positive act uh influence on a people's life you've got to be the one to stand out can you say Amen there's a lot of Christians out there that are smoking and cussing and swearing well you know their influence is so wrong that people don't want that anymore am can you say Amen they don't want to go to church anymore they don't want to believe in a God that can't keep they're looking for influence that is something greater than what they have seen and so we should as the prophet says we should always try to reflect Christ in everything everybody say in everything that we do see not just in the public eye but as at home as as well and and and brother brandom had a model uh uh plaque that that had a model that he hung up in his home that says go no place that you would not want to be found if Jesus should come don't don't say anything that you wouldn't want to be saying if Jesus could come don't you be watching things that you wouldn't want to watch if Jesus would come see and and we know that Jesus is coming but more than anything we should be such a a a conscience of the presence of God With Us that we would be very careful with what we say because we know he's listening he knows the very thoughts that you think he knows the very words that you think he knows the very motive and the intent of our heart amen and the problem the prophet said is people do the things they do because they're not conscience that God is watching they're not conscious that God is listening they're not conscious that God knows the very thoughts that they entertain amen see and so therefore there's always there there there's always two ways to doing things and that's the right way and the wrong way ain't that right brother Ram talks about his son Joseph who was eight at the time and and the boy you know he got in a fight with another boy and and the boy had uh stepped on Joseph's toes and and and so they got in the fight and brother Bram told him says you know Joseph don't don't don't do that see but he says but Daddy he did such and such you know and and he says but and and and brother BR tells but that doesn't matter see what that boy did just remember Joseph he said do you love your father yes Daddy he said well then remember that people are going to look at your life now notice how he's starting 8 years old and he's already teaching this his boy that you're going to be an influence at 8 years old there's going to be people watching and and he say see he says that they're going to look at you your life as a minister son and then if you if you do anything wrong then they're going to say well does this Minister permit his child to do sex and sex see and and and brother brand said well see we know that there you know children are going to do wrong and all these things we know that see but he said to him he said see he said now that doesn't only reflect on you Joseph but it reflects on your mother it reflects on your sisters see and and and young people I want to say this you got Christian parents that are trying to do right that are trying to live right your actions reflects upon them as well can you say Amen see so he says it reflects on your father the very cause of the family that of what we're standing for then what we stand for see it reflects on Jesus Christ CU we're claiming to be him uh uh uh his his bride we're claiming to be uh United with him and then therefore it it reflects upon on Christ if we say we have the Holy Ghost and we live like a devil and and we act like a devil we talk and and we're looking at evil things and and we're just running at the mouth and we're throwing our little temper tantrums every time we turn around that we're treating our wife like she's just a bunch of trash and and our children and all of these things well then what are you doing you're reflecting Christ your actions are actually a reflection of what you claim to have within you ain't that right so see he says then what we stand for it reflects on that on Jesus Christ you don't want to do that see and I said see so our Lord told us see if somebody smites us on the on One Cheek just turn the other he well that's kind of a hard for a little boy with a high temper to begin with of such a things but he says but but place it before him anyhow that he should not do it can you say amen I have found uh you know sometimes when when their children are done wrong parents will go up there and say go slap him you know well you're teaching them wrong see place it before them I promise you they're going to do it anyhow you know uh uh when you're not looking how many times I guarantee you my boys have done it you know turning around just I have you know I remember you know uh I my dad was the principal he was the associate pastor and I was a real poor reflection you know on him you know uh uh especially when he ain't looking you know so he was he was somewhere else and actually he wasn't even there that day and so so some boy come up and and and said something to me and and and I just turned around and knocked the knocked him flat you know and and uh you know and and what I didn't realize as the teacher was sitting there watching and uh of course she went and told my dad you know and he let me know real quick that was a poor reflection you know on him you know and and uh uh but you know uh it's that way and and so but but but we we got to teach our children you know that that uh uh uh there's an influence with everything ain't that right now Galatians 6 and 2 it says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ bear everybody say bear ye one another's burdens bear ye one another's burdens don't be just bear yours now bear the other person's burdens see in other words think of what they're going to do think of what they're going to say think of what you're going to put them through think of think of things of uh uh how you know we don't want to be TR put trials on people amen we want to be able to help people ain't that right see Philippians 2 and4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others that's right see now the problem today is no one wants to be accountable to others and the reason why is because the Bible says they're lovers of their own self pleasure lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God fulfilling see what was prophesied of them and so this is where we're at amen how many people buy for themselves instead of buying for other people you know and and they just putting it all on themselves all on themselves and they leave everybody else you know they can leave their own family in in in poverty and and they're buying this and they're buying that and they're buying this and it it has nothing to do except it has no value except what they want they'll buy this scope they'll buy this hunting gun they'll buy this camo they'll buy this you know and and and the families are living in poverty you see what it is it's a selfish selfish motives and and so uh but you know you see brother brandom said for a man to live to himself is to live for himself and the devil he said see if I live for myself I live for a a selfish life now now we we can find this selfishness in every part and and and I think every one of us can say that we we have an ounce of selfishness in us if if we're not careful how many of us husbands can be selfish and how many wives can be selfish how many children can be selfish amen see we become selfish in things and and when we do that then we're living for ourselves and it only shows that just how selfish we can be and we're living a selfish life now the prophet tells us that in for a man to be able to change amen because we're all born with this nature to be selfish it's all for me it's all for for my deal look what I have done look what I said look what I do look look look look how I act and and and you you you can make the bed or you can you know and or uh uh you you can do something small for somebody look at me see I'm the one that done that see and and and what it is it's it it's bringing out a selfishness you you understand what I'm saying see to we everybody oo and alls oh man he's a nice guy he really not now that that you know you understand what I'm saying but see we all have that type of a selfish nature within us see and and the only way for a man to change from being that way is to be born again Amen to be born again amen that's that's the only way that he'd be able to subdue that selfish nature amen see and and because New Birth brings forth new life ain't that right and brother Bram said in order for New Life to Come a sinner has to die and rought to his own ideas see he has to his own life has to die that old Sinful Nature has to die and Rod in order amen for New Life to grow out of it see the nature a new Nature has got to come so the old Nature has to first die and and to rot amen we have to die to our own thoughts and and rot so that God's thoughts can come in to us ain't that right so we can truly say and just just flat honest people ain't getting to a new birth amen as as they're claiming because they want to be entertained they they they are uh uh pleasure mad brother Brown called them pleasure mad people in in this day see if if if if it aches them to just to do some little thing if it's against their grain just to do something well they ain't going to do it nobody going to make them do it nobody going to tell them what to do you know they don't understand me you know well see it it's because there's a selfishness there that's why people don't don't have no burden for Souls anymore that's why people amen ain't witnessing to other people and telling them about God and and doing these things because they are so wrapped up in self and then put that in the church you understand what I'm saying so they not getting to a new birth they want to be entertained they are pleasure mad people they just want comfort and luxury brother Ram says see people walk about not knowing where they are going and seem to care less see just at leisure to go wherever they wish to and kind of pleasure seeking people see he's just about like he was when he left God at the Garden of Eden and was left to ship for himself he just simply leaves God out of the picture and just goes wherever he wishes to and kind of pleasure mad see this is what causes so much dissatisfaction in the home it causes dissatisfaction in the church it causes dissatisfaction on the job Amen to where the the boss has to meet every criteria of that individual or that individual is going to run him down and run the job down and run this and run that amen everything's got to be so perfect for that indiv idual the wife can't please him the husband can't please her and and and and children even children can't even please their parents or they the parents can't even please the children everyone is wanting to be pleased themselves and forgetting about Ministry ain't that right so there's so much dissatisfaction in the world and in the church and you know what what really the Bible calls them is unstable Souls unstable Souls looking for pleasure looking for entertainment looking to be pacified looking to be you know everybody to say the looking for the preacher to say the right things don't ever step on my foot you understand so they'll go Church to church seek it but the problem is amen let them sit there long enough and they're going to find every problem with that one so then they're going to run that preacher down they're going to run that Deacon down they're going to run that Saint down they're going to run that church down no one can be satisfied notice what Paul prophesied in 2 Timothy 4:3 for the time will come will they'll not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables of course fables is lies be turned to to lies where they actually believe the lie over the truth ain't that right so now the Amplified Bible says this for the time has coming when people will not tolerate or endure sound and wholesome instruction but having itching or ears itching for something pleading and gratifying this is what that itching ear means is they they're looking for something pleasing and gratifying they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number chosen to satisfy their own liking and to Foster the errors they hold see and and and so no one wants to be told wrong no one wants to be rebuked anymore no one wants to be corrected so they look for things or somebody that will allow them to Foster the false doctrines and the lies and the thing that they they're already holding you understand what I'm saying see because it's a self pleasure It's s uh uh lovers of self lovers of pleasure lovers and more than lovers of God but see the Christian life is not self a self-serving life now it is important for a man to find the right kind of church to attend so that's not being selfish that's actually watching out for a soul and for The Souls of his family that are depending upon Him brother br he would say this I wish this above all things that you hear tonight that who believes in your heart that you love the Lord and something has happened to you promise me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere a church that teaches the Full Gospel the power of God his resurrection join up with those people and make yourself a church home don't just Dray around loose on the streets go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God is made known and the signs of eternal life is in there the signs that was in Christ another place you go find a a good church somewhere that preaches the Full Gospel that believes in Divine Healing believes in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and there you find a good church of your choice and then settle down there and be a real servant to Christ ain't that right so don't come to a church don't settle that at that church and then expect all always be waited upon and attended to and pacified and all that find you a good gospel church now and and if you're going to find that it's going to rub your wrong sometimes amen because the Full Gospel always cuts and and it shapes us because the what God is doing with that Full Gospel is he's shaping stones to fit in his body can you say amen amen but if you find that type of a church support it and then settle down there and be a real servant now you're going to have a Ministry can you say Amen be a servant real servant to Christ now he says once you know brother Brown says see once you find that church he said I want you to be with your church support your church and help it help it ain't that right help it for the glory of God in another place if God is God he's worth everything you are if Christian religion is right it's worth everything you can do uh uh for it support your church support your pastor support your ministry or M missionaries do everything that's in your power to do and give God the best you've God can you say Amen so God didn't call us to be entertained God didn't save us amen for us to expect Amen to be pacified God called us that we could be part of a Ministry and be the best at it that we can amen throw yourself not everybody supporting you all the time but now you support something yeah put your put your all into it support your church support your pastor support your missionary do everything that's in your power to do and give God the best you've got another place brother Brown says I absolutely believe that every person should stand at their post of Duty when their Pastor there is preaching or evangelist or something I think they ought to stand at their posted Duty do you believe that you know one man told me said well I ain't got anything to do so that's not I ain't got a posted Duty yes you do you got to post a duty every time them Church doors are open you got to post a duty to be there if you're not preaching somewhere you need to be at your church if you're if you're if you're not out of town amen and and you're just going out of town for whatever you know be at your church can you say amen amen be at your post of Duty see they ought to support that church with everything they've got in them with their ties their offering with anything everybody say with anything they're called to do on to do be willing and happy don't be complaining see be willing and happy if your pastor asked you to do something in your church you should do it that's good but don't let that just be the only thing get inoculated first get the Holy Ghost first can you say Amen so see I read these quotes to let us know you're not only here to be fed you're here to uh uh uh serve ain't that right amen you're here to serve here to serve you know I uh uh uh so I I I want to say this because now I'm I hope you know that I'm not just preaching just to preach I I got a burden but it's not pointed to anyone I think I've got the best congregation on the earth uh right here I I think our church has done great things I think God has given me people willing to serve I thought of our tent meeting and and and and people just oo and they're just amazed someone tell me uh two days ago says your your church how how in the world they can do that put on such a meeting a big meeting with such uh with a small congregation and things but I I just be honest I've got a People amen that that want to help they want to be ministers they they they want to do their part they they want to be part of it they you of course you've got people that some people that don't but that's in every Church you know but uh uh uh uh but God has given us some great people that that want to put their all into it no they don't consider the tiredness they don't consider the the the time that is consumed they don't consider the fact that they're weary they know that God is doing something they're wanting to see God's people blessed they want to see Soul safe and what every little part they've got they want to do it with everything they've got within them amen see and and so I I certainly appreciate that uh uh from the bottom of my heart amen see brother brandom says this I want to live for others how many wants to live for others I want to live for others amen and and he says and give what strength I have you know I I thought of that you know I'm 50 and and and to be honest I I'm I I I don't know how many years I've got left but I know my as time is ticking I ain't got much energy left you know I mean 20 years 30 years but what is that you know what is time you understand what I'm saying we don't know brother Tim how much time we have but I I think God you know I I would hate to have a stroke and and not be able to do nothing and I'm still living you know I I would hate to to to be lamed uh in some way I'd hate that that somehow my vocal cords went out you you understand and I wouldn't be able to preach anymore and and and and and these things really uh come into my mind and and when it does come in my mind I think God let me do everything I can while I still have a voice let me do everything I can while I can still praise God Amen everything I can because there's going to come a day amen even even if God takes us home what record we have left what life that we lived will be our record do you understand what I'm saying I think it's brother Donnie you know that that said you know if if people would just live right and live a Christian it makes it easy for their funeral you know then I don't have to lie about things I don't have to say things that that ain't right you preached your own funeral your life has preached your own funeral you understand what I'm saying how many times we go to a funeral and you know that man was a saint I thought brother Walker for example you know and and it was the easiest thing to get up and preach amen because I I didn't have to wander about him I didn't have to I saw that man you know I've only known him 12 years but I saw that man go through scar he got scars and of losing his son and then and and the things that that man went through but the change and and he's still holding on to God every time you went up there he just talking about God wh people called him a fanatic people thought he was crazy people just looked at him as an old man I looked at him as a genuine Christian amen see but his life his life already preached his funeral see you are declaring your funeral right now you're preaching your own funeral by the life you live by the words you say by the energy you put in there's other times you wonder I wonder if they ever did make it and all that and you hear people say oh they've done this and they done that bless God they were really holy but then in our minds we all know that that wasn't the real case you you know good and well they didn't live that type of Life what they're saying behind the pull pit you know they didn't say that they didn't live that and you understand what I'm saying is you don't have to lie to a real about a real genuine Christian amen and I thought God let my life bear record of what I am let everything that's within me bear record amen of who I am that if there's no preacher to preach my funeral the people will know what I was brother Ram said I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God so you see we got to have a feeling for one another got to have a feeling for the Lost God have a feeling for those that are Wayward yes yes Ezekiel 9 and4 and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the forehead of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the mid thereof brother R said see he said we make so much emotion over our religious ideas all fuss and the fighting and the oh if someone doesn't agree boy we'll make a fuss there's you know there's churches that are split just over the carpet color of the carpet the painted walls and it wasn't their color it wasn't their kind of Pew it wasn't what they wanted it wasn't the song they sung it wasn't the musician that they wanted it ain't this it ain't the sermon that they wanted to hear and they actually walk out the church they'll split at church they'll do whatever they can see amen it's it's because we make so much emotion over our religious ideas but who is it in the city tonight in Jeffersonville that's so concerned about the Lost World in this last day that can even spend even spend 30 minutes a night praying for the sins of the city you understand what I'm saying amen see so so now if you notice our opening scripture the son of man did not come to be minister to but he came to minister he came not to be served but he came to serve now he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that so we believe that he's the same healer we know that he's the same savior we know that he's the same brother Brown said he's the same in in thought he's the same in power he's the same in motive he's the same in every which way but the Corporal body but who is his body today you and I ain't that right we claim to be that bride well if we're that bride we are his body we are the physical appearance of Jesus Christ on Earth that's right amen yes sir you ain't going to see him on on the earth in a physical body God never promised that you are his body we'll we'll be caught up in the in and caught up to meet our Lord in the air but until then we are that body ain't that right and when he comes into our body he has the same motive the same intentions the same attitude the same the same character he's got the same everything amen and and that's what it is to die out you got to die out to yourself in order for him to come in and then he he directs you he controls you why because he didn't come just to to as people think he's an emotion and they get some type of feeling on their on their flesh and they feel good and they say oh I got him no no no he didn't come upon your spirit to where you just feel good and you think a good thought and you and you know and all these things he come to live into that Soul which is the control tower ain't that right so now John 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know you shall know ain't that right not in imagination you shall know it ain't going to just be a teaching you shall know that I am in my father you in me and I in you he's the same praise God praise God hallu looking at his ministry his service was totally different from that of the church in his day his ministry was different from any other Ministry that man had the type of ministry that man has operates in the natural real such as hospitals insane asylums yes using medication psychology we see that man has come up with charity organization ations to help feed the poor and provide shelter for the homeless even the church has got into such things as programs and societies and charity functions to keep the people entertained to keep the young people out of trouble you know they have movie Nights just so to draw the young people you know they have all kinds of things there are Ministries in the church out of the church to help reform drug addicts and alcoholics there are ministers Ministries to help troubled teenagers and to help with marital issues man has established all kinds of programs and organizations and things to to help people with all kinds of addictions whatever if you're having uh thoughts of suicide just call the suicide hotline if you have emotional troubles there's you know uh I just heard uh you know last night that they got actually they got they got places of rooms to where if you're having problems with anger management that you can go in these rooms and and and it's it's so built to where you you can just go in there and throw things and just just let off your steam I mean break it whatever you whatever you want to do it's it's it's for you you know to handle your your anger so you don't go out and and throw throw your child or something see and and and uh they they've got all kinds they you know uh my wife is tell me she read where you know these these uh uh high up um they you know they they've uh businesses and things they they've got they got rooms cubicles where it's just soundproof that you can go in there and just scream you know uh to to let off the frustrations oh my what compassion people have today you know just to suit you so you don't yell at anybody just go in that little room scream all you want to it's it's relief you know well that's that's human that's human it's it's it's people are trying to fix people you understand what I'm saying and it's coming up with all kinds of things you know and and and they're all fine but they only deal with the outward manifestation and not the source of the problem you see it's a spiritual problem that people are dealing with yes there is a physical illness yes there is mental illness and and then there's that sickness of the soul but it's all demonology do you believe that amen you can call it cancer but the prophet would say it's a demon you can call it deafness but the prophet said it's a demon that's that's God on that nerve and it's cramping that nerve down you know it you we can call it parkon but it's it's a demon it's it it's a spiritual real and the doctors can't fix demons the the psychologist can't fix demons and and these things and so no matter how many hospitals we're building the sick are it's getting worse sickness more sickness after after another the more scientists they have and education and and and discuss iies and invention it it's still not fixing problems you understand what I'm saying the more psychology that we have and and the more insane Syms that we have they're filling up already and we still got them Lo running loose around here you understand what I'm saying see it's not fixing the problem doctors deal with the physical and mental state through medication surgeries and and and and and training and and all these things and yes it is a Ministry that that God does uh work Works through amen uh uh to heal amen medication doesn't heal God does the healing and and and all these things but but when it's all said and done the doctor is limited in what he can do and we all know that amen and and and so so most of the time you know a doctor can only help his patients just cope with the problem you know and and these things but see God has given his church you and I a far greater Ministry you don't have to be trained to be a doctor you don't have to be trained to be a psychologist you don't have to read all their books and and all of these things you don't have to know about natural medicines and and and all of these if you can get the power of God and get back to prayer and believing in the reality of God God never told us to build hospitals he never told us Amen to build such programs and and and all of these thing he told us that we can cast out Devils we can lay hands on the sick we can do something that is greater and have a Ministry far more effective than we could a natural Ministry when Jesus walked the Earth in his physical body there were millions of people in need and he came to supply the Need No Doubt there were many who were poor maybe no doubt there were those that were even homeless but he didn't come to create jobs for those who needed a job even though he could have done it he didn't come to give money to those who were poor even though he could have done it he didn't come to build charity organizations for those in need even though he could have done it but see he come to meet a greater need ain't that right a need that the government couldn't fix a need that even the natural Church couldn't meet doctors couldn't meet the need Psychology couldn't meet the need his ministry was different and far greater ain't that right according to Luke 19:10 he came to seek and save that which was lost not by passing Donuts not by passing coffee in the church hello Galatians 4:5 tells us that he was sent to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons what a Ministry according to 1 John 3 and5 he was manifested to take away our sins Luke 4:18 Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the Amplified Bible says the son of man came not to be waited upon but to serve to give his life as a ransom for many the price paid to set them free can you say Amen yet he didn't go into natural prisons he didn't go and have a meeting with the governor and the king and whoever and say set these people free come on he didn't loose the natural natural prisons there was a far greater prison that was holding the people can you say amen he didn't set the people free from Roman oppression that Roman government that they that was oppressing the Jews it didn't come to set them free from that that can you say Amen there was a greater oppression the people thought that what he would do they thought he would come as king and deliver them but notice Romans 15:8 Paul says now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy as it is written for this cause I will confess to the uh uh among the Gentiles or I will confess uh uh to thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name the Amplified says for I tell you that Christ the Messiah became a servant and a minister to the circumcised the Jews in order to show God's truthfulness and honesty by confirming verifying the promises that was given to their fathers can you say amen and also in order that the G Gentiles see might glorify God for his Mercy not Covenant it to them as it is written therefore will I praise your uh uh Praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to your name oh do you love the Lord amen see so he came not to be ministered to but he came to minister but if you notice he was sent he didn't go on his own he was sent amen that's I think that's a a a thing that you know very powerful thought is he was sent yeah he didn't go without being sent sent means he was commissioned he was directed He was ordered he was under a command right right well the body of Christ you and I there's not a person here that can be part of the body of Christ without having a commission the body of Christ has been commissioned Mark 16:15 he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature brother Bram said if you're not a minister then don't try to preach it not don't stand behind the pulpit he said you got a life your life is a preaching ain't that right right a minister he has to stand behind the pulpit and preach and live a life too you're called to live a life amen see preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe every one of us this scripture applies to every one of us that's exactly right that's why we should never have this mentality of being helpless and hopeless and don't know what to do and all of these things you have been commissioned get out of the selfishness amen amen hallu we expect God to do things without us inserting anything people don't pray no more true but they want everything God to do they want all the promises but but they they don't want to come into that mentality of ministry amen amen he that believeth and is baptized these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink deadly any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see our ministry is far different than passing out the Tylenol bottles far different than educating people on essential oils far different than educating people in in the medical field they got their job yeah but what about our job who are we hello what are we to do our greater ministry that's right so we have been sent to the world with a commission Jesus would never send his people without a commission I just don't believe that and notice he sends us the same way he he the father sent him Jesus sends us the same way the father sent him notice John 2021 Jesus said as my father has sent me so even so I send you and when he had said this he breathed upon them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost notice he get ready send them out but before he sends them he going to give them the Holy Ghost notice whosoever sends you or remit you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sends you retain they are retained can you say amen amen now how did the father send him by being with him by being in him he went with him and was in him can you say Amen see John 1412 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever things you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father May glorify the son be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen 2 Corinthians 5:18 and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ not by some program not by a psychologist amen not by the world's programs he reconciled us to God by Jesus Christ what a Ministry and hath given to us the same Ministry of reconciliation can you say Amen to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world how did he bring a Reconciliation God was in Christ amen not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors not for the government not for some organization but for Christ that's right Christ is the one that has ordered us Christ is the one that has commissioned us can you say amen amen yes sir now that see now we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us see when you speak it's God speaking can you say Amen see we pray you in Christ dead we're standing in Christ dead on the earth as his body be ye reconciled to God right Matthew 18:18 ver I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two or three two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask see it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them can you say Amen see so we as the bride of Christ has has something that the the Church natural the world does not have our ministry is so profound it's so much it it it just cannot be anyone people are trying to impersonate it but they're that's what they are they're impersonators God doesn't recognize that impersonation amen and and look where they're they're going with it they mislead people they lead people astray away from the word of God any impersonator that tries to impersonate will always lead people away from the word of God can you say Amen but when God send his bride there's something there that is genuine it's a genuine Ministry yes sir brother Brown talked of the precious Souls out on the street he's in his prayer and praying he's talking of the precious Souls out on the street who are looking and wandering and waiting to see the Life of Christ being manifested among God's people and he says see we may not he said we may not be able to influence the whole city hardly ever was that ever done because in there uh is the wheat and the tears they're gathered together see they are together see the wheat and the tears amen he said but then he said this he said Lord may we be so enthused may we be so enthused that we'll try to light one little candle each day by telling someone else doing something that'll influence others to know you to love you not to trust in doctors and and don't get me wrong I'm not against doctors we go to the hospital we we we take medicine all these things but we're not looking to them for our ansers if they're not The Miracle Worker you understand what I'm saying our job is to influence people to God to know that God Is A Healer to know that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen that they can understand and experience the same God that we've experienced ain't that right by telling someone doing something that'll influence others to know you and to love you for to know you is life oh do you love him our opening scripture shows us that in order to minister one must be a servant for Jesus being the son of man came not to minister to but to minister and notice in Philippians I believe 2 and 7 it says but he made himself of no no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross he took upon him the form of a servant and humbled himself yes and became obedient amen did he lose his power by doing so no did he lose his excellent see by doing so no did he lose his kingdom by doing so oh no he was God right God God he remained to be God and and and so a as Jesus said you know in Matthew 28:18 all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth why because God the all powerful one was in him amen the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in him ain't that right see and and so God veiled in a man and the word is God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us ain't that right so the prophet said God hid himself in human flesh he was the creator he was the I am that I am he was the the one that met that met Moses in the burning bush he was the fourth man in the fiery furnace he was the one that moved upon the waters of the Red Sea and part of them for his people he was that one wasn't a different God it was the same God that took on a form of a Man became a servant to man can you sayen he was the one that discerned and revealed the the secrets of the heart Amen to Abraham and to Sarah he was MDC can you say Amen but notice he healed the sick but he made no reputation for himself you know what the prophet says about it the doctor he comes with a fake arm and he has builds a reputation he becomes Wealthy by what he's invented they'll do this and they come up with something but when Christ came the god of Heaven he raised the dead and didn't build a reputation from it he didn't seek reputation he didn't do it for reputation he ministered to the thousands and he multiplied The Fish and Loaves but he didn't do it for reputation walked on the water but he didn't do it to seeking to build a reputation can you amen you think Matthew 15:30 great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at Jesus's feet and he healed them in so much that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the m to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of Israel can you say Amen the ministry was so humble that they didn't exalt a man they glorified God hallu what a Ministry Jesus said to the man with the paly arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and Mark 2:13 says and immediately he arose and took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified God saying we've never saw it on this fashion as soon as Jesus raised the young man from the dead the Bible says in Luke 7:16 and there came a fear upon all and they glorified God there come a respect there came a reverence upon the people that they glorified God it wasn't glorifying some man the old critics today saying that we glorify that man right there it ain't that man it's the god in that man but how many people how many ministers seek Glory from from people that's right they they they they've lost their burden I look at at doctors and and things and look where we're coming to today it's coming to where that that doctors and nurses and you wonder even why they're there they're rude right they're just sometimes they don't want to help you they they're just and what it is it's a it's become a job to them it's just become a way of money right people become doctors today not not for the help of the people but I don't know I'm saying not all of them is that way but the majority is becoming that way right is is because it's a money thing yeah see and they forget it's a Ministry can you say amen that's right and and it's becoming more and more but look at where it's coming in into churches even the same but see Jesus Jesus didn't live for himself he didn't seek fortune and fame he didn't seek comfort and pleasure he didn't seek popularity or big crowds and you say Amen as I close if he was living for himself he would have called 10,000 angels cuz he said he had them at his disposal he could have called them and he would have called them to set him free from the cross so he wouldn't have to have gone that way we know that even when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane right before he was arrested his flesh was screaming out father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but notice but nevertheless thy will not my will will thy will be done ain't that right if he was living for himself he would have never never taken the time to go out of his way to go by samarra to talk to that one little woman he would have stayed with the 5,000 10 thousands the thousands of crowds that were following him but a woman that didn't even know him didn't even understand who he was but he went anyways one individual cuz he wasn't living for himself he was doing the father's will sometimes we get Ministries so wrong I see it working among the young men of ministers a lot of them they want to be full-time evangelist they want to be like brother Andrew comes to a point that you know brother Andrew feels odd being around them cuz there's just a weirdness there because they wonder why he's that way and they can't be but the point is if you're a minister it doesn't matter if you're called to go to the nursing home and minister to one individual it's Ministry it's true Ministry is not all about standing behind the pull pit it's true very true getting out on the streets passing out flly letting people know what God is doing witnessing amen it's it's it's all Ministry can you say Amen see so so if Jesus was living for himself you would have never you know you you would have never saw him going up that hill reading about him going up the hill and crying out and saying oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how often i' gathered you as a hen with or brood right yes he said but you would not brother Braham said he was a rejected he was rejected the people rejected him well how did he get there because he didn't live for himself he stayed with the father's will right if he was living for himself you would have never read about the 70 walking away from him right why because he would have been passing out the donuts he would have been so careful on how he worded his his message so not to offend everybody cuz who wants to be rejected right who wants people to to to walk away and say man that guy's a nut whoever who wants to be a nut who wants to be considered the Oddball so if you're living for yourself you want friends you want everybody to Pat you on the back and see what accomplishments you can do right but we find the 70 walking away and actually the prophet say Jesus said it to weed down his crowd can you say amen amen he said he said it to weed down his crowd till he could get the group together and and out of all those people only 11 of them then understood actually who he was ain't that right see and I want to say this a lot of people within message the message ring would have attributed to Jesus being unwise in his sermon maybe he could have said something a little different that wouldn't have offended them come on maybe he could have said something because after all we're here to to win souls we're here to to Rally everybody around I am appalled at how many people are really ashamed to declare the message to other people they call it being wise but in all reality they're ashamed of what God has done see the message is so different from the mainstream teaching of today the message goes against traditions and people are so rooted in Traditions that the message seems so odd so the moment we start saying about Malachi 4 and telling other people about what God has done and sending a prophet well automatically they call us an occult right automatically they link us up to Mormons whoever else because of a prophet but no matter what the truth is truth amen sure see people ain't going to make it in a Rapture without this message people ain't going to get a rapturing faith without this message amen you understand what I'm saying see so so it goes against you know this message corrects false doctrines ain't that right that people have been taught that are depending upon these things for salvation right see and so therefore people are afraid that if they say anything about a prophet in this generation they're going to lose friends and be considered the wackos considered you know David cres Jim Jones and and all these things but see when Jesus come he came not to be minister to he came to minister amen but he had a certain way to do it and that was to reveal the father's will to the people can you say Amen you love him I love the Lord if the musicians will come you see Jesus knew that if he was going to save that elect if he was going to be able to reach that elect he had to do more than just work miracles first and second pull that was only to confirm his ministry but then it came to revealing who he was that was the third pool that's right of his ministry the opening of the word when he come to open the word can you say am man see so then if he was living for himself he would have just stayed with the Social Gospel he would have stayed with the signs and the Miracles everybody was oo and and nowing over that everybody loved him by Healing The Sick raising the dead everybody loved him I mean he had great flock of people when he was multiplying the fishes and the loaves great things but when he started opening the word and revealing really who who he was yes sir but he had to do it he had to do it because he was after that elect can you amen yes sir oh I love the Lord Brother Brown said signs are usually accepted but the voice is not they don't like the voice they'll take the sign usually they'll take that they like the sign cuz they like to look at it it entertains them but the voice they don't want to do it see he said remember now the voice turn back to the word again Jesus sign of Messiah according to Isaiah 3:5 the lame shall leap like a heart and all this see that was wonderful all they accepted that that was good they believe that they believe the sign come on Rabbi to my church we'll give you full cooperation sure we believe you you're the wonderful say you're the rabbi you're the young Prophet come in all kinds of cooperation the sign is wonderful but when The Voice Bo spoke and said I am my father are one oh my they couldn't believe it they said oh you're making yourself God see they didn't want the voice they likeed the sign they know that see they admitted it was the sign of the Messiah but the voice they didn't like that can you say Amen Well church we're not part of the first and second pool that's right that was for you know the gifts people have applied the gifts to the first and second that's not [Music] true Peter and the disciples didn't work the first and second pool but they worked gifts the first and second pool was brother Brand's Ministry but what we are part of is that third pool the opening of the word can you say Amen you love the Lord we're part of that the voice the opening of the word and and brother B says the voice of God is in her that's right do you believe that amen what a Ministry that we we have the voice of God is in her the same voice that that that that created the the world the same voice that that stood at Lazarus grave and said Lazarus come forth and he came forth that same voice is in the bride what Ministry that we have oh do you love him and the Bible says speaking of this last day the spirit and the bride say come no other no other way come Spirit and the bride and L brother Bram said listen to the authentic prophet of God who appears in this last day what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing can you say Amen oh do you love him amen I'm so glad to be part of this ministry amen amen praise the Lord what what are we playing Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul
