having here this week and we sure want to say we appreciate the opportunity and invitation to stand here this morning and speak to you and we thank the Lord for what he's done how many got a victory in that prayer line last night hey man I was hearing the prophet of God last night as I left he said the reason these people are coming through the healing line and they're shouting like they are he said is they're not looking at a man he said they're looking at God and he said as they're looking at God he's doing exactly for him what he promised he would do I believe we saw God do that last night and we just want to say we have enjoyed all the ministry here this weekend how many can thank the Lord for the ministry that we've heard here this weekend amen these men of God that are preaching this message we sure appreciate each and every one of them and also want to put my voice with brother Wayne and brother Jonathan the other brothers and just say how much we've appreciated all that's been done here in these meetings and I'm not very good with words but I did hear something yesterday that I want to repeat um someone said this meeting is about helping people and I thought to myself well when you know the vision of our pastor brother Sean to help people in the vision of the church you see people being helped and we thank you for that this morning brother Sean God bless you and our assembly here we do thank the Lord for everything that's been done to help these people amen amen I believe that there'll be rewards handed out on the other side amen and just before we read the word let's just buy our heads together here for a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we've come now to the portion of the service of the preaching of your word Lord we fill your presence in this building this morning and father we know that you're not in a tomb in Jerusalem you're not in a grave in Jeffersonville this morning Lord You're not buried in history books in a religious Library somewhere but Lord you're right here this morning in the power of your Resurrection learn the same you the same God that walked on water that changed the lives of humanity two thousand years ago you're right here this morning changing lives and changing hearts and Lord as the songs of design have been sung the people Lord have rejoiced we feel angels in this building Lord father we're under the influence of a supernatural being now Lord may you send your grace in the meeting May you take these things up on our heart Lord Place them into the lives of your people Lord for those that would be Lord battling in their bodies this morning are weary I pray God that you would bring a refreshing once more Lord to the hearts of your children Lord now father we commit this meeting in our faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen The Book of Daniel the ninth chapter he loved the Lord this morning and in the first verse of Daniel 9 the Bible says in the first year of Darius the son of assurus of the seed of the medes which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years were of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek my prayer and supplication so whatever Daniel was reading had power to move him he began to pray in supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes now I want to skip down to the 20th verse of Daniel 9. the Bible says and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay while I was whilst I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me now listen to this he informed me so whatever Daniel's reading is information but I'll say it like this it's revealed instruction he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I have now come forth to give the skill and understanding somebody say understanding at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandment came forth and I come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understood now does that word again understood the matter and considered the vision seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make a Reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now I just want to read the first part of verse 25 know therefore and understand know therefore and understand if you read the rest of that chapter you will read the vision in plain detail but I want to say that there know therefore and understand we asked for this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning for just a few moments I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you here and if I will title this sermon today I want to speak to you on your ticket out of here your ticket out of here the word ticket means a piece of paper or a small card that gives the holder a certain right especially to enter a place to travel by public transport or to participate in an event it means to give the holder a certain right especially to enter a place so you're leaving one place and going into another to travel by public transport or to participate in an event now I titled that this morning your ticket out of here but for a theme out of that I want to say this I believe that I'm speaking to people this morning who are ordained to the message of the hour I believe I believe we're not here just as church members we're not here just taking up time or just feeling pews or just going through religious duties but I believe amen that we are here and we are here for a purpose and we are here and we have been chosen to be here we didn't put ourselves here amen but God chose us to be here in John 15 16 Jesus said he have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth and fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name amen he may give it to you amen I believe that we were ordained amen by the foreordination of God says it very plain he says I believe in the foreordination of God he said it's all together by Grace it's not by desire it's by Grace he's speaking of his own birth he said when they opened up the window we had an old grease candle there they said to make light I don't know whether you've had it or seen it or not he said but burn that old Pine not through the night to make the life and when they opened the window up the morning at five o'clock in the morning when I was born there was a lot he said we have the picture of it circled in the room hung over the bed where I was standing now do you see why I have to believe in the fore-ordination of God see it's out of a sinful family none of them even went to church another in profess religion on either side amen but God in His Grace by his Mercy amen I can't stop here because I preach here all day but but God in his grace amen by his Mercy is the reason we're sitting here today we're not sitting here because of what family we come out of we're not sitting here because of what church we attend or what background we've got we're sitting here because God by his grace and his Mercy amen has allowed us to be here then I believe if God has allowed us to be here then we should be in joy in the thing amen that he's allowed us to be here to be a part of amen he didn't put us here to be a part of the Republican Party he didn't put his shield to be a part of the democratic party amen but he put us here to be a witness and in a lost and dying amen sinful and adulterous generation amen that the son of righteousness would arise with healing in his wings and would return in this age to declare amen that I'm not dead but I'm alive I'm still moving I'm still healing I'm still saving I'm still giving the Holy Ghost I believe the hour has come Amen to move out of the shallow Waters to move amen out of the ankle and need Waters I think it's time to get in the swimming Daughters of the stability of the message of the hour Amen to move Beyond just going to church to move Beyond just going to conventions to move Beyond just can't meet and experiences amen but to move into a place of authority with Jesus Christ where you can back every devil and hell up and remind that devil I didn't buy my way in this amen you didn't put me in this brother Mark God placed me here from before the foundation of the world and if God hadn't been on my side I wouldn't be standing here this morning but because God was on my side there wasn't enough devil's hand there ain't enough Devils now and there ain't enough devils in the future to defeat this bride we have been ordained for a Time such as this we have been ordained we have been chosen we have been placed here listen I believe the word is in the people because the people is in the word amen I believe the word is in the church because the church is in the word therefore we're not established in what God did we're not established in a in a history lesson we are established in present truth we are established in present truth now amen I've just got to read this to you because I find it very powerful that brother Branham 1965 is ordaining some men of God to preach the measure to preach the word and he said here in 1965 this God ever change his mind he said anybody this brother comes up to be ordained he said does anybody know brother Merlin Anthony he's new to me he says well I'm with the Salvation Army do you remember me oh yes he said you're from the Salvation Army that's right I remember him sure I know him see how many knows him to be a man of God Amen how many believes God is working with him raise your hand they said amen he said will you pray for him he said now brother we know that you're coming from a great group of people the Salvation Army they do a great work he said they do a great work on the street we can say nothing against the Nazarene we can say nothing against the Pentecostal or the Salvation Army or any of them they aren't Brethren but you see we believe that we are carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in do you want to do that with us and the man said amen amen I find it powerful that brother Branham amen was not blasting what they were doing he was not he was not standing there amen trying to tell him how wrong they were amen but he was just showing Merlin amen you were not ordained to further the work of the Salvation Army you were not ordained to carry on the Pentecostal tradition I'm not ordaining you to be another Street worker for the Salvation Army amen but if you want to carry this message I'm going to ordain you Amen to carry this great message and let me just go on record and say I was not ordained and I was not brought up on the earth Amen to continue the traditions of denomination amen but God who is rich in Mercy placed this seed in my soul from before the foundation I was born to preach this message I was born to believe this message and if I was born to preach it and there are some people here that was born to believe it if there's some men here that was born to preaching or some young men here that's born to believe it if there was some men ordained to say what a prophet said about the way a girl on a dress and there's some young ladies on the face of the Earth this morning that is ordained to manifest amen the word and the age they're living it's very clear we are not here to play games we are not here to reduce this message down they're just some shouting Hallelujah time this is the Revival of the Bride this is the Revelation that will change your body let me go ahead and say it's your ticket out of here it's not a book on the Shelf it's not a picture on the wall it's not a tradition it's not a group of men it's not a personality it's your ticket for mortality into immortality it's your ticket from time back into eternity we are carriers of a great message let me put my voice with the voice of brother random it's a great message the message of the hour is a great message I know there's been a lot of craziness around it but it's a great message [Applause] [Music] secret messages in the message but it's still a great message it's in the message and just track them down to the bottom and you'll find a man but it's still a great message before one man twisted and the prophet said it and you was ordained to believe it and that's why some of y'all are sitting here and you had to fight your way out of false Doctrine to get where you are because you are not ordained to a man's idea about this message you were not ordained to what somebody thought that brother ran a man you was ordained to the revelation of the son of man by the appearing of Jesus in the AIDS that you're living I think it's a Ministry it's a message it's a positionally placing of the church Reverend said what has happened he said we've had a personal contact with God until all the intellectuals in the world cannot explain it from us listen we're not looking for personal contact we have personal contact and I propose to you this morning that we are carriers of a great message let me just go and say this brother Isaiah I can't help what others do I'm not here to correct them not here to fight with them I can't help what they do but as for me in my house go listen to reproach for the cause of the word and he comes down to the end and says as for me in my house he says we're going to serve the word amen and I think that to be a declaration of every family leaving this meeting this weekend as for me and my house we're going to serve this message that's for me in my house we're going to turn off every voice contrary to what a prophet has taught and we're going to give our lives to the message of the hour brother brother I'm sitting my friends I don't want to hurt feelings but I'm responsible for a message and that message is come out of this mess well glory to God I feel like preaching there that message is come out of this mess amen he said and if I call you out he said where am I going to take you Brandon Tabernacle he said it's the biggest mess as much as part as any of them he said but there's one place I can take you to where you are safe and protected from death and that is in Jesus Christ it's God's provided place of worship listen this message didn't call you amen from one mess to another this message called you amen from the message denomination for the woo from the confusion of Babylon into the perfect interpretation of the word and the age you're living come on Church there's not a man coming that can turn on the line the lights already been turned on there's not a Pride's Revival coming the bride's Revival is already here there's not another messenger coming we have the shout we have the voice we have the resurrection in our bodies this morning then it's time to rise up and remember who you are you're not a bunch of weak beat down help us hopeless church members you are the Invincible Army thank you you were prophesied in the Bible and you're now in fulfillment here this morning therefore we're not in a church we're not in a system we have been brought into God's provided place his name was put in a man his son Jesus Christ in which he Tabernacle himself and we are in that Tabernacle then what did Jeremiah say God say through Jeremiah he said before you was born I ordained thee a prophet I knew you and ordained you a prophet to the nation now look at this word ordained it means to give bestow Grant permit a scribe it means to employ devote consecrate means to dedicate in other words I dedicated you to be a prophet to the nation it means to give over to yield produce now Reverend says it very plain he said before Jeremiah ever come from his mother's womb he was ordained so God did not come down in the birthing room look at Jeremiah and say man that looks like a prophet right there but before he was ever conceived in his mother's womb in the back part of God's mind he was already a prophet to the nation can I make a connection for you before Daniel was ever born on the Earth he was ordained to believe Jeremiah's message that was going to be given to him by the angel Gabriel come on God does not send a message hoping somebody will believe it well I might as well preach I'm here this morning God does not send a message amen hoping somebody will show up to hear it amen but if God does something he's got somebody on the earth to receive it he did not go by the way or hoping the woman would be there but before he ever left his disciples he knew she would be there he knew what hair color she would have he knew what color clothes she would be wearing you know why because he's not a week old dirty Grandpa amen he's Jehovah he's Jehovah the Bible he's Jesus of the new and if he knows you he knows everything about you when God went by the well he knew she would be sitting there and he knew that that message would bring her amen from being a reject to society into being a testimony of the power the transformation of Jesus and this message has brought well I might as well preach I feel good this message has brought us we was a bunch of nobody's rejects Amen on our way to Hell amen but God who is rich in Mercy sent a message in this generation Destiny and it claims you a minute called you you're not a reject amen you're a daughter of God come on Brothers you're not a bunch of hopeless man you are sons of this last day children of God born in the world not by the blood of man not by the will of the father of your Earthly father but by the will of God so we have not come here looking for a purpose we have a specific purpose you didn't know you was cut me preach this morning but you are look at somebody next you didn't say specific purpose you're not just here for a purpose you're here for a specific purpose now brother Mark we can really hone down there couldn't we you're not here for just any purpose you're here for a specific purpose do you realize Moses was born for a specific purpose and that purpose was to deliver the children of God that could not help themselves the Bible says that Israel was born brought on the earth for a specific purpose now that was that out of Israel would be the cleanest bloodstream that the lineage of Jesus Christ would come out of now brother Ben turns and says now Jesus had a specific purpose he said he did not come to Calvary to die haphazard oh no he didn't come there and say well maybe I'll die and it'll be so pathetic some people amen will see that I died maybe they'll come and serve the Lord Jesus come for a specific purpose Jesus come for a specific purpose now let's just go and say what a prophet said he said the specific purpose was to redeem those who God by foreknowledge elected to come to him so then it's not of him that we love it's not of him that runeth but it's of God that showeth Mercy the only way you're here is God shows your mercy now let's just say it if Moses had a specific purpose and Israel had a specific purpose and Jesus had a specific purpose then don't tell me that I don't have a specific purpose the prophet of God said God did not make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose you are here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose amen let me say that again for that complex devil that's lingering in this building no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose well brother Andrew Nobody Knows My Name no matter how big you are how little you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose well I'm just a little nobody on the backside of nowhere no matter how little you are you are here to serve a purpose you know what it's time you do it's time you pick up them devils and kick them in the kick him in the seat of the britches and send them back to the hell they come out of and remember you're not here amen by accident you're not here by happenstance you are here because God who hung the moon and placed the stars and put a water in the water and put a fire on the earth amen put a seed in your soul for a Time such as this I say we ought to back every Temple a men of complex back to the hell he come out of amen amen somebody might look at me and think I lost my mind I have amen you're not unimportant you're not too little amen come on David pick up your slingshots come on shamgar pick up the ox code you have been ordained for a specific purpose now I know why the devil don't want you to believe that it's because he wants you to believe he's going to destroy you before you fulfill that purpose but according to a Vindicated Prophet there is nothing coming that can destroy you until the purpose that God has brought you upon the Earth to fulfill has been fulfilled words of indicated profit when God is done with me on Earth in this life I am done with life well if that Devil's lingering around here this morning saying well I'm too weak and I'm too insignificant and I can't preach and I can't see amen I tell you what I'm sick of the I can't I'm sick of the excuses amen I don't care what family you come out of I don't care what tradition you come out of amen God Is Bigger than any family bloodline God Is Bigger than any tradition God is bigger than any curse that the devil's trying to place upon you amen come on shake yourself Samson the Philistines are upon you but your purpose was not Amen to serve Delilah your purpose was to slay them for his teens and nothing can harm us until the purpose that God has brought us on the earth to fulfill has been made manifest he said but Andrew God didn't call me well brother Ram said amen amen if you want to argue you got the wrong preacher because I'm going to tell you what brother said what God calls to be will be so come up with any excuse you want to but if God called you to me you'll be he said if God wants you to be a certain thing and he brings you to this earth to be that you'll be it you see because God calls by a Divine call then I say to you this morning God called you and he ordained you by the spirit to the message Jeremiah 1 said he ordained you John 15 said he ordained you amen look at first John 1 5 can I borrow your brother Jonathan amen this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light in him is no Darkness at all look at this word message it is an announcement brother Sean it is a promise it is the act of a promising it is a promise given or to be given it is a promised good or a blessing remember said do you realize this seriousness of this you don't come to church just to hear a message or to see a messenger I mean you've come to hear the message and the message is the holy spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you the message of the hour is the whole Holy Spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you then then I got to say it amen that little complex if I'm unimportant I can't fulfill it amen the part of God said the highest of Heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth what did he do he bypassed all between him and them to make I'm paraphrasing her out there to make himself known to come and Brethren see come into the common herdsmen the greatest message of all time so between amen thank you brother Ron so the greatest of all time amen was coming to what the world will call the lowest of all time and there was a lot in between them that thought they were the greatest of all time and here's what God done he bypassed all those wannabes and went down to a bunch of nobodies because the one of these wanted to do it the way they wanted to do it amen but God said you're not going to deliver my message the way you think it ought to be delivered so I'm going to bypass the Kings I'm gonna bypass the potent page I'm gonna bypass the monarchs and I'm gonna go find me some old dumb Shepherds up on a hill that's just out there tending to their sheep and I'm going to ordain them and anoint him and I'm gonna put my words in their mouth and here's what they're going to say Messiah is here now glory to God should have got the most educated brother Kenny but he got the most illiterate you know why because they didn't have an education they wouldn't stand there and try to word it a better way they would just stand there and say if you got makeup on your face you might as well be called what you are they they wouldn't stand there and try to find politically amen correct words they would just stand there and say Messiah is here now and you know what I think it's high time I think it's time we get some preachers that's got some backbone to take the gloves off and just say what a prophet saying it may not be fancy it may not be popular but just say it you know why because God ordained you and chose you to say [Applause] some ask me other day they said how many pulpits have you lost I said as many as the message cost me oh brother Andrew hey man I won't back off of this message for nobody and neither should you well brother I'm not a preacher don't back off of this message for your family don't you back off of this message for some friendship somewhere and then don't you back off of this message and hide your face like a blessing Prophet you're not a blessing Prophet you are a bride that is unashamed of the identification of the sign of the Messiah in this age what is the message the message is the Messiah is here now well brother and if I say what brother and said I'll lose some friendships well you probably don't need him to begin with you just ought to go ahead and lose them so you can get around your real friends well glory to God I might as well shout brother Joe amen you might as well go ahead and lose your Society identification so you can get away from the chickens and get among some Eagles amen that when the Holy Ghost drops down in an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Gospel tent needing and the power of God begins to shake the building you can lose your dignity You Can Lose Yourself righteousness you can Surrender Your Prestige and you can embrace the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in the last days it should take it out of here I said that you're taking out of here if you're ashamed of you take it you're gonna stay right here but if you ever lose your reservation you will declare the key message Messiah is here now I just go ahead and say it God uses nobodies without consulting anybody I said God for the Jason uses nobodies without consulting anybody because I guarantee you there have been a lot of people said don't use Andrew and don't use Wayne and don't use Nathan don't you dare use man I mean I mean that guy's that guy's a firecracker don't you dare use him amen but God wanted somebody that would lose the shame to stand in the pulpit and just say what a prophet said so he went bypassed all the somebody's and found you come on Church y'all know I'm telling you the truth amen amen God rich and mercy what about it went out to meet Goliath and Goliath disdained him you know what the word this thing means it means to regard as worthless so David is looked at by the enemy as worthless but you know what I love about this before the enemy disdained David God already ordained him before the enemy said why do you send this little child out here to me why do you send this little ready amen young fellow out here am I a dog amen God said Bow Wow and you're fixing to bow down and I'm gonna wow you by using a nobody I'm serving a god that'll take a nobody and he'll wow every devil this side of the Mississippi they've been destroyed he don't need education he don't need personality he don't need your bank account he don't need your status he just needs a voice it'll say what a prophet said and if you'll get a life to this message he'll raise you from the low of the lows to the highest to the highs oh yeah every age had its message and its messenger and every age had somebody that would receive that message now when that message comes it's always a fight evening time messenger it's always a fight to separate I'm in the old from the new but I'll say this we are not Fallen a false prophet We are following a true Prophet you know brother Ben preaches the message the way of a true prophet do you know in the church age book he tells you of the way of a true prophet he is he says it's to preach the whole word he said the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear I love this next part and we'll be ready for the rapture he will be disdained he will be viewed as worthless he will be viewed as a contempt as somebody that is a rebel but he will preach a word that will prepare you for the changing of your body then I say with everything within me layout of CH has received a scriptural message you say what do you mean by this term message of the hour remember said it's what they're getting at is it's God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do see them the message of the hour actually interprets the hour the message of the hour interprets the hour that you're living in he said the message itself from the scriptures interprets to you the hour that we're living in now somebody asked for the ram they said well the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture he said well sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour so the ministry of the bride of Christ is the message of the hour that it's a message of the hour is the promise Amen to see Jesus the message of the hour is the promise to see Jesus now amen I'm going to borrow something from brother Ron amen if you don't like this message then you're dismissed foreign to be under this morning the message of the hour is the promise to see Jesus you say See Jesus why did he preach 21 times sir we would see Jesus amen because he was bringing it from Zacchaeus who had a desire to see Jesus and he said what he did was he climbed up a tree and he got up there and he found two limbs that come together and he met at the truck of the tree and there he sat down he said now that's a good place to sit we're two-ways meet amen that's yours and gods he said it's your idea and his he said that's a good time to sit down and think it over your own thoughts about him and what the word says He is what you think he is and with the word says he is here it is with the message of the hour is to your thinking and what the message of the hour is to his word he said that's the difference amen sit there and think it over a little while and I'll just go ahead and say this if you sit down at the trunk of the tree and you talk between you and the Lord when you get done talking here if you if you get rid of your idea and your thoughts here will be your conclusion the message is Christ have I got a witness here this morning that sat down at the trunk of that tree and they have come to this conclusion the message is Christ what about in the back the message is Christ what about it over here the message is Christ what about it here on the front I meant the message is Christ this message ain't a belt buckle this message ain't a replica of a suitcase this message ain't brother Brown's replica of this briefcase this message is the deity of Jesus Christ not in the heavens but in the earth in the redeemed flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ this message is Christ and I'll say what a prophet said he said we're not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message amen and the message is Christ he is the word see we're to get into it we're to get beneath it we're not to get around it we're not to get beside it and we're sure not to get above it we are to get into it and then get beneath it you know why when you get into it and get beneath it it becomes your headship they say what is the message of the hour but remember I said the message of the hour is this apply the token Exodus 12 he said I will pass through the land of Egypt watch them words pass through amen but then he says a few verses later I will pass over and the plague shall not be upon you I will pass through Leia I mean I will pass through each sorry I got my words twisted up I will pass through Egypt amen and those that are under the blood will be passed over come on Church in other words if he passes over you it's because you're under the token [Applause] brother Joel if he passes over you you're under the you're not out there's still reasoning with a token you're not out there still trying to figure out a better way to apply the token you've actually come underneath the token and that token is your identification and he only recognizes the token that's the message of the hour and that's the message of this day that's the message of this time Amen in the name of Jesus Christ receive it come on church amen War clouds are gathering laodicea is coming to an end amen listen if you're looking for Trump if you're looking for some Republican if you're looking for some democrat to change this thing it ain't gonna happen baby you better get in this message amen America is under the voice of the seventh angel and he said the world is falling apart politics have reached Syrian governments have reached three finances and economy has reached its end but unto you that will receive amen the message of the hour it'll lifts you above all the destruction it'll Lift You above the tribulation [Applause] what are you saying brother I'm saying the message of the hour is here get in it now my brother Andrew what are you what are you getting at well God is perfected can I have a little bit of time here God is perfected in threes right father son Holy Ghost what water blood spirit right amen amen God is perfected three is the number of perfection right so God sent you a message in the form of three pulls now I don't have time to read it all to you but in the first time I want to show you 1962 is this time of the end is this that third pull he told me three or four years ago now he said there's a third pull coming I'm gonna I'm gonna give you the preaching version of this can you say it with me a third pull coming there's a third pool coming in 1962 he says when the third pool comes there's a great ministry line ahead third pool coming great ministry line ahead 1963 indictments looking for the Lord for that third pool third pool coming when it comes there's a great ministry looking for that third pool 63 why Christ speak hold that sword and March forward to the third pool amen third pool coming when it comes great ministry Lord looking for it now hold the sword and March toward the third pull you see it's now coming into action Christ is the mystery amen if you turn around and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock it's the end of the second pull amen the third pool is at hand we have now come from the third pool is coming Amen to the third police at hand and what does the phrase at hand means it means that it is nearby it means it is readily and accessible when needed it means it is close in time it means it is about to happen so when a prophet made a declaration brother told that the second pool was over third pull is at hand amen it was the announcement to the church amen that the power that was sealed in the third pool has now been released and it is now not just in a prophet amen but it is now readily available and accessible Amen to every member that has been ordained to believe the message of the messenger that's the third pool was coming from well I feel like putting my shouting shoes on that third pool's not buried in the mountains of Arizona that third pool is not in a grave in Jeffersonville but that third pool is in this building this morning that's what you feel that's what you feel moving you that's what you feel right it's not a bunch of music it's not a workup it's the manifestation of the third pool in this generation I say oh God unlock the supernatural let it not just be in this tent let us take it home let us take it back to our jobs brother and do someday somehow or sometime third post coming I say it's here [Applause] it is here I'm just simple so I got to tell you things real simple okay having this message and not using it is like having a 42 inch zero turn mower in the garage and using a push mower [Applause] you say well that's a pretty dumb example it's pretty dumb you got this message you don't use it it's pretty dumb it's a book on the Shelf it's pretty dumb it's been reduced down to just an opinion I told you I'm not a politician I'm a preacher get these books off the shelf get these books out of the coffee table get them in your family get them in your soul this is your power it's accessible to you God didn't unleash this to put a carrot in front of you and taunt you like you can't have this amen put your walking shoes on church it's time to walk in the third pool it's time to walk in the manifestation it's time to walk in joy unspeakable it's time to dance in the blessings of the revelation of the son of man we were dancing for Years brother Kenny and didn't know what we was dancing about but a prophet through a message made an announcement the third pool is at hand it's yours use it you need to defeat that devil of complexes pick up the third pool and cut that devil's head off [Applause] well brother and do something no why not today is a good day I come on Church in a few short days we're gonna take this tent down everything will be cleaned up around here and you go up on top of the mountain and look down here you know what you're going to see at dead spot you're going to see life everywhere else but it's going to be dead right under here you know what if you had vision and I believe brother Wayne preached it to you Friday night if you could allow your vision to see beyond just the dead grass I believe you'd see more than just dead grass brother Mark I believe you would cheat Devils Lay It Hallelujah you would see Devils laying on the ground they've been defeated under the feet of the Victorious Pride I'm on Church you know what you need to do right now you need to bring back that old-fashioned Holy Ghost Field flip Stomp and religion and put that devil under your feet he is under a curse of defeat he is under a pronouncement of defeat the third pool is at hand he said the third pull is beginning to move do you see within me the third pool has now been Vindicated the third pool is properly identified the third pool is here the third I'm giving you a timeline the third pool is here come on Church notice he did not stop when he said I feel the third pool within me he said the third pool is here well come on Church he's not here this morning so does that mean Isaiah the third pool is not here amen no the third pool just changed Dwelling Places it moved from a profit now if that return Ministry Spirit wants to push I'll push back it moved from a prophet into his prophecy come on Church it moved from prophets profit to prophecy but come on Church once prophecy has been fulfilled it's no longer prophecy it's now history and a prophet preached an entire sermon called this day this scripture is fulfilled and showed you what was prophecy three years ago it's history today and what was prophecy prophecy just a few short years ago that there would be a bride's Revival we are the manifestation if you're looking for the bride's Revival then you're not looking at it if you're looking for the ultimate word then you're not looking at it but if you can see that this is that if you can see that this is the promises of God if you can see that this is the power to live a Victorious life if you can see that this is the way to overcome two hundred thousand thousand Devils then you gotta right to get your sword in your hand and This Means War oh This Means War the third pool meant War the third pool was not a picnic it was a battlefield because the bride was coming to the battlefield for the Battle of Truth this means what you want to talk about war let's have War let's defeat these dumb Devils with a third pull anointing [Applause] I'm gonna pick it up you'll never use it looking at it you gotta pick it up third pool's now in the bride third pull us to the total loss but it will be for the bride it was to the total loss brother Sean but it'll be for the bride well I might as well keep going hat now there is no more doubt in my mind I know what the third pull is and I know what it does well Robinson I put my voice with the voice of William random this morning and say right here April 26th to the April 30th I have seen the third pool I know what it is and I know what it does the third pulley said is the great and final pull he said when he begins to declare his message see first pull is healing second pull is prophesied but the third poll is the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember you're right there's a preaching on it up here you can't hardly read remember the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word somebody tell you they don't have time for the third pool here's a good response I don't have time for your nonsense come on I told you I'm not a politician I'm a preacher I don't have time for your nonsense if you're not going to say what a prophet said go join your Baptist Church they'll help you pay the bills go join your Pentecostal Church they'll give you a good feeling but if you want to get in this war if you want to be a real soldier of the cross of Jesus Christ then take the penny waste off and put on the six Ephesians six ailment of Salvation and sword of the spirit and quit being an assistant and be a message believer and fight back against these Devils fight back against lukewarmness fight back against clinicians fight back against pornography fight back against Lush fight back against Hollywood fashion fight back against the church the third pull is in your hand to do it [Applause] you ain't gonna whip a devil with a Baptist message you ain't gonna whip a devil with a Pentecostal tradition but you will with the Devil with this message well Isaiah you will with the Devil with this message I'm alter you wish message have I got a witness that this is a devil with a message have I got a witness that this is a devil weapon message [Applause] you know what brother Nathaniel this message will with the devil anywhere anytime any place under any conditions what are you saying I'm saying the third pool is the message well I said it the third pool is the message I love the first pull but that's not the message I love the second pool that's not the message the first and second pool was called preparation years the third pool is the message they say can you prove that he said I've Got My Mind Set On this message that's the third pool and it's the one I must be loyal and reverent to if you've been ordained to something you better be loyal and reverent to it and young people you've been ordained to this message Church of the Living God you've been ordained to this message then be loyal and be reverent to it what are you getting that preacher the message is the opening of the word in the church making it the bride come on now you were not called bride under the first pull you was not called bride under the second pool but under the third pool was when a marriage took place and you changed identity from the church to the bride if you want to stay in the preparation pools then you're just the church but if you want to come over into his age underneath the third pill amen then you are the bride and the church don't have the secrets and the church don't have the answers and the church don't have the way to fix the problem and the church cannot change your body but under this third pill you have received the token you have received the tickets come on church I Daniel understood by books ah damn you're understood by books what are you holding them books up for because the same God that come to Jeremiah and give him a message of Daniel and his future is the same God that came to William Marion Branham and gave him a message concerning the future of this church and it was not just put on tape but it was put in books to fulfill Daniel 9 2. I understand my future not the doctor adoption not by psychology but by the books that have been given I understand my future buy the books you don't like them I'm going to read them you don't want to hear him I'm going to preach him you want somebody to get rid of them we're going to print more these books are going away till we do these books aren't going away till we do you say I don't like it it's your ticket [Applause] it's your ticket [Applause] but somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah you got something to shout about this morning it should take it brother Kitty it should take you to the new land it should take you to the Future home it should take it to the Millennium it should take it to the body change [Applause] hi Daniel understood my books hi Daniel understood my books I Andrew Glover understand my books [Applause] I understand the books for the Andrew you're a fanatic I understand my books [Applause] oh I know men have given their lives to study the message and find them faults to try to prove brother Ramos a man but I don't have time to waste my time I've got One Life to Live Mr Sonic I Got One Life to Live I'm not going to waste it searching this message trying to find where brother Brown got his words Twisted just to prove he was a man I'm sorry I don't have piles of errors in this message but I do have files where a prophet said this is the infallible Vindicated spoken word yeah I got the courage to say it Thomas it's the absolute get in it [Applause] it should take it out of here what is it it's the announcement that the word has become the church and the church has become the word the bride now remember what do you brother Andrew what are you getting that brother Batman statically teaches us amen that scripture I don't know if that door right there is gonna be enough for that be able to get out of here he Running Scared right now because we're not just around the message we're beneath it [Applause] we're not just standing around looking at it I don't know why I'm going here but I'm going to go we're not just standing here walking around saying Oh My My My look what God did but there's a people by the way that is stepped they've literally taken a step into the message and they are the message now you say brother Andrew how can you prove this because the prophet said he said the bride and the church or he said the bride or the church should become the bride it's God manifested flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self-flesh brother Batman fatically teaches you that a prophecy which comes from scripture has a compound meaning he says it has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning one place he says every Divine promise has and amen behind it can we put one there and we're so happy for that to know that all these prophecies and so forth most of them has a compound meaning again he says the cycle of time swings back over every so often history repeats itself and the scripture repeats itself down the age any scholar knows that that's ever studied from a spiritual standpoint watch the scripts repeat itself not just and Prophecy of the New Testament come right into this day to be fulfilled again brother Jesse Prophecy from the New Testament come right into this day to be fulfilled again oh God that's breaking for me prophecy come from the Old Testament about the Messiah into the New Testament and Jesus was the Fulfillment of the when you read Zechariah and you saw Jesus you saw the prophecy fulfilled when you read Malachi Jonathan you saw the prophecy but when you saw Jesus you saw it fulfilled why because the prophecy in the Old Testament came over in the New Testament and was fulfilled in the New Testament and in these last days the prophet of God said there would be another spoken word come on Church there would be another spoken word then what happened Jesus was the spoken word of Isaiah he was the spoken word of Zechariah he was a spoken word of Joel and when you saw Jesus you saw the Fulfillment of the prophecy that he'd come into the New Testament from the Old Testament well I might as well go and say it and there is prophecy in the New Testament but you know who is speaking of it's speaking of the Bride so just as you can read Joel look at Jesus and see the fulfillments I can read Ephesians where it says there'll be a bride without a spot without a recall without a blemish and I can look at you and I can say brother Diego this day this scripture is fulfilled come on church I can look there and say that Greater Works in this shall you do I'm on church that was Prophecy in the New Testament that has traveled over into this age to be fulfilled listen friends amen if you're looking for the Greater Works you are the Greater Works come on if you're looking for the Greater Works quit looking you are the Greater Works I gotta I gotta try to bring this down here in a second the message of the hour then is a compound message come on church it's a compound message the Old and New Testament is a compound scripture amen the prophecy and the Fulfillment is a compound then this message is a compound message you know what it means compound means two elements to make up a hole two elements to make up a hole amen amen so Moses spoke of Jesus and when they come together you saw the whole picture Abraham had the faith of God and when Jesus come on the earth and they come together you saw the Fulfillment when you saw Jesus you saw the Fulfillment of the compound scripture in plain view and I gotta go and say it and when you see this bride Hallelujah when you see this bride you will see the Old Testament the New Testament behold he's in plain view come on Church you heard it yesterday morning and she is him [Applause] well I gotta I gotta preach and then I'm gonna go eat with you amen are you hearing me this morning this message is a compound message are you ready for it it is a message that says this come out of this mess first part come out of this mess but the next part is Messiah is here now brother Wendell compound message come out of this mess IAH is here now then this message is an exit but it's also an entrance [Applause] testing to end still working you might have your cotton too deep this message is an exit and it's an entrance it's Revelation 18 4 come out of her my people but in first second Peter 1 11 so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom so the same message that brought you out through an exit is the same message that will introduce you into the new world come on Church there's brother Sean there's not another message coming there's not another entrance coming this message is Christ because he is the way he is the truth he is the life come on church if you wanted to leave the old world Jonathan and get in the new world you didn't walk in front of the Ark you then walked behind it you didn't cling on to the rails you got in it because the ark was the exit from the old world and it was the entrance into the new world and if you want to see your loved once again if you want to shout now mistreats are gold if you want to partake of the marriage supper of the land you better get out from around this message you better get out from in front of it and you better get in it because one of these mornings it's going to write us how to lay out of sin your ride is here your ride is here they say preacher where is my ride it's right here get in it get in it get in at church you want to leave here it's a message of redemption it's a message of Exodus and what does redemption have brother Sean has got two parts what does the Bible have two parts what does this message have two parts come out go in come out go in come out of unbelief go into Faith come out of sin go into holiness [Applause] well they come to yours I might as well preach come out of makeup and get into clean living [Applause] get out of your high-heeled shoes can't ride this ride in high-heeled shoes get out of your skin tight clothes you can't you can't ride this riding skin tight clothes you know why because sometimes in this right you got to get out and Shout a little bit so times in this ride you got to get out dance a little bit because you just can't take all that inspiration of the supernatural revelation of stimulation so you got to come down to Virginia for about five days and you just gotta shout around a little bit amen amen you know what you can't do you can't do it in high-heeled shoes and you can't do in skinny jeans and you can't do it looking like a Leo to see you amen but God who is rich in Mercy send a message in this generation Amen to release you from the fashion so you can wear the wedding garment and the wedding garment is the message of the hour put it on Church put it on get out of Hollywood get out of fashion come on I feel that devil pushing against me right now and I will push back I will push back when in God's name did we lay down our standards and let Hollywood come in the house of God and not say nothing about it I'll tell you when we did when we got rid of preachers and got politicians but there are some preachers here today that ain't a bunch of high listen you know why the devil don't like me it's because he didn't hire me and he can't fire me so I can say it quit looking like a world and start looking like a bride oh yeah oh yeah I know what I'm talking about amen well I'm here so might as well pretend they've been winding our boys start looking like girls [Applause] and then they get offended at us for thinking they may be on the wrong team it ain't our fault we can't tell what you are you're taking pictures like girls posing like girls got hairdos like girls if it walks like a girl talks like a girl then it must be a girl amen but there is some young men in these last days that's going to take off what Leota Sia says a boy looks like and they're gonna put on the message of the hour and they're going to walk in the footsteps of what a prophet said if a prophet said kick the television out there ain't going to be one in our house if the prophet said don't go mix bathing then we ain't gonna be doing it if the prophet said that we shouldn't wear shorts and 16 year old boys get them off and put you a pair of pants on and get in your ride this whole world's coming to an end but if you want to go to the new world you better get in your ride it's here I said it's here [Applause] it's here get in it you say preacher I hate these means you're closing these meetings ain't closing we're gonna take them somewhere else because this is one meeting that you will never shut up we're gonna take it to our homes we're going to take it to our schools we're going to take it to our churches we're going to take it on our jobs because we are in our ride [Music] oh okay them devil you should know better than that well preacher you're just exalting books and not the Bible we had this for 2 000 years and did not have a clue what we were reading about but in the end time by the voice of Revelation 10 and Malachi 4 we would have the perfect interpretation with Divine vindication [Applause] come here Josh I need your help people say some really dumb stuff freaking they say would you rather have this or this you know what that is that's a dumb question [Applause] and then they say well just give me this and if I don't have this I can still get by Anders that say well we just need these and we don't need this but you got the picture on [Applause] because it's not like this and it's not like this but actually [Applause] it's like that thank you it's called the opening of the word the word is not above the message and the message is not above the word but the message is the revelation of the books that you've been carrying I say oh thank you God in the last days I have been given eyes to see I have been given ears to hear I have a heart to believe I have a mouth to confess I got feet to Shadow I got hands to clap I got a voice to say it foreign [Music] get out of here devil we believe the message and we're not ashamed of it wherever you put us we'll preach it brother Wayne take us to the ballparks of India and we'll preach it put us in the jungles of Africa and we'll preach it Nathan take us down under and we'll preach it wherever we go wherever we be whatever we do we will declare this message is you're taking out of here now I gotta close right here I gotta close quickly because I want I'm just going to leave this with you okay this message is your exit come on it's your exit then you know what I say to you in closing these meetings this familiarize yourself with it [Applause] where'd this out go familiarize yourself with it you know what the word explore means it means to travel in or through and on for me I got two minutes left by the way an unfamiliar Contour area in order to learn about or familiarize oneself with it it means to search for resources to inquire and to or discuss a subject or issue in detail it means to examine or evaluate an option or possibility so I got to thinking about this you ever go into a theater where they have a concert or singers or music or something like that you're going to theater you walk in there brother Wayne and it's real clock the stage is there the performers are getting ready the singers whatever the drama you're getting right watch it's real it's real quiet and then it gets real dark all of a sudden and then all of a sudden brother Josiah you hear a voice and the voice says Welcome to our theater Welcome to our Welcome to our Auditorium in the unlikely event of an emergency please notarize and familiarize yourself with the clearly marked exits [Applause] so while it's real dark brother Steve all of a sudden a lot will come on above the door and it will draw your eyes to it and you'll look at it and say in the unlikely event of an emergency that's the door I need to go out [Applause] you know what in that theater or concert hall there's exits plural Tommy there's X it's plural but you know what Amen in this message we heard a voice and it got real dark and the voice said there is a man here theme there is a man here who can turn on the light there is a man here who can flip the switch there is a man here that can show you the way out listen in this bride Church there is not X it's plural in that Auditorium brother Jeremy there's X's plural but in this body out of laodicea there is only one exit it's not plural it's singular can I tell you what it is it is the message of the hour foreign and you look at the exits and you say in the unlikely event but in this day the prophet did not say in the unlikely event he took his text on the Rapture from the most Troublesome time you could talk about and said but in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his exit he shall hide me in his Pavilion I'm on church I know they're talking about world war three but I'm not biting my fingernails I know they're talking about the economy collapsing but I'm not worried you know why because I'm in the provisions of the exit from where government controls things from where the stock markets controls the mood of the people I'm going to Glory I'm in the exit and I'm Homeward Bound I'm closing with this listen church program comes the end of his ministry and preaches you a message called this things that are to be I know that devil right now is pushing me but I'll push back devil this message is the only way in a rapture I said it I meant it I represent it and I stand behind it this message is the only way into a rapture without this message brother window there is no Rapture without this message you will never see Revelation 21 in reality but with this message [Applause] can I have a few more minutes in your pulling things that are to be he reads John 14 and then turns and says now last night over there in Yuma I spoke on the rapture and there's going to be a Rapture and he said maybe here I'll ask how many Christians do we have that's still good here today ain't a dead message he's still inspired this one he said if I ask that question everybody will raise their hands are you hearing me now he said but here's what I want to say as Christians I think we ought to kindly be notified testing one two it's still working kindly notified of our destination I don't think we should be guessing at it [Applause] now come on Church you got a destination but there's a lot of questions brother Jason between here and the destination okay let's preach it's inspiration well Jason go tell sister shawnica we're going to Virginia we're going to meetings Okay Virginia meetings is your destination but how are we going to get

destination but it notified you of everything in between I'm going to give it to you real quick in this message you can find amen what time you're leaving it's called The Rapture book it's called some morning between six and nine in this message you can find what you're writing it's called the token in this message you can find what you're wearing it's called The Wedding garments in this message

you know it just shows that brother branham's right when you get Believers in the place God comes down and we just can't thank you enough for coming to the meeting and this is just something that we have desire myself our church desire that Believers would come and just be able to let their hair down so to speak get touched from God I know how it is we fight the preachers battle at mind battles parents children young people we all have our mind battled that would come into a place where the message is preached men of God are anointed and the people begin to receive and it just drawing from an eternal realm an unseen rim almighty God shows up and I say he has and so I know that you have spent much money and gas to get here hotels things of that nature and we just want to say thank you for making the sacrifice to come and I want to thank the musicians brother Tim sister cross for helping us brother Daniel brother Austin [Applause] this message has the best musicians in the world [Applause] I want to say thank you to my sound guys as well [Applause] and uh they did a big help everybody gets recognized with the sound guys give recognition to the sound guys [Applause] I had to appreciate them very much and I also want to say thank you to brother Diego see oh right there uh brother Diego and his brother for helping with the interpreting God bless you God bless you we have we have really enjoyed our Hispanic friends coming and I count them very dear and uh a lot of them I've been here since for 11 years and they a lot of them come from North Carolina the first year uh just to come to our church about 71 of them I think and uh just to be with us for the weekend and and they have came up for years since then and I just grown to really love and appreciate them very much and uh so we uh I I you know they interpreting uh we have one Minister each night that they've been interpreting them twice doing it the rest of the time so God bless you all I [Applause] I want to say thanks to the those that have helped worked in the kitchen repairing the food [Applause] and we they have given their energy and they they've wanted to do it their way to hell and uh I know it's it's tiresome uh to them that I appreciate that they have the the willingness to to carry on the vision and also I want to thank those who have helped outside the brothers of the parking and the ushering they were doing it out in the rain and they they got to hear bits and pieces of the service but uh they were out there not only doing the parking but making sure that no one Brakes in your car and takes the money or whatever you got in there and so I I really appreciate them doing that and I I want to say and I know my church feels the same way as thank you to all of you who have volunteered to help whether it be in the kitchen whether it be here in the meeting we're just a small group and there's no way absolutely no way you can turn this down it's ringing but there's no way that we could have done this without Brothers new brothers and sisters volunteering to hell and and I I so thank you so much I wish I could repay you a thousand fold um [Applause] and um and so I those that have contributed uh in money I know this tent that you see I I last year there were those of you sitting in the rain with umbrellas and we were cold because of the we couldn't raise lower the flaps because of other people sitting outside and and so it was a little catastrophe but I I purposed that I was going to get a 10 and I told you last year I'll have a tent next year not knowing how I was going to do this but I was going to do it by God's grace and several Brothers came to me afterwards and you get that 10 I want to help and by God's grace this sin is paid for and I thank God for it praise the Lord and there there have been brother Mark Spencer they have their church not too far from here 15 minutes 15 there in Charlottesville and but they have contributed uh money they they wanted in any way to help their Church help us and they've been he dismissed this church today service today to be here and so Mark I really thank you for that it has been so much and um [Applause] most of our the the the Brethren uh well I guess all that have administered uh here uh this week I'm supposed to be giving them the offering and they have contributed money uh either with with paying for lunches or paying whatever they they have just been uh very so they're not just preaching to you but they they have supported it in in other ways and I just say God bless each and every one of you so much um for this and so I I I'm probably missing some but if if any of you have contributed brother Manuel even though he wasn't able to be Eerie you sent money with his dad to give to us and I know I'm missing a lot here but uh just other names um that that have contributed individuals and I again I want to say thank you so much and if I don't get to shake your hand or tell you personally I want to tell you now thank you and God bless you dearly and uh by God's grace if we don't uh if the Lord if we're still here we'll continue this next year and so we invite you already invited to come back and uh my wife did tell me to mention this to you that if you do think you're coming you've got a ring in this but if you think you're coming uh uh it's best to reserve rooms now you can always cancel if if somehow you can't because I know there are some that have tried to get it later and all the hotels were booked uh them apart and wasn't able to to come or whatever so if you do want to come back the best thing you could do is is reserve a room and if you're not able to by some unseen incident you can always count cancel not counseling but cancel amen so uh also uh God bless you young people and I love just to see everyone dancing up here uh rejoicing amen praise the Lord we got something to Rejoice about what a message have we heard today exalting the message that God has sent to us and I appreciate every Minister that has preached preached this week I love them dearly and I know you do too and you've been blessed and uh uh one other thing uh two other things but uh for you young people we do have the gym that you all went to Friday um we've got that same gem uh reserved at four o'clock and uh and so if you want to go and have a good time uh we would love for you to come and and I do ask this apparently there's an upstairs uh there and they got video games up there please do not go upstairs and play their games they called us and asked us not to do that and so we would just depreciate that you uh just don't go up there that's their their place and so anyway but if you'd like to go and if you need directions uh Daniel guy in the back there want to shoot me that's my son he can give you directions or show you what to do there but he'll be around and so and then um anywhere but he's going to be there as well I'm not missing rosham I see you in here he's like me short oh he's in the kitchen okay he's got a good excuse so uh anyways so we want to do that if you want to come also a sister from Arkansas uh sister Patty uh Ogden I guess had had written a book on shangard and the ox gold and it's it's told in the story that brother Branham tells it and so she's donated I think there's 96 books that we have to to the children and so if you want if you want a book for your grandchildren your children uh whatever they're they're in the back and you can just go straight back there and they can uh give them and give you one or whatever there but I've read it and it's just a tremendous tremendous little book and and so your your children won't be told a fairy tale that'll be told the truth and uh so about what happened in the Bible and uh so if you want one it's professionally done I say God bless her for that and and uh I don't know how much she had to pay that it's a really quality book a man and so anyways we've got food prepared got uh smoked chicken I think that's how brother will done it and got pork up there and got all kinds of stuff and so we want you to stay and eat because there's going to be enough food for everyone and I don't want to eat it all so you've got to take some food with you or if you got to go or stay in fellowship and uh also I was going to ask uh if you young brothers would want to take some time and help us stack these chairs um we uh we got a lot of them and uh we just if we can at least have your help on that uh man uh we'll ask your mom give you a big hits or something but um so in any ways uh it it would just be a tremendous blessing amen so God bless you may we just bow our hearts in prayer brother Nick would you want to come and and dismiss us and pray over the food we appreciate brother Nick and it goes to brother Wayne's church and and uh been a great help to us amen God bless everyone let's just Bauer heads Heavenly Father we thank you so much for the visitations and and today we heard that we're equipped with a sword to take through the week through the through the months day to day to battle the enemy we are Overcomers we heard it we saw it we're in the third pool we are the third pool we thank you Lord for the tremendous visitation
