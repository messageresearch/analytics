well he's planning on going to Liberty I believe it is and so they're in Lynchburg is that right so anyways but if you're good to see you all amen and uh just good to have all the Home Folks praise

talk to our Lord father we're thankful for another day that you blessed us with and watching over us bringing us here safely tonight Lord we could come together to worship you father how we long just to be in your presence and to talk it all over with you father and we're just asking now that you had anoint the service this part Lord anoint myself father and onto people Lord may we just get ourselves out of the way and may you have the preeminence is our prayer we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord first Thessalonians the fifth chapter and um in the 17th um verse is just one one verse but it says pray without ceasing amen pray without ceasing and then it will go back to First Timothy I think the the word is important you believe that and um we had read this uh last Wednesday and it's a simple verse but um uh First Timothy um actually the eighth verse is I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting amen then one more scripture in First Corinthians the 14th chapter First Corinthians chapter 14. and um the 15th verse it says what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also amen you can have your seats this evening and um I want to use the the title that I'd used last Wednesday and that is why we should pray and uh I uh just a a simple thought I'm not much of a preacher by any means and but uh we pray that the the Lord would just plant the word into our hearts and um but I I think Satan I think he fights us all uh on on our prayer life and that seems to be a a common battle I think um if if we would all um look at it uh uh Satan fights us and and they're just times uh that it isn't just the easiest thing to do and that is to get down and and pray and and you know we we come up with all kinds of excuses as to why you know we don't pray and and you know I I think our our excuses has has us believing that we can't pray or that we ain't got time to pray or uh and and and these things but uh to be honest I I it's Satan is the one that supplies us with these these kinds of excuses uh because uh I don't I don't think God uh would make the day too short to where we couldn't pray if he wants us to pray and so apparently he thinks 24 hours in a day is pretty adequate enough to find time to pray on a daily basis and and so uh but there is a reason as to why Satan uh fights Us in in this way in in our prayer and and again um brother Branham mentions it several times but in one place he said prayer is the greatest weapon uh in the world and and and and so um you know we we read about different characters uh in the Bible and how they had something to defeat the enemy with and um whether you know it was uh uh a slingshot um or whether it was just uh uh you know an ox gold or uh what whatever it would would be but these stories aren't fictitious they ain't something that we just use for a bedtime story but but they they are a reality and and they are to give us hope that if if they had something if a natural Seed of Abraham could take a natural weapon under the spirit of God and and defeat uh the enemy with whether it being a lion or whether it was one man against 600 soldiers or whether it was the you know just a choir out there singing and the enemy uh Was Defeated or or whatever it was amen then then it would give us or it should give us as the Royal Seed of Abraham uh a courage to know that God has given us something to defeat the end enemy with ain't that right and and you know we we look at at Satan or at Samson and and Samson just just a common man and yet we we uh when the lion come at him uh he would just rip the Jaws apart and uh when the Philistines came at him he defeated a thousand Philistines I believe and and it was just a story after story of the supernatural upon that man and and and we find that the the the secret to Samson's strength was not in his muscular power but in his uh the physical but it was his hair uh it was a Nazarite uh that uh a vowel and it was his long hair and nothing could conquer him nothing could imprison him nothing could hinder him and you know you read where the Bible says that they would put ropes around him and and try to bind him and he would just break him and there was a power that that the the the the the Nations and the enemy did not know where he was getting this from y'all's brother Brandon tells us that he was just a little mama's boy skinny little kid and and yet there was a hidden power and that was in his hair but when the enemy cut off his hair then Samson was just like any Normal Man and the enemy was able to make a slave out of him and put his eyes out and and you know the story well the prophet in talking of Samson's string then he begins to talk of the the the church's strength and that is a prayer life he said that that the the secret to the church's strength uh is is the prayer life and if the enemy is able to take our prayer life away then we become no different than the rest of the religious World ain't that right now brother Branham says I can almost point you to a church like that helpless defeated blind rejecting the promises rejecting the word a church that Christ promised that would have power over sickness for he says in my name they shall cast out Devils taken up a devil and casting him away and the blessings that he promised his church and because the church has turned from prayer meetings and from sincerity and made the religion of Christ a tradition and has took all the strength out of it glamor has come into our churches and she stands just about defeated can you imagine that look at David when he defeated Goliath with that slingshot and and uh what what a thing that was David just a little boy but that he was an anointed and he had something in his hand a man to fight that that Goliath with and it wasn't anything that the world would have would have picked amen but but God was with David and David knew uh uh uh how to use that sling ain't that right well the prophet like him the slingshot to David as what prayer is to the church and and so uh uh he said you've got the greatest weapon in the world in your hands and that is prayer can you say Amen see so God did not leave us here in this layout of sin age uh to be defeated amen we're living in an age where where the enemy is coming like an onslaught it's it's the demons are pouring out from everywhere and it's invading the homes the schools the Nations the world the churches it's it's it's ruining uh uh marriages and the people's minds are so twisted and all of that and yet God in this age says he will have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish and there's got to be a reason why he gave us a weapon a man to defeat the enemy with and that is by prayer amen first Peter 3 and 12 it says for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers not their complaints not their gripes not the grumblings but their prayer can you say amen amen see and so it's it's through prayer that the lame has walked it's been through prayer that the blind is seen the dead has been raised the crippled have walked the death here it's been through prayer that the sinner has been saved the drug addict uh delivered and and on and on and on you think of today how did we get here tonight amen it's because somebody prayed for us amen whether it was a mama and a daddy or a grandmother or a grandfather or the preacher or just a a Godly saint that spent time on their knees in prayer for us amen but there there was somebody praying amen it wasn't just a magic wand A man that was just waved over us but somebody was praying somebody took us a man on their hearts and and began to pray the Bible says the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much a man a James 5 15 it says the prayer of faith shall save the sick do you believe that amen and that's just not talking of physically but that is Also spiritually whatever you have need of the prayer of faith will save you the prayer of faith will deliver you amen you see the prophet said when the weakest of saints fall on their knees in prayer even the devil's tremble they don't tremble at your your your your scholarship they don't tremble because you can put fancy words together they don't tremble because you can run around the church and roll on the floor and speak in tongues and and all of that that don't what make them tremble but when you get a weakest Christian on their knees and begin to pray the devil begins to tremble amen and no wonder he fights us so hard amen because it's it's it's a weapon that God has given you and I amen do you believe that amen we we think of word word word and I'm glad for the word I appreciate the word the word is powerful but the word without prayer Ain't Nothing To Us you've got to put that word to practice and that is by prayer amen the prophet said what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God not only a power has been given to us by prayer but it's been a privilege that's been given to us to be able to pray unto our father Amen brother Branham says the backbone of this nation is good old mothers and dads at the prayer meeting on their knees praying amen that's what makes a a nation is when you get people no wonder he's got us into sports and and movies and he's got us in in all kinds of programs and all of that he's got us distracted from the real thing and that is prayer can you say Amen when Mom and Dad ceases to pray the Devil comes in and he can he can do anything because there's nothing to keep him at Bay when the church ceases to pray when the nation ceases to pray amen when the individual ceases to pray can you say amen amen you can know the Bible you can know the message you can know it all but if you ain't got a prayer life that's the weapon against the devil amen second chronicles 7 14 If my people which are called by my name notice that my people a man which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land do you understand that that's not all America that's not the whole world but if my people which are called by my name ain't that right when you begin to pray and and when there's things that are in your life that you know that that you've done wrong you made your mistakes and and all that get on your knees and pray amen because there's a God that is waiting to hear your prayer amen and to answer them do you believe that amen see uh uh that's right Amen brother Brown said we would have less juvenile delinquency if mothers and fathers spent more time on their knees praying bringing their children to God through prayer instead of out in these parties drinking and running around amen uh we we all know the the story of Job what a father he was a Godly father a man that knew what it was to pray amen and he was a man that prayed for his children even after even after his children were married and gone on a man with her own lives amen job as a father kept that kept his children amen before the Lord and the prophet said he knew what path to turn to when he got in trouble he said some of us go other paths in this neurotic age that we're living in so many people turn uh to the psychiatrists Christians go to the psychiatrist the psychiatrist has to go to the psychiatrist and everything amen but someone's forgetting to pray job didn't go to the psychiatrist he didn't go to the uh to the counselors he didn't go looking for professional help he got on his knees and he began to pray ain't that right prayer amen so we we see Amen brother Adam said you want God to send the power upon you go to pray and then believe it the Holy Ghost will bring it to you bring healing bring Salvation or whatever everybody say whatever whatever you have need of God will bring it to you now that's a promise do you believe that that is a that is that's thus saith the Lord that is a promise that whatever you have need of go to praying praise the Lord yes sir why does God allow situations to come in our life it's because God has placed confidence in US that we would be able to pray the prayer of faith you think of that that we would be able to pray the prayer of faith you see God's not God's not oblivious of our troubles God God is not our you know we're not hid from God but but if if you look at it on God's end he's got confidence in you ain't ain't that right there's other people that are turning away there's other people living half mediocre lives and lukewarm lives but then but then there are people that are living true lives and yet you've got your troubles and it's not because God don't love you it's not because God is forsaken you it's actually the prophet said God has placed confidence in US God's Place confidence in US knowing that we're able we're able to pray the prayer of faith can you say amen amen see and so he says here any believer he says any believer that's got this Holy Spirit you have the power of God within you or the authority to pray the prayer of faith ain't that right so so the Holy Ghost it wasn't given you to excite you it that that comes with it I'm sure it wasn't given you to to roll on the floor and do flip-flops and you you may do that I don't know but one thing it does give you is the authority to pray the prayer of faith amen we all need to pray can you say Amen you don't leave it to the preacher to do all your praying you don't leave it to Mom and Dad to do all your praying you don't leave it to everybody else to do all you you got your troubles that you get on your knees and you pray the prayer of faith and what's your troubles go away can you say amen and that's the relationship that God wants us to have now it's there's nothing wrong with praying for one another we need one another and that's all part of it amen but but don't don't don't think that we can just go and live in a a a carnal life and let everybody do our praying for us amen that's what the Catholics was doing you know that it was the priest that was holy the people just done whatever they want to and they would take care of it all amen but the prophet said that ain't the way it is the preacher's got to be holy the Saints have got to be holy the preacher's got to do is praying the Saints have got to do their praying can you say amen and sometimes you young people got to do your own praying [Applause] [Music] so why why doesn't God just automatically give what we need if if he knows we're having need and and and sometimes he allows these things to linger and it just seems like he just don't know and and and so automatically we wonder God where are you so why now now I'm I'm here to assure you he knows exactly where you're at he knows your troubles he knows what ails you whether it's physically spiritually mentally he knows but see what what it is is the prophet said the kingdom of God lays within the human being hey ain't that right Jesus said I'm Divine and you are the branches and and brother Brown said see the the vine cannot bear the fruit only the branches ain't that right see the vine cannot bear the fruit only the branches God cannot bear fruit of himself it's got to take the church so when you branches he says are yielded to the vine then the fruit comes forth see what I mean God wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you we've read the quotes before where brother Branham amen talk to how God decided to live inside of you so he could defeat his own enemy in you he gonna take your body and defeat his enemy ain't that right so he wants to take you and believe through you he wants to pray through you he wants to speak through you he wants them mountains to move through your lips that's why Jesus says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will you shall ask everybody say I shall ask I shall ask you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if you say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea amen and shall not doubt in your heart but shall believe that those things which you say a man shall come to pass you shall have whatsoever you say Do you believe that well if we're going to speak to our Mountain then there has to be a mountain standing in our way and I don't care what kind of a mountain it is if it's a mountain it's something that you don't know what you're going to do about you don't know how you're going to get over that mountain it's there standing in your way to prevent you from moving on Amen and that's the mountain that Jesus said if you speak to that mountain ain't that right amen he ain't going to do your speaking for you so this mountain before you is not an imaginary your problem amen is not imaginary it's not something that is fictitious it is real but God wants it to be real we're not playing games here the enemy is real but your Victory is real and his defeat is real do you believe that amen see so only a Son of God has the authority to speak to the mountain notice Jesus says another place whatsoever things you desire think of it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them can you say Amen so I'll say that again whatsoever things you desire if you pray he didn't say that did he he said when you pray you can sit there and quit you know I just wished I just wish how many times have you prayed it's not if you pray but when you pray can you say Amen so so then that that's obvious that we are going to be a people of Prayer so what's whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so he's not teaching you how to cope if if you want to cope how to be an alcoholic and and cope with that go to the AAA if if you if you want to learn how to cope with things in life there's all kinds of programs but the gospel doesn't teach you how to cope [Applause] can you say man the kingdom of God lays within you so so then we find that prayer has value it is valuable and and and you don't treat something that is valuable as though it is worthless and no good you you you if you don't see the value in it you're going to cast it off yeah true I um I remember my my uncle my mom's side um he had him and his wife it was actually his wife's uh mother had passed away and so they inherited a lot of things and and a lot of antiques that he had no clue about value and so he didn't see value he saw it as junk and so I began to sell these things and he sold something for five dollars to my aunts you know and she went and sold it for a thousand and you know it is because he didn't see value he just wanted it out of his way and so many times we treat prayers the same way it becomes burdensome to us when we don't realize it's your very ticket amen it's your very thing that you whatever you pray whatever when you pray whatever you desire you shall have but you've got to pray ain't that right prayer is so important it it's not it's not you know when you start complaining you'll have it or or when you start grumbling you'll have it or when you start worrying about it you'll have it or when you don't know what to do that's when you're going to get it no it's when you pray believing that whatever you say you shall have [Music] ain't that right so so there's power in prayer Dayton here's what the prophet said and I I thought it was profound he said you take the world and their way of life and then take a people who pray and see who gets better results right and and and this is exactly what Elijah did he he he of course you you know the story the whole nation almost the whole nation uh uh had had went toward bail to idolatry and and so God sent a Prophet Elijah to bring it all down to a showdown to see who was God and so instead of saying you know God is God God is God he says you know what let's bring this to a showdown let's prove who's God all right you 400 prop to Ahab you get your your prophets and your preachers and all that and and and you you build your altars first you do whatever you think you got to do and let's see the god that answers by fire let him let him come and that's the one we're going to serve ain't that right and and so they that so he allowed them to pray to their God he made fun of them and they ain't get nowhere and and and so then he began to pray unto his God Amen and and and we find amen that the God answered by fire ain't that right well brother Branham spoke to an audience in in Kentucky uh Louisville Kentucky who was gathered there for prayer there must have been a big drought it was in the 50s and and so uh they had all come together for prayer and so they invited him to uh to to speak uh for for a few moments and so he he told them this he he said you you have a beer party down here to start your gaiety or have a big picnic somewhere and let the whole world turn into that and bring rain on the earth amen so so this now this is just the serious thing because everybody you know well God ain't answering God ain't this and God ain't that well let's just bring it to a showdown then if the world says that their God is right then let's do it let's ever let the whole world turn to sports let them turn into movies let them turn to their actors let them turn to all the gods of this world and see what God of God their God can do for us hey can you say amen that's right see he said see let's try that tonight you just open up every Saloon give everybody all the drinks they can and make the Christians stay home and not pray and everything like that and see if you can bring rain and prosperity to the nation he said but then you close them every one all the bars all the saloons and and everything else stop all your meanness and everything and get down on your knees and call out to God and watch what happens and let the god the answers let him be God can you say Amen let him be God see amen he said let's do a trial he said I've seen that tried many times I said you get one of the persons let's bring the sick and Afflicted and find out who's God God will be the same thing in this see amen he says if you people around this area here one an old-fashioned pouring down rain you just get down on your knees and all of you start around here start calling out to God with the sincere heart burn up everything in your house amen and uh uh he says uh take that that beer bottles out of the ice ice box and throw away that deck of cards and take the children and take them off to Sunday school and stay in prayer instead of running out and running around and getting all about the way you do get on your knees and start praying and God will send you the rain don't do you believe that well I believe that's the same thing because I I tell you what God did not God did not call us out of the world just for us just to not know who God really is and and for him to remain silent and him to amen just to remain hidden from us God answers prayer and he will answer your prayer if you'll pray to him yes sir I believe that you believe that he called you out of unbelief he called you out of the mutton sin of the world to show his power through you and to you so I believe that God is bringing this to a showdown you believe that I I do and and and people are choosing as to what side they are on the nominations keep saying they have the answer we say the word of God has that how many knows the word of God has the answer you know the word of God has the answer it's true don't lie you believe that and don't lie say he he doesn't lie amen well the religious World they they say they have the authority well we say the sons of God have the authority do you believe you got the authority now if we're sons of God now everybody raise their hands on on the Bible now do you believe you have the authority amen if the Bible is true he says you've got the authority so we've got to raise our hands on that one too amen that's right see so we say the sons of God have the authority well then now now church we know we know that God has answered by fire in this day do you believe that God has answered by fire in this day and the god of theology the god of psychology the God of this world has been exposed for what it is it's nothing it's a bluff it's it's powerless it's it's everything that that that that that it says it's not amen it's just a flat liar amen all the gods are powerless amen but now I'm talking about you and your personal experience and your personal crisis you see the world says that it's the God of Pleasure that will help your children but I say to you the god of Israel will help your children do you believe that the world says the god of science is the answer for your sickness but I say to you Jehovah God Is The Answer amen hospitals ain't the answer God Is The Answer medication ain't the answer God is the answer I understand that God works through medication and we we believe in that stuff amen that we don't get to the point that we forsake God and think that the doctor has our answers and then all of a sudden he says well there ain't no more hope for you than we just fall apart if he don't know what to do and he can't fix us there's a God that's still known let him answer by fire then you say Amen see you got to bring it to a showdown don't be afraid to bring God to a showdown the prophet said amen amen that's right don't let the devil back you up don't let the devil intimidate you you say but you don't understand the crisis that I am I don't care it's still God he's God over everything he's got over every name whatever your face and he's God and you've got the weapon in your hands to defeat him that devil and that's by prayer the prophet said see don't be afraid to bring to put God to a showdown he's great in battle do you believe that he's great in battle now our enemy of course is not a natural enemy Ephesians 6 12 Paul says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so see our fight is a different fight amen we're not wrestling against human beings we're not wrestling against the government we're not wrestling against a nation amen that's not our warfare that's not our fight let the politicians let everybody else do that that's their fight the fat ain't our fight we're not wrestling against flesh of blood so we handle it differently can you say Amen our weapon is different amen see so what do we do amen we go to our knees and prayer and pray through till we get the victory that shouldn't be foreign to us that's what the prophet said we pray through till we get victory victory victory is yours brother Bill victory's mine but we got to get pray and pray through pray through get down there and pray through until we get to Victory don't act as God ain't for us God is for you he's already told you in his word he's for you what else can he do for us oh God is for us until we go through battles God loves us until we go through things and we think God doesn't love and then that's when we start questioning it but if his word is true and if we're sons of God then we've got the answer already we don't have to wait for God to give answers we've got that answer pray through until you get victory Hallelujah when a sick person prays through to where he knows that it's God's will for him to be healed that's what brother Graham said pray through and tell you no tell you no ain't that right now the prophet says when that person does pray through notice what he says he said there's no need for a minister to pray for that individual all the minister has to do is lay hands on him and cast that devil off because that saint of God has already prayed through he already knows healing is for him so it doesn't take the prayer of a Preacher to pray no he's already done the praying through he's already got the victory he's already knows he's already come through it that it's God's will for him to be healed now we just cast that devil off then you say Amen that that's exactly right see he said see you pray until we go beyond the sound barrier of sin and unbelief brother Branham called it praying through to Victory go pray until you get past that same barrier of unbelief pray until you get past that sound barrier of skepticism and doubt and worrying and and questioning amen pray through until you get to victory that you know that God is going to answer and you know that your prayer has been heard and that victory is yours and and that everything that you have longed for the desires of your heart has now been given unto you it's prayer hope is all right prayer Hebrews 4 16 Paul said let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace in time to help in time of need see so how do we come before the Throne of God grace by prayer when you come into prayer see and and while while praying the prophet said we look to the throne of God with confidence so this is where your prayers got to have confidence you got to be confident in prayer not I'm going to try it and see if it'll work out that ain't confident you're not looking at God and confident but when you come to pray amen and you're coming Before the Throne of God that throne of grace amen you come boldly you come confidently that whatever you say to God he's going to hear your prayer amen and he's going to answer them prayers can you say Amen now amen and seat now there is a reason there is a reason that you must have this confidence uh uh and and this is again in the natural sense uh but first Kings 8 and 30 tells us of the prayer that Solomon uh prayed as he dedicated the temple and he said Lord God of Israel hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people when they shall pray toward this place in other words when they pray look into this place amen that and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest to forgive ain't that right so remember when they pray looking toward this this place the temple then hear from heaven now that prayer now you think of that prayer he's just praying to God that they that anyone that would that is away from from the place if they would just when they pray look to the temple amen that you would hear their prayer well here years later here's a prophet Jonah he got himself in trouble ain't that right amen and he finds himself down in the depths of the ocean in the whale's belly the prophet said there's no man that has had a situation like Jonah he was in a he was in a horrible condition but he remembered the prayer of Solomon amen he just didn't look and say well then we're just words of a man no no no no he believed in prayer he knew the quality of prayer and he knew that if that man prayed God heard it can you say Amen the prophet said it was a prayer of a prophet and he began to pray amen Solomon remember or Jonah remembered it see in that condition and he believed that Jonah uh two and one says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord is God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou hurtest my voice for thou had has cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods compassed about me amen all by Billows and thy waves passed over me then said I I am cast out of thy sight what a what a condition Jonah was in yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple amen he was basing his actions off of the prayer of a man that had backslid can you say amen that's right see he and and the temple amen it was built by a man a man all it was nothing Eternal he was it was destroyed eventually down down the years amen but the prophet said if Jonah could do that look to a natural Temple amen because of a prayer of a man that had later on backslid but Jonah believed in prayer and he he put that he started to look to that Temple he started he knew somewhere you know but he was in the depths he was in a problem amen but notice this see he says if he can do that how much more ought we under these present conditions look away from our symptoms to the throne of God where Jesus sits at the right hand of God on a throne by a temple that was made by God with his own blood to make good anything that we confess can you say Amen you think of that the prayer of Solomon's a Jonas so believing in that prayer that it caused him not to look at his conditions it caused him not to look at his surrounding it caused him to begin to pray in faith knowing that God would hear his prayer Amen in effect be the case then we've got an eternal God Amen and is a high priest that is making intercession on our prayer you realize that he's making an intercession on your prayers that's why you should pray that's why Satan bothers us with prayer that's why he hinders us because every time you pray you realize the prophet said that Jesus cannot make intercession for you until you pray okay you confess it he you've got to give him something to make intercession far can you say Amen but he's making intercession based off your prayer father I need you there's an inner ceasing he's interceding for you right then father I I need my finances met father I've got a mountain my father I need my my boy saved I need my family saved I need oh Father I don't know what to do I need a picking up in my heart I I just need you father amen and and the words that you're spitting out there in your prayer you don't have to be beautiful words just begin to pray begin to speak words and there he is interceding on your confession you believe that amen you know the prophet speaking of Jonah then he says this you can't hide a saint from prayer he said I don't care where you go You Can't Hide a saint from prayer he could be in the depths of hell but he knows where it's at prayer he could be his back against the wall and it could be so Bleak that he don't know what to do but get him on his knees and he'll start praying then you say Amen well look at Paul he was in the middle of the ocean the ways amen were sinking the ship they were Shipwrecked amen and and all hope was lost but there was a man on that ship that knew how to pray and he began to pray in the middle of the storm in the middle of everything when it looked like it was no hope amen he got on his knees and he prayed through amen until he can look at them men and say man fear not for an angel of the Lord appear to me and told me not one man that abide in this ship will be lost why pray through you didn't say oh let's let's turn on Fox News let's let's watch a movie folks we got we get we got a lot of we got a lot of problems let's get our minds off the problems you anybody got a boat so we can go to Hawaii for a little while thank you no there was one man that knew how to pray he understood the value of Prayer can you say man and the prophet said he prayed through pray through you see prayer works the Hebrew children when they're facing the fiery furnace brother Brahman said they prayed through they knew it was okay Daniel and the Lion's Den that Prophet said he prayed through he knew it'd be all right Joseph in prison pray through Paul and Silas in the jailhouse they prayed through can you say Amen see you you the prophet said you can put the believer in any condition wherever it may be and they'll pray through they know the power of prayer can you say Amen they know the power of prayer see we're not carnal Believers that don't know the Our God we we're not one that is professed Believers and yet we've got our own imagination of God and and that imagination he does not answer prayer and he just leaves us the way we are so we have to just defend for ourselves we have to lean to the politics we have to lean to the stock market we have to lean to investment we have to lean to the psychologist we have to lean to all of that no no no we're not that type of people we are the Saints of the Living God that have the power Amen to shake the hells of the walls of Hell by our prayer and the weakest of Christians when they go on their knees amen the devil's tremble brother Brahman says a real believer holds on to that prayer he said I don't care what take place he holds on to that prayer one place who said you find Christ on your knees you get answers when you fall on your knees James says you have not because you ask not brother Bram says in one place when Israel started praying for a prophet God had the prophet God had the prophet all the time he had the answer all the time because God's always a jump ahead of them not think of this quote now you're not waiting for God to do something like it's your idea like hello God don't you know hello I don't know where you're at you you behind him I don't know he's he's already a step ahead of you he's already got the answer see he already had a prophet waiting for him but here's what a prophet said but he was waiting for the people to go to praying he was waiting for the people to really want the answer he was waiting for the people for God to really come through on the scene he had him waiting that he was waiting for the people to realize they needed it can you say amen and when they started to pray God had the prophet on the sin I'm gonna tell you something God's already got your answer God or he's got to figure it out he already knows what he's going to do to work this problem out he already knows amen how to defeat the enemy in your life whatever Mountain you're he knows how to dissolve it it's not up to say well I wonder how they if I speak to it I wonder how it's going to leave I wonder I just wonder forget about it it's not up to you to figure all of that out let don't don't control God just pray just speak God promised to answer prayer you believe it John 14 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glory in the fight in the son if you shall ask anything everybody say anything come on now anything is there any barriers to that well Tim is there any barriers is there is there just little parts that we can only pray for not I think anything means everything I think anything means everywhere whatever you want it's yours if you ask anything in my name that's no wonder the prophet said ask big ask for big things how many has ever had God do something for you can he do it again [Music] when you prayed did he do it amen you know my mom we were we were really poor back in the day and we didn't have money to to buy things and Mom's wash machine broke down and we didn't have the money to get it fixed mom knew it so she's like man I Lord I gotta I gotta I got a wash here and so she just put her hands up on that that washer and said in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you Satan made this thing start working started working why God answered prayer you believe it amen God answers prayer yes he does I was on me and Josiah doing a job and we've done we was doing 36 stumps just right in a row oh my second to the last my machine started acting up I thought Man this ain't the time for it to be acting up I won't go home I mean I won't get done with this job I don't want to come back you know and so we thought you know we didn't know what it was so brother Josiah went and got some more gas just in case that was it and it was just barely gone just barely I thought man you know just something just pray and don't remind me of Mom praying so I just laid my hands on that thing I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ whatever is wrong with this machine you leave it alone and I'll get these stumps done and that thing backfired about scared the Daylights out of me and the thing ran didn't even have any problems since prayer works now God will do that for the natural things and God will do it for your eyes sister Bonnie he'll do it for your eyes he can do it he'll do it for your children he'll do it for anything that you have need of the weapon is in your hands you're not asking God to give you the weapon God's already supplied you with the weapon and really it's the easiest thing open thy mouth wide and I'll feel it and we all know how to talk then you say Amen we all know how to talk but a lot of times we allow Satan to use negative words use our mouth to speak negative words instead of speaking a negative word get down on your knees let let this preacher get down on his knees let the people get down on their knees and begin to pray and watch God come on the scene then you say amen that's right see if you ask anything in my name I'll do it now we know that he hasn't seen this just to anyone because later on in in John 15 17 15 7 we read this earlier but he said if you abide in me if you abide in me and my words abide in you my promises abide in you you're not receiving all the Hollywood you're not receiving junk you're actually taking in the word and you're receiving it you're believing it and saying Lord that's mine that's mine that's mine and that word abides in you can you say Amen then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done in unto you now brother Brown says see the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is see if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true you believe that Moses father was a man of Prayer and he is actually one of the Bible characters that is a pattern of what we should be he was in slavery uh with the rest of Israel and all these things but he knew that God promised and I want you to listen now he knew that God promised to deliver them you see you must know what God promised and you must believe it you must know what God has promised and you must believe it this is where if you abide in me my word abide in you say no and and so this is where we'd read in our opening scripture pray everybody say pray with understanding pray with understanding so Abraham amram he he knew what God had promised he believed in it and so you know the prophet describes it how he would he came home one night to their little Hut and told his wife how bad it was getting him and all of these things and he told his wife he said you know I predict that you know uh if God ever does anything for us it'll be after we're all dead and and it was just getting so bad so wicked and and they were now just putting women to work and and these things but the prophet said but God doesn't wait like that God doesn't wait until we're all dead and defeated and weak and destroyed that he says he watches us sometimes God watches so that night a amaram went somewhere and he started praying like he never prayed before and brother Brown said now that's the way to pray pray like you never prayed before get desperate I hope this is helping us he said if you just go up and say Lord bless so and so and so and so well God doesn't God don't take the interest much to that but when you really get down to business when you little boys and girls pray get down to business he said do you do that in school you ask God to help you in school when you're going to go to school don't you make uh he said and you don't make a very good grades you go in and say God I want you to help me today do you have a secret place where you go pray where Mommy and Daddy don't even see you do you pray like that you don't you don't pray like that you know he's talking to little ones but he says have a little place step out and pray and say your little prayer you say it every night before you go to bed he said when you get up at morning honey he says oh that's good he says how many other little boys and girls raise your hand he says that praise way over the building ain't that fine well that's good that shows you really you you got a real mother and daddy that teaches you to do those things when you really get in need you better pray sincerely haven't you see you know and and so he goes on of how that amaran got so desperate until he didn't want to suffer that night and his wife tried to get him to eat because he was so frail and and all that and he says no he's like I just can't eat he's I just gotta go pray and and so she she's trying to tell him no no eating he says you know he says but dear if somebody don't take the people the heart if somebody don't pray for the people what are we going to do see we're getting worse surely sometimes God will hear see amen and he says that's right God will hear can you say that with me God will hear you get down to business and just stay there ain't that right see so it's up to us now Abraham amen really he was him and his wife were just about the only Believers that really just believed God and it took him it took somebody to get on their knees and get to desperate amen not just for himself but for the people Amen in church if we ain't going to get desperate who is going to get desperate if we don't take our children before the Lord who's going to do it if we don't take one another before the Lord if we don't come down into desperation and to pray who's going to do it can you say amen he said so he says this time he goes upstairs different he goes upstairs this time he kneels down he puts his hands up in the air and he hollers God I'm speaking to you now he says see amen get into business God thou has steers and you can hear thou Hast eyes and you can see thou has to memory you know your words you know your promise I plead to you God look down here the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that your people are in distress and they're dying do something for us God we've got to have you at once we just got to have you or we're going to perish we must have you see we just got to if we live he said that's when you really pray he said Oh my he prayed amen see sometimes when we pray we get tired how many gets tired when you pray well brother Brown says I do too he's like I get tired he says fasting and and and you're praying he said you pray I pray I pray I pray and then you go preaching and he says oh he says I just get so tired see amen he says but that's no time to give up you keep on for God will answer yes sir keep holding on can you say Amen Keep Holding On so amram said to his wife I'm going up to pray now if you hear me weeping don't you come up well but Abram Amor amram what are you going to do honey you're just about dead he said yes but I got the people the burden of the people in my heart I got to do something I got to stay on my knees you know and and again we're called to intercede amen that that's what we're called uh is to intercede for the people amen for The Sinner for our lost loved ones and and and what you're doing in prayer you're bringing them up before the throne of grace there there are loved ones look at them they they're cut off from God Satan's cut them off that because of their sin and and all of that but you as a as a daddy as a mom as preachers as as whatever as a scene of God you're toting this into your heart and you're taking those that can't pray that are bound by the devil and now you're coming and holding them before the Throne of Grace that God could intercede on your prayer [Music] Abram was doing that amram by praying holding the people up in prayer but notice what brother Branham said the people were getting bitter against God because they prayed and prayed and prayed and nothing was happening so the people were getting bitter and he said that's the same thing that's happening today people get bitter with God because they don't see things working out the way they think it should work out and so therefore there was hardly anyone back then that believed that God still answered prayer but thank God for an amram that believed that God answered prayer can you say Amen and and and if there's ever a Time that we need to pray it's now because I've I've as I've told you amen we're we're fighting the worst stage we're in living in the worst age ever Satan's had more freedom in this age than ever before because the people have empowered him demons are pouring out in every every way amen and if there's ever a time that a people must not get bitter against God it's now don't let your heart get hardened in your troubles don't let your heart when you see the situations and it's and it seems like it's getting worse don't you let the devil Harden your heart to where you'll get bitter against God do you think that there's no use in praying today our young people are at the crossroads in life and I read this quote and it was in 1956 notice what brother Bram says he says do you realize old men when we were boys now this is in 1956 so figure where we're at today and multiply that but he said you realize old men when we were boys our boys has got 10 times the Temptation that we had sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times the Temptation you had when you was a girl what will her daughter have look at the things the pictures the Devils of painting oh how we need to pray hello how we need to pray TV was just coming in they didn't have cell phones they didn't have all this crazy stupid apps people didn't spend their time going taking selfies getting so wrapped up in every carnal thing in this world and yet brother Branham saying that their children his children had it 10 times worse than what he had so look where our children are today compared to that how we need to pray how we need to pray can you say Amen how we need to pray he said see brother do you realize we don't pray half as much as our fathers did Pastor do you no we don't put as much time on our knees as pastors before us did women do you realize we don't instruct your daughter uh you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her at night like your mother did you then what about it who's guilty we're guilty can you say Amen so here's a prophet amen not just opening the seals for us but he's opening uh calling us back to prayer calling us back to the greatest weapon we are not to set in this assembly and set in this age as though we're helpless as though and let the devil ravish our children and rape their minds and do this and have his way and we just sit there oh my God I don't know what I'm going to do you do know what you do amen and that is get on the near knees to pray and there ain't no devil big enough to hinder your prayer can you say Amen it may take a little while to get there amen but but there's a Warfare you remember now amen how Daniel began to pray but there was a Warfare it wasn't that God didn't hear him God heard him the very first word together and he came down to answer but Satan was there Amen to withstand him amen and that battle raised him there for 21 days there was a spiritual warfare but God prevailed and I say to you God always prevails when a saint will get on their knees you don't understand you may not understand the warfare that's going on right now because you're on your knees praying praying praying but you remember this God will answer your prayer God promised he'll answer can you say man may we be a people of Prayer prayer you said see Abraham Ram believe that God still answered prayer he got right down to business that's how we have to do it get right down to business he said God you promised this and we've looked forward to it and we've seen all the seen the signs all year and the time is at hand it's time for you to do something about it and while he was deep in deep consecrated prayer praying with all of his heart he looked and standing in the corner see he rubbed his eyes and looked again there stood an angel with the sword drawn and he said Deliverance is coming and you're going to bring a son into the world and he's going to be the one to deliver them you see God always answers prayer doesn't he if we're just hold on and I say to you tonight keep holding on ain't that right but another thing is I get ready to close look at the prayer that amram prayed he prayed based on God's promise his prayer was founded on God's promise you promised it God are you with me you promised it God see and we know the promise Genesis 15 13. God said unto Abram no of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance see so his prayer amram's prayer was founded on the promise that God made ain't that right now I want you to notice this now uh uh as I was reading uh brother Branham and I thought this was profound amen and but he said you know the Hebrew children didn't have any promise to base their prayer upon he said see they couldn't get back here and read in the Bible and say Lord you promised in your word that any of your children ever went into a fiery furnace you would deliver them all right Lord so we're coming right there based on that ain't that right amen see brother Brown said if they had a promise like that it wouldn't been so hard to pray it wouldn't have been hard just to see it it wouldn't because there would have been a promise but God never gave them a promise such as that hello but you know where there was God is able our God is able can you say that with me our God is able our God is able so now now you've got the promises you can read about the Hebrew boys that's a promise you can read about Daniel in the Lion's Den and watch God come down on the scene that's a promise to you everything that God done to that natural seed is now yours for you are heirs and Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ [Applause] and you say Amen so all see so brother Brown said see if they had a promise like that all they had to do was just anchor their faith because God had already promised it amen see but God was so real to them God was so real to them that they just simply told the king our God is able you do whatever you want to do but I'm telling you God God is able and if it be so that you're able to carry this threat we still ain't going to bow down God was so real to them ain't that right so the prophet said they walked in that furnace with sheer faith not based on one God had promised but upon God is able sheer faith not upon what God had promised but upon God is able ain't that right so brother Branham says now what is it going to be for those people who had the promise and still didn't trust God what is it going to be for those of us that have the promise and still didn't trust God they didn't try to they they had no promise and they still trusted God ain't that right so here God by their faith sheer faith in God is able God honored that faith and sent Christ down to Fan the flames and delivered them from that fiery furnace aren't you glad for that amen so notice now today we do not come before the throne of grace in prayer saying God you're able God you're able God you're able can you say Amen no see our prayers are based upon the promises that God gave God that you said God that you promised not God you're able but God you promised it can you say Amen now I don't care what situation you're in there is a Bible full of promises that you can take to God and not say God you're able God I know I know you're able but it says I am the god that healeth thee amen now you say God you promised it can you say Amen shall be saved amen not God you're able but God you promised it you said it in your word and that's where my faith is based upon yeah our prayers are based on the promise that God gave brother Brown said you say God you promised it and more than that you've already prepared it at Calvary it's already done can you say Amen you provided it and I see others receiving it so I come to you Lord amen to get my part of it brother Brown said if you come like that you'll go away a different person you'll go away with such an anchor inside your soul that nothing can upset you you know that you're healed you know that God has taken care of this matter for you because he promised it [Music] well do you love the Lord isn't he wonderful so that's the way we come to God's promises is we come boldly and accept them and that's the prayer of faith God you promised it not an accusation not accusing God then God you promise it now look look at it where are you no no no you come God you promised it that's where my faith is that's why I'm here praying because you promised it God through Christ has prepared a way and I come to accept it it's an easy thing when you look and see what the promise was made by if you see that it was God that made the promise see if God made the promise God is able to keep his promise oh aren't you glad for that do you love the Lord isn't he wonderful my my mind so don't be afraid to ask God anything don't limit your prayer don't limit God ain't that right you must ask God for anything that he has promised I I know I'm running out of time I got a lot to go but but there is one thing that I am going to read to you if the musicians will come amen now I want you to listen to what brother Brown said don't have confidence in your prayer can you say that with me don't have confidence in your prayer have confidence in what he said he said it and every devil is trembling not trembling at your prayer it's not how eloquent of a prayer you can do remember the boy that didn't know how to pray so he started saying a b c d [Music] some guy heard is some guy heard the boy saying ABC he's what are you doing he's I'm praying is how you praying like that he said well mister I don't know how to pray he's about figured if I just say the alphabet God can put it all together and know what I'm saying what I'm meaning see it's not the eloquence of Prayer it's not words sometimes we go into our closet and we don't even know what to say I know for me and this has really helped me just to be honest because there's sometimes I I want to approach it right I want to set just right and sometimes I mess it all up and the devil whips me on my minds and see you didn't say it right so then I'm trying to say it all over again they said I realized it's not confidence in my prayer it's confidence in what he said God you just take my prayer that's all messed up but I'm just reminding you what you said you said Lord My Heart Is Anchored In what you said brother Graham said God not not with not confidence in my prayer but confidence in your promise no matter how little it is what it is how weak our prayer is God you promised it you promised Hallelujah another place he said we thank and praise thee for the privilege that we have of coming before thee in the way of prayer knowing this first that it is promised to us that if you ask anything in my name I'll do it and we have that assurance that you'll Grant our request do you have that Assurance tonight Church oh my we have the assurance that he'll Grant our request that's why I called you [Music] that's why I saved you that's why I put you through the valleys that's why he allows the mountains to appear in before you because he has confidence that you can pray the prayer of faith he has confidence that he can move on the scene for you and show himself to be real Because he believes that you'll pray that prayer faith that you anchor your prayer Yankee your faith yanker everything into what he promised and here's a whole Bible full of promises Hallelujah aren't you glad for that aren't you glad the book has been open Alleluia just makes our faith so much easier just to take it and say God you promised it I believe it I know it'll work out Hallelujah I love the Lord that all is over Victory is one it's already done oh it's already Hallelujah it's already done do you believe that the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done oh I have overcome I have overcome how Hallelujah I have overcome praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one I have overcome
