to filterate it or bring it in with all kinds of other stuff but just preaches the pure word amen but um Hosea the 12th chapter and um ninth verse we've been reading this uh for a little while but says and I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in Tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast and I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets amen let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we are your people Lord and realizing that we need you more than ever before and our desire is that we would have you more than ever before father as we see the turmoil that's in the world and just such a chaos Lord we're thankful that we could gather here this morning Lord under the protection of your word that you would just um speak to our hearts Lord and bring a comfort remove all fear and frustrations and doubts Lord that father people are looking for answers all around and yet we sit here as blessed people that you have given us the answers Lord and father we don't take it lightly Lord but we we do thank you for sending us a prophet Lord and opening the word father to us and Lord now we just ask that you would just speak to our hearts once again Lord in opening the word to us our understanding is our prayer father if there's any sins that have been committed Lord that is not under the blood we pray that you'd forgive us all father may you be pleased to dwell Among Us here today in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen amen you can be seated and um as we we know um this this life is changing the world is changing everything is just changing history tells us and shows us that change is a very common thing and U if there's anything that we could expect in life and that is our change but the real Christian life is all about change as well and um the Bible speaks of change there right at the beginning when man fell and uh there in Genesis uh 3:15 when God told the serpent I will put enity between thee and uh the woman in between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shal bruise his heel and it was at that time that God was promising a deliverer a a redeemer and letting man know that that the condition of man man that man had fallen into would not always be but there would be a change and Prophets have come and have revealed the the kind of change that was to come God has showed it through the scriptures as to what kind of a change um Abraham and Sarah for example being changed from old to young again their condition of impossibility changed to where they could have a son and that's just one of the changes but but job talked about it in job 14:14 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come amen Thou shalt call and I will answer thee for thou wil have the desire to the work of thine hands Zechariah 3:3 it talks about it Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away these filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of reignment Paul talks about change there in Philippians 3 uh 20 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vow body that it may be fashioned liken to his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to even even to subdue all things un himself Romans 12:2 and be ye not conf formed to this world but be ye transformed or be changed by the renewing of your mind 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face as in a glass the glory beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord or a mirror are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption in other words the change and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass say uh the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory of course we don't have to wait for that change uh uh to feel the effects of change for the Bible says if any man be in Christ he is a new creation he has changed old things are passed away behold all things are become new the Bible talks of the new Heaven and a new Earth things are changing it's all about change God saved you to change you uh uh and so why why must the change and how how can we be sure of the change is is because the infinite God took a picture of you in your Perfection amen and he he took a picture of what you are were to be to look like uh in your physical stature um and and when you were in your Prime uh think the prophet said around you know 2021 or so he he took a picture of you and and and um you you you may have come into this Earth deformed or sick and so many babies even uh uh have fighting sickness diseases or whatever or you may even get crippled up in Life or or you may even get old uh to where you know you lose your hair or uh you ain't got that um you know that youth anymore or whatever but uh uh but God took a picture amen uh in your Prime and and as we know that this is the negative um uh and and and um and you know I I kind of I brother Wayne had brought up a uh illustration uh the other day uh uh there in Ohio where talking of um about that negative you know and and he he he pointed out a brother and he says see now now you you all can see that brother there sitting there he said but now if I'm going to take a negative of that brother take a picture of that brother and he I put it over here he said well I can change anything I want about that brother I can I can I can design him any and all that but no matter what I do about the negative the positive is still there and and and the positive is greater than than what would the negative would be I can distort it all I want to but I can't distort the positive and so so so Satan can take the negative and and and distort Us in any way but but God has the positive and and that's that's what he's kept is the positive and he can never distort the positive he can't touch that so the Prophet said the picture is the main thing ain't that right the the the picture is the name main thing he says now the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if if there is a negative then there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this everybody say this ain't the real thing the negative isn't the real thing see see uh uh it's only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come he said now you got it I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's Great Gallery up there it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you can burn it up uh uh and he's talking about your your physical uh uh uh uh stature and these things you can burn it up your body feed it to the Lions do any way you want to but it'll come forth again just as sure as 2 two uh two tws is four just as sure God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are ain't that right but not only did God take a picture of your physical stature uh uh there and your physical being and and and not only did he know your height and your hair color the color of your eyes and and uh everything about you but he also had a picture of us as to what we are to be as sons of God and and and as we said so many times he wrote our name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he gave us an expected end and and that expected end is the picture ain't that right that he took of us as sons of God and so Romans 8:28 Paul tells us what this picture is and we've read it but we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son he took that picture right amen and that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also Justified and whom he justified he also glorified and so what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us so so we we see the expected end the picture Ephesians 1 and4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love the picture right amen see and having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen uh second Peter 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that we you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blemish or blameless ain't that right so that's his picture that's his vision of what we are to be amen Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious picture a glorious Church ain't that right not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so so the the the Bible actually has amen God's wrote down the the description of the picture that he has for you and I as as Believers ain't that right you you you may not know and and and I may have not known what God 's purpose was but it was in in in this time that we began to understand that God took a picture of us uh before the foundation of the world and he's able to bring us back to what he had the picture that he has taken in his mind so the vision uh uh picture the vision is what God had in the beginning you see way back before this world started in them Adams back Yonder when God seen what was going to take place right there he saw you and he saw me he saw every flea every frog every net everything that would be upon the Earth he saw it right then see another place God before the foundation of the world saw you you wasn't there but you was in his mind he saw it ain't that right so this is not an imagination th this is in just is something that God was just trying to he literally saw us there and and what he saw us as a man is is forever remaining the same I mean it's that the picture is what matters the picture is what counts amen so before the foundation of the world our names when the lamb was slain our names were put on the book when in God's own mind he foresaw us and pred destinated Us by his for knowledge before the foundation of the world as we know we didn't come into this world reflecting that Vision that God saw of us and and what he predestinated us to be look at all of our hangups and look at all of our failures and look at all the scars that we have and look what a Satan was able to do to us not only in our physical uh uh uh body but but spiritually and mentally and and we we we were a basket case I know I was and and uh a basket case and look at the complexes uh that he has been able to put Upon Us amen so to try to hinder our walk in God and and and and and and you know we we had so much baggage on us when we become a Christian and uh uh uh to deal with and and and a lot of us are still dealing with the baggage you know a lot of the baggage that that that came with just being humans and a fallen nature and and all of these things but as Paul said thanks be to God who give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ ain't that right so there is a victory there is a victory amen and and and you know the prophet said God will not be defeated no matter what takes place amen he will not be and he will never be defeated ain't that right amen Jesus even said uh the heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and we know what his word is it's the vision that he had before the foundation of the world and so the word is eternal and uh the Earth that we're setting on today uh uh um uh is is the manifestation of God's word the world was framed together by the word of God and and it's it's by things that do not appear uh uh there was nothing that God could use to uh as we would uh we took things to invent things amen but it were already here but God would take nothing and there was nothing there and yet the worlds are framed amen and so God just said let there be and there was and so the prophet said how how easy it is for that God could uh to heal a sick body then if he can build a creation by just speaking it his word if we could only get Faith to see what his word is amen and I that's why Satan is so trying so hard to discourage us from the word of God Amen is because the word of God has so much power in it amen to bring forth the change ain't that right we are so Earthbound and our minds uh we're just so uh uh conglomerated uh in our minds and things and brother brandom said we've had so many indoc a shot from this one and a shot from that one and it's just got us to a place she's just all twisted up but if you could ever shake the whole thing loose and come back to know what that he is God and his word can no more fail than he can fail ain't that right amen so so it it causes people being so indument with doctrines and ideas of men and and and the world that is around it literally causes Faith to become slow to where people can't just take God at his word but but the word of God is still powerful today as it has always been ain't that right and and and and and God doesn't ask us to change ourselves amen amen he only asks us to believe to believe and we're not believing a myth we're not believing a man uh uh with blind faith God has so Vindicated his word today and showed us that he is the same yesterday today and forever and he showed us that the power that created the worlds out there was the the same power that created squirrels that that that that that uh uh uh uh brought that fish back to life and all of these things to where we could just simply be at rest and believe ain't that right amen and so um you know brother Bram says you know it says brother a long time ago before the found before the world was ever had a foundation God through his eternal Grace looked down and by for knowledge he seen you and I he knew what age we'd live in and he knew what we would be therefore by election he chose us before the foundation of the world to be with him without spot now that word is going to happen without spot it's happening right now do you believe that amen a people that that that Satan was able to distort and and change the picture and all of that but God Amen the picture has forever uh stayed with God in his mind and so so something has got to change us from being spotted to being spotless a ain't that right and and we know that God himself provided the remedy and that is John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that who should ever uh believeth in him should not perish and but have everlasting life ain't that right so so through the ministry of Jesus Christ amen God has has been able to change amen uh us from being spotted to spotless uh uh uh with changes from from being blemished Amen to without blemish amen of Hebrews 9:13 if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify the puring of the uh uh purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit off offer himself without spot to God Purge you purge you see Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God ain't that right so the prophet would say when Jesus come dealing with sin at Calvary he killed sin and he killed every attribute that goes with it and completely everybody say completely completely redeemed us back to God and to we are Sons and Daughters of God perfectly Redeemed by A Perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ ain't that right amen now you say well I'm still got sickness well you know the problem that we don't have it in full amen but we're being changed it's it's a change it's a progress but but one thing we do have we have the earnest we have the earnest of our of our Salvation so the prophet said we are not p Temptation neither are we above sin but Jesus will help us in every Temptation now when I do wrong I'm ready to repent and anyone else that wants to live right with God see amen he says you you uh you don't desire to do wrong but when Satan upsets you somewhere because there is an atonement that is waiting for me if I confess my wrongs God is just to forgive it can you say Amen so it's not about us trying to be a Christian God's provided it amen the God has already provided a way for the change to happen amen you don't have to worry about we just have to rest in him knowing that God has already made a way for the change can you say amen amen think of it now the 2 Corinthians 5:19 uh uh break it in God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trans presses uh trans uh trespasses unto them ain't that right brother brah says a real Christian doesn't have any sins imputed to him at all see he says when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make belief but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he does not see it Lord amen see he had to do that in order to bring a change in your life amen see there's a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see uh uh the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life well how did he see you blameless spotless can you say amen that's the way he done it see and now that he provided a remedy that's the only way he can see you is without spot wrinkle or blemish ain't that right see and and so he says because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you're washed in the lamb the blood of the Lamb therefore there's no gal in you there's no unclean Habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb has did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin offering laying there waiting for you he says well you say that gives me plenty of room brother brandom I can do what I want to he says I always do always but when a man can really see what Jesus done for him and turn around and do something contrary to him it shows he never received Christ can you say amen amen Ephesians 2 and8 amen Paul would tell us for it by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God ain't that right amen so then we we uh Brother Brad would tell us we come to him or we come in him by by faith through Grace we are saved by the Holy Spirit calling to us amen see he's already redeemed us he's already provided the sacrifice he's already provided a way to to to to wipe your slate clean ain't that right amen but now he's coming to call us calling to woo us amen aren't you glad for that wooing amen see so so we we find that he come to redeem that predestinated that people that he saw before the foundation of the world it isn't just a random thing it's not just that he died and now he's disappointed because of the millions and the millions have rejected him amen no he foresaw a people and now he's wooing that people amen he's wooing that people to himself amen so he says seek God through Eternal Grace seen who would be saved and he called you no man can come to me except my father calls him first not him that willth or him that runthe Mercy you say well I sought God I sought God he said no you never did God sought you and that's the way it it was in the beginning it wasn't Adam saying oh Father father I've sinned where are you it was father saying oh Adam Adam where are you see that's the nature of man is to hide that's the strain see that's what he's made of amen that's right but it's the only way we could come is God pulling God calling God bringing us unto himself aren't you glad for that amen see we we the the the work of redemption is so great it's a mystery and it's so great that we can't even fathom with our men with our minds our understanding uh can't even be begin to grasp amen what God has really done for us but all we know is we feel the pull all all we know is that there's something that is pulling us amen and it's causing a change aren't you glad for that see it's in this day amen that God promised to call out a people amen for his name out of the Gentile calling people out of the Gentile for for his name and that group of people is to manifest every promise amen and manifest his eternal purpose God saw a bride God saw the manifestation of sons and daughters God saw amen a a a people and and uh that would be conformed into the image of his son and he predestinated them to be conformed ain't that right amen and what is the image of his son well the the Bible says he's the image of God he's the expressed image Amen brother BR called it the expressed image of God ain't that right in other words what what this image was is what Jehovah was Jesus was amen he was the expressed image of him he was God shaped out in human form see and all the powers of God formed into and put in a human body that's the image of God ain't that right amen and God would predestinate a people to be transformed into that same image and that's the same that's the image that sons of God Amen are being changed into today the bride of Christ ain't that right Matthew 25 it it talks about the 10 virgins amen the five wise and five foolish and yet we we know that they're all they're all virgins amen and and showing that they all come from the same pattern uh uh or material amen but but we know as the prophet described it the the wise virgin is being cut out amen all that material laying there and he Likens it to a woman that a seamstress or whatever but she's wanting to make a dress or uh after wanting to make something and so she she goes and gets the material and there's a lot of material that is there amen but but she ain't going to use all that material right away uh uh uh she wants to make a a a dress so she takes a part of that material and and in order to do that I've seen my mom do it uh uh many times and and that is to lay a pattern She lays a pattern out in that material and and you know any way she wants to lay it that's her prerogative amen she she whatever she wants to do with that material see amen and and so uh uh she begins to cut amen that that that piece of material out to fit the pattern a ain't that right amen and and so she's got an idea of what she wants and so she begins to cut it well the prophet said that's the way it is amen see uh uh brother Brown said what is the pattern it's the place that the lady elected to cut it from that's the pattern ain't that right and and so so she she cuts this pattern out and she puts the rest of the material lays it aside for another day another time but now she's going to work on that that material to make what she's after ain't that right so the prophet said seek God before the foundation of the world he knew the end from the beginning by for knowledge he elected where to cut aren't you glad he elected you Hallelujah he elected the place the the on the material of where to cut for his pattern see he know the difference between Esau and Jacob he know the the difference between Sinner and Saint he know the difference he knows the motive of every heart so he elected us before the foundation of the world and put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life and also the lamb that was to be slain put our names on before he was slain and the Bible says that Christ was slain was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and our names were put on the book when he was elected back there to be the lamb to be slain we were elected to be the one that was he was slain for can you say Amen see God knew oh if we could understand that I think it would make us happy Amen to know that God precisely when he ordained that lamb to be slain he had you specifically in mind and he that blood would speak fre all your life that blood would speak for you all of your life the whole journey of your living here on this Earth that blood would speak for you brother Bill amen why because you were the one elected for that lamb to be slain for could you imagine to be walking through life and the blood not speaking for you in your behalf amen now we're not any better than anybody else we've had our faults we've got our failures we've got our you know we've got our hangups we've got our complexes we've got all kinds of things amen that we deal with every day of our life and you can't even say that we've got even unbelief that we have dealt with and and and wondering and questioning and and all of these things of wondering how and wondering where and wondering when oh God do you love me oh God is you know am I really going to make it how many's ever done that before amen well we we've have them but the difference is is the blood is speaking for you amen the blood is speaking he knew where to lay the pattern Amen on that material and you've been included into that amen see and so we were elected to be the one that he was slain for see and so so we find that it's all the same material amen but one is cut according to the pattern and the other is the remnant of what is left over can you say Amen so see God by election chose his bride before the foundation of the world and he brother brandom identified the bride as being that wise virgin don't let anyone tell you that the the wise virgin ain't the bride amen that's contrary to what brother brandham taught can you say Amen the he identified the bride as being the wise virgin and the remnant is left amen is is the foolish virgin ain't that right so so this is what God is doing amen is is you say Well they're good people that that's not the point well well you know their church goers they really love God that's not the point the point is is God predestinated you for a reason amen and that's why the change is happening can you say amen amen yeah I believe that anyways and any True Believer knows that the wise virgin is the bride of Christ see so as God brought a nation out of a nation in Egypt he is bringing a church out of a church or a bride out of a church church out of church amen what the prophet said see amen and that's that wise virgin amen that he's working on today amen Revelations 9 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife everybody say his wife hath made herself ready amen ain't that right she's made herself ready what's happened there's been a change something have changed you you you can't tell me that this bride's going to be halfway uh uh there amen halfway ready when the Rapture comes it ain't going to happen she's made herself ready she's endeavored she's endured there was a blood speaking on her behalf ain't that right she didn't make Grace a disgrace that's right amen that's right she made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints well that tells us that your end is better than your beginning amen so that's the wise virgin who kept oil in her lamp Amen brother Brown said see it's all virgin now here's the little Remnant not throw it away no no she keeps it but lays it back she can use it for something else but it's not going to be used there that's the church that's cut out ain't that right am man the the the remnant man is going to have to stand judgment see because they go through the tribulation that is the remnant but thank God that God elected you not to go through that tribulation God elected you not to stand before the white thrown judgment think of that church not anything that you had to do it was God by Grace elected you it's a change now Revelations 12:17 tells us says and the dragon was wroth with a woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keeps the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ see brother Brown said see the remnant of the woman's seed that's what was left over ain't that right and there is weeping and Howling and nashing of teeth cuz they didn't have oil in their lamps the Holy Spirit see and there they are they're the ones that's going through the tribulation amen they're the ones ain't that right amen see why because she didn't have the atonement in its fullness amen virgin yes Church going yes you know in her own way having an understanding in her own way of of scriptures and standing true to what she knew ain't that right that God has opened your eyes of understanding God has enlightened you can you say Amen that you would to sit in the church and believe halfway truth wondering what's truth but you could stand there with thus said the Lord and believe all the truth and the washing of the water of the word is washing you from all of your sins and it's bringing a change the word is bringing a change amen amen the bride doesn't have to stand at the white Throne judgment the Lord the bride doesn't have to go through tribulation amen cuz she's redeemed brother BR said she's already pure the Holy Spirit has come into her and purified her and took all away all the filth and gum of the world and she believes that word and becomes part of iten aren't you glad for that now the scripture we all know is Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord which we know it to be this day and he the spirit of Elijah the Holy Spirit Will shall turn the the heart of the fathers to the children which was the ministry that John the Baptist had amen ain't that right the spirit of Elijah the Holy Spirit came upon John that's right uh Luke 1:13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zachariah John's father for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and go into the 17th verse and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children fathers to the children ain't that right Amen in Matthew 11:11 Jesus said verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come ain't that right so so we we see that that John the Baptist is was the Elias there that was to turn amen the hearts of the fathers to the children amen that that the the law uh that those that kept that law and and traditions to turn them to to the children hearts of the children the faith to where they could accept Christ amen in Matthew 1710 the disciples asked of Jesus why why does the scrib say that Elias must first come and then you go in the 12th verse Jesus said I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed ain't that right 13th verse the disciples understood that he spake of John the Baptist ain't that right but then in that 11th verse Jesus sayth unto him Elias truly shall come and restore all things well then then John the Baptist did not restore all things but this Elias that is to come he shall restore all things restore all things all things are going to change amen that's a oh my and to think of that what a greater what a greater Ministry you sit under today than to sit under John the Baptist and to be introduced to Jesus in his physical form uh uh it's greater to set under this ministry Amen to be introduced in to Jesus in a bride form Christ in you amen Christ in you can you say amen amen and so and and and now this Elias that is to come to this Prophet amen he's going to restore the last part or fulfill the last part of Malachi 4 and he shall turn the heart of the children to their fathers the apostolic fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse ain't that right so th this is the prophet that God promised to sin before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it's this day and as we said brother Bram said he shall change everybody say change the thoughts of the people he shall change the thoughts of the people praise the Lord we've got an idea of the blood of Jesus Christ that has been taught us through Traditions yeah it's a blood that is So Weak and Powerless and helpless and the churches have become powerless and weak and can you say amen amen but this Prophet would come and change our thoughts change our thinking amen amen change your thinking amen yes sir We've Come to an idea of what church ought to be what Christian ought to be and what religious ought to be and it it's so messed up than what God has for his the picture that God took of us church instead of becoming conformed to the image of Christ come be formed to the image of the world religion can you say Amen but this Prophet this Prophet would come and have the vision of God he would have the vision of God and know what God is looking for and as I said you know before the Bible says it amen the prophet says it uh that God has always used the prophets to to chop his people out ain't that right chop his people out to think of that pattern being cut today chopping the people out amen and why because the word comes to the prophet and and Hebrews 4 and12 it it says the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged forward piercing even to the dividing of of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in Mara and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart can you say Amen so the prophet is the voice of God for he has thus saith the Lord he has the mind of God and he reveals it to his people the people of God that wise virgin who has the spirit of God now God has promised to speak in this last day again amen and we've read these quotes but read it again the coming of a prophet was the sign that God is ready to speak because if God ain't going to speak the prophet wouldn't be on earth ain't that right amen you see this ministry that is today is is is can happen because of the blood right yes being shed and you say Amen because this isn't just your average Ministry amen this isn't just a theologian coming and changing our our our minds from one thought to another thought from the Baptist thought to the Methodist thought or from the Methodist to the Pentecostal thought and this isn't about reformation can you say man this is a changing that's going to a Ministry that will change the people change them to where they're different different different from churchianity different from Religion different it it's a Ministry that makes us odd but it's a Ministry that prepares us for a Rapture and you say Amen so if God ain't going to speak a prophet wouldn't be on earth he said remember that he wouldn't be on earth unless God was ready to speak and that's the way he speaks is through those channels the unchanging God never did do it any other way this is always God's way of making his voice known to his people he sends his prophet and gives a sign and then takes his voice that's been spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man and they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of this day ain't that right so then this this scripture is is is is uh fulfillment of the message of the hour and and we've read it Hebrews 12:25 see that you refuse him not that speaketh amen don't don't don't separate the voice from the messenger because the prophet says the messenger and his message is one see that you refuse him not that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven see whose voice then shook the Earth so what we have been hearing uh on uh the the prophets it's not it's not an Earthly voice it it's the voice of God it's it's a Heavenly Voice Hallelujah can you say Amen Lord so he said see whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more if I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the remove everybody say the removing how can he restore all things without there be a removing and you say Amen of those things that are shaken see as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain those things that cannot be shaken are the Eternal things can you say Amen things that the devil put on you has got to be shaken am amen amen wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly Fear Can you say amen amen in this day what a change that has taken place a people that is no longer serving God by their own intellect a people that is now move been able to change from Human Faith to a perfect Faith Godly faith a people that is that has been moved and redirected from Human element Amen to Supernatural element there's been a change can you say Amen see it's the voice is what is bringing a transformation oh my this this message is the key to getting us back to the picture that God thought of us can you say amen that's why you ain't going home you ain't going to heaven you ain't going in the Rapture you ain't having a changing of your body without this message there's got to be something that changes they ain't going to be sitting us just sitting there watching television then all of a sudden Rapture takes place that ain't happening us so wrapped up in the politics and all the the the corruption of the world and then all of a sudden Rapture takes place that ain't going to happen it ain't going to be a bunch of people swearing and cussing and and and and drinking and looking at all this pornography and and just indulging themselves in the world that ain't going to happen amen that which can be shaken will be removed done away with annihilated and you say amen and that which cannot be shaken shall remain I understand we're creatures of habit we're preaches a routine you get it in in doing it so long long enough you think that's just Norm it's not norm and that's why this message is so different because it's not according to the norm it's not according to the routine of man hello it's not according to the same old school of thought there had to be a message that would be totally different amen and it's not different according to what God thought of us it's different from what the world has tried to make us amen can you say Amen all right yes it's the word of God Amen that shall remain the word of God shall remain I believe 1 Peter 2:5 tells us that we are Lively stones and they're built up a spiritual house but notice what a prophet says God doesn't just want want us being Stones he said stones are confession millions millions have confessed Jesus to be their savior confess to be Christians confess to believe the Bible confess going in a Rapture confess that they're the bride of Christ but it's just church members making a confession that's as far as they go the prophet said see the church is today they just want members in their church so it's all about making a decision come on joining the church you leave the Baptist Church come join us the Baptist or the Methodist come join us the Baptist you leave the Baptist come on and join us the Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran and then the Catholic taking all remember remember remember remember remember decisions decisions but then the prophet says what good is a stone confession what good is a stone if there isn't a stonemason to shape him into a Son of God that's right he said see you're just piling a bunch of rocks it isn't doing any good that's right you have a thousand members but it ain't doing any good you're just you're just piling in a bunch of rocks same old school of thought just a little bit different ain't that right the people ain't coming to a place of discernment that's why they're all going into the World Council of churches confessing Jesus Christ and yet worshiping Satan amen the God of this world CU there ain't something there a stonemason to start shaping them stones into sons of God to bring them spiritual discernment of what's going on praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah to God BR says you're just piling a bunch of rocks it isn't doing a bit of good see he says the the water wearth away the stone that's right that's the people see God what good is Stones if you haven't got a true Mason Stone Mason with a good sharp tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God just want to ask you what's what goods the decisions what good is it putting your name on the book what good is it to come join the church if the stone Mason isn't there that'll shape that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them and make them like Christians that sits in the house of God with signs following the believer praise the Lord amen got to have a stone Mason yes sir cut shape aren't you glad that God's not just leaving you set in a church what good does it do to have a big denominations built up by the thousands if somebody isn't there with the sharp two-edged sword of God to shape the them out into real children of God might as well leave them out where they are God has provided himself a knife it's not the Methodist Pentecostals Baptist Catholics it's not denominations it's not theologians psychologists or whatever can you say amen God has provided himself a knife to shape out children of God sons of God and it isn't just by chance that the prophet said he was there in in Arizona in Tucson in the backside of the desert on a mountain lifted his hands and a sword drops in his hands can you say Amen we know what that word was it's the word of God it was symbolic of the word of God that that Prophet would have the mind of God that Prophet would have the word of God would have the power amen not to waste his time didn't waste his time you've had great healing Ministries great healing Ministries that have taken place and we thought wow them are good a Allen for CH for one or Roberts till Osburn Kenneth Hagen healing I mean they've all dealt with healing in the Physical Realm ain't that right and you still got some of them doing it not too many anymore but some are healing healing healing but then here come a prophet tell us there's something greater than healing in the physical Rim it's the healing of the Soul no one could bring the healing of the soul but a Prophet come to bring healing to the soul can you say amen amen healing campaign was fine but but it wasn't enough that's right it was wasn't enough to shape us into Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right amen the ministry of of Billy Graham was fine but it wasn't enough to shape them into sons of God Amen the Ministries that we've had throughout the world they they're they're great they're fine look at them they're drawing the millions but it's not enough to make a bride to make a word bride in this day to cut sons of God cut them stones into sons of God to place them into the house of God praise the Lord can you say Amen so not one denomination has what it takes to shape a real son of God amen amen we we talked about it but the prophet said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece it's its own mouthpiece takes the word of God and twists it any way it wants it's its own mouthpiece and they tried it they tried to cut us into sons of God have they not they've only butchered us up butchered our faith to where we didn't know what to believe in butchered our our joy to where we had no joy butcher butchered our our our uh Salvation and our Thanksgiving to where we sit there just like not on a log butchered our experience with God butcher it so much that our young people don't want it no more butcher it can you say Amen the calvinist don't have what it takes to make us into real sons of God Amen and and the legalists don't have what it takes to make us into sons of God I've said under that never do that again amen well maybe you want to that I won't no no but Jesus told us by the tradition by their Traditions their teaching the the the Commandments of men right they make the word of God of no effect so what little truth they may have you say well they got some truth what little truth they may have they kill it that is by teaching for Doctrine the tra the traditions and Commandments of men and the prophet said They Crucified the effects of the word to the people that's right can you say amen amen so what what what truth they have may have they crucify it they kill it so they ain't they ain't the mouthpiece of God they ain't got nothing what it takes Amen to make real sons of God so what is it they're blind leaders of the blind amen blind leaders of the blind can you say amen and and and this is what Jesus called the religious leaders of of his day Matthew 23:16 woe unto you blind guides ain't that right called them blind guides see brother Brandman said they were supposed to be guides guides to the people guiding the people to salvation but Jesus says you're blind and he said let them alone for if the blind lead the blind won't they both fall in the ditch blind guides how the world has been contaminated with blind guiding he doesn't want you to rely on your own understanding God doesn't want you to rely on your own understanding or your thoughts or any man-made thoughts can you say amen and then he said says what were they they were blind to the spiritual things blind blind to the pattern blind to the pattern that God is using to cut his church out they didn't know God's thoughts they didn't have his idea of what God wants his church to be see they're blind guides amen see so they haven't caught God's vision of the church today so then what are they doing then blind guides the blind they're making the people totally different than what God wanted them to be in this day they they they they they they want the church to be totally different they're making the church totally different than what God has called you and I to be right that's right John 17 and 19 Jesus said and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these Al alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word notice that they all may be one is't that the vision that they all may be one father as thou father art in me and I in thee that and that they all may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them and thou has loved me can you say Amen so now the denominations you know go listen to Oneness they there and and well a lot of other Jezebel religion and things the denominations are getting the people to a Oneness they're getting them to a Oneness and and and all the churches now are crying for Oneness see and and are compromising for the Oneness and and and all of these things but what are they doing they're bringing a Oneness to the World Council of churches because they think that this is the Oneness of God right can you say amen and the prophet said the reason why they're doing that is because they lack knowledge of the word of God they they don't know the vision of God ain't that right amen see so the Bible promised has already promised that they would make an image unto the Beast and that it would be given power to speak amen ain't that right but that is not the Oneness that Jesus was praying for because when it speaks it speaks Blasphemous things teaching things contrary to the word of God so then God would send to us a prophet ain't that right amen and why would he send the prophet to fulfill the promise he made in Psalms 32 and8 I will instruct thee God saying this and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye Lord hallelujah you're not going to be led by a blind guide for this will be God's own eye that he will lead you amen can you say amen amen and and brother Bram tells us that God always sent the prophets to be the guides to his people yeah ain't that right for the word of the Lord came to them that's why Prophet is a sear he's like an eagle he can far see far above anything of this world sure he sees beyond anything why because he's he's a sear it's God's eye amen and he catches the vision that God has and so God sends a Vindicated prophet to us and has showed us things to come and it gives us the assurance that it's been the holy spirit that has come to us for here John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth right for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me he for he shall receive of mine and shall show it to you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it to you can you say amen amen we're not a people that's wondering what God wants us to be we are a people that have a vision it's been revealed to us of what's to come we don't have to wonder what heaven's going to be like we don't have to wonder about what the new City's going to be be like we don't have to wonder about what a body or what it's going to be like when we leave this old world it's been shown to us prise the Lord can you say amen Amen brother BR say see now every true God sent sign has a voice and that voice must speak according to the word that's given for that day just exactly if the voice comes the same old voice of the same old he said see you see a sign rather and the sign that the man is doing is the same old school of thought then you can say right then that that didn't come from God that's right if it keeps identifying the same old school of thought it never did and never has it would be against God's program amen can you say amen that's right if a man came and said he's a prophet and and and kept pointing to himself it it it it it' be wrong we'd say it wasn't of God listen to The Prophet today in in God proving his word and and it just it just struck me you know as he's he's he's he preached and he was uh starting to call people out and then he' turn around and say now people don't look at me don't look at me amen this is God Amen I'm just your brother and I thought how many men have fallen because they got lifted up in some little gift not even half the gift that brother brandham had that because of popularity because they had a little following they draw the people to themselves but brother Bram never done that why because it wasn't him it was the Holy Spirit can you say amen and I thought oh my how how how marvelous what a miracle it it it it it it is that God could actually do what he done through that man and that man never ever ever tried to draw people to himself he tried to take him to Christ it's Christ it's Christ it's Christ and he never he never said he he he never always he you know he did let us know that it was Christ in him working the ministry but notice how he does it Christ in you Christ in you Christ in you why because he had the vision it wasn't his own Vision look at me see I'm just a good guy look I'm special because God is doing this all in me but he began to let us know that that same God that was in him working these things is now in the church amen praise the Lord can you say Amen see it's got to be something new it's got to be something that the people don't understand or it wouldn't be sent it don't need to be sent if it's the same old School of Theology it's got to be something different yet it's got to be identified in the word for that it is for that day see the positive of God's word it has to be that there's no slips up to it there there got to be the truth got to be Vindicated by God the truth and the man who speaks it has to be Vindicated of God to be a Seer from God am or it's wrong that's right can you say Amen well do you love the Lord amen so he says the end time message should meet end time conditions where they've got off the message ought to bring it back all the way through the scripture it'll have to do it this time a call back to the original word like the other Messengers in the day see did in that in the day this message will have to be the same we are promised that God promised it in his word Malachi 4 said it would happen and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers promised it and were living in that day amen he said it's always been each time a group of leaders that gets the people all mixed up that's right it's not so much the people it's the leaders that gets them mixed up that's right oh you say oh brother brandom he said well now let's just wait a minute we got to make it this scriptural if it isn't scripture then it is no good see by their words of wisdom in their uninspired leadership words of worldly wisdom why there's some of those genius that can set together and but but you think that Satan isn't a genius at it too they can sit that word together and he said but you think Satan isn't a genius at it tooo did he not uh uh approach Jesus Christ and give him a reason and even quoted the scripture to him he did it he's a genius at it but Jesus never argued with him he said it is written also get thee behind me Satan see it's uninspired leadership leaders they are but blind leaders of the blind can you say amen amen you love love the Lord amen that's good isn't the Lord wonderful Lord amen so you can see why we're happy amen because we've accepted the word of the Lord ain't that right amen now notice as we get to wind down here amen the the prophecy uh uh told us am man he says now the he looking for the character he said God isn't after members he counts character ain't that right the character of his word so only a prophet can make this type of a cut amen because he has the ability to cut according to the pattern not according to his own liking not according to what he his ideas of it but him having the the character of Christ him having the plan the vision he begins to cut out a people according to the character of Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen so he knows what the Church of God should be according to what God saw so he has the ability to chop out a bride to make them a word right amen not members of Faith Tabernacle or any other church but to make them a word bride word bride so what is this message what does it do to us it gives us the freedom to be what God ordained us to be it cuts us out away from all bondage yes sir religious bondage worldly bondage bondage of complex bondage that preachers have tried to put us under bondages that Traditions have tried to make us under bondage that even our own ideas have tried to put ourselves under to where we can be free to be what God ordained us to be aren't you glad for that amen the message of the hour has done thaten to be free my pastor when I come into the message you know and I was so excited man I didn't understand a lot of what I was talking about but man I'd tell everybody about this message and um you know uh especially those that I was went to church with and things you know I got just talking about it and get so excited and but my pastor asked me you know one time says what what has this all done to for you I said well I'm going to tell you what is done for me it has Set Me Free praise the Lord let me free thank you Lord I used to wonder what he thought of me used to wonder you know well what does he accept me as a preacher does he this and does he that I always looked up to him nothing wrong with looking up to a man respecting him but when it comes to where you you are under his the control of that man something wrong and so I was free I I just like a bird that was set free out of the cage prise the Lord and you know it gives us the freedom and that's what this message does it gives us the freedom and this is this is the vision that g that brother brandham had is House of Hell give way to the name of the Lord and it wasn't just a vision that's the the scope of his message if if you could say it that way we are becoming The Vision by the ministry of the Prophet praise the lord we are the word the prophecy the vision manifested in this day amen that's why we didn't have to have brother brandom stay with us throughout you know everybody's got their own ideas why brother brandham left the scene most of them say he got off the word and that's why he left the scene and but that's not true it's actually scripture for John the Baptist even said I must decrease that he may increase and it's turned from the prophet to the prophecy it's turned from the prophet to the vision can you say amen amen we are the prophecy we are the vision that's right whether we realize it or not we are the vision if the musicians will come I uh you know as I guess most every one of us probably have and do driving to church I thought man it just be nice if if if brother bran was here just to ask him questions I love just to have a private interview with him and ask him some questions and you know but then it come to me you know as as much as we would desire that and like that that's not way God established it we have to believe we just have to believe in what God has said we are yeah right the prophet what whatever the prophet brought this message is good enough for every situation yes sir it's good enough to take us out of everything that we have yes sir problems with complexes with what whatever whatever you're dealing with this message is has enough power to take us from this to here amen can you say Amen yes he does and and so what we've got to do is to believe now brother brandom said God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious church that's what he's intended that's the vision of his church fact before the foundation of the world it was a a vision of a powerful Church a glorious Church in this age so then the prophet can you imagine the prophet has the ability to make make us make the church a powerful Church a glorious church and he said see a church that the whole world could look upon as the bride of Christ well expected and dis spoused to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord it should live in that characteristic in the church and it should be living that way can you say Amen so how could we be that how could we be a glorious Church a powerful Church without the message of the hour to chop us out to make us that right brah said the Gentiles are rejecting Christ they're rejecting their signs they're rejecting everything that's called Godly and branded as some kind of telepathy or devil power and they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God and God will take that Minority after a while and raise it up into a powerful church and then turn the spirit to the Jews and take the Gentile Church home amen can you say Amen is that not what he's doing this church has risen I for you maybe young people that have never been caught up in Traditions of men and church anity and all these [Music] things you're blessed but if you could only realize where we've come from and where we are today we can truly say there's been a change in our lives amen we have risen into a powerful Church a mighty church and I hope today that you can see that Lord you say well I ain't walked on the water I ain't raised the dead but you know the dead is been raised and I'm part of that church amen but more than anything there's a people that is standing their salvation intact their Joy intact their faith intact their fellowship with God intact relationship intact no matter what they go through the struggles you we we ain't just talking about just average people we're talking about a people that God has redeemed and God has surrounded them him himself his presence among them and has cut them out to where the church is standing out confused by the by the things that are going in the world and yet there's a bride that's not confused she's a powerful Church prise the Lord she's a powerful Church why the power of God is holding her yes keeping her she's enduring and she's going to make it you believe it amen perfect faith unspotted without blemish amen I
