again because that was my promise given from God and I want to say that I didn't call myself in this laysan age I didn't ask for this I didn't come before God but it was God who came and search for me it was God who come and touched my heart and it was God that said you're going to have a Rapture and I have confidence and Faith before God that I can come before him and say God you gave the promise come meet me in my time of need God you gave the pro well glory to God Amen it wasn't a covenant that I could keep it was a covenant that God could keep and God will keep his word concerning you amen that's exactly right they there there in in in 2 Kings 4:21 she says the Bible says and she went up and and laid him on the bed of the man of God shut the door upon him and went out looking for the prophet of God can you say amen and so the church is built upon divine revelation man now you young people that are here today don't just be doing this because your mama is is and Daddy's brought you to church don't just be doing this because there's a you a good youth group amen don't don't be don't be coming and being a part of of this what God is doing this day by int uh intellectual Revelation you've got to see the vision and you've got to see yourself in that Vision can you say amen amen listen Victory is the direct consequence of faith when you believe and you act victory is yours ah Hallelujah I know we've got we we've got brother shemaya and sister Bethany down at the hospital this morning amen and and and and they're waiting on Amen they're you know they've got that little baby and and it looks like the enemy is just trying to kill their promise but I just want to I just want to say to them if they are amen if they're if they're live streaming this morning Victory is the direct consequence of faith and we are believing with Bethany and and brother shemiah we are standing upon that promise this morning God gave that that promise and we're expecting God to fulfill his word oh glory to God can you say amen amen you see faith is literally Faith confesses what it is saying it's not it's not just a hope so it's not a it's not a maybe show it's not a amen I hope it comes to pass but faith brother bradam says literally sees the promise amen it's way out there you can't see it in the natural amen you might not see it in the visible the doctor might not say it you you might not see it in that lost child but yet Faith sees the promise and Faith believes the promise and faith is pushing toward that answer amen I wish there was somebody here this morning that could say I don't care where I'm at I don't care what I'm going through I don't care what I've got to fight I don't care what kind of battles that I've got to go through I believe the promise amen it's not in what I can do it's not in what the doctor can do it's not in what anyone else can do but it's in the promise of God and I'm walking into that Vision hallelujah it's not going to come to pass God has showed me that it is already mine here this morning can you say Amen so Revelation is the direct amen it is it is amen the unmasking of God's plan to you it's the unveiling or the uncovering of God's thoughts that he's had in his mind from before the foundation of the world Revelation is the divulging of God's plan in your situation now I want you to catch this as we preach this morning because you've got a see yourself in this last day Revelation and if you don't see yourself in this last day Revelation you're going to be all over the place God don't call he's not calling us to be all over the place he's calling us to stand stand fast amen steadfast in his word and believing every promise of God can you say Amen When Faith walks into the room amen I I I I I love this I've said it before amen but when Faith walks into the room it turns on the light switch so that you can see where you're at he all can you say Amen you see lot could not see where he was at lot could not see amen he could not see the son he didn't have a promise of a son he couldn't see himself amen fulfilling uh uh the promises that Abraham could fulfill there was no way that Abraham could fulfill it there was no way that lot could fulfill it but there was only one difference in between them and that was direct Revel ation Abraham had met God Abraham knew that God was going to complete his work so therefore Abraham he though he was old and though Sarah was old and though the situation looked impossible and though everything looked like it was all amen just it just looked like it was getting worse and worse and worse and worse yet there was a hope Amen in the heart of Abraham that says I'm going to receive that promise I'm coming into that promise I don't care whether I get old I don't care I'm not looking at amen the deadness of Sarah's womb I'm not looking at the circumstance around me I am in the direct orders of God God ordered me God ordained me God will fulfill that I can't answer for anyone else I will answer to what faith has revealed unto [Applause] me but lot he was looking at the natural lot couldn't get past the natural lot was looking at the trouble in the church lot well that's what the Bible said amen there was all the feuding going on and amen between the herdsman of lot and the herdsman of Abraham and there was this that and the other can you say Amen Abraham knew God by Revelation showed him that Sodom was fixing to burn lot he was just as blind as a bat lot couldn't understand anything because the re Revelation was not there in his s oh now I want you to understand aren't you glad that you can see the things of God aren't you glad for the divine revelation that has come your way so faith is not an imagination faith is not listening to a prophet's words faith is not Amen in your pastor faith is what God does in you when you're born again [Applause] it's that little something right here amen that says everything's going to be all right a little something in here that says I'm a Son of God well praise the Lord hallelujah now right now as you're looking at your situation amen I'm I'm I'm going I'm I'm sidetracking for a moment but while you're looking at your situation this morning are you looking at the Pro or the problem or the promise Giver are you looking at your sickness or are you looking at your healing are you looking amen at your problem or are you looking at a Rapture come on what what are you looking at this morning amen because where you're looking is where you're going to be walking the Apostle Paul says I I I I I run not as uncertainly come on and I fight not as one that is beating the air but I bring my body under the control of the Revelation that God has given me I I I I I'm not going to be like a donkey that is just sniffing the a wild donkey sniffing the air and running here and running there amen but the master has put a bride into my mouth the master by divine revelation amen has told me that you're a goodly horse amen he's told me that you are amen you are God's choice come on church amen and God the Revelation that was once in the mind of God Amen that had once hidden in the mind of God that was once hidden from Luther that was once hidden from Wesley that was once hidden from the Pentecostals amen there's a revelation in this bright amen that you're the one that he's coming after that you're hallelujah oh can you say Amen you they didn't have that Revelation back then it was only a it was only just a portion it was only a it was just a little bit of the picture amen how many's ever put a puzzle together hallelujah amen I don't have much I I just don't I just don't have enough patience Amen to to you know to look there at the puzzle and and put it together I look at the beautiful picture and how many puzzles have I started and never finished hallelujah amen we look at the picture and we're trying to put it together but I just want to tell you amen we're not at the beginning of the puzzle we're not at the middle of the puzzle we're at the finishing pieces of the puzzle and the divine revelation is coming more clear today than it has ever come and the picture is of me the picture is of you the picture is of redemption the picture is of sons of God coming and walking on the ashes of the [Applause] ungodly can you say Amen the picture of this day is not of the orphan girl who lost her her mom and Dad we're further beyond that in the story she's not in the house of morai anymore she's beyond that she come on Church Hallelujah and Hon's wicked schemes are not just Hon's wicked schemes it's been uncovered we're in that portion of the story the story is becoming more real and we're seeing ourselves in the king's chamber and the King's chamber has heard your request and the request has been granted and he's already condemned amen that Wicked Man non or or what whatever his name was and he is bringing you into your complete victory hmon has no more hold because the schem has been uncovered now if we can walk in that kind of Revelation brother Sean hmon has tried to kill you come on and he had all power to kill you and he would have killed you but the Revelation has come that the evil schemes of hmon have been uncovered and God has heard the request you know what I'm saying here today I'm saying that you always were a son you always were the bride the Church of the last 2,000 ages always was the church but it's only in this Revelation it's only in the revealing of the son of man that we found ourselves with the scepter in our [Applause] hands if you find yourself with a scepter in your hands then you're no longer under justification come on you're no longer under sanctification you're no longer speaking in tongues and running the aisles and right and I've had the privilege of doing it all hallelujah amen I was raised in Pentecost and I know what it is I know what it is to see the cartwheels and amen cartwheels these guys going down there I this is hallelujah was just stop for a moment but we had a guy doing a cartwheel going this way amen through the Hallelujah a lot Wier church and and and another guy he was coming up doing this Hallelujah and both of them collided I mean they puted in they then they both fell out in the spirit Hallelujah I mean I've Seen It All We we've we've seen the emotional side of it I I hallelujah amen though that emotional side was just wonderful I'm thankful for the gifts and I'm thankful for those things that God and they're good they're listen I the brother brandom says the gifts are going to be in the church all the way till the time the Rapture takes place but you see the gifts could not do anything for me but when the anchoring of the word came when the prophet came when the when the when the scales came off the book when the cover comes off the book the scales come off your eyes when you see who you are Hallelujah emotionals amen has nothing to do with it anymore whether you're up whether you're down whether you're in whether you're out there's a revelation that anchors you deeply in that promise and you can get up and possess every thing that God has promised youen brother random says if you can't see Jesus in every verse in every line go back and read it again sir Hallelujah you know it it would it would it would do us good to read this occasionally and it would do us good to listen to the interpretation occasionally glory to God he didn't say in the days of the voice of the pastor of pony it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to s the mystery shall be Oh Glory to can you say Amen so footsteps what am I seeing today amen what am I possessing today you see it depends on what I see that what I possess I I I love this scripture here amen I love the way brother Brandon would bring it out he says if you can see the purpose of Christ if you can understand the purpose of Christ then you can see who you are he came and as a redeemer amen somebody say he is a redeemer what did he come to redeem you for he come to redeem you back to that place of position that place of authority that place of anointing that place of dominion ship he's brought you back to that place of perfect Faith amen hallelujah can you say Amen so when you seen Christ you can see you and then when you look through those glasses All Things become possible right then you're looking and you're thinking Hallelujah I'm the possessor of all things you're not sitting there in a prison cell wishing to get out you've got the golden scepter in your hand and you're saying it's all mine you're not a slave in a slave Shack you are the [Applause] son yes sir when brother Sean's up here preaching the message of the hour how how how many's glad that you got a preacher that preaches the message of the hour how many's glad you got a preacher amen that is preaching something that well he's not the originator [Music] of how believe he's glad you're serving a pro servant of God who sent us a prophet who was not the originator of his own [Applause] message the prophets simply come to unveil the Plan of Redemption while they're back at the manger while they're back W down here you who are walking as Sons and Daughters of God can you say amen that's right he is redemption expressed somebody say Christ is redemption expressed Christ is very heartbeat of God expressed Christ is love expressed Christ is Deliverance expressed Christ is healing expressed why did it have to be expressed God always was healing God always was love God always was the deliverer God always was the Savior Hallelujah but he had to find a way to go from him down to his sons can you say Amen his sons had fallen not God God didn't fall from godhood God didn't fall from Dominion God didn't fall from Authority his Sons fell from Authority the Earth is not in trouble because God is not God the Earth is in trouble because the sons of God are not in their place the Earth is not in trouble amen but God has given us a has has has opened the scales has revealed the scheme and he's saying the sons are going to walk out the sons are the possessor of all things Abraham you're going to have to quit looking at where you are now and you're going to have to start getting out there and look northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward I want you to know it is yours now the scripture says there in 2 Timothy 1 and9 who had saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began it's always been there Hallelujah but he says but is now made manifest that word manifest means brought into public view view by the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ and who is the Lord Jesus Christ the in the image of the invisible God why is that important why is it important that the invisible God become visible yeah because his sons were in in invisible natural bodies [Music] you were his sons you didn't know you were his sons and the invisible God had to become visible hallelu and when the visible God became or the invisible God become visible the people still didn't know who he was they thought he was just another good man thought he was just another good Prophet thought he was just another good can you say am man so what did he have to do well glory to God God someone punch your neighbor and say this is going to get good Hallelujah the invisible God there was there's no way that a righteous God is ever going to be able to look down and to visit a sinner no matter how good you are amen no God no holy God was ever going to be able to do it right and yet God God had already made the plan God had already said that it had to be a Kinsman to come in and lay down his life to redeem now that's the Old Testament that's the Old Testament law in order to be redeemed it required a Kinsman to do the redeeming we've got a problem Jack he's a holy God you're trapped in a body full of sin and the devil has got all of these leans against you his my daddy was a sinner his granddaddy was a sinner his great granddaddy was a sinner he is I've got my lean I've got my hold on him I've got my mark on him I will never let him go right I'm talking about the Revelation can you say Amen there was no way are y'all with me there was no way that a Son of God trapped in a sinful body was ever going to fulfill their purpose and yet God said the promise was given to Adam the man Adam was to rule the Earth that's right you know can you see that God's design is not for you to just be a dead lukewarm church [Applause] member can you see that God's design is not for you to just have emotions and speak in tongues come on God's design for you was to rule and Reign Over All Your adversaries well I I know I know I know I know one of these days brother W one of the you need to clean your glasses you need to go back to Calvary you need to listen to that message you need to start paying attention to what your pastor's preaching you need to get a revelation that it's not going to be you are right now sons of [Applause] God right now somebody turn to your neighbor and say right now turn to the other one they didn't want to listen right now hello ljah hallelujah oh glory to God we're going to call this the logos you can't see the logos now I'm the Lord forgive me for calling him a hanky that's the logos this is the key this logos came and appeared brother Brandon says the logos the great Pillar of Fire come down and talk to Abraham which was a little bit lower than that great pillar fire he says we'll call him a cloud now amen he said now that's man and then God put that man in a body and that man am man would represent the invisible world through his body that man would control the winds through his body that man would be able to call Leo the lion with his lips that man that in that that has that Pillar of Fire that the genetics of God on the inside of him yes sir yeah sir but by one man's sin we were all thrown into death all right I'm getting in my message just a minute just a minute but I just want to stop here one man sin and when Adam used to come Amen brother brandham says brother brandom or that that Adam and Eve would come to God's Cathedral every evening and they would walk with God God didn't have a body how did they walk with God their eyes could see the spiritual realm they held the hands of the pillar of fire they walked with the pillar of Fire they lived with the pillar of fire but one day the pillar of fire came looking for his son and the son is hiding now why is the Sun hiding because sin had separated him on now his eyes are closed Adam will never see the pillar of fire he can't see the pillar of fire he doesn't have relationship anymore he is now in sin he is now in in iniquity he is now in death he is not come on church but the promise was that I'm going to have the woman is going to have a seed and it's going to produce it's going to produce another atom it's going to Hallelujah there will be a man walking on Earth that the pillar of fire will have authority in again come on for what purpose he's trying to find a way to get to you now God had Lambs those little lambs they they they talked about the the lamb Christ the Lamb of God coming for years and years and years but once the perfect lamb came now now now y' y'all stay with me I I I'm I'm I'm getting back to my point once the perfect lamb came all of those other Lambs were no longer needed yeah because now God was dwelling in Jesus come here he was the lamb it was a bunch of little lambs little woly lambs but now he's dwelling amen amen it's the pillar of fire in Jesus all the genetic of God are now in Jesus devils are afraid of Jesus why come on because it's God in a body come on church it's God in a body they didn't want to believe him they didn't want to believe it they just kept on sacrificing the Lambs and they just kept doing this and that and the other they said we don't want but God was in a body and when God Amen you can be seated you can God was hung on Calvary the Bible says the veil rent amen and it showed and exposed The Mercy Seat saying it's no longer going to be used now God is going to live in aen Jesus Christ and Christ paid the price for every one of you sir amen what what does that mean to me now Christ has received all the way up to the to the heavens Hallelujah now are we just supposed to just worship a god of yesterday or do we have a revelation reation yeah he's there somebody believes Christ is there but he sent back his spirit the pillar of fire is back on earth now the scripture says that on the day of Pentecost a rushing Mighty Wind came and the Holy Spirit that great Pillar of Fire split up and there were hundred there were tongues of fire fell on 120 amen different people now it was the pillar of fire not living in the man Jesus but now it's the pillar of fire living in his sons hallah Oh Glory to God can you say Amen now something was taking place now brother Brandon would say this he would say Amen brother Brandon would say it was a partial word or he talks about the partial word that was giving a substitute lamb he says now they could not have the fullness of that lamb because the fullness of the word had not come it was a prophet given a little here a little there and a little here and a little there and little lambs were there can can you say Amen but it was pointing it was pointing to the Messiah the perfect one that was to come and when that perfect one come brother Brenham would put it this way amen he would say he would say now notice he says now notice how appropriate it was showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour but the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes things the old system is done this one was a new one and the lamb the perfect lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very things that they had to do that is right in other words they had to kill that lamb right now I I I I I like this because the phet had been talking about it Abel talked about it all of these prophets had talked about it Abraham had talked about our possession typed out it everything was all typed out but when Jesus was standing there he was everything of the Old Testament in a body amen all of the promise somebody say all of the promises of the Old Testament was in the body of Jesus and brother bradam says that blood of the perfect lamb had to spill yeah come on you're still not catching still not catching he's not come for you to sing the blood he's not come for you to come and sing in a church he's not come for you to have a youth group he's not come for you to come and belong he's came for a purpose the perfect blood of the perfect lamb had to be spilled what's the reason because he has Sons he has sons that must be [Applause] [Music] redeemed sir that's right as long as Jesus remained on the earth without giving his son he could Jesus could have lived forever but he would be the only one under the possession but God's design was to give you possession you possession and you possession am I going too slow this morning hallelujah amen watch now he says that they had to do that to Christ oh my Now watch how brother brandom connects you in with it let me let me just just let me just stop here for a moment we have gone through church ages Satan come in and seen that perfect church he seen that church that was glorious he seen that church Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils he come on he seen that church when they were lying they just fell dead he's seen that church and Satan come in once more and offered another substitute lamb another substitute Christ another substitute and before you know it first age fa and second age and the third age can you say Amen but then God says I'm going to restore fourth age here come Luther justification fifth age here come sanctification amen oh my it was wonderful amen at the beginning of our age here it was amen speaking in tongues everyone says oh this is Adam this is Adam restored this is Adam stor but then amen they went back to the they went back to the amen this denomination and this one and that one substitute this and substitute that but that that that didn't bother God because that was part of it but he says I'm going to come in now I've got an elect my spirit is on the earth the pillar of fire is back on the earth amen now I'm going to come in with that perfect word and give a perfect Revelation and I'm going to teach you that they're not just a Justified church member or a Sanctified church member or a or a somebody speaking in tongues but now I'm going to give them the word I'm going to take them to mount Sunset I'm going to I'm going to adopt them into the kingdom of God I'm going to show them who they areall sir Hallelujah can you say amen amen now watch watch what brother Randon says God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same things today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing God's word from then on comes the word and the word only that's your time to shout hallelujah hallelujah from the old Pascal lamb passed away Christ become our L at the day of crucifixion and the day when the denominations crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day the word comes into full effect still not catching it full effect full effect somebody say full effect what's full effect go back to Adam what was the effect of the word in Adam what was the honey are are you are are are you cold here let's sun shine a little bit brighter over here oh oh you're too hot Hallelujah call for the shade tree to come you say that didn't happen brother Ram said it did Adam as a son of God good call for seed for for for shade call a tree over good well praise the lord well what about the scripture that says in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you'll Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover what about that scripture we're sons of God coming in and manifesting the glory of God yeah can you say amen amen that is the revelation of redemption the animal blood atoned up until Christ F crucifixion amen I'm going to bring it I'm going to bring it I'm going to bring it oh my but the what did what did what did John what did the Holy Ghost tell John amen the spirit of the Lord told John he says now the the the the the the spirit has falling upon the prophets and then it would rise back up amen it would fall on on on on Isaiah and it would rise back up it would come upon Jeremiah and then he would go back to Heaven he would come back but this when he told John he says the one that you see the Holy Spirit come upon and remain amen there's going to be a there's going to be a person there's going to be a man it's going to be a perfect man that the pillar of fire is not just going to come down and anoint them in a church service and then go off it's not going to come down and anoint him in a in a prayer meeting and then go off but he says he's going to come and he's going to remain he says that will be my man I want to tell you we're living in the day of not just an anointing and going off but the Holy Spirit has come down upon a bride of Jesus

up your eyes you're going the four lepers they were just going to sit there and die they've been kicked out of the city there was nothing left but death until the Revelation come that says why said we here until we die it would be better to go and start possessing and the Bible says that when they took off toward the enemy that God came in confounded the enemy and they walked right into the enemy's camp and there was Beans and Cornbread there was all kinds of stuff right there there was gold and silver they had all taken off you know why because somebody was walking according to the plan of God God had already said by this time tomorrow amen I will pour out of Windows in heaven I will I will deliver I will bring my word to pass can you say amen he had already given that word and these men found themselves walking right in that Revelation I'm not the prophet I'm not the son of a prophet amen but I want to tell you I have heard the voice in this last day that says come out of her my people I've called you I've ordained you I've anointed you I'm bringing you into a place of position and Authority I'm bringing you back to that place you are the [Music] plan when the word comes the

and when I pray I'm going to pray with faith and amen when I come to church I'm going to come to church with faith and can you say Amen do you love him this morning love him with all your [Applause] heartall well I the condemnation there was so much condemnation brother W how many ever how many ever fights condemnation I'm not going to hold you too much longer whoa if you was up here seeing the list of hands there's a lot of perfect folks in this place there's about 10 people raise their hands say that they fight condemnation and the rest of them says not me Hallelujah every believer is going to fight condemnation and every man and woman that the devil amen that that you that knows who they are Satan is going to fight you someone shout yes he's going to fight you amen I I I I was I was thinking here this morning as I was as I was fixing to come up and I I I I I wanted to I wanted to amen let you know that you're fighting those Devils as Satan has always fought amen how many believes that God or that the devil was fighting job in his Revelation brother brandom says Satan fought job and fought job and fought job and fought job but job says that he knew he was perfect on you say job wasn't perfect and and you say and I'm not perfect brother bradam says job's Revelation job in his Revelation knew he had not sinned Hallelujah he knew he was perfect before God well praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen brother Bram says you see when a man a person really ever comes in contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that God is and there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God I believe it was Paul that says there's no Strife no hunger no perils no living creatures no death anything can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus you are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life but Satan thought he could twist him up Joe around a little bit and cuff him up and and and make him do it amen but you see job with a perfect perfect revelation of God who God was how God loved him he waited no matter when the circumstances what the circumstances was he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he knew he had had a grip on God a revelation that I spoke of last night and when the sck people in this building the crippled people or you that need God when you get that type of Revelation that you are Justified when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for and believe that he is a reward of those things those that diligently seek after him there is nothing somebody say nothing can ever separate you from that faith that is anchored to you now brother bradam says he knew he was perfect because he was setting or he was worshiping with that sacrifice us preachers probably face condemnation maybe even more than the congregation right the devil fights as preachers right [Music] preachers well you should know better well you should do this well you should do that you right you say well I didn't know preachers that's just like you parent you you kids think your parents never fight anything they do they do they fight they fight right here but you know what job had that Revelation and he was anchored to his lamb and no matter what the devil brought there was nothing that was going to turn that Revelation around he was solid in his faith that's right are you there with your lamb there's a lamb interceding for you here this morning are you needing healing and the devil saying you're not worthy of it the lamb is worthy am yeah you're needing Deliverance amen and you say when the devil say well you're you're you're you're not worthy of it the lamb is worthy that's yes sir the lamb has made me worthy the lamb has shed the price the lamb has given me my authority in Christ to believe and receive amen is that right Joseph living under the under under the amen the Revel that he was going to rule and then pifer's wife or his brothers sell him and Pier's wife is accusing him and calling him this that and the other but they didn't stop the purpose of God he reigned anyways come on jealous cor and all of the crew was right there telling Moses you'll never be you can't be but Moses had a revelation that he was God's prophet and he stood there upon that Revelation and nothing was going to turn him from it and car was SW swallowed up the three Hebrew boys were standing there alone and it seemed like God had forgotten all about him here they had stood and stood and stood amen and God had forgotten all about him there they are walking the gain plank to fall into the fiery furnace but God was there are you hearing me Jeremiah was accused of being disloyal to the king and was I want you to put feed him the bread of sorrow and put him down in the in the manure Amen in the sess poool Hallelujah when I turn back we'll deal with him Hallelujah but the prophecy was being fulfilled anyways and they had to come back and honor Jeremiah and say God Truly Spoke to Jeremiah is that right if the musicians would come God says there's going to be a bride in this last day and you stand upon that Revelation and the devil's right there saying but it's not you you'll never be you can't be but you've got to stand and watch God vindicate his word in you stand stand on the Revelation and God will vindicate his word in you every time why does he bring these assaults against the believer why does he bring these assaults against the bride of Christ he's trying to stop the vision on that's right that's right but I'm already seeing all the pieces to the puzzle I done see the end product I done see the victory I don't see success I am not going you could have told me that at the beginning but now that I can see myself in this thing there is nothing going to turn me [Music] [Applause] around God says no you can't God says no you won't God tries to mess your family up God tries Amen to mess your mind up God tries to mess you you you young people get you out in sin he the devil the devil tries to to to to mess this all up in your in your mind and your marriage and amen and and and you kids getting out in sin that's the devil trying to to to stop the vision but somebody's got to stand up with a revelation and and though Heen though the Devil Comes against me and it might hit me I'm going to stand up and say in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to rise above it I might have fallen today but I'm going to get back up and I'm going to walk this land today I'm not going to sit down and defeat amen and wallow in in in in in in regrets for three weeks I'm going to rise up the same day that I fall yes sir Hallelujah can you say Amen I'm not going to turn aside one way or the other God's given me a revelation and I'm going to be obedient to that heavenly vision amen I am who I am by the grace of God and nothing else I am who I am because God's ordained well can you say Amen look at your life

disloyal to the king but God came in and said no no you're my son can you say am man Ahab was accusing Elijah you're the reason but God come to vindicate hmon was accusing the people but God came in to vindicate Jesus was accused Luke 23 and10 the chief priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused [Music] him but he was God's answer and you're God's answer [Music] Hallelujah so if I say
