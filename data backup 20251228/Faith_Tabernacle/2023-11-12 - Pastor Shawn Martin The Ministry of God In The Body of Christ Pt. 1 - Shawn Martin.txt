mean a great deal to us amen and um also uh December 9th which will be on a Saturday at 5:00 we're going to have a a a church gathering for those that want to come for supper and um we used to have this uh thanks uh just before Thanksgiving we would have a um turkey ham and all that good stuff so we're going to do that again again so you can call it thanks belated Thanksgiving or just call it early Christmas whatever you want to do don't matter to me or if you just want to call it supper but we are going to have turkey and dressing and all of that and uh so if you'd like to come you're welcome to come uh Britney um she's sick today but uh uh she's going to try to have up a a signup sheet in the back uh by Wednesday and so U if you'd like to look that over and um I think it'd be a good time and um I want to uh just thank all of you that labored uh to put our fall festival together and um Sister Kim for putting it on and and uh we had a good time and I than everybody enjoyed it and and uh so it's always good to have fellowship and and um around Believers you know we um every day that you know we're we're rubbing shoulders with the world and and you know that's the only way we can be a light to people you know uh is that way but when we come together as Believers it's just good to have a fellowship around the Saints of like Precious Faith believe the same way that you know we all know that the Lord is coming and we're looking forward to his coming and um we were took Heather out for a birthday Friday night I think and and um we went to that Japanese place there in U ronoke and um so where you know this where they cook in front of you and looking right across you know was a um transgender cross dresser whatever you want to call it and um which you know that's up to them whatever but um uh Heather and Ruth went to the restroom and that guy walked in that restroom and uh it's all I could do just all I could do but I got to thinking about that how nice it is just to be around levers and uh you know it's uh you know it's it's it's coming it's getting worse and worse by the moment and by the day and tell you what we ought to just keep together just keep together keep our young people together and keep in Fellowship amen and and no wonder Satan fights us so hard to try to pull us away and draw us this way and that way and but stay together amen cuz we we need one another don't we amen so you know and and we certainly pray for them type of people that God will um help them in some way you know and um I you know I just listened to brother brandom how it's just he he said that people are going insane and that's exactly what people are doing right they're just going insane and so you know we just just thank God that God has brought us to where we're at today it's all we can say and that's that's even as Paul said I am what I am by the grace of God and we should cherish that more and more the book of Ephesians the 4th chapter the first verse we'll start there but it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you uh that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with with all loneliness and meekness and with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body can you say that with me there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above of all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father how grateful we are to be able to gather here today Lord as we see more and more the reality of us living in the Sodom and gomorah Lord and the sins of the the world Lord and how the gross darknesses upon the people but father it just humbles us more Lord to know that you've called us to walk in your Marvelous Light and that we are not children of Darkness but we're children of of the light father may we reflect that Lord and may the light become more brighter this morning as you would shine upon us father may your presence just be uh in this place father May the angels of God just uh be by every Pew Lord and father help us Lord just to remove all doubt from us Lord and may we believe May our faith be become more stronger we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen you can be seated I going to maybe just title this the ministry of God in the body of Christ and um as we read there is one body and one spirit and that body is identified as being the bride of Christ who is going to be raptured out and and I say with any with within days it's just uh and it could be today uh could be any moment but that's how close we are to the coming of the Lord and and so the body of Christ is a gifted body uh because as we read God placed every gift is to be used for edification of the body and is to be operated by The Same Spirit so whatever gift that that uh we have it is the same spirit that operates it uh uh in each and everyone and the gifts are for the work of the min Ministry and so God still has a Ministry and uh that is fulfilling his purpose in uh today and this this again this ministry operates within the body of of Christ and so um you know we've read this um but he said to have one of the gifts outside of the body it would do you no good in another place he said see there is no Fellowship outside of the body of Jesus Christ you can't have fellowship with God no wonder people don't believe in Divine Healing no wonder they can't believe in oldfashioned God sent Revival no wonder they can't believe in these things that cleans a man's heart and we could even just say no wonder they're allowing you know the homosexuals and transgenders and no wonder no wonder they're allowing the the things of that that's totally against God's laws is because they're out of fellowship with God their their only Fellowship is in the body of Christ and it's not at Faith Tabernacle it's within the body and the body is made up of a universal uh uh people it's is people from all over the world ain't that right but it takes being in the body of Christ and so in the body of Christ then you are subject to every gift uh that has been placed within and and so brother brandham says see Christ he he sets the members in the body he endows them with their Ministries and he puts the gifts at her disposal amen uh uh disposal so so e every everyone that is in the body of Christ is subject to gifts you you're you you've got a Ministry you've got something to do and and all of these things but it's not that we focus on our gifts uh that's that's not the the point um um because brother brandom says God uh a gift will make room for itself and so uh I find you know that if if men are called young men that are called to preach then they they they want they want to go just preach preach preach preach preach or they've got an idea of how they want to preach you know they'll look at a a young man like brother Andrew that's just going around the world so they want to be just like that you know and but God may have not called him to be that and and so it's not that we focus on the gift I I I I think that or I believe that anyone who is part of the body of course it belongs with has something to do in the ministry of God in some way shape or form and and and all those that are part of that Ministry uh are focused on one thing one thing and that is for the will of God to be done as as Jesus told us he told us to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and so then if if and and I believe that's that should be the desire of every member of the body of Christ uh uh and and and in order for his will to be done uh then we have to perform his will uh we we can't depend on on you know the sinner to do the will of the father we we can't depend upon you know the carnal man to do the will of the Father God has has selected us and put us in his body and we all know how we get in the body and that's by one Spirit we're baptized into one body amen see so uh we must do his will John 15:5 Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and so we see that the vine supplies the energy he the the vine only the prophet says supplies the energy but we as the branches have to do the job amen see so we we being members of his body are to carry out his will it's just like God had a plan for the Messiah uh uh uh when he come uh on the earth and what he would do and it was prophesied in the scriptures as to what he would do what he would be and and these things and the type of ministry that he would have and only Jesus could have fulfilled them scriptures only Jesus could have done that we we find there were other Messiahs that come along before Jesus come and they would lead uh uh people out in the wilderness and they LED them here and they done this and and and and they all perished they they all perished because there was only one Messiah that could fulfill the will of God because along with the Prophecies of what the Messiah would do God had Jesus Christ in mind to fulfill that do you believe that and so others tried to be Messiah but they were proven to be impersonators and and so there was only one Messiah that could fulfill uh the will of God brother brandham said every move every place he went everything he did every word he spoke had a meaning to it and was EX exactly in harmony with God and the will of God Amen so then then we find that God had a a plan for the uh you know the Forerunner uh of the first coming of Christ and and it was written in the scriptures uh uh what he would do and what he would be and the type of ministry he would have and and only John the Baptist could fulfill that there was no one it didn't matter how many wanted to to introduce Messiah only John could have fulfilled them scriptures but he had to fulfill them in order for the will of God to be fulfilled he had to be the way he was he had to do what he did in order to fulfill scriptures for he was the Forerunner that God had predestinated so his ministry fulfilled the word of God it wasn't just running out here amen doing whatever amen but but the ministry his ministry matched Pro prophecy that's can you say amen and and so then we find that even the Apostle Paul said that God separated him from his mother's womb and called him by his grace and notice he said it pleased God to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen amen and and in in Acts 20 and 27 Paul says I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God so Paul had to put into practice he had to perform he had to do in order for God's will to be accomplished ain't that right amen see and and so he had a certain Ministry had a certain and and we know that he was the first church age messenger he was the a prophet to the Gentiles and all these things and so his ministry fulfilled what God had called him to do and so everyone that is part of God's Ministry desires for the will of God to be done they seek the will of God they submit to it and do it ain't that right amen and that's that's the challenge and to me that's what separates amen the true bride from the rest is is they they're after the will of God they're seeking the will of God to be done they submit to the will of God and they do the will of God Amen see well what is the will of God well the will of God the prophet said is the word of God and it's the word for our day the word for our day is the will of God ain't that right amen the word allotted for us in our age and and so that we pray as Jesus taught us to give us this day our daily bread don't give us the day of yesterday don't but give us the day that we're living in our daily bread that way we know what the will of God is having an understanding of the will of God Amen everybody might be confused on the will of God for today but a bride isn't amen because that she is the body of Christ so she's got to know every member has got to know what uh the will of God is uh uh for the church today amen so um the word for today is the only thing that will take effect upon the elect uh so Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 the these are the scriptures why we stay with that constantly uh uh because it's the word for our day it it's it's a product of we are a product of this Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 uh Revelations 10 1-9 amen uh uh we we we we say A Lot 1 through 7 amen but but we are the8 and N uh verses if you if you know where John was told to eat the book go get the book from the angel and eat the book and thou and the angel after he ate it said thou must prophesy again ain't that right well John was the type of the bride and so so the revelations uh or or 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and and and on and on and on and on we could go of scriptures that apply for the day that we are living in and so now I understand that there is a will of God that that that we we seek for uh in our personal life you know such as who who should I marry and and and and uh you know what what should I do and uh what should I say when certain situations arise and what what should I do in life and you know uh uh you know even to the uh church that what should I attend and what Ministry should I sit under and and all these things it these things that we seek for the will of God in our lives amen and it's a personal thing and and we we we must we we need to seek the will of God in every aspect of our life amen of even in my opinion of of where we should work amen as I've said before a lot of folks they'll they they you know they they'll go after the money and it'll take them further from the house of God and and they they call that the will of God well if it takes you from the house of God if it takes you from The Fellowship Of God and around the Saints and all that there's something wrong with that that's my opinion anyways and I believe it's scriptural amen for the Bible does say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even that much more as you see the day approaching and and so uh uh there is a will of God that we are to seek for in our personal life and and and and this is U Romans 8:14 it says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so sons of God which belong in the body of God are placed in the body of of God uh of Christ uh they're led by the spirit of God and it's it's no longer now the world Amen they're led by their own pernicious ways the Bible says they're own led by their own lust the Bible says but the sons of God uh uh are different from that they are led by the spirit of God ain't that right and so if if we're going to be led by the spirit of God then this requires us to be sensitive to the spirit of God and it also requires us to be disciplined uh uh to his will and and the word disciplined uh it means to show restraint controlled or temperate amen and you know brother Brandon talked about the the Capstone uh uh or the Great Pyramid uh there in Egypt and how that the Capstone was never put up on it and he tells tells us why and and uh because it was a type of Israel rejecting The Headstone which was Christ amen and and brother brandom says here and I want you to listen now he says when Enoch and them he said they knew that the C Cornerstone the Capstone would be rejected and that pyramid is so perfectly together till they don't need any mortar see it was so mechanically hewed out until one Stone fits against the other so tight that you can't even put a razor blade between them see and and and just kept heaping up now it's all honed off on top ready for the Capstone when it will come see that's the way God has brought his church from justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now everybody say now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the world word that Ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like his so we we identifying the ministry in the body right amen see and he says see it's just like my when my shadow here my hand if I never seen my hand seen the shadow it gets pale it get as it gets away see but he says as it gets closer and closer and closer see the negative and the positive are coming until they both become the same thing and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one see God has was God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and so Christ will have to be in the church see the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled ain't that right and that's the Capstone that comes upon this last Church age not lay Osa now it's a calling out of that out of Le osia a bride out of that calling a church out of a church ain't that right see so then that tells us that we're not just a pile of stones just laying there but we are as what Paul or brother Brandon would say we are stones in the hands of the stone Mason that have been cut that's been shaped to fit into the body amen uh and and shaped into Sons and Daughters of God so so we we we are now as at at the honing see being honed we are stones that are hone trial after trial trial after trial what what what's being hone your will is being subjected to his will your thoughts being subjected to his thoughts can you say man everything of you is being subjected and conformed into his nature Amen to where you become obedient to the word of God Amen see and and the Capstone headstone can come upon the body now one of the fruits of the spirit is temperance Temperance and that is self-control that's that's uh restraint amen see and and and not not is it just Restraint of well he made me mad so I ain't going to hit him you know because I'm I've got Temperance and no no that I I think it goes more to Temperance to do his will amen and and how far many people are lacking in that is is the temperance a control to do his will amen Romans 87 now notice he says the carnal mind is enity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be ain't that right so so then the carnal mind has no Temperance that's that's what we're talking about right it it has no Temperance now people may not uh uh shoot shoot another person you know because they don't want to go to jail well that's that's being a little you know that's been a little temperent showing some Temperance but this ain't the temperance that we're talking about in my opinion anyways amen because uh while that same person may not shoot someone cuz he don't want to spend life in jail you know he ain't temperate to the word of God man a lot of folks going to church but they're not temper to the word of God a lot of people are even showing Temperance in business where they get up 4:00 in the morning and they get out there and they they make their and they'll they'll work 90 hours 100 hours a week well to me that's that's showing some Temperance you know amen as to where you can get up they're maybe tired they may be whatever but they're out to make that business work they're out there to make that money they're out there you know but when it comes to the things of God there's no Temperance so see so the fruit of the spirit amen brings a Temperance into the body ain't that right amen see into the body amen and and so we find that the carnal mind is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so it has no Temperance when it comes to the will of God for it cannot be subject to God or to his word ain't that right so then what it boils down to is a gift that is used by a carnal mind can bring harm more harm than it can do good ain't that right so Galatians 5 and 24 it says they that are christs have crucified the uh flesh with the affections and lusts aren't you glad you have that ability to do that amen if you're part of the body you have that ability to do that it's because we're we're crying out thy will be done in in Earth as it is in heaven and and so then we have this ability then amen Jesus said you shall receive power amen after that you you uh have received the Holy Ghost see so they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit also ain't that right so then the I I just believe that the spirit of God will never lead the elect outside of his will that is written out in the scriptures Lord amen No Matter What will what what Revelation you seek for your personal life that revelation will always line up with what is written in the Scriptures it it just will because the spirit of God if you're truly if a man is truly led by the spirit of God it will never leave him outside of the word because the spirit of God cannot deny the word of God ain't that right so then if you notice a god ordained ministry will do all it can by the word of God Amen by the word of God not by some lecture not by some Creed or some pamphlet amen but by the word of God to help your faith get centered on the will of God for you amen every God ordained Ministry every in other words every member of the body will help you to get your faith centered on the will of God for your life it ain't going to lead you somewh and ain't going to lead you there it ain't going to lead you here it ain't going to whatever see it's got to say the same thing can you say Amen so God forbid that we go through life claiming to be the bride of Christ and and and then we not know his will amen uh uh for us as the bride of Christ claiming to be bride of Christ bride of Christ and yet not know the will of God that he has laid out for his his bride amen see now there are Ministries that are powerful and effective and yet they work against the will of God Amen and and they teach contrary to the will of God they do that with which is contrary to the will of God they live contrary to the will of God and and yet they are genuinely anointed genuinely and and and this should not be a a a surprise to any of us uh especially in in those that you know in in the message ranks um uh well just any Bible believer really because 2 Corinthians 11:13 it says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light showing that he is religious ain't that right therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their Works ain't that right so then what is Satan's true intention you know I I think if we could understand his motives and his intentions then then uh then then that's what will keep us from being deceived uh uh and only the spirit can truly Quicken that to us but here's uh uh the prophet Isaiah exposes and tells the true intention Isaiah 14-12 it says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for th thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars or sons of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so this has been his intentions and he's been acting upon this ever since he has never changed and then Paul picks up on this in 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God can you say man so this is the motive this is the intention desire of of Satan and and and so then we see that Satan is an enemy to God and he seeks to be like God and to take the place of God to be God Amen to be God and and so in order for this to happen he has to do it in deception he has to do it in deception and I thank God for a prophet to to Really expose him for what he truly is he has to do it all in deception and and Revelations 12:7 and we know that he achieves it he achieves this uh it says and the Great Dragon uh was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world think of that it deceiveth the whole He deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him so then Jes Jesus comes along and he prophesies that this deception would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible ain't that right so the prophet says by unbelief in all God's word has brought the the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden we're now entering in where Satan is taken the throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth an Eden of sin perverted Rel everybody say perverted religion amen see perverted religion he started not upon I am Satan I'm the great Angel not upon that but upon perverting God's word and we know just how much he perverted it by missing one word one word and he perverted the whole the whole word of God see so he says upon perverting God's word and that's how he's brought his kingdom in every age now in this great deceitful age ready to take his throne by his people amen that's what he's been working on all this time so as we read Satan has ministers who are transformed as the Ministers of righteousness now I want you to notice now that Satan the prophet says can impersonate any kind of gift that God has got but he cannot not bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden and that's where he always fails he doesn't fail upon gifts per se he can you impersonate any gift but he cannot bring that word word by word in other words he can't stay with it he can't believe in all of it amen see so brother Brandon preached about the false anointed ones and and he says this they can be Anointed with the Spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still a devil that's right ain't that right we all know that the real genuine Holy Spirit can fall upon a man and yet it only fall on his spirit and brother Bram said his soul is his germ see not the spirit it's in his soul is the germ and that germ is the word so he says I don't care how much you can preach and how will you do this and how much you love well that's one of the inlets to the spirit see you can't you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love God and still not be right see you can cast out devils and preach and do things and still not be right Jesus said so said that many would come in that day see it's the word that settles it stay with the word can you say man see and this is what this bride is she is a word bride word bride and her Ministry is a word ministry amen ain't that right so then we find that Satan the prophet says anoints his servants with unbelief another place he said Satan and his demons anoint Humanity to disbelieve God's word and Jesus here in Luke 11:24 said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and finding none and he says I'll return unto my house whence I came out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished then he goeth and and taketh him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worth wor than the first my see now brother Brandon quotes that scripture and then he he he he says this that's what happens to these meetings see when people go forth in revivals and men are just led to an intellectual conception he goes off and joins some church and lets it go at that satisfied yeah I want to just say here we don't want intellectual conceptions we don't want to bring people to intellectual conceptions ain't that right we don't want to just sit here as a morg it's important that we entertain the spirit of God it's important that we know how to bring the spirit of God in our midst can you say amen and not grieve him away from the service so many people grieve him because when he starts moving on someone someone starts dancing or shouting oh that's fanaticism you ought to know better than that if you're any type of a Believer you ought to know better than that you ought to know that brother brandham said don't criticize that person even though you say well I know he's doing wrong I I see what is life brother Bram said don't criticize that person yet is that could be a genuine anointing on that person you understand what I'm saying we want the spirit of God to have his way why because there could be a seat somewhere where the spirit of God Amen will get past that Spirit into their soul that's right true so we don't want them just to leave with an intellectual conception ain't that right where they say w that was powerful that was so profound the way they put it together it doesn't matter if you can put it together that's right doesn't matter if you can explain it and spell it out if you just lead them to intellectual conception it does no good right true so and I think you can all say men if you're Believers so he says men are just led to an intellectual conception he goes off and joins some church and lets it go at that satisfied that's all right see well there's nothing to all this other nonsense he begins to say see we should not have it the pastor says all that's all well that was way back in another age see and the first thing you know that devil returns back was other Devils and he becomes a religious devil and then he's really filled and then he's got pride and jealousy see he's even angry with the very God that wrote the Bible and he looks down there and he says these things that I do shall you do also and that man will say well that was just for the disciples see it only come to an intellectual conception of the message or of the Bible whatever you want to call it to me it's the same amen pise the Lord and when they begin to explain it away for another age then it shows they're under a different headship that's right you can't be that in in in the body of Christ now they have a Ministry of course they have a Ministry but they're not centering the people's faith upon the word of God you know the prophet said the worst thing that you can do is disbelieve God that's the worst thing you can do you know it's it's it's it's well anyways I think it gets us worked up on a lot of things and it gets us thinking about other things and thinking that God can't forgive and God can't do this and you know but the worst thing you can do is disbelieve God the tactic of the devil he says in another place is to get you to disbelieve God's word ain't that right well isn't that what he tried with Jesus there at Temptation Matthew 4 and3 when the tempter came to him he said if thou if thou be the Son of God throwing them questions out there isn't that what he does to us well if you're the bride if you're really really saved if God really loves you and this and that well see if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread see but Jesus answered and said but it is written see th man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into a holy city amen and Seth him up on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down ain't that right see so what Satan was trying to do he was trying to get Jesus to doubt the word of what the word said he was ain't that right am Jesus's knowledge of who he was was only by the word of God that's right bless the Lord and that's the only way your knowledge is going to come by is by the word of God can you say Amen of who you are is by the word of God so he was trying to get Jesus to doubt the word which would have caused Jesus to act outside the will of God but Jesus was disciplined to the will of God Amen he was yes now Satan taught Eve to disbelieve and he has tried throughout the history his of mankind to teach men to doubt God he tried to teach Moses to doubt he tried to teach other men to doubt God's word so so don't think that Satan isn't going to try to get you and I to doubt God's word he he's going to do it now he may not be able to to to to get us to doubt that Jesus Christ uh uh you know uh didn't exist 2,000 years ago and he may not try to get you to doubt out that you know of of the former Church ages and what God done in Moses and what God had done in David but the point is is the word for our day is where he's going to challenge your faith the word for our day right amen hello see so so we find here um uh in the message proving his word brother brandham and talking about Satan said he's trying to teach you to doubt it see or yeah he's trying to teach you to try to doubt it and you that's sitting here right now if you want me to call your names Satan's been trying a long time to get you to doubt me don't you do that now isn't he still trying to do that trying to get us to make to make light of what God has done in this day like it it yeah it's okay but you know we're moving on to Greener pasture so to speak and that's the attitude that people have come on hello and and and yet see it's it's it's but but he says see Satan trying to get you to doubt me don't you do that amen stay with the message amen that's right Matthew 24:9 Jesus says and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many but notice what we're commanded to there to do in 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not not every spirit amen not talking about personalities not talking about men not talking about nothing else but Spirits believe not every spirit because behind everything there is a spirit ain't that right behind every Ministry there's a spirit so he says believe not every Spirit but try everybody say try in other words discern try the spirit discern the spirit whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world ain't that right so this is not just a request from God this is a command from God this is an order from God that we as Believers are to tried the spirit it's just like in nickan uh uh in the first church age was it not I think it was the first church age that God commended that church because he said you have tried them and found them to be Liars ain't that right yes sir because they're they no matter what little uh what they were starting to do at least they still had some discernment right now so brother Brown said now there is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so so many people judge people by gifts that they have well I believe that these things are gifts I believe that what we see see uh that we see take place as gifts and they are god-given gifts but if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts ain't that right see the other night he says I made the statement at the pulpit saying this I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know everybody say we must know what these things are for we must know what these things are for ain't that right how many times have we seen men use their gift to divide the church divide the body of Christ they Ed their gift to draw people unto themselves to bring confusion among the people see they're taking a gift and it it you know hey we ain't doubting the gift but what is behind the gift what is motivating that gift can you say Amen see so what is it it's a distraction uh uh from what God is actually trying to do see amen see so so what are we to discern then well brother brandom in the spirit uh discernment of spirit he says now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denomination he come from or how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it I'd have discernment of spirit enough to know that that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate or how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or spiritual power see that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so that he'll have a big name so that other Brethren will look up to him as some big person then that's wrong we do not have big preachers and little preachers we do not have big people and little people so do you understand what I'm saying not in the body hello now now some some may be going around worldwide and they're famous and and and and and that's the gift that they've got but he is no better than than that little person that's that's that's M making sure that the local church is going and and sweeping and cleaning and the musicians and nobody may know your name but to God you're important in the body ain't that right so see maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the pitcher that's still wrong amen but if if if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ and I don't care what he belongs to you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man see another place if he if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together and to bring the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination but to an understanding a fellowship a Unity of the spirit can you say Amen it's said that a lot a lot of times you can't fellowship with others because they're trying to destroy you they're trying to destroy the church their whole motive is to empty a church out that's right absolutely hello to break up Brotherhood and then you say well then you're accused of of not fellowshipping well I thought you wanted to Fellowship well how do you how does light and darkness fellowship if a if if a man has a motive to empty the another man's Church to fill his church up right then you're not having Fellowship you're not walking in the light there's a spirit behind that thing it amazes me how people don't have the understanding what of what groups of Fellowship they get into they'll get into certain group and all of a sudden they lose their fire they lose their energy they lose their burden they lose everything that's right you don't see them around local body anymore something is at work and they'll tell you to your face oh we're all just fine no you're not amen something's wrong that's right and the problem is is they all do it for fellowship and ignorant of the spirit that's behind it all now yeah true but see here it is if he's trying to lead the people not break them up but but to bring them together and to bring the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination but to an understanding a fellowship a Unity of The Spirit Well then if his former L Reign latter Reign whatever he is see his spirit and his purpose is Right amen and the spirit that's in him no matter what move he belongs to that spirit that's in him is trying to point the people to Calvary away from himself away from anything else but his only achievement he has is to point them to Calvary the body of Christ is pointing them to Calvary pointing them to a bloody bleeding word pointing them to God of the realities of Jesus Christ for today can you say amen he doesn't care whether even his own movement which is fine it's good if he's a Methodist Presbyterian Roman cath whatever he wants to be by denomination but what is he trying to do the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get see well then you can see what's in the man's life whether his motive is for his denomination is he working for his denomination see it is is what whether it's for himself whether it's for worldly Fame whether it's for big names I you know to say well I predicted that and it come to pass I you know I I'll say it this way you know a lot of times you get preachers that are that that that say well the Lord done this and the Lord done that in our church in our church you know and they and and they're just you know it's almost becoming bragging you know the Lord done this well brother brandham he he constantly told of Miracles and things that was happening but I guarantee you and you can tell the spirit that brother brandham had it was not to say see here I [Applause] am never did he do that and when you start seeing them Spirits start fighting and and and again trying to empty churches and trying to do this and trying to do that it's almost like see God's here I don't know where else is he's moving but he's sure moving here brother he says see I predicted that and it just come to pass exactly well see you see that's wrong right there to begin with amen it's not about us our ministry is not about us hello brother brandom knew that that's why he was willing to go to people of five or to 100,000 he was willing true that's why he didn't get bound up Amen in in in in all these things like old Roberts and and them did because they had to have certain money and before they would win they had to have 10,000 they had to have whatever because they were so in debt but brother Brown stayed simple that way he could have a house meeting if God called him for that house meeting he would go if God called him out in the mountains of Canada to reach an Indian he would go you understand what I'm saying see so notice brother Brown said never on the platform under the Visions have I ever seen the Holy Spirit challenge anyone and tell them they was in the wrong church I've never have done that see and he says see he will tell them just exactly what kind of church they belong to and different things like that but he never did uh never did he ever challenge anybody's faith and say you belong to the wrong Church all right can you say Amen now you know it's bad enough when we when when when you see it out in in the in the uh in in the church world but then it's really bad when you see it in in the message Rings yeah now he said see you find gifts and so forth creeping up in the church and the operation of these gifts before you let it go to operating in things feel it pressing in your heart now the enemy is real slick can you say that with me the enemy is real slick and that's just what tears the church purch the pieces every time is a true gift operated wrong something God is trying to do and operated wrong it'll just simply not only uh hurt you but it'll tear the tear the whole church up see consult it take it through and through the Bible then test it and see if it's God or not just keep testing it and trying see if it's perfect right down the line and WR with the word then you're all right as long as the word has said it would be here would operate this certain way stay right with it don't never get off no matter what anybody does how real it seems to be if it doesn't reflect in the scriptures from Genesis to Revelations leave it alone don't take no chances we're in the last days when Satan is just deceiving as he can be God has done everything to show that he's God Amen and Satan has pulled every trick out he cannot be more deceiving than what he is today true now and I hope this is all right this morning but the ministry of God operates within the body of Christ and as we know God has placed in the Min in the body the five-fold ministry praise the Lord there gifts Pastor Prophet teacher evangelist apostle or missionary Apostle missionary see we call them missionaries today I guess but these gifts are predestinated amen that God set in his church and according to Ephesians 4 and 12 through 15 this ministry is given for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of faith of of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro so this is the fightful ministry is that we grow up to where we're not wishy-washy we're not leaving questions in your mind we're not just scattering you out there and and destroy your confidence in the message and what God has done to where you just still you you you just gullible to anything the bride of Christ shouldn't be Gable these days I don't care what Ministry comes I don't care what personality comes I don't care what kind of a person says I don't care if what kind of friend you join up here with you should never be so gullible to to to swallow the Kool-Aid right and the ministry fful Ministry is given for that purpose yes that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fr and of course it's not going to affect only the it'll only affect the elect and carried about with every wind of Doctrine see by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so now 1 Corinthians 12 and 20 Paul tells us that this body is a many membered body and brother brandom says that God has put us each one in the body to do certain things 1 Corinthians 15:16 makes mention of the ministry of the Saints and there are nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body and of and of the Believers and that's wisdom knowledge speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of healings Gifts of Prophecy and Etc and and these uh they're not necessarily predestinated gifts as they are as the fivefold ministry but these are gifts that God set in the church and brother Brown said see to show his love towards the church see he wants you to stay in order the great Holy Spirit himself being the tutor of the church but notice the prophet said they work through the body and they Circle through the body it circles see well then there are also helps and governments in the body and and you know I think of the men and women who helped the Apostle Paul and it wasn't just men it was it was women as well and Paul says mentions Aquilla and PR Priscilla and he says that they were his helpers in Christ Jesus and he said of them he says they have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles so they may have not been ministers because Paul declared plainly that a woman wasn't a minister but yet even she was a help to Paul yes and to all the churches of the Gentiles then Paul mentions that there was uh Phoebe who Paul said was a uh uh secur of many and of himself also then he mentions a a woman Mary who bestowed much labor on him and the brothers who were with him and he he goes on to to to many more but but so it wasn't all just Paul now we see Paul as the church age messenger man Paul was an important thing important Ministry because said If any man teach any other thing even if an angel from heaven comes down and teaches any other thing let him be a cursed so Paul was his ministry his teaching was the Cornerstone for the church and and and and so but yet that there was a other Ministry of the body that was operating but it was in wasn't in conflict with Paul hello amen it wasn't in Conflict they wer weren't working against what God was doing in Paul but they complimented Paul they helped him they furthered his ministry prise the Lord is that right but the ministry doesn't just operate when we come together Ministry should continue outside these walls witnessing testifying conducting ourselves as Believers should is that right there's if there's ever a people that are part of the body of Christ that should be written Epistles read and known of all men it should be us today because we are the completion of the body brother Bram says all how we need in Jefferson Ville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler that's right devil don't care how loud you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God saying anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on see oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil just like you say well if he could preach like a Billy Graham or an old Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker see oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that for sure he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits backs and laughs at it but when he sees that life that's the thing th that shakes the devil so so I I hope I'm under you're understanding what really Ministry is it's not just a man just standing behind the pulpit if if we're part of the body then then we all have a Ministry I I I truly believe that father and mother have a Ministry Amen to their children to the headship of their home it's it's a Ministry and this is why as fathers sometimes are so burdened down with things because the pressure is because we have an obligation it's not just a choice well I don't know I just you know sometimes fathers have to deal with things in the home and we don't like it sometimes it may make mom mad it might make the children upset true not understanding why and sometime we have to break it down to them so they can understand you understand what I'm saying being a a father it isn't all about making money amen you can go out there and make money and the devil's working on your wife every member has a Ministry in the body and every member every member and we're going to wind it down here but every member of the body is controlled by one head Lord there is only one intelligence everybody say one intelligence that operates the body and every member operates under that intelligence we have had ministers with great Ministries within the message that have come and gone and because they have great Ministries and have been able to get a following they become elevated in their heart to where they see themselves as the leader the voice to the people oh my and they get lifted up in in in Pride and it begins to get them to do things that God never called them to do hello before you know it and it happens most all the time the message gets pushed aside cuz when a man wants to elevate himself in the ministry there's no room for him in the message it hurts him to say the prophet said it hurts them to just stay with what a prophet said right and maybe not realizing it themselves but they fulfill what Paul said in Acts 20 and 30 where he says also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them yeah so what I want to say is no minister is the head of the body you with me no minister is the head of the body brother Brandon is not the head of the body right amen we ain't got that picture there for brother brandom we we got the picture there for what God done right so it's not about brother brandom he's not the head of the body Colossians 1:18 and he Christ is the head of the body amen the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence prise the Lord in every Ministry over every every member of the body he's going to have preeminence amen over every aspect right so the entire body is subject to its head the head tells the feet where to go it tells the hands what to do it tells the mouth what to speak and what not to speak it's the intelligence it's the head it tells it tells the eyes what to look at see it's the head that gives the perception of what the eyes are looking at see and so that's the intelligence so if Christ the word is the head and he controls the body then that means no man controls you yes hello if you're part of the body of Christ Isaiah 9 and six tells us that the government shall be upon his shoulders ain't that right amen we know the government is the head and the shoulders represent the body body it's it's the body so the government shall be upon his shoulders the government of God will not be upon just anybody it'll be upon the body that he redeemed and claimed for his own amen and if you're part of that body you're under that headship amen that government amen ain't that right that's right so no other head is going to rest upon the body but his own head which is the word of God and all who are subject or in the body are subject to the word for he it's the headship praise the Lord Brother Bram talked about the men and women who believe this message you know and he uh he said this he said just as soon as they heard the message they were solded on it 100% prise the Lord notice now that could only come by for ordination amen it's the only way it could come amen the only way that a man can be totally sold on this message is by for ordination being for ordained to be so right now our headship is a kingdom and Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you amen so brother Braham said now listen we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life true a't that right see the kingdom of God is the word of God May spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God was one oh my and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last days and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again see as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden see that's what the headship is so the kingdom which is our headship is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing the pass every promise of God praise the Lord praise the Lord amen what a Ministry we have when the head's connected amen see the kingdom of God he says is God's word made Power the Kingdom's in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin it turns itself into Power making it say just exactly what it said see you can't say it says this and it says this and make it work you got to say the same thing it says that makes a confession amen can you say man so see when we're in the body then and the headship has come upon on that body it starts functioning in in every individual starts making it work in every individual therefore you're under such control that that that for example brother Bram talks about women working now you know good and well brother brah talked about women shouldn't be out in the factories and they shouldn't be out in here they shouldn't be Mayors and they shouldn't be this we got more is becoming more popular where young our young girls are becoming more career-minded than anything else now brother Brandon condemned it it was wrong but when you're under a headship when you're under that control of headship you cannot say well I know brother Bram said that but that's back in the 50s I know he said that but we're we're in different days we ain't going back to Grandma days something wrong there's a headship am that's true right surely you believe that with me I believe it's sad when we got mothers in this message that are leaving their children to Baby Setter so they can go do their own thing their own careers what they want to do yeah that's right you say well brother Bram allowed it he said that you know if if if we're financially broke then yeah we quit spending all them money on credit cards amen quit trying to be like the Joneses yeah no pun intended quit trying to be like everybody else most of America's broke that's right they're in debt they're driving these fancy things they're living in nice things and they're in debt that's true hello yeah so no wonder the woman has to go work but us men ought to ought to make it sure that our wives don't have to work work amen I want my children to be raised by my wife that's right right hello not by raised by somebody else amen so you can't say something contrary to what the word says and make it work you got to say the same thing it says and that makes the confession and the only way you do that is you're part of the body you're under a headship and it's making the word work see the headship is the word made spirit and life in you so now you're not just talking about the word over there you're not just talking about what a prophet said now you becoming what a prophet said because headship your ministry is not controlled by you then your ministry is under the unction of God then God can have his way God can have his will performed in you ain't that right the Lord how do we know what the word says one will take the Bible and say one thing another will take another the Bible and say another thing another will take another we got all kinds of voices about the Bible different ideas interpretations and all of that ain't that right and it has left every man confused on what to believe and and now I realized that in the message and and this goes on in the message just as much but I realize that our understanding of the word may be different on different levels we may all be on different levels of understanding of the word of God and so we're not going to see out to eye on everything but I don't believe that any true Revelation that is given by God will take away from the word of God I mean we might we might preach you know just the simple scripture of John 3:16 and and and it may be preached in Simplicity it may be preached in depth it may be preached but it's all focused on the same thing it's not taking away hello amen no matter how simple it is so so brother Bram says in the Old Testament if a prophet prophesied if a dreamer dreamed a dream no matter how real it seen before the church ever would accept it it had to be proven by the urum Thum you know that breastplate of Aaron where the lights reflected when that priesthood ended the urum th went with it but we've got a new Ur thumb and that's the word of God if your Revelation doesn't tie and and you say well God revealed it to me that I should be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost if that don't tie with the word from Genesis to Revelations tie it together then your Revelation wrong well you say well God revealed to me that I should be baptized in Jesus name if it doesn't with the word then the uran Thurman don't back it up no matter how real it seems this is the authentic word this is God's Ur th so no matter what Revelation how simple how whatever and it may seem real it may seem right it may seem true but here's the word right here here it is amen as we're going to get into it more but you got people getting this Revelation that God's done away with Ministry you never be able to tie that with the word I've asked them I've asked them about it because as soon as they get tied with no preachers then there's no church we just sat home and listen to tapes the house is my church show me where in the Bible where that says that and they won't answer they won't answer because it doesn't say that it says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together that doesn't mean Me Myself and I right amen so we are living in the culmination of all prophecy spoke of the church and this word culmination is the climax the summit or the peak the highest point obtained this is where we're at amen and all scripture concerning the bride in both Old and New Testament must be fulfilled by us right yes and in order for this to happen we got to say the same thing the word says and this is why God calls us out of Babylon out of confusion amen see because the Rapture cannot happen if we are confused on the word of God the changing of our body the Millennium the adoption of sons manifestation of sons of God cannot happen if we're all confused about the word of God right can you say amen I I I I I could go more and more but I'm I'm going to wrap it up but I truly believe that in this age God wants preeminence in his own body and and and when I when I say that you know the nine spiritual gifts you know well brother Bram said they're set they're not pred well he says the fivefold ministry are predestinated the gifts are set in the church and they operate they operate within the body in other words he says you know that brother Amos may use him to prophesy one one night and maybe never use him again May jump over to brother Bill or you know Sister Martha but they they Circle through the body they they operate but see it's no man's certain gift my gift as a Ministry is not my gift this is why even us as ministers are going to be held responsible for what we've done with this ministry and every one of us is going to be held responsible for the gift that God has given because it's his gift and therefore we must become so pliable to him Lord so yielded to him so submitted to him and and I know how the flesh works I know I know how it works how you know the flesh wants you know the the the the flesh wants recognition the flesh wants this the flesh want the flesh wants to do its own thing but then God's doing something else and it's so easy to jump ship yeah when God's trying to do something against our flesh it's so easy to come against what God is trying to do because we're doing it on our flesh true anytime that you see a church fall apart it's really when Satan's battling the church it's never when they're in Revival does a church fall apart it's usually when people are discouraged it's usually when people are disgruntled it's usually when Satan's been able to work and cause division in the church and then they fall apart because they lose vision of what God has been trying to do they lose the fact that God is blessed they lose the fact that God has done something and they begin to get their minds and their eyes on something else and God is trying to do something God is trying to to bring us to something and I say to you church here I don't believe that we're here in vain at all am I believe that God is trying to bring us to something whether it's just this preacher I don't know I'm I'm going to include all of us in this but the more and more I'm seeing things I'm really believe that God has been trying to get me somewhere because he wants total preeminence he doesn't care about how well popular you are he he doesn't care about anything that you think you should be it's what he wants you to be right so the ministry in the body must be under his headship can you sayen you love the Lord amen if musicians will come hope we've helped you in some way church it's the headship the Dynamics that has come to the body that's going to take us home prise the Lord and we're sure looking forward to going home amen but while while we're waiting let's make sure that we're yielded to him in every aspect of our life if you have to give up things give it up if there's things that you know that the prophet has taught and you're struggling with ask God for the grace just say God I'm not going to make any excuses anymore I'm just going to follow you the Lord follow your will follow your ways can you say Amen prise the Lord what good is Ministry if you don't have him brother Brandon would have just been another man come along on the scene if he did not have God backing him up can you say amen and that's the same way that differentiates the ministry of the Bride versus everyone else she's here fulfilling the word of God the will of God she's walking in step and God is backing it up doesn't mean that it's always going to be easy doesn't mean that it's always going to be applauded by the world the one thing about it God's applauding God's applauding remember brother brandom taught told about that pianist that went and done a concert there I believe it was in Russia when he got finished you know the crowd just stood up and there just oooing and awing and clapping but he just kept looking up there in the balcony it just seemed like he didn't pay any attention to all the Woos and the alls and the applauds finally they looked and and there was his his teacher you would want to know what that teacher thought about it if the teacher said it's okay and that's okay that's the way I say if God says it's okay whatever it is then it's okay I love him never out loves that's the right song the Lord can you sing that with me I want to do live the way he wants me to live I want to deal until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no [Music] oh I can never ever out oh saying it again I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there there's just no more to give I want to love love to you there's just no I can never ever out love the Lord is they just play softly can we just bow our heads for just a moment Church no matter what excuses we come up with and how legitimate they may seem if it doesn't line up with the word we must cast it aside thought about the how many women are standing behind the pulpit today preaching and they have the excuses as to why they're doing it and to be honest a lot of them seem legit a lot of excuses will be legit to say oh yeah that sounds really good that sounds right that sounds sounds like good things there but it's against God's word so when it's against God's word then we have to throw every reasoning aside and I I will tell you God brings us through hardship Christian life is not easy and if there's ever a time that each of us as members of the body of Christ should be dependent upon God it's now he promised to be our protector our provider he promised he promised to to meet every need and if we're in his will then he will fulfill his word if we're outside of his will then we're on our own not saying that God won't bring us in line and he will if we're in elect he'll bring us back in line and maybe a good whipping whatever it will but but what I'm saying is in the hard times we can't fall apart and then go to plan B we can't say oh God I trust you I trust you I trust you when everything's good money's in the account things are going great life you know home Church Life marriage children all serving the lord everybody's just doing great oh I Trust You Lord and then when things become unraveled then we start going to plan B and what happens is then the questions come well are you really a Son of God well if you are a son of God this wouldn't God be answering your prayer well haven't you haven't you asked God to help you and he ain't helped you yet and seemed like like the Situation's getting worse you might ought to try this and then if we start doubting who we are if we start then we find ourselves working outside of God's Will and this is where the trust comes and we must stay under that headship this message is not old timey this message isn't for Grandma and Grandpa this is message is still appliable today and we must stay under that headship and yield Our Lives to it and let let the message cut us let it shape us let us let it mold us to where we can become more like God and our ministry our character everything about us becomes more Godlike because you remember that's the only Ministry that the body is working today is the very Ministry of Jesus Christ the very character that Christ had is in the body of Christ and church we didn't start out that way that all will end up that way if we'll let him cut us and we'll let him shape us and we'll let him moce nothing happens by accident there's nothing that happens to you without God allowing it and when he does allow it is for a reason don't Buck against it yield to it and say God whatever you want out of me mold me shape me let me be pable in your hands is that your is that your desire can you lift your hands and just ask God God mold me let my Ministry be your ministry let me be so sensitive to your will Lord oh father I pray Lord that's my prayer as a minister of this church as a pastor here father oh God that's my desire every day Lord but not only for me but for this body of Believers here in this local assembly that Lord that we can be more appliable to your hands that whatever way you want us to be Lord whatever place you put us wherever it is Lord that we can work your will but Lord whatever it is let us be in your will at all times let us be sensitive to the leadership of your spirit father I pray Lord we love you Jesus we thank you Father for your spirit oh isn't he wonderful Church Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh up till there's just no more love I can never ever out love the can would

communion and uh remember those that are are sick some fighting real sickness there and it seemed like it's just going around I guess the weather whatever is is causing it but I know I talk to U Seth
