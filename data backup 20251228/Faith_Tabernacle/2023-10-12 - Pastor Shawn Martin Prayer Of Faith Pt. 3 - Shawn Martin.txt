God's Made A Way amen that you can stand on Holy Ground amen and U it's holy because he's holy he's here and we certainly believe that he's here Among Us and amen and do you love the Lord amen he is so wonderful to us Amen brother Tim it's good to have you sister Teresa God bless you all and um the musicians can be dismissed but it's always good to uh be around the people of God and good to be back home and um had some good Services there and brother Jonathan's and the brothers were greatly used of the Lord and uh people seem to be edified so we thank the Lord for that and uh as it's been said we want to continue to pray for brother baroo and his two sons and really the whole family that the Lord will just help them and give them strength and help the help them to recover and um you know it just seemed like the Lord um really watching over him last night he had um I don't know how many gallons of gas he had um that he was Towing uh baroo and um uh but the um policemen and the Medics you know I guess really kept emphasizing how blessed they were they called it luck lucky but blessed they were that that gas didn't explode and um um didn't go over the vehicle but uh um somehow it it went the opposite direction so the Lord was good good to them and we don't always understand everything but we do know that God has it all in his hands and um it does let us know that you know the turn of events of our life can can happen in a moment's time and uh we must not take life for granted we must not take I think it only just a couple miles from their home and um so you you just you just always want to be prayed up always want to be um you know just um uh ready for whatever the Lord has and and we want to just keep pressing on and uh so uh also we want to remember uh November 5th our fall festival brother Isaac haffield will be ministering for us and uh also uh and if you would like to turn to the Book of James the fth chapter while I'm talking but um uh brother Isaac uh will be ministering for brother Mark Spencer um uh the 3 of November uh so uh be the Friday before he ministers for us and um and so um I'm sure that if you uh can make it you would en enjoy it be blessed and be a blessing there to to uh brother Spencer and uh his church and so um I just keep that in mind there um I have heard great reports of brother Isaac he's just started ministering not too too long ago a year or so and uh a year and a half and uh but I hear he's just really coming right along and so we're just uh looking forward to what God has amen enjoy the songs Tonight uh songs of Victory amen praise the Lord and um I tell you what we ought to be excited about what God has done Lord amen we certainly don't want our uh services to be like a morg amen but uh we're not dead people not dead Christians not don't have a dead religion amen amen but uh this is a resurrected Christ and he's living in US amen before we go into the word let's just our heads and talk to our Lord father truly we're thankful for your blessings blessings upon our life Lord your grace and your mercy that you've bestowed upon us Lord Lord we're So Unworthy and so many times Satan brings up our faults our failures and but Lord all we can say it's by Grace we are what we are by grace and father we're so thankful for it and Lord we're just now asking that if you would take the time Lord to save us by grace and bring us into the message of this hour it gives us a boldness to ask that you would come among us tonight that you would just speak to our hearts Lord and that you would meet every need that is present pray Lord that you would forgive us of all of our sins our failures our compl complains and gripes Lord and help us to always have a Heart of Thanksgiving am trust in you to have the confidence Lord we thank you for all that you do for us and for answering our prayer tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen the Book of James the fifth chapter and we're just going to start at the 14th verse again but it says as any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with all in the name of the Lord and the prayer faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen you can have your seats so I'm going to to continue with this prayer of faith and we read about how powerful the prayer of faith is prayer is important and it's it's a powerful thing it is a weapon that God has placed in every one of our hands and there's one thing about it uh uh uh God will never take your weapon away from you no matter how INS INS significant you feel no matter your back against the wall you must always remember you do have a weapon and that is prayer no matter how how odds how the odds are stacked against you um and how helpless you feel and how impossible the situation that you're in you do have a weapon and that's prayer and prayer changes things and so we we find that uh uh uh Proverbs 15 and8 says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight the 29th verse the Lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of the righteous so prayer is essential to the believer it is the way we communicate to God it is how we make our petition known to God uh but our our prayer must be a prayer of faith and as as we read there it shall save the sick and and if he have committed any sins it shall be forgiven him but the key is the prayer of faith and brother brandom said the prayer of faith brings God's blessings down and so if it does bring the God's blessings down then he said we we must continue to pray NE never let prayer leave leave you uh let it the most important thing because as brother brandom said you can do too many things too too much uh but you can never pray too much and so by praying the the prayer of faith it's it's then we fulfill what Paul says there in Hebrews 4:15 where he said let us come uh let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we might um uh obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need and so when we pray the the prayer of faith then it shows that we are coming boldly Before the Throne of Grace We're we're coming in confidence it's one thing to to come before the throne of grace but Paul would tell us how to approach it and that is to come boldly don't come timidly don't don't come doubting don't don't come in any other way but come boldly come confident and and that is uh praying the prayer of faith and so but if you look uh just prior to to telling us to come boldly Paul gives us the explanation as to why we are to come boldly and and he says we have a great high priest that is passed unto the heavens that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities that's that's that's what Paul is saying amen he's not a high priest that that cannot be touched with with the feeling of our infirmities and and so and then uh there in Hebrews 7 and 24 uh uh he says this man and he's talking about our high priest Jesus Christ this man because he continues forever hath an unchangeable priesthood he says wherefore he is able also to say gave them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercessions for them aren't you glad for that amen see for such an high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those High priests in the natural uh in the Old Testament them men uh uh you know to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples but for this he did once he did it one time when he offered up himself ain't that right so so this this is uh uh uh the the basis that we could pray the prayer of faith and come boldly before the throne of grace is is because the the only way the high priest can make intercession and remember we do have an intercessor that is interceding for us do you believe that he's interceding he's making intercession and but the only way he could do that is there had to be a blood applied there had to be a sacrifice and and and and and and then uh uh uh our high priest and Paul is saying that when he's speaking of this high priest he's saying that this high priest has been accepted by God Amen and not only is he accepted he is our sacrifice the high priest is our sacrifice and he has been accepted by God ain't that right so therefore his his intercession amen is the only thing that can silence the voice of our accuser amen amen and then and that's the truth church amen your good works could not silence the voice of our Accuser amen your your education your talents of whatever we could do could not silence the voice of our accuser but because we have a high priest that become our sacrifice and and he shed his own blood and it's been accepted by God and now he's forever interceding amen to the father for us it actually has the power to silence the the voice of our accuser ain't that right so because of this then we can come boldly before the throne of grace and and and I want to say this that we must not come to God trying to be our our our own intercessor amen it's not that we come to God interceding for our own selves amen um you see the the intercessor it means petition or in treaty in favor of another amen uh uh so so prayer is not to be about us interceding for our own selves in hopes that God uh we get favor from God and God favors us and and therefore God answers you've already got favor with God Amen so your prayer should not be about trying to get God to favor you you've already got an intercessor up there that is interceding for you on your your behalf and because that there is a blood amen there is no way you could get favor from God on your own self but there is a blood that is there that is standing between you and him and any time that he sees you he sees the blood can you sayen because you're under the blood so therefore um uh if we're if we're making intercession for ourselves then it is to be honest it's impossible to pray the prayer of faith and amen because how good can you get who are you who are who am I amen uh uh uh to attain God's favor so we we because we have an intercessor and because we believe that that sacrifice is a perfect sacrifice how many believe that you you have to believe in your sacrifice now if God believes in the sacrifice that he provided for you then you have to believe in it in order to pray the prayer of faith right can you say Amen if we don't believe in it then how are you going to pray the prayer of faith how how can you have faith amen When you pray if you don't believe then you're in the sacrifice that God has provided for you because you'll never get good enough you can you can go to church every day of your life and set even under the message of the hour uh all for a thousand years and you'll still never be good enough you you know this Bible backward and forward you can know the message backward and forward and you'll still never be good enough Amen to to to uh uh appease God but he provided the sacrifice amen already for you amen see so therefore if God didn't make us a a high priest then we mustn't dare try to to make an intercession so to gain God's acceptance ain't that right God supplied the intercessor for you and I he's already Prov provided that and because the intercessor because the sacrifice has been accepted we have already been accepted do you believe that amen we have been accepted it's based upon whether he was accepted it's based upon whether the sacrifice was accepted it's based upon whether the blood was powerful enough to take your sins away and and and and you have to believe that it is you have to believe that the blood has totally Justified you to where you never done it in the first place then you can you can say the prayer of faith can you say Amen it's the only way that we can come boldly before the throne of grace amen Romans 8:31 Paul would tell us what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us now you just think of that if God was for you amen he already show his for you he provided a sacrifice he provided a perfect blood and not only that then he becomes the the the the intercessor so he became man so he could die for you he became a blood amen a substance of blood to where he could shed it on the ground for you amen and pay the penalty for you amen and then he becomes the intercessor amen and he's interceding for you how can man or anything uh if God before us who can be against us can you say amen amen see he spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things can you say Amen so then our prayer shouldn't be a prayer begging if if he if he delivered and raised his son up amen for us all Amen to where you can stand justified in his sight you can stand holy in his sight you can stand free in his sight amen you could be changed from a sinner to a saint in his in his sight amen then how much with him that sacrifice that intercessor amen freely give us all things can you say amen amen see so oh to think of that when if we could ever just really get that into our soul to where it becomes a revelation how much our prayer will change how much our relationship with Christ will change and our fellowship can you say amen amen see he says now who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justif us amen well how can God justify he provided the perfect sacrifice can you say Amen who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again so we're not just focusing upon his death but the same God Amen that died has risen again our sacrifices alive and well Amen to show amen that he paid the price and he is now our intercessor who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us aren't you glad for that 1 John 2 And1 my little children these things I write unto you that you sin not amen and if any man sin we everybody say we we have an advocate amen with the father Jesus Christ the righteous ain't that right amen now notice amen so it's not a license to sin amen as we know that but we're all human the Holy Ghost does not take your Humanity it it doesn't take away them things to where you're just Superman and and and now you just you know uh uh it doesn't do that look look what brother Brown said sometimes when we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into something the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us he's our advocator aren't you glad for that amen God knew who you were God knew all about you but he's ordained you for another life than a sinful life amen but yet he knew that there's a human nature There's a sticky nature you'll always have that sticky nature as long as you live can you say amen that's right but thank God he already had a way provided and now he sent an advocator amen see and he's there he's brother Brown said the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us he stands there he is our etern attorney so he not just our high priest he's not just our sacrifice he's not just whatever amen but now he is our attorney and he stands there and pleads for us amen we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand and he makes intercessions for us that's what the Holy Ghost is he said see when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little you know a fellow and we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sins full of traps full of everything and you say oh I'm afraid to take the Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid can you say amen amen don't be afraid if there's fear there you cannot have faith you've got to take all that fear out and perfect love amen worketh Faith ain't that right Faith worketh by love amen see and so he says Don't Be Afraid we have an advocate amen see oh he stands by us he's in us and he makes intercessions for us the Holy Spirit constantly everybody say constantly he is constantly making an advocate for us all the time when you're asleep he's making Advocate amen when the devil's uh you know pounding your mind with bad dreams or whatever he's making an advocate amen when the spirit I I was thinking of uh someone's telling me the other night he said you know he say I I I couldn't sleep and he says uh he says you know my baby was was was in the room with us and and and he said I couldn't sleep but he he says during the night say something he said I he said I don't know what it was I can't tell you what it was he said I just saw something dark form come across that room he said an evil present come across that room and went to my baby and all of a sudden that baby starts screaming and and and crying and he says I don't know what that was I said I'll tell you what it was it was a spirit trying to work and get to you amen through that baby and you know but you don't have to fear that thing none of us has to fear that old stupid devil can you sayen but it's in them times we've got an advocate he's making intercession for us constantly you think you could whip the devil on your own there is no absolutely no way that we could whip the devil on our own there is absolutely no way that we could actually overcome that stupid devil on our own with our carnal flesh but there is an advocate amen and he's living inside of his children and his at intercession his his Advocate is far greater than what the devil can do so so because we have an advocate the prophet said we have mercy aren't you glad for Mercy amen because we have an advocate and so he our Advocate stands in our place amen see so then getting back to this prayer a fath see Faith then our faith stands in the finished work of Calvary it does not stand on what we do it's not on our ability it's not on our talents it does not stand it is based on the finished work of Calvary can you say amen amen see when Jesus hung on the cross he cried out it is finished amen what powerful words amen then just wasn't just something he just said amen and and then just gave up The Ghost and amen like he just well I can't breathe anymore it's finished you know amen it wasn't that he was saying it's finished sin is finished brother random said see we were saved then we were healed then we were delivered then when he said it is finished the power of Satan's was broken amen every tactic the devil amen could put up the church and put up Humanity it was broken amen that's right see Amen brother Brown said when he said it was finished all that God required had been fully paid at Calvary there was no other man that could say it is finished when he died and have an effect on them words but when Jesus died and said it is finished you were loose then even though you wasn't even born yet but every sin every habit every Temptation every evil thing amen was finished it was broken over your life can you say Amen brother BR said in the sight of God it's all over when Jesus said it is finished that's when to God it was over it's finished it's over can you say Amen so our life the Christian life isn't based upon trying and pleasing and and hoping and grasping it's finished you've got to have faith in the finished work of cowy ain't that right brother Brown say there's nothing not nothing can be uh said there can be nothing else added to it nothing else can be taken from it that settles it the Bible is finished the plan of God is finished the atonement is made the devil is defeated and the only thing we have to do is look and live why it is finished can you say Amen so what happened when Jesus died and was risen again he done it for you and I to redeem us amen and brother rown said he redeemed us to every promise he made so then we we see that healing is a promise of God ain't that right therefore Jesus Christ redeemed us to it salvation is a promise of God therefore Jesus Christ redeemed us to it Deliverance is a is a promise of God and Christ redeemed us to it amen uh Heaven it is a promise of God and Christ redeemed us to it that's why through all of the troubles and the tribulations that is coming upon this Earth we have a hope can you say Amen oh my don't let your faith don't let your prayer be defeated when you're seeing what's happening in the world and the chaos don't pray a defeated prayer when things ain't looking great amen you've been redeemed to every promise in this book been redeemed the Millennium is a promise of God the new Heaven and new earth is a promise of God and Christ Jesus redeemed you to it amen see and and now you know what the message of the hour is to us you know what that is you know what the message is it's a pardon remember brother BR talking about that you know where where the boy that that that he he he ran from war they caught him they going to kill him they tried him it's going to kill him and his friend went to the President Abraham Lincoln and and said please have mercy and so when when he heard the story and all that Abraham Lincoln was moved and but he was in a hurry so he just grabbed a piece of paper and he wrote you know pardon the boy sent he he now he become the messenger and he he he takes the message to the boy that's about to die and says looky here you got some hope you're going to live I got I got it right here at your pardon he's showing the message he's proclaiming a message amen it wasn't his message it was President's message it wasn't him pardon it was the United the president of the United States pardoning but the boy wouldn't believe it right amen so so we all know the story see so this message amen that God has sent to us in this age wasn't a prophet's message it came from God himself amen you're pardoned you're free can you say amen amen see and then what to show his pardoning grace to us God has come down in this age to show that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen not in a body that he was in in in in two 2,000 years ago that he come in a redeemed body to show that you are redeemed to show that you truly have been pardoned he comes down in a people amen and shows that he's the same amen he has done the same signs the same works that he did back when he walked the Earth and even brother Brown said he's had greater success in my Ministry than his own Amen to show that the pardon really worked Amen to show that Calvary really worked that God could take he didn't have to take a word born body Amen to become God again and to show himself through Humanity he could take a redeemed born body a sex born body and redeem that body amen through the calvary and to show that Calvary really worked he could come into that body and have greater success yes sir he has been able to show that he is the same in every way praise the Lord yes in every way except the the the Corporal body amen this is why John 14:12 says verely verely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it can you sayen why how could he say that we have been pardoned we have been pardoned aren't you glad you're pardoned yes sir John 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me but you see me because I live you shall live also see and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you and and it's this day and so what come to us what what what come to us it was quickening power that come to us what's in US quickening power ain't that right amen showing that Redemption had taken place and the blood had had its effect Calvary had an effect can you say amen amen see so uh brother abam said see notice God's life which is in the Greek called Zoey moving through them and in them quickening their minds to his word yep you see the spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God Amen see that's what he's doing today that's why he's living inside of you amen not to condemn you not to drive you from the promises of God that is of the devil amen but if God is in you he comes to Quicken you to the promise of the word that was the whole point of him dying can you say amen amen see amen that's the only way we can pray a prayer of faith amen you can't pray a prayer of faith listening to the devil no sir you can't you can't pray the prayer of faith amen listen to all them mind battles and and in the dumps and hello Church the Holy Ghost comes not only to be your Advocate but to Quicken the word to you Quicken your mind to the word so God God if you look God is the one who made the Covenant in the first place Lord that's what the word is it's it's a covenant amen it's Bible the Old Testament and the New Testament it's covenants old Covenant New Covenant and God made an an an unconditional Covenant and and when he he he made that Covenant he made it with himself he swore by himself that he would he would bring that Covenant to pass do you believe that and and and so you could read about it where he showed it in Abraham when when he made that Covenant with Abraham he had Abraham to take the kill animals and then divide them animals in in and haves and and and and and you know the story of how they make covenants back then they would two men make that Covenant they'd write that Covenant out and they would stand between these dead animals and they would say well you know they one would make his pledge his Covenant and the other one make his side of the Covenant and then they say you know if we fail to keep the Covenant then may we be as these dead at these dead animals you know and then they would rip that Covenant and one would keep part of it and the other would keep part of it and they would set a date of of to come back amen and they would put that that Covenant together and and and read the Covenant and both of them would have had to have met that Covenant they're they're into the bargain but when God made the Covenant he put Abraham to sleep Abraham he put Abraham out of it didn't want Abraham showing Abraham this has nothing to do with you it has everything to do with me and the Bible says that that little light that flicker of light that Pillar of Fire moved not just on one part but it began to move all through them sacrifices showing that he would keep not only his end of the bargain he would keep our end of the bargain as well can you sayen amen see and so so we find that that one part of the Covenant that God had made was fulfilled in Christ Jesus amen he promised to redeem he promised to re restore he promised to bring us back he promised everything every promise is in him yay and amen there is nothing negative in Christ Jesus everything was fulfilled can you say Amen but now God is here on this Earth amen he's here fulfilling the other part of his covenant not through a a physical Corporal body of Jesus Christ but now it's Christ in you fulfilling that other part of the Covenant and as Jesus could not fail you can't fail Hallelujah I hope it brings your faith up as Christ could not fail you can't fail can you say Amen see we were as attributes as we've talked about here for a while we we were as attributes to begin with attributes of his thinking and never one time never one time we did it cross God's thoughts amen of us being powerless and defeated and helpless puppets to the devil that was never in his thoughts we were never Amen to be such a thing can you say amen amen but millions and millions and millions and billions of years if we could say it that way before the world was formed God thought of you to be his servant God thought of you to be his sons and daughters God thought of you to be a powerful Army amen God well you you hear the talking about a people being a super race a super Church well that was only God's thoughts amen of what he thought before you ever become into existence before the world was ever formed he was thinking of a super race of a super church can you say amen amen and he would create the worst enemy that could ever be amen and yet he would see that church triumphant over that enemy he would know that there would be a Dark Age an Eden of Satan and it would be the worst that it could ever possibly be and yet he's picture he thought of a bride rising up to be a super race a super Army in this age an invincible Army that the devil don't know what to do with it was in this age he never thought of you to be defeated he thought of his blood he thought of that intercessor he thought of everything that could raise us up and he promised and he saw him living inside of us defeating his own enemy can you say amen he thought of you to be a son and daughter and he spoke a word he spoke a word concerning you on now spoke a word hallelujah amen but as we said before you didn't come into this world like what he spoke you come into this world a different way can you say man because you're mortal Satan was already looked like Satan had the advantage but God actually had the advantage because he spoke his word before you ever become in sin before you ever become a mortal before you ever become a slave to the enemy before you ever took on an adamic nature a sinful nature a corrupt mind God already spoke a word concerning you amen hallelujah brother Ram said you might have gotten felt religious decide to join a church having that sinfulness nature he said but then you got under the right the atmosphere of God and he said you get under that atmosphere of God you're bound to recognize who your father is like the little Eagle recognized who his mother was see only you are God's attribute can you say I am God's attribute I am only you are God's attributes that's become a word spoken and then the holy SP Spirit seeks that word out not seeking your talents not seeking your ability not seeking your smarts how good you are and educated no no no there was a word that was spoken before the foundation of the world now the Bible says uh uh what is it the foundation of God standeth sure the Lord knoweth them that are his so he's already established you before the foundation world now the Holy Ghost comes seeking you out and not seeking just you he's seeking that word out there a promised word concerning you brother Bal I know you might have had a rough life and you might have had everything going against you but somewhere the Holy Ghost found you because there was a word inside of you that God saw you triumphant God saw you overcoming God saw you if there's ever time in your life that you become an overcomer is when God sought you out amen and he CAU that word and that word becomes quickened in you and all of a sudden you start Rising above all the you start Rising above all the critics you start Rising above everything else amen you lived a defeated life we lived a defeated life we were born defeated in the first place but we'll never die defeated we'll never end defeated we are the Conqueror because he saw us to be that way he saw us to be that way so the prophet said see the Holy Spirit called you and gave you everlasting life and brought you into the presence of God God's word and he says when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he spoke of now if you're not you'll wander frustrate run here and there and everything else you'll never come to the knowledge of truth but if you're one of those the old things pass away right quick and you become new and the Plan of Salvation is finished you glad for that you say but I'm not where I need to be the Plan of Salvation A's finished amen it's done you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of Pentecost can you say Amen so I as we go here I want to say this that pray our prayer to God is not about giving God new information that he can compute in his mind as though we would comp you know type in information in our computers and things and save it and all these things but but prayer is not us uh giving God new information concerning the things that we have need of uh Matthew 6:7 Jesus said when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathens do uh for for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking see be ye not therefore like unto them for your father everybody say my father see your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask amen him amen so then even though God knows what we have need of then again we the the the human mind says well then why do I pray if he knows if he knows I'm in this bad shape if he knows that the enemy is about to kill me if he knows you know I don't think I can make it anymore he knows it where's he at well it's in you to pray amen because here and we've we've read it before we talked about it but he he wants us as redeemed Sons to talk to him and ask him amen before be he this is his law be as as redeemed Sons and Daughters before he can supply the need you got to ask him and it's scriptural Matthew 9:37 Jesus said that he's talking to his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few so he's already telling them the need they even didn't know the need he knew the need he's telling them the need but now what does he do pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his well brother brand said he was the lord of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest is telling his disciples what is needed and now he's saying you pray to me that I will send forth the the laborers can you say amen and brother BR said well why does he do that because the kingdom of God lays within you the kingdom of God lays within you brother Bob the kingdom of God plays within you we're talking about redeemed Sons and Daughters of God God now you think of how positive how positive he is in in his works of Calvary that he would ask us to speak it yeah and our words he acts upon all right praise the Lord so is this not what the adoption of sons is about amen Luke 12:32 Jesus says fear not little flock fear not there's that word fear not for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom ain't that right so then we are Sons and Daughters of God who have been placed in a position of authority so then our prayer isn't just an utterance of words but it's a prayer of power and authority right ask what you will and it sh be done unto you that's can you say Amen so why how does that make it happen What wh my words my little feeble words I struggle with praying I struggle with what what words to say my little old feble words has power yes because the blood of Jesus Christ makes it possible the blood of Jesus Christ makes it possible that when you utter your little feeble words God hears them amen that's the trth yes Revelations 51 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wet much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on so what was it John was looking at a sealed book of redemption and brother Brown said he cried because if that book was not taken out of the hand of the original owner where it had been lost by Adam and Eve and went back after they had forfeited their rights of the word their the promises their inheritance think of that they forfeit it they had the word they had the power to make it come to pass and they forfeited that power they for fored their promises they forfeited their inheritance everything for forfeited and it went back into the hands of the owner not into the hands of the Devil he's a squatter can you say man brother Brown said see remember they controlled the Earth he was an amateur God for he was a Son of God and a son of God is an amateur God ain't that right so can can I can I ask you what made man an amateur God what made him an amateur God the same thing that made the prophets Gods remember remember Jesus called the prophets Gods the Bible calls them Gods to whom the word of the Lord came amen the word came to the prophets ain't that right and the word coming to the prophets made them Gods yes sir it's true true and man in the beginning had the word and him having the word made him God over the Earth an amateur God can you say man man being a Son of God was part of his father God ain't that right brother Brown said see When sin came in we found out that man crossed the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but it did not remit see until the real bleach that blood y'all remember brother BR talking about the blood being the bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon its original perverter that was Satan ain't that right and he says I believe that sin will be broke up now he's talking about Millennium amen and and the new where where Satan will not be there there will not be a mind battle there will not be a habit there will not be an evil thing amen you'll actually you worship God here lifting up holy hands with mind battles and with aches and the pains and sometime when we raise our hands our shoulders are hurting our hands are numb amen we're aching in our body we've got a headache running the fever and and the mind battles and the plague of of Satan just tormenting us but there will come a time when sin will be no more he will be completely annihilated there will be no such thing as a devil anymore you think of that now he says I believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a a a a drop of Black Ink in a bunch of clorex bleach he said see it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it Plum back to where it came from that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does notice then that sets a man across the chasm again as a Son of God do you believe that Hallelujah he said see then he becomes he said why he said even he's he said the creative power of God is in him and at least whenever God can command it to be done it will be done why the chasm is gone think of it there used to be a Chasm between you and godess Lord Wonder no relationship no understanding no comprehension of him but when he come and he drop Dro that bleach upon you that blood God it removes the chasm praise the Lord now you come to understanding you come there's nothing there to stop you you're back to being sons of God again Lord can you say Amen why because of the blood of Jesus Christ now notice Moses under the blood of bulls and goats spoke and even created things by the word of the Lord ain't that right he did it but how did he do it under the blood of bulls and goats think of that one brother Brown said now if it'll do that under the blood of bulls what about the blood of Jesus Christ see the blood of bulls and goats could not remit sins it only covered the sin and yet under that natural blood of that animal Moses having having the word could speak a creative word and bring flies and bring this and bring that into existence under that type of a blood what can the church do see not covered but remitted it all together you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son the church is far beyond its standard of living notice that there's something wrong somewhere in the churches he says and I think it's the denominational systems that's Twisted the people's mind and so forth until they don't know how to do it aren't you glad to be in the message of the hour the Lord why as we quoted the quote several times now brother Brian says the the prophet of Malachi 4 is to restore the faith and what does he say change the minds of the people why bringing them back to what Adam was the denominations has twisted our minds the Creeds and their unbelief and their doubts and the human efforts and and the exaltation of personality and humanity and all that has Twisted the mind minds of the people that God would send a prophet to change our minds yes sir amen he said that's right but we're promised that it'll be revealed now the churches have lost connection or the answer on how to bring the people back to what God has called them to be so now he says we find out that in the revealing of the seals that the lamb had left his mediatorial work as an intercessor and had come forth now to claim his rights all that he had Redeemed by his death what has he done in this day to claim his rights amen yes sir are you his rights you bet you are this Earth Is His rights and you are his rights go go go listen to the Future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly [Applause] bride the L had left his mediatorial work as an intercessor and has come forth now to claim his rights all that he had Redeemed by his death no one could open the book no one understood it it was a book of redemption and God the Father the spirit had it in his hand because Christ was at the throne as a mediator the only mediator there could be no saint no Mary no Joseph nothing else on that altar because it was blood and only the blood of Jesus Christ could make the atonement so nothing else could be standing as a mediator there was nothing else am so he said see in another place John was weeping he couldn't find nobody in Earth in heaven C all was on the other side of the chasm oh was see a sin see there was no man an angel of course he'd be worthy but after all it had to be a kinsman redeemer it had to be human being and there was no such a thing see because every man had been born by sex and and had taken it took one to uh to uh uh to be born without it see so God himself took that in the Virgin birth and become Emanuel and his blood uh was the the one that was worthy and when he crossed this Chasm himself paid the price and then he bridged way for the rest of us then he sat down to be a mediator and he's been sitting there can you say Amen but notice he didn't just build a bridge and and and we're walking across the bridge and looking down and seeing this Chasm no no no no in Place brother Brown said he took the chasm away yes sir prise the Lord so you ain't walking across the bridge thinking oh my goodness you know we go with Royal Gorge there in Colorado it's a th000 ft down you know and it's it's it's a bridge built you know with wood and it's got gaps that when you're walking you can look down and it's thousand feet and my wife's was scared to death you know because you're thinking oh no cuz some of them boards are like a little cracked and a little bit this a little chipped and they're old boards you know but I got to thinking about this Chasm that Heen we we're not walking Something That We're scared of that oh my it might fall there is no Chasm it's done you're so secured you can't fail Lord now what good is it though to be redeemed and not have the word the Lord the blood made a way for us to come back to God it done away with the chasm that separated us there is no Chasm now the word everybody say the word word has been restored to us the word it the book that Adam forfeited That's right The Inheritance that Adam forfeited has now been given to us Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel come down with an open book and the prophet said the seven Angel is on the earth at the same time and he hands that book to the seventh angel that he could reveal the book to the people what restoring the word to the people can you say Amen that you wouldn't speak what a denomination told you you would speak the word like Adam gave that's good word restored can you say Amen now we can pray a prayer of faith that's good praise the Lord now that the word has been restored it's time for the manifestation of Sons Sons of God right it's time for the sons of God redeemed Sons to speak with authority brother Bri said notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen of the Father the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ so will be bright amen so will the bride before that Harmony could come the word had to be restored to you amen the word had to be restored to us and then we come in agreement with that word you see what the devil's trying to do he's trying to do what he done to Eve but the prophet said it'll never happen you're not that type of woman you will not Surrender Your your rights that's right you will not forfeit this book you will not for forfeit your Authority amen instead you'll use that Authority you'll speak the word of God and what Adam failed to do you're doing it can you say Amen so will the bride he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again he says then I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret the word word is in the bride in the bride the word is in that redeemed Sons and Daughters the word not only have you been restored the chasm has been taken away and you're restored to Fellowship he's handed you the book the word is now in The Bride Can you say amen and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has the sayith the Lord did she get thus sayith the Lord outside of a prophet absolutely not for the for the Bible says the spirit and the bride say come and the prophet said the spirit the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing whatever the the spirit says the prophet says whatever the prophet says the bride Echoes that's right good she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it is gered so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves his purpose that word that you speak the Holy Spirit Waters it yes sir can you say amen amen they do only his will yeah think of that that's why you know I telling the church over there oh that's why you know we we as ministers don't get discouraged in the sense that we just give up on the message we we don't we don't we don't dictate our sermons and all that based upon what we see of you amen we we we don't allow this message you you your faults and your failures and your incapabilities brother Tim to dictate the sermons we preach it with everything that we got what are we preaching promise promise promise why because I know that the holy spirit will go out there and water it water it and that word will start growing and the word will start growing and as you receive the word you begin to overcome this and overcome that and overcome that you begin to take your rightful position can you say man it's not in vain your prayer is not in vain no no man it's not in vain they do only his will they have thus say the Lord to keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his day all things when he was here then he says he did not complete all when he was here for it was not yet time can you say Amen it was not all yet time but it is time it is time he done his part of the Covenant now it's him doing his other part in you you love him I love think of where we're standing today Moses could speak the word and watch you create under the blood of bulls and goats about it and yet the blood of bulls and goats could not take away the sins of the people so much it could not take way that adultery when when a child was born illegitimate in in adultery that child nor his seed could not come into the congregation of the Lord the righteous think of that could not come into a church right for 10 10 Generations 10 generations and a generation is 40 years so 400 years that's true now you think that could you imagine being in the middle of that generation and you can't come because of what you're great great great great great about it and yet under that Blood Brother Brown said see there was nothing there strong enough to forgive that sin the blood of the Old Testament did not forgive sins it covered sins but the blood of Jesus Christ divorces it that's different now can you say Amen but yet Moses was a able to speak a creative word under that blood now notice the word of God spoken through Moses the Creator because under the blood he was standing in the presence of God and his own words wasn't his word now notice John 15:7 Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you that's right showing that there is no Chasm if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask whatever you will praise the Lord can you say amen and it shall be done you see God wants us to ask you believe that amen John 15 and5 Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit brother brah said see the vine can't bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit God cannot not bear fruit of himself it's got to take the church amen it's got to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth you see what I mean God wants your hands God wants your eyes he wants your tongue your lips your ears your hands feet so that he can bring forth fruit into you so God wants us to make our petition known in prayer yeah see but we are to pray the prayer of faith amen Now give me just a few more minutes and then I'll let you go 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 Paul says and I was with you in weakness and fear and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but in what demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God ain't that right so where is our faith supposed to stand it isn't to stand in the letter of the word hello 2 Corinthians 3:6 the letter kth but the spirit giveth life our faith isn't to stand in just a lecture of the word I looked up word lecture it's a talk given before an audience or class especially for instruction to give a formal often extended talk on a subject brother Bram said we couldn't find him in fine lectures because we find people who can stand up and explain the word in such a way it's just breathtaking but when we find it it's still still a lecture just a lecture it's the mechanics and we find the Entertainer who can go through all the actions and so forth but that still is isn't it see that isn't what we're looking for we we find the religious top with the robes on and so forth but that still isn't what we're looking for can you say Amen see we don't want your faith to stand in a history lesson of what Calvary was or what Jesus Christ was or what David did and Moses did and and all of these things see and we do not want it to stand in the wisdom of men ain't that right amen Faith isn't to stand in the psychic side of the Bible where brother Brown said you only understand what he did back in Years Gone by can you say Amen but see your faith is to stand in the demonstration and the power of God so when you to pray the prayer of faith then you have to believe in the Supernatural side of the word not in the psychic part of the word where you understand this word mentally but you see it supernaturally that this word that we talk about there is a reality to it and you say amen amen Divine Healing is so unusual to the people till they don't know what well brother BR said they don't want to believe in it and yet yet it's a promised word ain't that right see and and he says we have seen in this day what we have seen is so unusual to the human mind uh who has never thought of it in the way that it has come it's so unusual but yet it's in the promised word amen ain't that right see when Jesus raised from the dead it was so unusual to so many people even to the people that loved him and believed him to be a prophet and believed him to be the Son of God yet but the the the resurrection was just too much for them to believe because it was just too much of a phenomenon can you say Amen brother brand said you take anything that's really way out in the phenomena like that always check it with the word can you say Amen don't so so then then there's your balance don't just anything that is done Supernatural you know you see the guy blow and you know and people fall over check it with the word you know when you see them waving and everybody just falls out you know I was watching a little bit of that preacher you know last night and uh seeing if you steal r and oh he's still around you know and he just you know and they just fall pick him up pick him up hurry hurry hurry up you know and he's so he he is so nervous and radical he's pushing even the guys that are helping him get over here pick them up you know then he do it again them guys are just check it with the word word check everything with the word can you say Amen but the word has phenomenon the word has the phenomenal side to it do you believe that he said if if the word promised it and he says see always check it with the word but if the word promised it then it's only God Rising on the scene again and that's the way every promise is can you say Amen so see when God promised God promised he would raise Jesus up on the third day do you believe that David said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to seek corruption see so Jesus understood the scripture he understood that that scripture pertained to him and he even told his Skeptics destroy this Temple and within 3 days I'll raise it up again why he understood it his faith was in the scripture but it wasn't just in the word it was in the phenomenon of that word it was a promise it was impossible to the human mind for him to raise he was a man that was crucified he died as a man true his spear a spear was drove right through his heart he bled out every ounce of blood was drained from him he took him and sealed him in a tomb where the Romans seal the prophet said and rode a stone over the opening but he rose again amen just as the scripture said he would exactly he rose again and he knew he would amen What Faith Can you say amen he did Brother Braham said it takes the same kind of phenomena when people thinks he's died that settled it 1900 years ago and here he is today after 1900 years he's still Among Us just as much as he was then just as real as he was then doing the same things he did then and it's too much of a phenomenon the people can't understand it it goes beyond their reasoning can you say amen he said many didn't see it in Jesus day because they hadn't searched the scriptures they hadn't listened to what he had said and he said many today hasn't listened to the message hasn't listen to the scripture and what Christ has promised in these last days that's the reason that people are in the condition that they're in and the churches are all gummed up among one another see they haven't noticed what the scripture said for this day they they didn't notice what these things had notice these things had to be done it's just fulfilling of the scripture many people love him many people believe in him but yet it's too phenomena see they can't understand it when you talk about him being just the same as he was yesterday doing the same things they claim they believe that but when it takes place they don't understand it see they just can't believe it but God wants your faith to stand in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost the word is being fulfilled today amen but where is it being fulfilled at in you in you in you can you say amen I believe and you have to believe in that your faith must stand there not in what Joshua did calling the son to stand still what about your words amen you say well if he'll move upon me maybe I can speak to the storms what about when you get into prayer you start praying the prayer of faith there's no greater weapon on this Earth than prayer if the musicians will come Gooding praise the Lord you love the Lord amen hallelujah thank God for this word no greater no greater than prayer he heareth the prayer of the righteous that's true from the wicked he's far away but he's n to them that call upon him that's what the Bible says he's nigh unto them that call upon him aise the Lord why because the word now has come to you yes it's in your mouth what what you say shall be amen wonderful may not be speaking the storm out of existence may not be creating squirrels but you got a promise about your [Music] children I believe it you got to promise that he supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory you got a promise that whatever you ask it shall be given you you got a promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much amen can you say amen amen you Lov him hallelujah what song All faith in God can move the mighty Mountain faith can and call our trou SE faith can make
