Lord amen amen good to be here in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the uh uh book of Hebrews and uh also brother Joe Green uh is having his annual meeting started

Friday night so amen but got a few scriptures here that we'd like to read uh Hebrews uh 6 and 13 I'll start there and uh but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the author of the word Our Father Lord Jesus how thankful we are to gather here this evening Lord um real realizing that we just ain't got too much longer and father we want to make every minute count just hearing your Prophet speak and telling the people to to to make things count and father we don't want to take things for granted we don't want to take our meeting here for granted our liberties to worship you and to be a Christian Lord we don't want to take these things for granted but I pray father that while we're here that you would come and that you would Minister your word to us father anoint uh both speaker and hearer you alone know the needs not only here in the the building but maybe to those that are watching online I pray father that you would touch them Father this Youth Camp that is coming up as brother Nathan has asked all the pastor Lord to to be praying and have their congregations to pray and father we just asking that you would be with that Youth Camp be with the youth Lord and Speak Lord anoint the ministry father May Souls be touched and delivered and father those that are needing the Holy Ghost father may you feel them whatever it would be father but Lord may it be just a super natural work among them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen um so Hebrews the 6th chapter we're going to start at the 13th verse for when God made promise to Abraham because he swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of promise now think of that The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath then if you'll turn with me to the book of Ephesians the um first chapter amen book of Ephesians the um first chapter and um going to read um start at the third verse Blessed Be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ and to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance everybody say we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will then if you'll turn with me uh before we have your seats um Romans the 8th chapter amen Romans chapter 8 and I want to start at the 16th verse Romans 8 and6 the spirit itself witness with our spirit that we are the children or sons of God God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen you can have your seats this evening and I have uh I guess directly or indirectly uh been dealing with us laying claim to our inheritance by the word in our mouths and um the the Apostle Paul we've read the scripture uh uh before but the Apostle Paul tells us that the word is in our mouth and uh and and that word that is in our mouth is the word of faith which has been preached which has been declared so then this makes it a confession uh the word that is in our mouth is is a confession and of course confession is to save the same thing that has already been declared and so but Paul would tell us that not only is the word of faith in our mouth but it's also in our heart and and so now this means uh that our heart must be settled upon the word of God just as it was with Caleb uh uh when you know the 10 spies uh went out and and uh uh they gave an evil report but Caleb wouldn't listen to that report he he kept his heart settled upon the word of God that the prophet had given and so uh uh the scriptures are opening scriptures stand out to me uh uh uh in in many ways and and I just the things that have stood out to me uh is is Heirs of Promise uh that that is a word that that Paul would use Heirs of Promise Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ uh our inheritance the dispensation of the fullness of times the glory which shall be revealed in US these scriptures are speaking of these things the glory which shall be revealed in us which reminds me of the scripture uh of Hagi uh 2 and9 that says the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former sayth the Lord of hosts amen and so all of these statements that I've just read to you uh that Paul mentions it has to do with us it's it's we we we can no longer put them in an age uh uh uh prior or an age uh to come but uh uh it has to do with us for we are the final the final voice us to the final age there's no other age to come there's no promises um that uh uh are given to another people uh that speak of a bride because there's no other age it's it's it's us and and and and we we are it another thing that stands out is is Paul would mention the manifestation of the sons of God that all creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation what what do we mean by the manifestation of sons brother brandham says it's when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed amen there that it comes a time that it it's it's we're separated from just being church member and religious and doing Christian duties and all of that but it it's it it comes when our word when we speak a word our word is backed by almighty God Amen see and so we're we're see we're we're no longer speaking as a servant but we are speaking as sons of God brother BR says say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ well I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen say there's a manifestation amen oh brother my crops are burning up out yonder I haven't had any rain well I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord that's not a prophet saying these things amen it's it's sons of God that that have come into the position of authority I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God see bless your crop see all waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the son Son of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man the domain he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with this assurance ask the father anything in my name and I will do it ain't that right well see so so these scriptures are standing out to us amen because we are living in the Fulfillment of them not just teaching them not just educating it being educated into them amen uh uh but but fulfilling the scriptures we are the people to fulfill these scriptures amen they've never been fulfilled as it is today this is the time this is the age you see uh you remember that those who make up the bride are the elected everybody say the elected amen if you're part of the Bride then you're elected and if you're elected then you are predestinated for this you're predestinated to this and and and and the ones that are in the bride amen uh are ones the prophet said who can recognize their place in the Kingdom amen that's that's the people that we are we're recognizing our place in the Kingdom we're not Beggars we're not Vagabond we are sons of God Amen and scriptures mean uh uh mean for us amen they they they uh for us to make them live they these are the things that are sharing us up as the as the Church of the Living God what makes the sun hang out in midair what makes the Moon and and everything stay in its orbit and and in its place they do it by the word of God and that same word is now holding us secure amen and we're recognizing in our place in the Kingdom you see Caleb recognized his place he recognized the time he was living in he recognized what his inheritance was and and so the bride is recognizing her position the prophet said in the word amen she's recognizing her position in the word and it's what is putting her in her place her recognizing her position in the world is what is putting her in her place amen see he says the spirit of God which is the word of God he said my word is spirit and life so the spirit is the word of God Amen will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ and will put her in her place aren't you glad for that amen politics ain't going to put you in your place government ain't going to put you in your place religion will not put you in your place amen but God would send a prophet uh in this hour Amen to divinely reveal the word amen and as Joshua did so is this ministry amen imparting the scriptures that pertain to us in this hour and we're recognizing our position in the word of God Amen recognizing our position I thought in the message in things that are to be brother brandham said we now feel the strange call of God to go to this great Eden how many feels that great that great strange call it's it's a strange call but but it's a call nonetheless that is pulling us to this great Eden we know we know that we're here we we see the signs we we see the things that are happening in the world and and I don't I don't think that that this thing these things are I don't know who's going to be president but I I can tell you this right now that every prophecy that brother Bram spoke of a woman being president and being cruel and being mean and and bringing this nation down to ruin amen it could very well be amen within uh uh the uh be ffield amen within just a few months from now amen everything is pointing to the end time amen and if that be the case then and we can see this and the world can see that there's trouble on every side then there is a bride upon this earth that is not just looking at that amen and being found in her position by that she is finding her position by the scriptures and prophecy that speak of her for this day and this age you see we have lived out the justification age the sanctification Age and and the Pentecostal age brother Bram says we are now living in the age of adoption we are now living in the age of adoption this is the age when God can pour into us his fullness not just aart not just having a little dip of God Amen like the other ages they had a dip of the holy spirit that God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close to together till Christ becomes visible in your flesh Among Us and raises the dead and we go into the Rapture aren't you glad for that you see he didn't pour out his fullness amen into the people in 1906 amen which started the Le osia Pentecostal age amen see and and and if he would have pulled amen poured his fullness in in in uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Pentecostal age well then it would have brought on the manifestation of the sons of God Amen you see the sons of God cannot amen uh uh be manifested without adoption and 1906 the baptism of the Holy Ghost did not bring uh uh the sons of God into adoption amen yes sir amen so now notice the prophet said the last thing the last thing this is after 1906 the Pentecostal age and all the ages the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire Falls now I don't know I I believe that it's happening everywhere I I just believe that amen and and I choose not to look at yesterday and I choose not to look at tomorrow and say it's going to come tomorrow I believe that we're living in the Day present tense can you say amen amen see so God isn't just satisfied with us and just being a Pentecostal and acting Pentecostal and carrying on the Pentecostal tradition and the Pentecostal ways and and all of these things there's got to become a manifestation of sons of God that's our duty that's what we have been predestinated for amen and this is the time amen you see we're living in a time where the church is being positionally placed amen the prophet said where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church aren't you glad for that see so the manifestation comes the manifestation of the sons of God comes when Christ and his church unite they become one they they they they blend together that's that's what amen when we we're not needing the Corporal body the physical Corporal body to come to Earth God's got your body amen and everything that God was he poured in to Christ and everything that Christ was he is now pouring into the church which is his body can you say amen amen see and so uh uh then we find that this manifestation of sons of God then is the Fulfillment amen of of Luke 17:30 the son of man being revealed yes the son of man was revealed in brother bram's time amen but it did not stop it did not end amen and and like one individual told me years ago said brother Sean we're not in the son of man we're back in the Son of God well brother R never taught that it's that's never been the case it's not true we are still in that son of man son of man being revealed in in a bride body amen see he says see when this son is adopted into his own family from then on Amen from then on this son is given power amen well it didn't happen in in ausa Street it didn't happen amen All Through the Ages amen this is the time of adoption no no other age no other time is it for the sons of God to be manifested outside of this time that's what a prophet said see it had to wait till this time and so when this son is adopted into his own family from then on this son is given power he's gifted then his names just as good as uh his father's is on the check because he's the boss think of that now you're not the victim you're the boss amen you're not a slave to the devil you're the boss amen that's what that's what this manifestation of sons of God have it means see he's the boss he's over the straw bosses because God see God gives him things that none of the straw bosses know nothing about because he's a son and I want to say this uh there there's a lot of people don't understand what we preach and and and and they don't understand why we believe the way we believe amen but listen church amen that Revelation is what's giving you a power Amen to become what God wants you to be amen that that no one else is going to understand this but it's bringing you to your position in Christ Jesus yes sir see and we ought to count it Grace that God would bring us into this message amen count it a blessing amen it's the grace of God that God would bring us into this and allow us to to to listen to what a prophet says and not only to listen but to believe what a prophet said amen and to live what a prophet said and that word becoming flesh in US amen yes sir now you see Abraham he he went through the same process as the church has uh uh has gone through uh he went through justification by faith election that's in Genesis 12 chapter 12 which represents the Lutheran age amen the next thing was sanctification by the blood sanctification by the blood to the seed the prophet said uh uh which represented the the West in age Genesis 15 uh uh uh that's where the sanctification took place for Abraham amen then the prophet said then in his weak condition Abraham Drew see from God's Own Strength by Nursing From A Promise see uh Genesis 17 you find that which represents the Pentecostal age see in his weak condition Abraham Drew from God's Own Strength by Nursing From A promise the prophet said he was nursing God's Own Strength into him taking God's Own Strength into the church see the Pentecostal age which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen But Then There came the adoption the time for adoption now brother Braham says Abraham was adopted amen which was a type of you and I today amen he his life amen the stages that he went through it represented Lutheran age wesle age and the Pentecostal age but then that last thing was adoption see and this see the and and and the prophet said the sun always falls air to to The Inheritance see see the placing of a sun everybody say the placing of a sun see the sun always falls air to the inheritance this is why Paul says if Sons then hirs you can't be a son of God and not an heir of God Amen if Sons then heirs can you say Amen so if he has in inheritance if there has been an inheritance left amen then he is an heir amen Well church and if you would take God has left us such an inheritance it it's incredible amen the prophet preaching on things that are to come a or that are to be talking of an inheritance it's it's it's our inheritance the future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom that's an inheritance amen this Rapture and the changing of our bodies what an inheritance that we have we're heirs can you say Amen you realize brother brandom says that if you are an heir amen then then you can look at sickness and tell that thing to go amen because healing is yours salvation is yours Deliverance is yours your children children are yours amen as an heir of God everything that Christ died for belongs to you he left us with an inheritance see so then that means we're heirs but notice the inheritance amen is not given to him when he is born The Inheritance is not given to the son when he is born but rather when he is adopted I know now I know that's some are teaching that the the the the birth and the adoption are the same brother Brown never taught that don't believe that if you go back listen to hear ye himym all them sermons and listen to uh the adoption series and listen to so many others amen The Inheritance is not given Amen to the son when he is born but rather when he is adopted ain't that right see so the manifestation of Sons of God happen at time of adoption amen now brother Bram says your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing amen see so the son had no inheritance until he was positionally placed in the family brother BR says just because you have received the Holy Spirit that doesn't mean that everything's going to be poured into your hands amen no no no amen you got to come to an adoption ain't that right notice Galatians 4 and 1 he says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child deth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen he's heir of everything he's he's Lord of all things but he differeth nothing from a servant as long as he is a child ain't that right see though he be Lord of all but is UN under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father now brother brandham in in uh hear ye him I believe or the adoption series he he he talks about that there in the Old Testament there were rules of adoption rules of adoption and and these rules are not something to be ignored amen uh uh this is something that that that we to listen to and to take heed you you know and and and so it it's like if a father uh had you know he owned thousands of Acres of a ranch and and he he's got this great business and and maybe he's got cows and and sheep and he's got this and he's got that and and all these things well he he he's he's got uh laborers and and and employees what we would call employees cow hands Ranch hands whatever you want to call them but he's got maybe maybe uh uh uh some uh uh uh you know ranch ranch hands that are you know 5 miles 10 miles out on this side taking care of the sheep and he's got maybe uh 30 mies out this way and and he's got Ranch hands over there taking care of his cattle and he's got this one over here and he's got him kind of all scattered well he he he's he's got to go and check and and make sure that that that everybody's doing good that they're running the business that his kingdom is operating just right see and and yet he's got a son he a son has just been born and and and kind of you know maybe he's 3 years old or whatever and and and I don't know maybe maybe just born I don't know still in the Cradle I don't know but but then he he got to thinking well I I ain't got the time to invest in my son I ain't got the time to tell him all the dos and the don'ts and what I want and all these things CU i' I've got to make sure my business is being ran you know and and he didn't have you know back then he didn't have the automobile and plane and all that he had his old donkey you know yeah and and so you know then then so what he would do is he would hire a tutor somebody that that he he knew somebody that he could trust somebody that was worthy honest and and and that that knew him that was intimate with him in in in business and you you understand it wasn't going to cut his throat and all these things he had to be somebody honest and and so so the the prophet said see when when the son was born in this home the father did not have time take care of the son that he should so he went and got some someone a tutor a razor someone to raise the child educate that child in the Kingdom of the father ain't that right why because he knew his son was going to fall air to everything that he owns here amen and his son and the desire was his son to take over and And he as the father would step back and and kind of blend in the shadows a little bit and no longer would would he be dealing with the ranchan and all these things in the business but the son would step forward and and take that responsibility and and he would run that Kingdom but his father wasn't just going to give it to a little sport brat and and someone that just a snotty noes kid and and had to have everything his way oh no no so he would raise that child under tutorship ain't that right see so the prophet said see he says uh see the son did not inherit anything until his life proved out to be the right kind of a child and the tutor which is the holy spirit in our case see brought word to the father all the time how this child was progressing see so so the son or the father would want a report from the tutor every every now and again I don't know how you know me could be that remind me of trump you know but uh uh uh but but it could have been you know every year could have been three months six months I don't know but anyways uh so so that the tutor had to give the right kind of report had to be honest and and he would tell well your son you know he's just he won't listen he's just he's he I hate to tell you sir but he's a little wild and and I can't get him to do nothing and and I you you understand what I'm saying well these reports now the father he wanted a good report he did he he wanted the right true report he didn't want the uh uh the report to be a little shady and and say oh your son is good when the sun ain't good amen because his is is he he's got a business and he don't want this business to go to pot you know and and to be ruined so so the so so the father uh uh the tutor would come and report on the progress of this child now the prophet said now we have tried to jump the fence see we tried to stick the cart before the horse you tried to claim things and do things before God did it and God a lot of Flesh worked up into it well see that's the Pentecostals that's that Pentecostal age amen when the tutor come amen this message they didn't want it they didn't want nothing to do with it they wanted their fleshly things yeah I say unto you y y and it didn't even come to pass and they went and they were led by their own feelings calling it being led by the spirit led by emotions led by Sensations led by everything else instead of the true word of God can you say Amen so the brother Rand talking that Pentecostal age then Pentecost you tried to claim things and do things before God did it see and a god a lot of Flesh worked up into it see amen so the the father finds this best uh tutor to teach his son he says he just doesn't get a Scully wag he wants his boy to be a real fella he wants a man a tutor that'll be honest he don't want a man to say well now look you know Junior you just do anything you want to honey oh yes Father uh-huh he's getting along just fine he's a fine boy and get a little Pat on his back and a straw in his hat no no he says that guy would get fired right away see he wants a man that'll be truthful if that boy's coming right tell him if he isn't coming right then tell him what's wrong see amen tell him all about it see well the Holy Spirit as we know is our tutor but he speaks through human lips ain't that right he speaks through human lips for the prophet told us and and we can see it all through the Bible that man is the agency that God works through man is that agency see and so uh the prophet said he's not going to speak through a pope because he knows the pope ain't going to tell you the truth see he isn't going to speak through a psychologist because the psychologist ain't going to tell the truth he isn't speaking through denominations because the denominations ain't telling the truth he ain't he ain't speaking the things ain't that right well what is the truth well Jesus said in John uh 17:17 that Thy word is truth so the word of God is truth so he needed a tutor that'll speak the word of God ain't ain't that right so this is why a prophet would come on the earth because the word comes to a prophet amen and in this day the spirit of Truth has come to us manifested through a prophet's word amen see amen so the prophet said see when you see the the Holy Spirit speaking through lips see that's telling the truth exactly every time predicting and coming to pass just perfectly like Samuel said then you know that's the truth see you know that's truth that's the thing you need to take heed to that's the thing you need to subject yourself to and let him be your tutor can you say Amen this message is not just another sermon of TD Jake and Benny Henn and Jack Cole and and whatever this message is the tutor it's the spirit of Truth amen speaking to a bride amen perfecting sons of God Amen to bring them up into an adoption see so he says see so you know it's the truth it's coming right see because God said if he speaks and what he says don't come to pass don't hear him cuz I'm not with him but if he does well then hear him because I'm with him ain't that right it's kind of interesting just for a moment but interesting how brother Brown says that at the time that the a woman would become president that cars would be like eggs you know and and of course you know or the shape of an egg you know and and it's funny someone uh uh uh gave me a uh a print of or a uh a deal of an advertisement of a of a car company amen and and and they're advertising egg shaped cars you know which really they're they're like a a V vws and and and and something like that but it's interesting that they're calling them AG shaped cars but a prophet already told us it was going to come can you say Amen so we're sitting here not wondering what's going on we've been given the spirit of Truth and if the prophet could be right about the world and its standing and its its political ways and and the turmo amen this turmo is no surprise to us everything that we're seeing is no surprise to us because we have been given the spirit of Truth we've heard heard the spirit of Truth declare it and if it that is right how much more is the word concerning you right it's right can you say Amen well see so the tutor gives the report to the father and tells him if the son is obedient or disappoint disobedient obedient or disobedient and he lets to know he lets the father know whether the son is of good character or bad character now notice Propet says here's where I think the Pentecostal Church made their mistake see when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was not yet determined it depended upon his character can you say Amen character you see this message is bringing us to a character hope you're understanding so though he he though being a son if he was a disobedient son he would not in herit anything but still he was a son but if he was an obedient son he was Heir everybody say he was heir to All Things see an obedient son and we've we've been taught not only through Pentecostal reals but through the Holiness group the Baptist and whatever more that when we're born again we're sons of God that's true but that yet that's just the beginning then it's your character from then on what means the difference can you say Amen am amen so we're not identified with that Pentecostal age sure they they had great things amen but they were not there remember the seed shall not be air with that sh so we are not the Shu Pentecostal age we are the seed so the kind of character that that um the father is looking for is one that likes to be about the father's business amen the prophet says that loves to do the things the father wants him to do see what was elzer looking for when he went and looked for a bride for Isaac he was looking for character that's what a prophet said he said and that's the messenger of the last days the evening life is to First find that church where they'll where will they believe the message hunt it see can you read what I'm talking about hunt where that church is that'll even let you come in that won't close the door in your face and then when you do there uh uh when you got there when you found that then you found character and I just believe there's a a people of character in this building tonight amen that will not close the door Amen to the prophet's words to the message of the hour but in every aspect of their life they say Amen to it amen to it amen to it agreed to it then you found character now as she'll stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed she's got to be clothed see stand still ain't that right now notice in 1953 1953 now in 1906 the the the baptism of the Holy Spirit was poured out amen and and in 1953 brother Brown said the church ought to be in adoption right now the church ought to be in adoption right now bringing into the full favors of God right my my my but he said but God can't trust us with hard nothing hardly because of our ups and downs ins and outs and ups and downs and ins and out one day I belong to the assemblies the next day I belong to something else I'm a Methodist the next day a Baptist the next day you packed your paper from church to church in every little group you go into the church and I'm a Baptist now see and the first thing you know somebody makes me angry the deacon get get me wrangled up see and the pastor says something I don't believe I pick up my paper take off over to the Methodist if the Methodist don't get them I take them down to the assemblies or go to the Church of God you pack your papers till it's all wore out but it's in that time that the church should have been adopted come into that adoption can you say Amen see you've got to keep your eyes single upon the word of God and I'll say that to you young people keep your eyes single to the word of God don't look what they're doing don't look what this one's doing don't look what that one's doing that one's doing amen you you've got all kinds of things even in the message amen that one contradicts the other and all that keep your eyes single upon the word of God this message is right the kind of character that counts is one that believes all everybody say believes all that believes all the word of God that's the character that counts is one that believes all the word of God brother Bram said when you accept the whole full gospel when you believe in everything God wrote it's the truth God wants you to believe it that way God help us see so this message is not to tickle our fancy amen you you you understand amen I I had you know an elderly one time tell me we need to go back to ausa oh they had it better our churches are so dry and our churches are this and and and we just ain't got it the way it was but see a lot of that was just emotions a lot of that was fanaticism I'm not saying all of it there was true things even we saw true things real things but a lot of it was emotions and and a lot of it was ups and down Sensations ins and outs and all of these things amen but what the message is doing is not taking the life out of us it's not taking zapping God out of us it's actually building character if somebody can stay still long enough through their trials and through their testings and Through the Fire amen just to be settled upon the word and let that character shine yes remember Caleb settled down on the word so a son of good character believes every word of God and says Amen to it and notice he's growing in Grace in other words he's maturing brother Brandon would call it ripening in the presence of the sun ripening there was none there was no ripening in the Pentecostal age there was no ripening Amen in all the other we're coming to maturity sons of God Amen the sun is now shining upon the seed and the the Shu has pulled away that Pentecostal shuck has pulled away from the seed and the sun light is shining now quickening that seed ripening that seed none others are ripening but the seed is ripening can you say Amen why because there's character in that seed there's a faith in that seed that believes every bit of the word that says Amen to every bit of the word of God don't say well that was brother bram's opinion and well I don't know you just have to kick that aside and just stay with your Bible amen how could God send a prophet amen and preach and deny the word of God H it ain't true a prophet is true on God's word so he's growing in Grace and notice the son of good character is is submitting submitting to the word not overriding the word but submitting to the word see in in and and and with that there comes a lot of Shaving there there comes a lot of cutting there comes a lot of of of of hurts and and and pains and Agony and and all that but you got to stay there and let God finish you out a self-denial he's allowing himself to be refined by the word he is about the father's business now see the father seen the son had progressed and that he was a worthy boy everything he did was right and and he was right up with the father's business he wanted everything just right for the father and he had no selfish motive see that that's the sign who the father adopted ain't that right now we know that Jesus was adopted uh on Mount Transfiguration that's what a prophet taught and and so we we know this Matthew 17 And1 and and uh um after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the the son his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them uh Moses and Elijah talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wil let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias and while he spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadow them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were s afraid Jesus came and touched them and said arise Be not Afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus Christ that's the only thing they saw was Jesus Christ there was the adoption that was the time that Jesus was adopted the prophet said see when he God overshadowed him Jesus and his reignment his pretty role before him the glorified condition like Shine Like the Sun in its strength is that right a voice came from heaven and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him I've placed him positionally that's my son what he says I'll back up he's kept my word he's fought through all these denominations and everything else and kept the faith he pulled no punches he's been true he's always always about my work when people look at him they see me this is my son hear ye him what an adoption so now after Abraham had gone through the stages of justification sanctification and the circumcision which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet said God took Abraham out and placed the adoption upon him and changed his name from Abram to Abraham gave him a name change see so the word Abraham comes from the word Elohim which Elohim is God's Own name and other words he Associated Abraham's name with his own name can you say amen God being Elohim the prophet said God took the Hem Hem off of his name and place it onto Abraham's name see Abraham was first Abram Abram but then in that adoption God took the hymn off of his name and placed it upon Abram's name and it become Abraham see God was the father of all things of the universe of creation but Abraham now became the father of Nations see what was it God positionally placed him yes brother brah said that's after see that's after his church received the Holy Ghost after they had went through the testings now I want to listen to tell you Church you got to go through your testings you got to go through your testings testings are hard come on now you ever been where you feel like God left you you ever just felt like God forsake you come on brother hello TR that ain't the time to give into this Le Odyssey in spirit that ain't the time to give up that ain't the time to grow slack God's looking for a character that's right yes sir he said see that's after his church received the Holy Ghost after they had went through the testings Pentecost missed it they refused to go through the test yeah yeah they wanted feelings they wanted something they can touch they wanted some emotion right come on hello yes sir and they organized themselves and couldn't get any farther then when God does a certain thing they say ahuh see stay away from it see see our church don't teach that go ahead see but here's what he done to Abraham to Abraham and his seed after him he adopted them made him heir of all things sir Hallelujah so it was in Genesis 12 that Abraham was justified it was in Genesis 15 that Abraham was Sanctified it was in Genesis 17 that God gave him the holy ghost or the circumcision and and and brother Brown brings this out he said did you notice that it took Years Years between the time of Abraham's justification and sanctification in between that time was years and in time in between the time of Abraham's sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost circumcision there was years right there took years but he says now notice in the 17th verse after he had received the Holy Ghost in that same chapter amen he was adopted come on we ain't got much years to go right that's right you say oh my you know I've received the Holy Ghost so how long do I got there ain't no time for adoption I mean in time in between you don't have to wait long time just submit just believe can you say Amen yes sir are you with me yes just believe the word see so he says notice how quick Abraham was adopted after he received the Holy Ghost he received his adoption in the same chapter that that he received the Holy Ghost see Martin Luther received reached justification and then years and years and years later comes sanctification and then years and years and years later come the baptism of the Holy Ghost but right quick after Pentecost did the same thing the rest of them did they then he pull began to pull his sons that's where that's where you're at God began to pull you out of that Pentecost po Pentecostal age Pentecostal tradition Pentecostal train of thought and all of the things amen and pull his sons and his daughters out of that Pentecostal age see that stood for his truth and give him something special magnified him before the people with a certain thing he stood out and placed him aren't you glad for that so the prophet said Abraham was placed as Elohim yes Abraham was placed as Elohim associated with God by giving him part of his own name not name Faith Tabernacle not name Baptist not a name of gospel assembly or evening light or whatever he is own name aren't you glad for that and if you notice God promised if you look in the book of Acts it talks about it that God promised that he would call out a people out of the Gentiles for his name amen think of that God had already purposed to bring his sons to an adoption call the people out of the Gentiles we are that people hallelujah and Jesus Christ is the name of the father for Jesus said I come in my father's name yes the prophet said the bride of Christ will be Miss Jesus Christ baptized in his spirit in his name filled with his power and robed in his righteousness Colossians 3:17 Paul would tell us what in whatsoever you do in word in or deed do all in the name of Jesus can you say Amen do all in the name of Jesus if you can't watch that television in the name of Jesus don't watch it you can't look at certain things on that internet in the the name of Jesus don't watch it that's right if you can't hang around a certain crowd or go into certain places in the name of Jesus don't do it right why because we're Sons yes we're we're looking for the father's business right we ain't saying well I can do it anyway I don't care I know people argue about all kinds of things they argue about the television well I can have a television in my home I mean the phone's just as bad have one one men say well the phone's just as bad the prophet didn't say if I had a phone in my house I'd kick it out and and get a shotgun and kick blow that thing out amen he didn't say that he said if I had a television in my home I'd get a shotgun and blow that thing away yeah right that's just for your information yeah always about the father's business can you say Amen so it's after the adoption comes then the association comes with his name the association comes with his associ with association with his name comes at time of adoption this is the time when 2 Corinthians 58 becomes more clear to us for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him we sing that song he became me that might become him he became me that I might become him when adoption hello church right come on the age of justification look at look at what Luther done he still he he was a drunk right yeah that's right look look what Holiness done they had it all out on the outside and we thank for that we believe in Holiness but it wasn't everything we thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it still didn't reflect all of Christ right he didn't reveal the son of man but in this age yes there is a people that has been Blood Bought purchased by God that he became us that we might become him that's right come on now Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the tutor for the law of of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free how many's free made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh see God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh is a where legalism it only deals with flesh that's all it does it just deals with flesh and then this is where legalism goes so far wrong they're wrong we believe in Holiness but we don't we don't well you can't push people into Holiness you can't push people into doing things we were under that we we we you know we you know fellowship with with apostolics and all that and and and you know it was just a constant thing but but what what was what was the thing it just made people more hypocritical of all things it just made them Hypocrites they would sneak televisions anyways and they they they would you know they they would cut their hair just so it can just enough to where it can't be seen see and and and and they would do this and they would do that they would see what they could get away with children would you know they they would wait until they got out outside amen of the home got in school or whatever the girls and then they'd put on their bries and and and then they'd wear their makeup just long just enough so it can't really be noticed and and all of these things it was down in that heart the law could not perfect on that's right ain't that right but what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sent in his own son and the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin uh uh condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit aren't you glad for that so what is an heir an heir is one who receives his allotted possession by right of sunship an heir is one who receives his allotted possession by right of sunship yes and by adoption we've come into our inheritance oh my aren't you glad for that you see we are in full possession of our inheritance that's right this is what a people is coming to in this day we coming in full possession you see the Rapture could not take place in the other ages it had to wait for this age for sons of God to come in to their full possession of their inheritance the body chain all all of these things that we're looking at so brother brand said here he is among his church today made flesh in his church certainly Elohim he said now oh if you could only realize that you men you were made to be an amateur God you're a Son of God you're an heir of God you have a domain he's speaking to all of us we have a domain Genesis 1:26 he gave him dominion over everything in the earth he made him a God over the Earth that's right he give him a domain he's a king God and where he got the his fall see he could speak to the trees be chained be plucked up and set over here to the winds and the waves be still and it stop he was a god an amateur God a Son of God like you are a son of your father like what brother brandham said and I'm getting ready to close brother brandham said what we need in this hour is a man to challenge the promise of God before the people we don't want some water down gospel right right we want a gospel that'll challenge us this is where we're at yeah amen can you say Amen do you love the Lord yes we can make it we've talked about them 10 spies and how that they' went over into the land they partook of that evidence but they came back and they showed that they were unbelievers 2 and a half million come out strong out of Egypt but when it come time to go into the promise into their inheritance they showed to be cowards the prophet said he called them cowards because they were afraid they they were f fearful when the promise stood before them they considered all the impossibilities of why they couldn't take that right and I say to you the promises are here don't look at all the incapabilities don't look at your mistakes don't look at your failures don't look at anything look at the promise brother Bram said don't look at anything that'll make you doubt right don't look at anything you can't doubt this is the time to come into promise air possession can you amen Caleb as I've said settled down on the word and I want to say this if you've got complexes then settle down on the word amen if you've got anxiety Then settle down on the word you got Hang-Ups in your life settle down on the word if you have sickness if Satan's telling you you cross that line of Mercy settle down upon that word hallelujah don't let unbelief take it over yes settle down upon that word that's right we are hires of Promise Hallelujah you love him if the musicians will come as the prophet said the word of God will defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any condition do you believe that amen if you go listen to perfect faith brother Ram talks about Jesus and how that he had perfect faith brother Ram says he had it and it come because he was the word you say well that was was Jesus no if you are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his Spirit word of his word power of his power you are the word that's right well here he says it he says he he had it perfect Faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you

doubt I'm staying with the word of God I'm settling my heart on the word of God I don't need someone to Pro propy over me and tell me that it's going to be okay I know it's going to be okay because my faith is in the word of God I don't need someone to have this dream over me I don't need someone to prophesy and tell me all these good the word has already told me see see it's becoming see I don't get the promise because someone prophesies over me I don't get the promise because somebody has a dream about me or sees a vision I get the promise because God said so I believe believe it and I have spoken [Music] it you don't have to feel Goosebumps but when you go down on your knees the devil's tremble because he realized you're a Believer and you're taking God at his word you're not going to sit there and say well I don't know if it's going to happen but I'll just try it that ain't going to work you're getting on your knees because you know it's going to work that's right you're a Son of God God has given you that Authority you are an heir that's and everything belongs to you you believe it can you lift your hands unto the Lord and just worship him blessed be the name of the Lord

that's right what you need to worry about is recognizing your position in the scripture that's what I need to do recognizing my position in the scripture can you say amen and you'll realize then you're not a popper you'll realize then you're not a beggar you'll realize then that Satan ain't got nothing on you nothing he didn't die for that stupid devil and he didn't make that stupid devil

have [Music] overcome praise the Lord the Battle Is Over the victory is one I got one more quote brother brah said if you are the bride then the bride is part of the husband the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband you are that word see or you'll never be able to recognize being the bride see if I'm bride then I must recognize what part I am what part of that word I am am I am I in Luther age am I in in the first age am I in the Pentecostal age or am in the bright age adoption time seed time ain't that right you have to recognize your position you
