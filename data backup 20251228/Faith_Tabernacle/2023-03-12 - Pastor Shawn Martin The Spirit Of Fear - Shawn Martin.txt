father we just ask that your Supreme presence your Supernatural presence would come Among Us Lord for that's our desire we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen the man the Psalms the 34th chapter and I'm going to just start at the fourth verse that it said I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened in their faces were not ashamed this poor man Cried unto the Lord or cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord in campus round about them that fear him and delivereth him oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord Jesus his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing gummy children hearken unto me and I will teach you fear of the Lord amen you can have your seats this morning I thought I'd take a different subject today and just was on my heart I came on my hard Thursday I believe it was and and so um but I want to I want to talk about fear and um in in our opening scripture we're reading of two types of fear um and there is one kind of fear that dominates the world today and according to Webster this type of fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger and an anxious concern a reason for alarm it is means to be afraid to panic anxiety scared this is this is the fear that is dominating and controlling the world of course um the Nations today are using this fear uh Russia is trying to get the world to fear them uh Iraq North Korea China America we're all trying to get each other to fear them and you know we we everybody boasts about their missiles and boasts about this and and to be honest the world is scared they're they're in this under this this fear because they don't know the future and we're everyone is threatening each other and and so it it is a fearful time and so but we uh as ministers are trying to get everyone to have faith in God that's that's our desire our goal and because the prophet said you will either be controlled by faith or fear you're going to be controlled by either one and fear and faith the prophet said one of these are the controlling factors that control everything fear or faith controls the Nations all people all churches all homes all everything and they are the again that two controlling elements in the world today is either Faith or fear so every individual is going to be controlled by one of these elements but if you look in the the the the the fourth verse that where we read just now uh David said I sought the Lord he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears he delivered me and so this fear that David is delivered from is a fear that comes from Satan it does not come from God because they're in first Timothy or second Timothy 1 7 Paul writes and says God hath not given us the spirit of fear and so this kind of fear is evil and according to First John uh 4 18 this kind of fear hath torment uh and and this word torment uh means extreme pain or anguish of body or mind it's agony and and so to cause severe usually persistent or recurrent distress of body or mind too and and and so that this is what the torment and and and we read there that that fear this kind of fear hath torment so and this fear is is dominating the world so most people are in such torment that they're in anguish of either mind or body uh to where their their their mentally snapping it's it's just they're losing it and and it's not just a a day thing it's it's becoming a persistent thing to where to where people are really not knowing what to do how to handle the pressure and and and and and these things because it's a it's a torment and and we we know that it's a demon before in the English word the the demon actually means Tormentor amen and so demons the prophet said are tormentors that torment us uh uh so this fear is a is a demon that is tormenting most of the world today now the prophet said if you fear then the devil steps in and he calls this fear he said it's it's the devil's fear it's it's it's it's that now Luke 21 and 25 Jesus said and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring now through the message they are we know and and to what we're seeing today we know that this scripture is being fulfilled currently right now in this age and so then notice that in that 26th verse it says men's Hearts failing them for fear and and and of course this is today and and and there and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken ain't that rhyme so so many people millions billions of people the the majority of people uh um is are are being tormented by this demon of fear uh media is is propagating fear uh Hollywood in their movies are propagating fear uh everything it's fear fear fear uh and and why it's it's because uh the the world is uncertain the economy is uncertain people's souls are in danger there there's there's a damnation on people's souls and and and so we we find that uh uh that it's the wrath of God that is approaching um you know uh uh if you're if you've been in in any place where there's tornadoes Oklahoma has many of them and and um so so you know it's not mountainous like it is here at least where we live it's it's open I mean You Can See For Miles and and um um but when a storm is coming and you see that wall of black clouds I mean it is so black and you know it's approaching and and and and as you're watching give it five minutes and it's getting closer and and it's it's just getting closer and closer then all of a sudden the alarm starts going off and it's telling you you better run you better hide and you know and and and we've seen it where it's just so steel the the winds everything just stops you know and and that thing is just moving and it just looks horrific you know and and and I I I I imagine what it is today to the world that is seeing the dangers I mean look at the the craziness in politics look at the craziness in the churches look at the craziness in in the the the average American home or just homes in general look at the craziness that's going on on the jobs and and everything and and what it is is we're looking at the wrath of God coming it's it's approaching and and and I could I I'll I'll put it this way uh as as we saw the as we see them with that wall cloud coming and then you hear the signs going off and if you turn your radio on you'll hear a tornado is on the ground you know uh uh take cover immediately you know what I'm saying and and I could just imagine the warning that is going out to a prophet that is telling us something's on the ground the the wrath of God is approached it's it's here take cover right and and so and and and we're finding that we're in an age where where uh uh and and and you know sometimes you wonder where where we are at in time uh uh that that you're you're preaching to Eternal lost people uh uh you know for the most part no one is uh uh there's not a desire for God anymore there's not a a whatever and so you you could just imagine the fear that is gripping uh the hearts of the people today and it's because the wrath of God is is approaching according to what the scripture tells us now Isaiah 60 and 2 it says for behold the the gross Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people Darkness the the the Earth gross Darkness the people and and notice what this Darkness tells us uh um uh Isaiah 9 19 it says the Wrath of the Lord is the reason that the land is darkened it's so so we're hearing the the gross Darkness uh upon the people Darkness upon the land and why is it it's because the Wrath of the Lord and and so we could say that the Wrath of the Lord is upon the Earth it's upon the people and and the Heart of men is failing them uh uh uh because of fear and why is because they have no hiding place that there is no hiding place and and if you look at the last part of Isaiah 9 and 19 it says and the people shall be as the fuel of fire now you could just imagine that that brother Branham calls it Cannon father many people out here is just cannon fodder and and so here the Bible is saying that the people will be as the fuel of the fire and no man shall spare his brother no man will be able to do this it's because it's not just a Wrath of a king a Wrath of a man it's the wrath of God and and so and and if you notice who who is the wrath of God upon and and John 3 36 Jesus said he that believeth on the son shall or house etern everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him it abideth on him think of that even before the the the the the Wrath actually comes before the the Great Tribulation actually comes the wrath of God at how many people the wrath of God is upon and is abiding upon because they believe not the the son amen and and we know what it is today the son of man revealed ain't that right and they believe not see they they're playing games with it and and these things Romans 1 18 uh Paul uh says here breaking in the the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so they have the truth they they know the truth right and and and and and Paul would even say that you you you can see in in I believe in Romans 1 there in that chapter where you you can look at the Sun and see truth you can look at the the grass and see truth you can look at the seasons during uh uh the springtime where where it comes from grass and trees and all that that were dead they come to life it's telling of a truth and so the world holds a truth and then they deny the truth they deny the fact that there's a God and they hold the truth in unrighteousness and the wrath of God is upon them amen and and so then you look in Ephesians 5 and 3 where Paul mentioned several things that causes the wrath of God to come he mentions fornication all uncleanness covetness filthiness foolishness talking uh foolish or foolish talking uh jesting uh um and and and and and so these things and he says be it's because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the children of Disobedience so now we know what the wrath of God is it's on the children of Disobedience those who obey not the truth those who disregard the truth as as as a a way of life it's you understand what I'm saying and and so uh then he goes on the whoremonger the the unclean person the Covetous man who is an idolater will not have any inheritance in the kingdom of God and then Paul would tell us therefore be not part takers with them be not partakers with him why because the wrath of God is upon them ain't that right and so with this there's an effect upon their hearts and that is fear fear and the devil is able to use that and and because it's the it's it's the devil's fear and and so in Colossians 3 and 5. uh uh Paul would write mortified Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness in in ordinate affection evil uh something to that effect and covetness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of Disobedience so again the wrath of God is on the children of Disobedience ain't that right and and so in in in uh Isaiah 13 and 13 it tells us that God will shake the heavens and and the Earth shall remove out of her place uh in the Wrath of the Lord of hosts and in the day of his Fierce anger now in this in this day of Wrath there is no mercy as as the Bible there in Revelations would tell us that he he that is filthy let him be filthy feel he that is righteous let him be righteous still it's it comes to a place that there's no more Mercy there's there's no more grace there's there's absolutely no way that a man can be saved um he he's come he can brother Branham says you know that he'll shed his tears and and and he'll they'll think they're getting saved and yet yet there there's nothing there uh uh because the Wrath of the Lord Has Come ain't that right so so you can imagine just how terrible this this wrath is that it's going to affect the heavens and the Earth and and and these things and and and according to to Paul's writings the Heaven and Earth is been shaken right now it's it's being shaken right now and it's the voice of God that is causing the shaken ain't that right is that you find that in Hebrews there uh I believe maybe the 10th chapter if I'm not mistaken but uh uh uh where he says once more will I shake not only the Earth but I'll shake the heavens in and he talks about the voice speaking again and how uh and we know that that's the message of the hour that's the voice of God today amen and and then through all this shaking uh uh uh Paul would tell us and we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken so so there there is a shaking but then we know that there is going to be an explosion uh uh that will make way for a new Heaven and new earth uh second Peter 3 and 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which uh the heavens and shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are in uh that are therein shall be burned up every everything of man will be gone oh aren't you glad for that have you ever just seen the the beautiful mountains or scenery and then right in the middle of it all there's a power line you know and you're thinking man you know if you get that stupid thing out of the way it'd be a perfect picture well God's gonna get it out of the way there ain't gonna be no asphalt there ain't gonna be no houses there ain't I I look at uh you know in process Fork Road that's where we first lived and and it was so beautiful out there I love the scenery just driving down that road and seeing the mountains and now they're they're filling it all up with houses and buildings and blocking my beautiful scene you know and it's like one of these days it ain't going to be that way amen why because the wrath of God is coming it's all the works of man all the achievements of man will be no more amen and and so you can imagine why that that the fear of man or fear is coming upon the Earth and and so uh all the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you ought to be in all holy conversation or lifestyle and and godliness looking for looking for and Hasting now now one is looking for the wrath of God to come looking for all these horrible things that are coming but then there's a group of people that's looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise we look how he's looking we look not not for the rest of God but we look for a new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness ain't that rhyme so there's going to be this explosion there's going to be a mighty shaking and you can you can read about it or hear about it listening to it in the future home of the Earthly bride and Heavenly bridegroom and and brother Brandon says the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite with gases we'll ignite the gases that's in the earth and explode it such an exploding explosion will rock it cause it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn everything there is to be done the fire will burn it up and remember it's not all together just a literal fire because it's also a holy fire that will take away Satan and all his devils and both Heaven and Earth will pass away killing all the germs all insects all natural life on it and around it even the H2O the water will explode ain't that right and and and then he he goes in and other place you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait till this Earth gets her baptism ain't that right now they tell us that people you know that that scream and dance and Shout they need to get the Holy Ghost first how do you know that they ain't getting the Holy Ghost how do you know that's not the Holy Ghost upon them amen making such an annoy ain't that right this Earth ain't gonna pass away and this Heaven Ain't gonna pass away without a noise can you say amen and I I just happened that just uh uh uh uh proves I'm not saying it has to happen all the time so don't don't get into that I'm not getting into an order of of where God moves and and these things but I just believe a person a man can't pass away the old things in a person can't pass away without there being some kind of a noise Amen to let the world know that that the old has passed away and all things have become new can you say amen amen sold now the H2O the prophet said is going the water is going to explode for the Bible said here in Revelations 21 that there is no more sea see see exploded this is will change the whole surface of the entire Earth she'll burst and blow to Pieces all the outside the crust for hundreds of feet below it would just simply be completely demolished if the atmospheres the gases that's in the earth now where they're finding these missiles that can't get through it a great sphere up in there way up in some kind of a sphere that uh where all these kinds of gases they say that'll it'll burst see the holy wrath of God will come upon it and will cleanse it and will change the entire surface aren't you glad for that see so it's is a time of purging and and we know this this is this is all under uh uh uh uh the the the the the the seal uh uh The Sixth Seal being a time of purging a man that God's going to purge the Earth he's gonna Purge the the heavens he's going to purge everything and ain't that right amen the only people that will not be there is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's been purged in a different way and they're being purged right now amen and it's the blood of Jesus Christ that is purging them ain't that right and they've got the token in this age they've got the life of God reflecting through them to tell them to show the world it's on display to show the world I've been purged I've been purged I'm not looking for wrath to come I'm a new creature and I'm looking for a new Heaven and a new Earth ain't that right God would prepare you he's preparing it's it's what did Brother Brown say it's it's a prepared uh Kingdom it's a prepared world it's a prepared land for prepared people ain't that right so so now it's a purging time and and the world knows that this is coming upon them they they've held on to their own ideas they've held on to their their rottenness they've held on to Spirits they've held on entertained Demons of bitterness and divisiveness and they've they've held on to all kinds of nonsense amen and God says I've had enough of it I'm going to purge this Earth I'm going to purge it all there will be a time you can worship and there'll be no one persecuting you for it there's going to be a time that you can just be a Christian and there will be no mind battles for it there will be nothing there there will be no trial there will be no nothing because God's going to purge this thing he's going to purge it can you say amen that's why we can go through our trials and lift up our hands that's why we can we don't care about critics we don't care about the nation players we don't care about what the devil does to our body we don't care about the the the trials that we go through we just don't care amen none of this matters to us I don't care what so-and-so does down the street it doesn't matter to me I'm looking for a new Heaven and a new Earth I I'm looking for something I've got to Hope in in my life now if people are Earthbound and all they can see is just a you know they can't see past the end of their nose they can't see past the trials and the troubles and the problems of the church and the problems of the home the problems of theirs the problems of the preacher the problems of the deacons or the musician amen well they ain't got no hope amen you've got to look up and and then see that there's a bright future that's ahead can you say Amen but what is it people have gotten so churchy that they don't have an experience with God Amen they dried up in that soul and the fear is gripping them now we we find that the world knows that this is coming upon them and people are doing exactly what the Bible prophesied of them running to and fro running to and fro why Restless they have a Restless spirit ain't that right Restless nothing can satisfy them divorce is on the on the rise adultery is on the rise you they're they're looking for all kinds of pleasures and the devil's is giving it to them because it's a Restless spirit because they're running it they're fulfilling scriptures and what's driving it fear driving it you know they're trying to find satisfaction they're trying to find something to appease them if you look Revelation 6 and 12 and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rowed together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the rocks and mountains following us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who is able to stand ain't that right so we're seeing that this fear is gripping every level of humanity poor Rich smart not so smart um it's it's gripping whether whether you got good occupation bad occupation no matter what place you live in the fear is gripping the world because the wrath of God is not just coming upon America it's not just coming upon one location it's coming upon everything God's going to purge this whole world ain't that right and so we we now we we look and and and we see that Israel in the Old Testament they provoke God several times they provoked him in in the wilderness they provoked the Lord to wrath by their Rebellion then the people the uh uh provoked the Lord in in Horeb by their idolatry then they promote provoked the Lord to wrath in kadish barnia by their unbelief see God had proven Time and Time Again by the supernatural amen that that he was God and that he was with him and that every promise he gave them what was true but the circumstance every time they come to circumstance and and and they hardened their heart they hardened their heart to the promises of God to the supernatural of God in other words all they could see was the circumstance and they couldn't see the greatness of God around them they couldn't see that God had proven time and a time and time again to answer prayer and to watch over them and to protect them that every time the circumstance come amen they Harden their heart and the the Bible says and Paul would write and say they hardened it because they had an evil heart of unbelief ain't that right an evil heart of unbelief and and so uh and and notice if you look they all died they they all died and and the uh uh Jesus said they're they're all dead right and and and we know that they were already physically dead but but the prophet said they were eternally dead that's what Jesus meant they were eternally dead right amen God God uh they they were not allowed to come into the promised land because they provoked God unto Wrath hey man we don't want God's rest we want God's mercy amen that that's that's what we want ain't that right now now we find that there is a people that cannot be delivered from Fear they cannot because the wrath of God abides upon them they they cannot be delivered for they are the children of Disobedience and and notice they are called the children a bit uh Disobedience because according to First Peter to an eight they stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed ain't that right so so again they're called the children of Disobedience they stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed and and this what brings the wrath of God upon them there's nothing in them to believe there they can be religious they go to church Church they they do pay their all their dues they they do all the ritual things but they don't have a heart of belief they they they they ain't got it there to believe God to take God at his word and so they become hardened in their hearts oh come on now you know this is the time that rapturing Faith should be taken hold in the church we've seen God do too much things for us we've seen God uh uh uh mighty in battle in this age ain't that right and it should be building a rapturing faith within us but instead of building rapturing faith it's exposing an evil heart of unbelief in many people hello now now we find that but also there is a group of people that can be delivered from Fear they can be are you with me they can be delivered from Fear and and and so we we look at this because and and and and and so first Thessalonians five and nine uh Paul would write God everybody say God hath not appointed us under Wrath aren't you glad for that God has not appointed us under wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do can you say man so our comfort should be of that we have obtained salvation our comfort together should be that God has not appointed us to Wrath so this fear that is trying to grip the Church of the Living God Amen David said he has delivered me from that fear he's delivered me from it can you say man now what Paul is speaking of here uh uh God has not appointed us that us is the children of obedience if the if the wrath of God is upon the children of Disobedience then then the mercy of God the grace of God is upon the children of obedience ain't that right so notice Romans 6 and 17 you were everybody say I was past tense I was amen you were a man the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart not just going through legalists not just going through rituals not just a routine of something I know that I should do so here I am no no you've obeyed from the very Soul the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being made free been being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness now notice if it can't come from the heart then you're still a servant to sin if it's not coming from the very most inner being amen now that's where it's got to come because when your Trials Come amen it can't touch the soul Satan can touch your spirit say can affect your body that he cannot affect your soul and when you believe from the heart that faith is still anchored I don't care if it seemed like God Is A Million Miles Away that faith is still anger and you're obeying from the heart you're obeying now God does not want us to fear God has not given us the spirit of fear God doesn't want us to fear so this is why he delivers us because there's no reason to fear because God has not appointed you to Wrath sir there's no reason to fear so then that means Satan is just trying to squat on him God's Property ain't that right see so you have a right to cast that devil out oh wait get away from me get away right so we find what does Fear work through unbelief ain't that right and and so uh uh this tormenting spirit of fear accompanies unbelief it does not coexist with faith the more faith the less fear it cannot coexist with faith brother Brown said when you go to reasoning and wondering then you begin to fear when you begin to reason it when you begin to wonder about it you begin to fear ain't that right so reasoning and wondering comes from unbelief ain't that right now now I'm I'm gonna say this uh uh if I can see and and it's in that Spirit Room that Satan begins to work on our reasoning it's in that Spirit realm that Satan begins to work on our imagination and working on it's the five senses ain't that right see and and so and and and and so we we find that that fear can can get in in in in that way now brother Branham in speaking of Christ he said this he was deity himself made flesh here on Earth to manifest his love to the people and to take away sin of the earth aren't you glad for that that's that's the purpose of Calvary that's the purpose of Christ's coming he came here in order that he could anchor death in his own body he could anchor sickness in his own body the curse that ought to have been on you he took it upon himself and had to die as a man in order to redeem you back to this full fellowship with the father again what a marvelous thing yeah what a marvelous thing ain't that right but then you know what the prophet says that fear and unbelief can literally paralyze a man to where he can't grasp that he he can't grasp what he did at Calvary he said our minds are too sluggish the vows have been stuffed up because they are paralyzed with fear and unbelief can you say man so see God does not want us paralyzed to where that you know that that when we preach the promises when you hear about the problem you read about the promises you can't grasp it God help us and that's what fear does that's what what this unbelief this fear and all of these things and that unbelieving Spirit tries to affect us in such a way hello yeah yeah now what makes fear what what makes fear a lack of confidence everybody say a lack of confidence a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it will make you fear that's what the prophet said people fear that they're going to be lost they fear that they're going to be left behind they fear that God won't answer their prayer they fear uh uh their sickness they fear the future they fear because they lack confidence there's their and and so notice what Paul would tell us in Hebrews 10 and 35 uh uh through 39 Cass not away therefore your confidence right say it with me cast not a way therefore your confidence this is a warning that Paul is telling us now don't cast that confidence away why the moment you cast it away fear grips you that's right which hath great recompense of reward what has the great recompense of reward your confidence is that right for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of gods you might receive the promise so so us us doing the will of God Amen uh there there's a many times there's a space between doing the will of God and receiving the promise but in that time don't Cast Away your confidence right right see that you might receive the promise he said see for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith ain't that right so faith and confidence goes together the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul ain't that right so now where where does our confidence come from for the Bible says cast not away your confidence so where does our confidence come from well Psalms tells us there in in or in Proverbs uh 20 or 3 and 26 the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken ain't that right so what is our confidence the Lord everything that our confidence is built upon is the Lord our confidence is based upon a finished work of Calvary our confidence is based upon his love to us our confidence is based because we are assured of his of his promises to us can you say amen amen the confidence is not that I know the Lord can heal but our confidence is I know the Lord has healed me the confidence is that not not the fact that I know there's going to be a rapture we all know that but but our confidence is now I know I'm going to be a part of that I I I that the confidence is that it's not that I know that God can heal duh we've seen that but the confidence is that God now heals me and every promise is mine that's the confidence that you cannot Cast Away [Music] you can't Cast Away that confidence it's one thing to have confidence that the Bible is true now many people have gone and thrown that confidence away but the real confidence that we need and we must not throw away is that every word of God is true for me [Applause] is that right the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken so now remember if there's no confidence or faith then fear takes over and when fear Comes The Devil Comes see and so if we're not in confident that God has everything in control then fear grips us if we're not confident in his love toward us then fear dominates us ain't that right so fear again resides where there is no confidence or faith now I want to go into something here and and I'm not going to keep you much longer but what is it that takes away our confidence now Paul would tell us don't Cast Away your confidence but then what would take away our confidence and I think this is so important and and just going to take some time here for a moment but First John 3 and 18 um it it says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth now that that's a mouthful right there let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth love indeed and in truth now the world today is throwing that word love around so loosely it's it's become so common churches are throwing it around like it's just common uh uh homes to where it's just perverted it's so perverted and and and or really well only the true elect will have that true love and and so they they have no idea as to what love means but love creates a a a loyalty it creates a devotion it it it creates a bond ain't that right it's a bond that and and this is where you know a husband and wife that love must be there or something will come in between them uh uh you know but if if the love is there there's nothing I don't I don't care how ugly I am my wife loves me and so some big old hunk comes by there's just nothing there because we have a bond now we could have just had a spat we could have just had a a real real spat but if that love is there I don't care who gives her flowers and who you know would try to entice her to something else it's the love that binds us because there's a loyalty right there's a loyalty there's a devotion now the first and greatest commandment deals with love and is found in Deuteronomy 6 5 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all everybody say all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might ain't that right so our love first of all is is to God it's it's it's there and the second Jesus said is like an Intuit love thy neighbor as thyself ain't that right so now Jesus said there is no commandment greater than these love the Lord thy God first with all thy Soul all thy might all thy strength all thine heart and then love thy neighbor as thyself right now this shows us that man must prioritize his love now I'm still talking about my thought here but man must prioritize his love God first his neighbor second ain't that right so when a person loves the Lord with all of his heart with all of his soul with all of his might then what happens he will be devoted and loyal to God and God is the word ain't that right so a man puts his first loyalty his first love will be to the word so his actions will be word based his thoughts will be word based his motives will be word based his decisions his meditation everything will be word based because his love is to God his devotion his his his loyalty ain't that right and only then can he love his neighbor indeed and in truth only then can he truly love his neighbor indeed and in truth can you say man see the deed ain't giving someone a candy bar and saying that's love that's not what that's not what uh uh uh uh uh John is is writing here see see uh uh we we find it is contrary to the word of God when a man tries to love his neighbor without loving God first ain't that right you have to love God before you can love your neighbor now so that kind of love is misleading so to love someone with with having no regard to God's word and his ways is to love with the wrong kind of love and we know that the prophet told us that there's all kinds of loves there's there's there's human love there's uh uh a a gopal love which is Godly love uh Divine love uh there is uh lust love passionate love filthy love and it just goes on and on and on perverts perverts perverts but the pure love is divine love ain't that right so a man with Divine love will always love God first and foremost he will be misunderstood and criticized his love will be misunderstood because it's not according to the interpretation that the world has of love ain't that right so-called Christians speak of love all the time but their love is misplaced churches all over the world have opened their doors to homosexual sexuality to adultery to transgender to all kinds of feel and they've all done it in the Name of Love now that that love is misplaced because they're loving without regards to God they're loving without regards to his word ain't that right so so far be it that now we've we've become we've become politically correct behind the pulpit to where so we don't offend no one we don't want no one to leave so we tried to just make it everything just right see and and and when you do that you bypass God's word you you bypass the whole fact that that God is trying to lead but you're afraid of every reaction then that's not love how many ministers have compromised on the word for the sake of love and yet that's not the order of love the love is love God first which causes you to be devoted to God first to his word to his principles to his his values ain't that right but the churches have misplaced love and sold their tables as the Bible has prophesied have become full of vomit fulfilling the prophecy sin has become more tolerable in this age than ever and so their love is not prioritized according to the scripture to stand for Godly principles is considered now to be hate to cry out against the wrong is deemed as bigotry ain't that right it's it's it's meddling in personal affairs it's now considered well being in the flesh critical narrow-minded why because the world has misplaced love they have misinterpreted What Love Is [Music] right so Isaiah speaks of this day and warns us prophesies 5 20 War unto them that call evil good and good evil that put forth that put Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter see what is it why would they do that is because they have misplaced love their their their their their love has Men been misdirected well the Bible says they become lovers of their own selves lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so then they have love but it's not Divine love before because Divine love loves God first it's perverted love and so only by Divine love can you correctly prioritize love according to scripture notice if a man is going to love indeed and in truth again he must love God first and foremost because you sisters have Divine love and you love people with Divine love what does that make you do it makes you dress right makes you act right you act totally you talk holy you live holy you dress like a lady should be you're willing to suffer persecution for it you're willing to suffer mockery for it why you love God first and foremost and with that you love indeed and in truth about you loved your neighbor indeed in truth how could you love your neighbor and put it on a pair of pants hello aren't your actions leading them to hell how can you love your neighbor your brother and and cut your hair sisters then your love is misplaced because you're misdirecting them well that could go with anything you're getting joined in the gossip session then how can you say that's love when you're misdirecting so many hello so we find that if you love with Divine love then you sisters it makes you dress holy act holy talk holy because you don't want to do anything that would be a stumbling block to someone who is watching your life ain't that right now you're going to be a stumble block to a lot of folks just simply because they they can't see God in the veil of Flesh so they're looking for critic uh uh uh always looking for things to criticize I don't care if it's the musician hit the note wrong there's always going to be somebody there to criticize that I don't care what you do you know Pastor blew his nose wrong and there's going to be somebody that'll criticize that but we're not talking about that we're talking about somebody that that is such Divine love that through all of your mistakes through everything that you go through you're staying right with that word I don't care if it's called if you have to repent you repent because the Bible said so I don't care if you've got to make things right you make it right because the Bible says so I I don't I don't care what it is see and because you Brothers love people with Divine love what does it do it causes you to live right act right talk right think right can you say man because you don't want to hinder somebody from coming to Christ you're not this kind of love is not looking for a pat on the back it's not looking for the Applause of men it's not looking for everybody to like you why because you know the Bible says blessed are those that are going to persecute you for my name's sake right if they persecuted him they're going to persecute us ain't that right yeah yeah but see the Divine love causes you to go through brother Brandon said if I love you I'll tell you the truth now see what is that that's loving God and loving his neighbor in word and indeed for people that don't tell the truth and and you're what you're you're being friend well I'm gonna be friends I love them I just love them oh bless your heart and they're just crying sobbing complaining about the church they're complaining about that oh bless your heart you just come over here honey bunny you don't see if you really love their soul you'll tell them the truth you won't lend your eye your ears to the garbage can or make your ears as garbage cans come on ain't that right so this what it means to love indeed and in truth you you can't say I love people and then refuse to tell them about the message of the hour you you you you can you you can't love people I mean with Godly love now I'm talking about Divine love and then refuse to tell them the truth about about what's coming upon the Earth I don't care if they hate you I don't care whatever Jesus so loved the the father that he was done he had the father's business he wasn't out for every healing campaign he he wasn't do you know why the prophet said there's very few people that really knew that he was on the earth and he said why would he go around the Pharisees and the Sadducees that hated him he said it wasn't for them per se it wasn't for them it was for there was an elect that was among them so he knew that there was going to be a set that would hate him and despising but that didn't matter he loved with Divine love and he was after that man's soul who the elect and you say Amen so you can't love God and then have a misplaced love for your neighbor if you love God then you love what he loves you hate what he hates if you love God then you will love the soul of a man you with me you'll love the soul of a man that's why brother Branham you know he didn't he didn't do humanitarian works he didn't go out and feed the poor he didn't get us together and say all right let's let's do like John 3 16 and missions and this and that and that he was after the soul of a man as much as he loved people and he hated to see the Affliction he didn't go out and trying to heal every Afflicted person he was after that soul of a man now that's Divine love when you really love your neighbor as thyself how many wants to go to hell oh you don't want to go to hell y'all don't want to go to hell then love your brother as you would love yourself love him so much we've given Christmas gifts and we'll give them this and we'll give them that and never tell them about God never tell them that they need the Lord never tell them about the truth of this message but if you loved your neighbor as thyself you don't want to perish and we know that that you can give a house to somebody and they're lost that doesn't save them you can give away your car you can give away it all and it doesn't help them we're talking about the soul of a man when you love the soul of a man that's what God loved God so loved the world he loved the soul of the man then you won't live to be accepted by all you won't live to be liked by all you won't live for the Praises of man you live to win that soul to Christ that's been predestinated you live to be a light in darkness to that predestinated soul let them laugh at you let them scoff you whatever but there's one thing they'll know about it you love God and you love them from the soul you're after the soul brother Brown so loved man that he was willing to be rejected by the churches he was willing can you imagine aren't you glad that there was someone on the Earth that had a passion for Souls that he turned down the million dollars that was given him he turned down all the prestige of these preachers of these denominations to where he said I have no church to preach into but he did it for the lost for the love of a soul he stayed with the word for the love of the Soul he wouldn't just stop shh uh shut up they wouldn't shut his mouth up because he had a love for the soul and I'm one of them Souls you're one of them Souls now we are the ones that that has to have that confidence and you say man see so then see you you're out to rescue that predestinated soul from hell and to do that then you must become a prisoner to the father's will which is his word is that not what Jesus said I am come to do the father's will I can do nothing except the father show me my meat is to do the will of the father ain't that right he went and prayed for that one man when there was all kinds of lameens and and and and and and and people that were dying and all that and he went and touched that dead prayed for that one man told that one man to rise up take your bed and walk amen Annie what brother Brown said he wasn't even going to die he had had an inflection for 30 some years amen but he done exactly what the father showed him why he loved the Lord thy God so only then can Divine love when you become a prisoner uh to the father's will only then can Divine love be manifested indeed and in truth Paul tells us that a man can give all his Goods to feed the poor but that's not a manifestation of divine love he can know all the mysteries of the of the Bible but that's not a manifestation of divine love he can give his body to be burned but that's not a Divine manifestation of divine love he can speak with tongues of men and angels but that's not a manifestation of divine love manifestation of divine love is when you do the will of the father then you say man persecuted yes despised yes scorned ridiculed misunderstood laughed that talked about yes but men's Applause is not what we seek for right ain't that right now how can this be how how can how can Jesus be willing to go to the Cross how can Paul be willing to be beheaded how can all these the the the the the the the the Saints throughout the the the the uh history amen be willing to give their lives and all that why because they had confidence [Music] hello love produces confidence love and confidence goes hand in hand to love God and not have confidence in him shows that there's something wrong ain't that right to love God and say I love God and yet not have confidence in him shows that there's something wrong now I want to go into that for just a moment and then I'll let you go now if you'll read just let's continue reading in First John 3 and 19th verse and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart everybody say our heart condemn us well God is greater and knoweth all things but if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence with God toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight so then we find that the confidence leads when the heart condemns ain't that right and and and and our heart condemns us when there's sin in our lives when we're not doing the will of the father our heart condemns us then you have no confidence and if you have no confidence then fear tries to get in right because then what what happens sin separates our relationship with God it does not mean that you're you're a sinner it does not mean anything like that but sin when you have sin in your life when you're holding on to sin I don't care what it is if God convicts you of something and you're holding on to that you cannot have relationship with God until that's done and you say man so it's not that a person isn't a Christian but sin interferes with relationship with our relationship with God one-on-one this is why we must keep everything under the blood because we want confidence everybody say we want confidence now brother Brown said if there's something in your life that condemns you you'd better make that right I don't care what in the world see you just can't operate right the Holy Spirit can't deal with you when you've got Prejudice selfishness and all those things in you the Holy Spirit can never bless you you might get some intellectual emotion some work up but if there's that something in you then it takes the confidence away we're still talking about fear now if there's something there that takes away that Faith amen and that confidence and and remember God knows your heart God knows my heart God knows all about us he so knows us that he's the one that puts that condemnation there he's the one we can call it conviction whatever now there is such a difference between a person who whose heart doesn't condemn them and whose heart does condemn and and there's a difference brother Brown gives the example of a woman getting married and she's afraid that she's not going to have a baby she won't have it see that fear if she's afraid she's not going to have it she won't have it no but let her go and adopt a baby then she'll have one see what it it he said now the book claims that that's nine out of ten will do that why it sets her body in the right condition or the right emotion now he says go ask your doctor and see if that's not right why it puts her in the right attitude now this means something to us because see if if if fear is there it brings a certain attitude if confidence comes it brings a certain attitude if fear comes it'll affect your worship if you have confidence it'll affect your worship if if you have if you have fear it'll affect how you you listen to the word and how you receive the word if you have confidence it affects you on how you receive the word and how you hear the word it all depends on whether the confidence is there the faith is there or fear has gripped your heart it's true can you say man so condemnation brings a fear upon us to where we become paralyzed and God can't do nothing for us ain't that right job brother Brown says job said the things that I feared worse has come upon me see you want to be above everything to where there's no condemnation or nothing to you you've got to live like real Christians live in the presence of God live daily hourly momently say nothing do nothing go nowhere see Let It Be Christ like everything you do all your actions God requires us absolutely to abstain from all the things of the world separation the world wants mixers they will go down to the beach and bathe and and have card parties in the basement bunco in the church let me tell you God wants separators who will separate men and women from sin listen it condemns so now you can understand why the churches are full of people that have fear upon them but there's an elect that is going to be have confidence that is gonna drive that fear now we've been given the secret on how to get rid of that fear keep your relationship with God right let nothing come in between you and God for he is our confidence I hope that's okay did you know man's not made to lie you take a person take take brother shamaya you know uh it's about 12 46 12 45 I guess which means it's time for me to close but you you you take brother schmann in a week later week from today's got a friend that's in trouble with the law and so he likes that friend so he's going to go and vouch for that friend and so he goes up there and tells the law I I I I was there you know maybe in Chicago I was here in Chicago last week Sunday at 12 45 I was there so I know he didn't do it I was with him then they put him on the LIE detectors now he's telling them straight face he's given all the best he can give it I was here I know he didn't do it but you know what that lie detector is going to do he's lying he's lying why because man wasn't made to lie right man man wasn't so brother Brown says now intellectually intellectually brother shamaya could be could could be telling telling him right you know but they've got something a machine that'll go deeper than the intellect that goes Deeper Than Just Words it goes down into that soul and there's something in that Soul no matter what it's saying here and no matter what's here there's something in that soul that they've actually got a machine to find out what's there and Cindy's lying it's not right because the heart is condemning him right he's saying one thing but down in his soul it's speaking out and they got a machine to pick it up so he's lying now God knows our thoughts he looks upon the heart I know that word scripture has been so abused and misplaced where God does not look upon the outward appearance he looks upon the heart so they say the outward appearance doesn't matter it does matter but one thing about it what more matters is your heart your soul and you want your soul and your body you want your spirit you want everything to line up that way when God looks at that soul and it cries out God can look at your life and say it's truth is truth it's truth right oh I love God but he knows what's saying in the heart he lying he's either saying he lied or saying it's the truth it's the truth can you say man and when it all lines up it's the truth it's the truth there's a confidence I don't know how it all works but I do know there becomes a confidence not a condemnation I think all of us have have come to a place that when we've done is wrong there's something that condemns us you try to pray that thing's still there it's condemning you try to you try to serve God it's still there and what it's doing it's taking away your confidence trying to pray you can't believe God for it now you're trying to serve God and it's still there why it's taken away the confidence that condemnation but you get it under the blood and Watch What Happens you come with a smile Lord I love you why because now you know he loves you there's nothing there to block that voice there's nothing there to block that loving voice to you seeing allows Satan to come in and start speaking to you and you're trying to Lord do you really love me God do you are you really for me God God is a is it just if there's something there get rid of it I don't care what it is it could be the smallest thing if there's something there because you don't want fear you want confidence in God if the musicians will come brother Brown said if you can't throw back an old Prejudice and selfishness how do you expect God to ever answer your prayer oh you can speak with tongues and jump over the seats and shout and beat the tambourines and talk about your neighbor out there don't you expect God to ever answer prayer for you another place he said God will never hear your prayer as long as you hide iniquity in your heart he will not do it see so if if our heart condemns us then no matter what we say or do we cannot have confidence toward God so we've got to keep the relationship keep in relationship with God brother Branham another place said there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power amen thinking of this first John 4 18 it says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out all fear because fear hath torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love now notice 19th verse we love him because he first loved us right we love him love divine love can't exist without his love shining upon us and when there's something that is blocking it now it doesn't mean that God's love has changed toward us it means that there's something there's the clouds that is blocking it from actually reflecting upon us and for you know it we have an effect because we're only reflectors right we're only reflectors so when his love can absolutely shine upon our soul then we have confidence and we love him back and not only do we love him back but we love everyone else as he loves us remember as I have loved you so love you one another right so we we find that love towards God cannot exist until we get the revelation of his love toward us and until that come fear will torment us and notice what happens when fear comes a man will always constantly question God's love for him he will questions God's grace toward him he will question God's dealing with him he will question the promises of God as to whether or not they are for him fear hath torment amen all do you love him how can a man correctly love God and his neighbor when he has lost his confidence in God he then becomes needy so he looks for approval security applauds he looks for the accolades of men and many good men have compromised on God's word simply because they're in need of approval they're in need of a standing ovation so they're in need of Praises of men which is a sign they've lost confidence in God [Music] fear has gripped them many young people have turned aside to the world because they're not competent in the love of God so then they become fearful of rejection fear of being made fun of fear of being alone fear fear fear fear but God has not given us that spirit of fear the Bible says we've not received the spirit of fear but we've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father our God ain't that right to serve and Paul would tell us that the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are sons of God the confidence remains all the Lord is wonderful what song Greater is he greater is he that is that is greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me he that is in the world will on the day a panic cost a
