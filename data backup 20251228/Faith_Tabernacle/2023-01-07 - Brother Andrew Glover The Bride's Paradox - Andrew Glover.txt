========================================

shall follow them they believe he's got to keep that word and because he said it it went through his mouth it got to be fulfilled all scriptures got to be fulfilled so it's a paradox alone to hear Jesus the son of God make such a statement as that the things that I do what you do also now the Bible said Hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever that's a paradox because it has to be done it was an earth will pass away but not one word that I've ever said will ever fail he said it has to be done now friends I believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever I believe he's just as able this afternoon the cause in this building are paradox because that he promised it would happen and how much more has he promised how much more is it leaning in the Bible to this very age that we're living the Ephesians again of the church ages we got seven Church ages and we're promised that the lady will see a church ate there would be another Ephesian it's right and we're here I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ who made the promise as I said my last message standard where he gets that wall I want to share a few weeks ago every time you move your finger that goes around around the world never will stop every move you make you'll sit at the judgment television proves that it's here the fourth dimension because the television doesn't manufacture that picture it only channels that wave into a tube and you see the picture Connor everything every moving object is happening in the world going round around through here now making a record someday your record is going to be closed and you're going to answer to that record he's trying God let me so be planted let me be so damn to myself and anything around me be conscious of the word of God living among us today let's pray Lord Jesus Thy Art of paradox when God was made flesh I pray heavenly father that you will manifest yourself this afternoon proving to us here today not only proving to who's there's I suppose 90 or more of the people said here believe that every word but that we might see you again and let know that this word that you spoke that's still traveling around and around the world just like a record let us move into that record today Lord let us move in and not hear it just like it was coming secondly from a man's mouth but let that mouth and person and people all sitting here become your word we're ready to die Lord of our own ideas just to see you keep your promise the things that I do shall you do also I pray that you'll Grant this in Jesus name amen just before we call a prayer line let's have a little a lot of ice cream one day with an old doctor friend of mine he said I want to ask you something Billy I said all right said Do You Believe In that's where it got this thought paired off said you believe in a paradox I said sure he said I know you do he said told me about a certain person had been healed and been prayed for that his soul epilepsy drugs to it for years sometimes it had seven or eight seizures a day strong medicines he said they never did come back for no more I see him all the time never had it no more don't taste something just let you know I believe what you're talking about he said during time the depression my son here now it's over the over the store said he was he's waiting on counter young fellow just could study oh they're standing down in line for medicine and said a man come up here and he had his wife's a little woman she was you could look at her and see she was just about to be delivered of any time of a child and said she just couldn't stand that line no more so that he brought his wife into the door just leaned on his shoulder and said my boy went up say can I help you said yes I said here's a prescription from the doctor but said I want to make it clear to you he said uh we haven't got the money yet said we're get it from the county but my wife just can't stand it no longer doctor said she had the medicine right away it's a if you just give her the medicine I'll go right there and stand in the line until I I get the money from the county and the boy said sir I'm sorry said it's against our our rules here to give out the medicine without having the money you know how the times it wasn't them days he said I I feel sorry for everybody can't do it he said I was sitting back here reading a paper and I looked up and said something strangely warmed my heart then I walked up I said wait a minute son wait a minute the man started out the door said well all right son started out the door and said I said just a minute so what was that he said what's this man explained it to him he said let me see the prescription said just wait a minute son I'll get you the medicine mixed up the prescription the doctor had prescribed on his paper and said I went up there and had that mountain he said hand it to him not know where I get it out but I just thought it would said it just felt as she did and said Billy when I put that that medicine in that woman's hand said it was the Lord Jesus so I seen a man standing there and he said I read later on that the scripture said in so much as you have done at the least of the end my little ones you have done it unto me he said Billy what happened to my eyes did I actually see it I said yes sir I believe it I believe that you so fulfilled your duty as a druggist and the emergency needing for that Jesus said what you have done unto these others you have done unto me I believe it and I believe that same thing today right here present with this people that Jesus Christ can manifest himself make himself the word made flesh Among Us this afternoon will you believe it Lord bless you now we're going to call for prayer cards for the people to come and uh we can't get too many because I think now if I look at the watch right I got 25 minutes till we have to close just at four o'clock on time but we'll continue on now let's start from prayer card um I believe it's a wasn't a let's go from A1 who has preparator A1 it's 21 at times so if you're crippled we can pack it all right prayer card A1 who has it raise up your hands somewhere in the building or way back in the back would you come lady if you can one two who has prayer card two a two would you raise up your hand if you and you walk all right come out over here get on this side three if you raise your hand right away I I can get you we won't have to wait for it on prayer card number three would you raise up your hand all right uh man down there all right come over here sir prayer card number four would you raise your hand quickly not as quick as you possibly can prayer card number four all right number five just as I call you stand up number five all right number six number seven number eight number nine ten Tiana ten all right eleven twelve thirteen fourteen where's you coming sir 14 14 15. foreign [Music] attention now Jesus made this promise that a little while and the world won't see me anymore yet ye shall see me you believe that yes the world the world is the order of the world see that he don't think want often passions and things but they won't see me anymore yet you'll see me or he promised I'll be with you even to the end of the world is that right and the Bible said Hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday to him forever you believe that that's a promise now you don't have to be up here to be healed only thing you have to do is believe that word to be the truth now I'm going to ask you if you will just to be Reverend and quiet for a few moments did all of them come in Billy got two out three out I'd say three more number three prayer card number three what how what's the Mexican word for that three anybody can say it art surely they heard it what that everybody's got that prayer card uh to come into the line with you or if I think it was somebody had it and didn't know it and moved back all right now now how about as everybody believe now with all your with all your heart well let's pray again and Lord Jesus now we realized that we can read the word with our best of our knowledge explain it but Lord You're the only one can confirm it you're the only one can say that it's right or wrong father I pray today that you'll let the eyes of the people be open may we see a paradox this afternoon just Lord enough to let the people see that you're present that you are not out of existence at your word same yesterday day and forever for you are that word for the sake of the sick Lord for the sake of those who are suffering many probably are here from different parts of the country but parts of the nation Amos they're suffering so they couldn't enjoy them the meetings otherwise if there wasn't healed I pray that you'll heal granted Lord and now we're only physical human beings and can only preach the word and say what you said to be the truth now Thou Art the one to make it real I pray that you'll granted in Jesus name amen now I'd just like for your undivided attention just for a moment and if everyone will just be seated now for a few minutes now as far as I know of course I don't know anyone and I can see in the in the building that I would know out there now you don't have to be here to be healed anyone knows that see there's a little woman one time she couldn't get a prayer card with say and she touched His Garment and he turned around and looked and said who touched me and they all denied it he looked around and seen this little woman she couldn't hide herself because see the spirit of God that was in him let him he was the word and it led right to her and he told her what her trouble was she had a blood issue and she was healed she believed it and immediately in her body she felt that the blood issue had stunts is that right it stopped right there now he's just the same today you don't have to be here now the Bible said that in the New Testament now that Jesus Christ is our high priest do we believe that the only high priest we have the only intercessor we have between God and man is the man Christ Jesus you believe that and the Bible said he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities is that right I mean all that true raise your hands all right I'm not among strangers on this word now how would he act act the same that he did when he was here because he's the same yesterday and forever is that right now you just believe you just say oh Lord I've been in meetings of it but I'm just going to believe today I'm not even going to take no thought of myself I'm just going to believe with all my heart that you're here I have a need and you just you help me Lord you do that don't get nervous just just calmly faithful a gift of faith is not something you take and do something with a gift of faith is just get yourself out of the way the gift is get your own self out of the way now here stands a woman father God knows as far as I ever know what I've ever seen a woman in my life she's a total stranger to me but there isn't about two or three people I can see out there to do um I think this is Mrs Vale sitting here brother Lee's wife I'm not sure no no these three four boys sitting right along here alone here or as I know that's all and I see in the meeting at this time that I know I'll be that's brother Anthony Milano is sitting here from New York brother Pat Tyler from Kentucky outside of that I'm afraid stopman's in there somewhere I heard him holler a man a while ago that's that's about the limit the heavenly father knows that and this woman standing here and I never seen her I have no idea what she's here for she's just a woman come up here on the platform and see me you're sitting out there now If This Woman's in need well then I if I could help her I'd sure do it but I I depends on what she needs if it was money uh might rake up five or ten dollars outside of that I don't know let's say give her a post-dated check until I get my pay next month but now what if she's got domestic trouble then I'd say go get your husband let's talk together maybe I can help you I have no way of getting home well I ask somebody if they take you take you home going your way you live you live what street down dancing but I don't know the woman but there's someone here this word that promised the things that I do shall you also now perhaps what if this woman is sick maybe she's got cancer maybe she has TB and or something that medicine can't help at this at the stage well now I couldn't I by no means could heal the woman but now if he can reveal to me what she wants just like he did the woman at the well or like he told Nathaniel or or told Simon what his name was said your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas it's forth you be called Peter which means a little Stone well now if he would do something like that here in the presence of all of you that goes to shoulder that word is truth how many will believe that is there anybody here knows the woman raise your hand any people's in the building yeah all right father knows that I don't but now let's just see what he would say and that would that be a paradox I don't know what's wrong with her don't know what she's here for nothing about her but God knows that I'm going to speak to the woman this is the first person I've had before me for about three months now I just want to talk to the lady just a moment and that is what contact your spirit just like Jesus did the woman at the well contact your spirit now if the Lord Jesus lady can reveal to me uh what's wrong with you what you're here for or something about it you know what I don't know nothing about uh something on that order would you believe it was him it had to be him wasn't it it had to be him if he'll do it then we'll all be thankful that we're nowhere that his word is right then we can put confidence in that now if he can reveal what your trouble is to me and me not knowing and you know that but now if he can reveal to me what your trouble is or something about you then that shows that there's a spirit here somewhere that knows you and you know that I don't so it wouldn't be the man it would be the spirit and that's what God promised at this time of Ephesus you believe that to be the truth may he Grant him I see one thing She's suffering with something like a sinus troubles up here in her head that is true is it raise up your hand if it amen but scientists wouldn't cause you to sneeze and carry on like that so you have hay fever also you're not from Phoenix you're from Worthy's there's lots of hills trees you're from Flagstaff you believe God can tell me who you are Mrs Earl ier is it right is it I go believing it'll all be over I didn't see the same yesterday and forever now the Heavenly Father Knows see the word Vindicated now it isn't me I'm just a man just like this microphone it's a mute without me speaking to it or somebody and so is a man it's the new but it's the spirit and that spirit's right out there among you see he's the Healer not me how do you do sir another man that's a person is a stranger to me I don't know the man as far as I know I've never seen him in my life but now this spirit the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in Jesus Christ is the same self-spirit the anointed one Jesus the man was the son of God but the Holy Spirit was only with God my father dwells in me see it's the holy spirit so it's still God now if I missed it myself that man can get himself out of the way then that part's dead then let the spirit of Life go to work that's why weakness didn't see what happens till the morning gets started if the Lord God whose presence we're in will reveal to me sir what the your trouble is or something you've done or or something about you just something of course more we would talk more it would go but see his other standing alone but if he'll just tell me what your trouble is well uh you believe me to be his servant leave his presence a rupture is that right [Music] I say how was that done I wished I know there's nobody can explain that that's a paradox yeah that you might know I've seen something else an examination a heart trouble too raise your hand Mr Anderson you can go home now Jesus Christ that's right just believe I have faith how do you do sir we're strangers to each other I don't know you as far as I know it's the first time I've ever seen you or me said oh that's right but he knows both of us now you know why this has taken place it's his grace permitting him they would bring these people conscious of God now not knowing nothing about you not even knowing you're no way just a strange man to come here now it would be a absolutely a paradox or something to happen to to know what was wrong with you or something you've done or something you ought not have done or something you should have done or so who you are or something about you it has to be a paradoxical there's no way for anybody to know that outside of some revelation of the Unseen that's right now if he'll do that for you between you and I it's only the audience not a show but that they might see the the Ephesus is here that this is the thing that Bridges between the nomination and the glory land he promised it that they might be assured that what we're telling is the truth now to know you you know I don't that's raise up your hand so people sees it uh I've never seen a man in my life it's just a man standing here asking the others foreign but you're suffering with a rupture you also have hemorrhoids you've come a long ways to get here you're not even an American you're a Canadian you brought with you a son that has mental affliction you may tell you where you're from here in the The Province of Saskatchewan Saskatoon the city believeth all your heart and God will send you back home well with your son you lead us God bless you believe the Lord God Still Remains God there's none other but him how do you do there's a lady a stranger to me perhaps a little older I've never seen her but she's she's just a woman standing here I go to I have to hurry because he just got seven or eight minutes now uh just look here do you believe that these things are true with all your heart you know it's impossible for me to know what's wrong with you or anything about you but it isn't possible for God to know because he know being before there was a world isn't that right how many believe that to be true whatever time you bat your eye infinite and just think by his grace he's presented with his gospel the same thing he promised to do then there's a heaven and we're going to it and we're in this Ephesus right now we're in this coming out of one into another you have so many things wrong with your complications so many things wrong and you're not from here you're from west of here you're from California that's right [Music] you also have Sun that's Afflicted that's right foreign you have someone that's close to you that lives in Chicago that knows me that's right it's true and you know I don't know you but you believe God knows who you are Mrs McGuire you've got your request the whole

God is tremendous amen his strength never failth hey Manny he'll go through the fire amen just to save a sinner amen I think of the prophet of God talking about the love of a mother one time he said that she was willing to escape the fires he said but when she got out she realized that her baby was still trapped inside and he said she turned and ran back in the fire he said covered her face up ran in the fire to get her baby since she realized in there that she didn't have nothing to wrap that baby in so she took the Garment off of her face and wrapped the baby in that garment and carried the baby out of the fire and brother bear said that baby is not bearing scars today but the mother is he said because she was willing to run into the fire and I I tell you I think that love was coming from almighty God Amen that we were burning up in the fires of the world and the tribulations of this life but God would send a prophet to run after us with a message of Grace amen well it sure is an honor and a privilege to be uh have this privilege to speak to you tonight and if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to to turn in the word of the Lord to the Book of John the 14th chapter amen how many is feeling revived amen amen I'll tell you the prophet of God's words ring true in my heart tonight that Revival is not necessarily add new members but it's Reviving the ones that you got amen and he said you can have a Revival and add 100 new members and not be no Revival at all but I tell you when the spirit of the Lord breaks Out Among the church then lives are changed and hearts are strengthened and situations are fixed and sicknesses are healed and demons are defeated and amen I believe we've been privileged this week to see all that amen transpire right here before us and just before we read the word let's just buy our our hearts together tonight and humble our spirits and his presence and I mean we'll just slip your hand up and say Lord speak to me tonight amen he's mindful Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Saturday evening service Lord of these meetings father as we've been in your presence throughout the week Lord just Lord how else can we say it but just wave after wave of your glory and or the brush of angels Wings throughout the building father Lord I believe that you have been doing things here this week Lord that only eternity will tell the benefits of what's been done in this meeting this week you're a father Lord I'm reminded of the words of your Prophet when he said I'll leave a town or go to the next meeting he said and you pastors and you ministers here you'll be hearing things in your congregation for days to come of the supernatural things that God done Lord we don't always see it in a physical manifestation but Lord we have no question in our heart that you're moving Among Us Lord we have no we have no reservation to testify that the Mighty God has walked in this building this week and Lord as we come here or to this portion of the meeting I pray that you your spirit would come tonight Lord may you open the windows of Heaven tonight may you drive out every spirit in this building that was crept its way in that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord ever demon of Torment of sickness it will try to afflict the precious uh children's body I pray God that you would destroy that thing tonight Lord and father May the May the spirit of Revelation and wisdom and or understanding knowledge Lord may it come into this building tonight and for those hands that have been slipped up Lord they've not come to hear from a man but Lord they have come to hear from the son of man so father we invite you may you take this microphone as it were Lord and may you speak to your children father may you speak through me Lord may you hear through the Believers Lord and may we be edified and may we be changed oh god father we commit this meeting tonight into thy faithful hands have your way Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says a man and amen I want tonight to turn to the Book of John the 14th chapter and I want to look here in the 12th verse I know it's very very familiar reading in John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse Jesus says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me how many believes on him he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father amen let's just read that 12th verse together verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now I believe that John 14 12 is speaking of both the head of Christ amen and the body amen if we can also look in first John the fourth chapter I just want to pull one verse there that's very familiar to the Believers tonight first John the fourth chapter I want to look in the fourth verse first John 4 and 4 you love the Lord this evening amen first John 4 and 4 the Bible says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater now brother Brian says that greater is Christ the anointed word because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word is you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments I want to speak to you tonight if I title this sermon I want to speak to you on the bride's Paradox uh the bride's Paradox I I really don't believe that after uh four services on the Rapture that we could quickly move away from the thought of rapture simply because amen the word of God is eternal it's inspired it's infallible it's a perfect word amen now as I mentioned the title tonight the bride's Paradox I also want to say it's a real privilege to have the best family with us here they're really special to our hearts Amen in the Book of John you read that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and you hear about Greater Works now when you think of this word paradox you know that brother Brown preaches the message Paradox about six different times and tonight I'm going to be pulling a lot from all uh six of those tapes I'm not going to preach all of them but I'm pull up from them and then the message Paradox 1961 first time he preaches it he said oh the only thing that God is waiting on now is he wants to get one man he don't have to have big organizations he don't have to have big denominations he wants to get one man that he can wrap his Spirit into him that'll tell the rest of it now watch this there will be another Paradox if he can just get one man in his control there will be another paratox he said until he can get someone completely surrendered that will do that he said that's the way God does his work he uses paradoxes amen our God is Jehovah amen he's the Jehovah of Miracles and the way that he works is through paradoxes now brother says in Paradox 1963 according to Webster he said a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true can we say that together incredible but yet it's true it's something that you cannot scientifically wrap your mind around but it's still true something the prophet said it's unreasonable but it's still true it's unexplainable but it's still true he said therefore a paradox then would be the same as a miracle so now amen of paradox a prophet has identified as a miracle he said a paradox is when something that seems like it just couldn't be amen the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven to be true now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it he said then that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's true can we say that again it's incredible but yet it's true now watch this you people today he says watch a lot of modernists believe that the days of Miracles are passed they don't believe there's such a thing as a miracle but yet I believe that the world is full of Miracles how many can raise your hand and testify amen that you still believe the god of the Bible amen Jehovah of the old Jesus of the I knew amen is a miracle working God Amen he's a paradox performing god brother Ben said Paradox is constantly so Paradox is not something that visits the church it's not something that amen that happens just in a special meeting amen but every service amen that Believers get together amen the god of paradox is in the building said what makes a paradox is when somebody believes God and takes him at his word what makes a paradox is when somebody believes God Amen and they take him at his word he said that word paradox is something that is incredible but it's true he said now you know we've heard the old saying that truth amen is more strings and fiction how many has heard that saying truth is more strange Than Fiction he said see because when a person tells the truth amen it's something that's very strange when a person tells the truth it is something that is very strange listen amen I know it does not it it does not sound strange to you Amen to hear somebody say that one day there was a tumor in their body and the next day that tumor was gone that doesn't sound strange to you amen because you're Children of the god of paradox it does not sound strange to you to hear somebody say they were blind for 20 years and in a meeting amen God come down and open their blinded eyes that doesn't sound strange to you amen because you're in the you're the child of the god of paradox amen but what does sound strange to the world Amen should not sound strange to a Believer and what sounds familiar Amen to the believer amen is going to sound strange to the world Listen friends amen we are not here and layout of sea Amen to take a backseat Amen to the devil affection to the devil of science to the devil amen of knowledge we are here as the Church of the Living God Amen to take a stand and let a lost and Dying World know that for God that we are serving is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he is not in a grave in Jeffersonville Indiana amen he's not a million miles away but he is right here ain't been robed in the righteousness us of his resurrection he is moving he is healing he is saving he is delivered he is still performing paradoxes amen there's no mountain too high and there's no Valley too low there's no desert too dry there's no trial too long amen by what the god of paradox will come on the scene amen and in the moment in the twinkling of the night amen he will change the situation amen I know it sounds strange to the world but it is shouting sounds to the Church of the Living God Amen the world accepts fiction but they reject Vindicated truth think about that the world accepts a fictional story but they reject they prove and Vindicated truth of almighty God now the prophet said truth is more Stranger Than Fiction isn't him he said one time over in Switzerland they tell their children amen that William Tell shot the Apple off of a boy's head you read the story he said but when I come over there that's a lie it's never been done they've been thinking about this how many parents Amen brother us have had to go against our own conscience they meant to tell that lie amen that hundreds of years later that lie amen may still be living in a child's heart to believe that William Tell shot an apple off of this boy's head listen friends we ain't got to lie to tell our children amen that Georgia Carter got up out of a band we ain't gonna lie to tell our children that Florence Nightingale was down to nothing and the saving grace of God raised tobacco we're not lying when we tell our children that William Upshaw was in a wheelchair for 66 years but in a moment in the tweaking amen of an eye in a meeting a man got out of a wheelchair I'm on Church we're not a bunch of liars we're not a bunch of crazy people we are Sons and Daughters of Truth and I think it's time to raise our voice and let our young people know what God did for us he can do it for them what God did for our pastors he can do it for them what God did for the prophet he is here to do it for you amen you didn't come in late amen you didn't come in too late you're still in the presence of the god of paradox amen I think I feel like preaching here tonight is there anybody can testify amen that our God is still a miracle working God is there anybody that can testify amen I shouldn't be sitting here tonight amen it's incredible to think that I'm Not Dead in a grave but it's true it's incredible to think that the devil's through everything he had at me he's done everything he could to steal my joy and to silence my praise and discuss my testimony amen but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and every time the devil tried to Bear you he forgot that there was a germanized representation of the god of paradox on the inside of your soul I want you back up to no devil affection won't you back up to no negative devil don't you back up to no cancer devil I want you back up to no depression devil won't you back up to no suicidal level you have been anointed amen by the god of paradox to pursue that death and to recover everything that devil has stole from you as a child of the god of paradox hey it's a paradox we are living in an evil world how many agrees we are living in an evil world Amen but I want to say this we are Sanctified by the god of righteousness we are living in an evil world but we are Sanctified by the god of righteousness what does that mean that is a paradox it's incredible but it's true I love what Jesus said I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but thou shall keep them from the evil so he's not going to take you out of the world to overcome the world he's going to leave you in the world to overcome the world Amen because greater is he that is in you that is in the world that he that is in the world oh my what is that church that's a paradox he said they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through the truth amen for Thy word is truth watch this we've just identified what truth is truth is the word remember said the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced what was John 14 12 saying amen Greater Works than this how you do he said the word is God and the spirit is God and they are all one see one cannot work apart from the other he said notice if only one true had the spirit of God he will have the word of God that's how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them brother they did not find the word the word found them he said see that is how it was with Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him and Jesus both began to do and teach my Doctrine it's not my own but the father that sent me he said remember now John the Baptist was both prophet and the messenger of his name he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in the Jordan of the word of God Jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly Spirit field that's the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost is that Jesus said would be the evidence he said I will pray the father he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive you know why they cannot receive the spirit of truth because they have received the spirit of error which has caused them to believe a lie and to be damned by lie amen but there is a pride upon the Earth who is not believing a lie and she's not being done by lie and she's not wondering to laodicea under a strong Spirit of delusion but she has risen above amen the deceptions of laodicea she has risen above the confusions of this age and she is standing underneath the direction of the spirit of truth and the word is the truth my Jesus said the word amen would come only to the Holy Ghost see the word and the spirit are not separate they are the same thing he said did you notice that Jesus said the word the world could not receive the Holy Ghost there's why they're not seeing paradoxes as they cannot receive the one that performs the paradox right well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets then the word will come to you here it is the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word so the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not your shouting it's not our dancing it is not Pentecostals identifying it as speaking in tongues but the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the receiving of the anointed word in the allotted AIDs that you're living in hormone Church the prophets that the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truthful word amen but to receive the truth which is the word and to believe it and Obey it listen You'll never see a paradox just believe in the word you'll ever see a paradox just shouting about the word but when you can believe that word and you can obey that word and you can fight back against every devil in hell with the authority of that word then you will see our tremendous God he will come into action and he will perform a paradox before your very eyes listen we are not in a picnic we're in a battle and it's a battle for truth the prophet set them in just been lost God said it would be restored again in the last day and we're looking for him we're looking for his manifestation and we will see the Vindicated word of God there'll be just a few understand it but as it was in the days of Noah can I preach as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man he said what was saved in the days of law there was actually three saved he said the wife started out amen and she was lost amen so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there will be very few saved amen translated in that time and one of the mysteries of that church being taken up can I tell you what the victory amen for the Battle of truth will be the victory in the Battle of truth will be the rapture the victory in the Battle of truth will be the Rapture you say why do you say that because the prophet said amen the Church of the Living God the bride she will move right on just the same listen she will go in the Rapture by the word she will not go in the Rapture by the way she feels she will not go in the Rapture by the way things are she will not go in the Rapture based upon end time conditions she will go in the Rapture upon the basis of the Vindicated manifested anointed word in the age listen that's right amen the word will take her in the Rapture listen I know we're living in an intellectual age I'm trying to keep from preaching Leia Foundation but y'all are pulling he said the intellectual age we're living in he is the same yesterday today and forever he can steal can I can I get a little class participation here he said he can still discern the thoughts of the human heart he can still change man he can still keep every word he promised in this day he can still manifest and let them take the picture that same color of fire that followed Israel the same one that was with the Lord Jesus the same one that was down where was Saul on the road the same one that come in and delivered Peter out of the prison he said that same angel of God is here tonight and he's doing the very same thing it did when it was here on Earth manifested Amen in human flesh people ask me they said with Andrew what is this message really is is it a book is it a tape is it a cliche is it a quote is it a Doctrine I'll tell you what I hear when I hear this message I hear about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever coming back into the Earth not in a Corporal body but in a redeemed body amen called The Flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ the same angel of God is here tonight and he's doing the very same thing it did when he was here on the Earth manifested in human flesh I'm on Church you ain't got to go back there to meet him he's come into this age to meet you you ain't got to go back to the prison house that Peter was in you ain't got to go back to the road of Damascus amen that Paul was home amen by brother Mark for one that was back there is in this building tonight and he's pulsating in my heart I am the same yesterday I am the same today I'll be the same tomorrow and behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man will hear my voice what is his voice brother Branham his voice is his word and it's a scriptural voice and he will open the door then I will come into him and I will sup with him and I will reveal myself among church it's supper time amen it's supper time it's time to open the door unless the service of the Lord come in and serve his Victorious children the bread which is a revelation of his word this is the angel of God back in human flesh can I preach I believe says that God is wanting people to believe in a paradox well Andrew I don't know if I can believe it the prophet just gave you a license he just gave you a right to believe in the god of paradox he said I went way over my time I believe it could be a paradox right here brother I read that today and something ran through my body I've been believe it could be a paradox right here I believe that God is willing and waiting to take his people and show himself if he can only get a man or a woman or a boy or a girl they meant to lay down their own thoughts and become a prisoner to him and believe him he is the word somebody help me he is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and brought Among Us he said and now he is in you come on Church what's making you a prisoner amen it's not your Mom and Daddy it's not the clothes you're wearing it's not the preacher you're here it's not the tapes you're listening to what is making you a prisoner it's the word has claimed your flesh in this wicked and adulterous generation your body has become the claiming grounds amen for the god of paradox to manifest himself through once again he is in you what is he he is the hope of glory he is the same yesterday today day and forever what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying we are in the god of paradox and the god of paradoxes in Us in other words it is a uniting time and the uniting side the god of paradox has come into the Flesh of people that believe in Paradox and brother Terry because they're believing in Paradox the god of paradox it's not just going to make them come to church and read about what he did for Noah and read about what he did for Abraham and read about what he did for Sarah oh God I feel like preaching but he's going to claim their bodies and he's going to make them paradoxes listen amen he's not going to rewrite Paul's story he's going to write Hope's story he's not going to rewrite Peter's story he's going to write Branson's story he's not going to rewrite William random story he's going to write Thomas this story by what Authority do you say he's going to write a story about this bride Greater Works than this how you do it's an incredible Paradox but it's true can anybody tell me what I just said is not true can anybody tell me that's what God that he that Hill cannot raise glory to God he said God of paradox what are you saying I'm saying we are in the god of paradox the god of paradoxes in US therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away sister Dan and all things are passed away I'm on church I don't know if you believe this or not but I'm gonna preach my heart it's a new day it's a new season it's a new age amen it's a fresh Revival I'm on church we ain't got to live under the stigmatism of under the stagnant amen ideas and denomination we do not have to approach one service under a history mentality we do not have to have one prayer line and talk about what God used to do but before we have a prayer line we can talk about what he did for Amos we can talk about what he did for Sean we can talk about what he did for Rayanne you know why because he's a god of paradox I'm on church we ain't got to talk about him delivering somebody 50 years ago we can talk about what he done for you Mariah we can talk about what he did for you brother Kevin because the god of paradox has come into the church and the church has come in to the god of paradise then I say with everything within me House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ there's a mighty God on the scene he's not a weak dirty old grandpa he's a mighty God he still performs paradoxes when it looks impossible he'll come true when it looks like it's too late he's right on time when it looks like for conditions they enter too bad he shows up in the Midnight Hour I'm on Church you say Melanie this is the darkest hour my family's ever seen this is the darkest hour my church has ever seen this is the darkest hour my body's ever seen thank you for telling me you are in a position to see the god of paradox because it's always the darkest of hours and then Jesus comes on the scene it's when there is nowhere else to turn to he shows up you know why because you've not been prettier to believe Baptist Doctrine you've not been prettier to believe Pentecostal shuck you you have been put here as a voice of the god of paradox If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things somebody say all things are become new I love what Paul says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory I believe that every man every born-again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves ah now we just figured out why you can't figure yourself out you're a paradox or you hearing me every born-again member of the body of Jesus Christ is a paradox Birmingham said I believe each one of you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran they never had an experience in the baptism of the Holy Spirit was in some formal church amen that did not believe in the genuine New Birth but have now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because Something's Happened to you that changed oh God it changed your whole being anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is it's a miracle can I take my sword out and preach for a second what are you going to preach against I'm going to preach against that negative devil that tells us every day we're not seeing Miracles I'm going to preach against that long tongue line slow foot Slicker devil Lucifer that tells us that we're just wasting our time we're just going to church and going to meetings and paying tithes and paying offerings and singing a few songs that is a Lie from the pits of hell you got up this morning you are a miracle you lived another week and Satan's heated listen if anybody got a right to shout tonight in the city of Blacksburg Virginia it's the Bride of Jesus Christ she lived another day in Satan's Eden and she's found her way in the house of God and she's not lost her mind she's not on dope trying to get through but she is a powerful bride she is a Victorious bride she is an anointed bride by the anointed word I'm known church and might as well say it you're a miracle you're a miracle rather Landing you're a miracle you're a miracle tonight every devil in hell has done everything he can to destroy this bride and here she stands tonight because she is a paradox oh a son and daughter of God not by the nomination not my Creed not by handshake by birth word Birth by a birth military that you have died to your own intellects and been born of the spirit of God and you are a paradox yourself how that you've been changed amen from Death unto life you have been changed from Death under life from your innermost being is a new creation in Christ Jesus it's a paradox can we say it again incredible but yet it's true incredible but yet it's true amen Shake somebody's hand slap somebody on the knee do somebody something to you next to you and say it's incredible but it's true it's incredible but it's true but Amos it's incredible but it's true what are you saying I'm saying this message is incredible but it's true I'm saying the seven things always incredible but he was true I'm saying the Bride of Jesus Christ Sister Janet she is incredible but she is true I'm going to church some of you all right here tonight amen need to let go and praise God because you lived another year from last year's January meetings and you didn't regress and you didn't go back amen but you're closer to the city that Abraham sent out to find you know why because the god of paradox is on your side that God apparentox is holding your hand he's bringing you through the palace he's bringing you through the mountains he's bringing you through the trials he's going to bring you out on the other side and he's going to present you as a spot the sinless Bride of Jesus Christ it's incredible it's incredible but it's true you know why it's the word doing this it's the word doing this his word that spoke I'm gonna try to behave brother Bill his word that spoke the world into existence can make every word that he ever promised come to pass the word that spoke the world into existence has come back into flesh and that voice is speaking the spoken word and bringing every promise of this Bible in to existence in other words Abraham you're up on the mountain and there is no Ram but you spoke the word and said listen the lad and I will return little let Abraham realize he was not speaking about brother Walker Going up here and killing a killing Isaac and then resurrecting him that's what he thought but what God Said Abraham you've been faithful and you just kept on going forward brother Kevin you just kept on pressing forward listen and there's a miracle in the making oh God and I just preached my heart to you right now hold on Church don't swap your hands don't turn around don't give up there's a miracle in the making there's a miracle in the oven there's a miracle in the bacon and one of these days You're Gonna think it's just about over and then all of a sudden sister broke that miracle it's going to come in the manifestation you say what is that Miracle it's not just the healing of the body it's not just the Rays of the dead it's the changing of the Mortal body I could have very well titled this surrounded by the Paradox of rapture among Church you're surrounded by this message you're surrounded by this anointing you're surrounded by this power what is it it's God in you somebody say god in me it's God in Me y'all forgive me I accidentally stopped the timer so I don't know where we're at he is the word with its true interpretation the true interpretation of the Bible for God himself is in you speaking back his own interpretation what is the Bible the Bible is the word it's the Blessed old story of Jesus Christ and it's not been changed it's not been altered it's not been diluted come on now it's not been weakened it's just as powerful tonight as it was the day it was put in ink laid upon paper you say brother Andrew how are you getting this Peter said we've already heard it this week but I'm going to quote it again we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty look at this word cunningly it means to become wise to have understanding to invent it means to play the sofas it means to devise cleverly or cunnally now that that definition there play the sofas is actually related to the word skepticism how many agree we're living in an age that is full of skepticism come on now but it's full of skepticism but I love what a prophet said he's praying he said may he perform in their hearts the work of the new birth and bring to that Redemption power of his resurrection taking away all Shadows of doubt and unbelief and destroying all skepticism that the church might move on in the perfect harmony with the will of God as present it by the Bible I am the Holy Spirit I love what he says here he said now I know this sounds rational but if you'll just bear with us a few minutes I believe this is a mouthful brother Matthew I believe that I by God's help with his word and according to his word I can bring him right here before you come on church that's not a sophist that's not a skeptic that's not a polished up so Sayer that's a man that stood on the back side of the desert he stood on the sacred Sands and he's met God face to face and there's been something imparted into him of assurance that I can bring the god of Heaven in this building he'll stand face to face with you and you will see that it's a consolation it is just a myth is it just some words put together is it some Jewish fables or is it the truth where there is so much error there has got to be a truth somewhere listen friends where there is a bogus dollar there's a real one made out of it where there is a much impersonation many things we see today then it's got to be a genuine God somewhere has it ever dawned on you it it actually strikes me kind of odd that you get up and tell somebody about a demonic manifestation and they'll ooh and ah they'll never ask you for one evidence about it they'll never say well can you prove it they'll say oh my goodness that's in man I'm getting Goosebumps that's where you mean that devil spoke how that person oh see amen but you stand up and say Here's the supernatural manifestation that a man was out in there oh God he was out in Sabina Canyon and there was a rock laying there from creation and there was no way for him to find a Supernatural part of it but they sent a rock bastard through there and they'll say that's a little far-fetched that's a little too far out there is it really is it really too far out there is it really too far after to believe that a man stood in the woods and spoke the word and squirrels come into existence is it really too far to Believe come on church amen we are not the Sons and Daughters of error we are the sons and daughters of Truth we must have the truth or we'll die and you know what we'll do we'll fight for this truth we'll preach this truth we'll shout on this truth we'll cast out Devils with this truth you know why because it's not a Jewish Fable it's not some mythical fleshly Mind of a man trying to make it up it's the word of God thoroughly Vindicated and thunder out in this age it is the Fulfillment of Prophecy come on church I'll tell you why you're here tonight it's cause you're living in a world where the Bible said the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine can I preach my heart to you can I preach Mark to you Sabina Canyon is sound Doctrine sunset Mountain is sound Doctrine among church amen a pillar of fire in Houston Coliseum is sound Doctrine amen Seven Peaks and Corral in Colorado is sound Doctrine you say well it ain't sound to me well what are you a fictional believer or a truth believer amen it makes perfect sense to me that a prophet stood there I'm known church when you got the god of paradox in your heart you can identify the god of paradox anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition come on friends we God just preacher for a second we've come too far to let the devil tell us that God don't love us we've seen too many sovereign acts of his Sovereign Grace to show us that he loves us and he cares for us and he's with us and he's upon us and he's anointed us and we're not the feet we are the head of this thing what are you stand by there and do I'm saying how many can testify in the darkest moments when you felt like you weren't loved when you felt like everything was against you out of nowhere you saw a supernatural manifestation a known church I could take testimonies right now and pile up on that Devil's Head their award a few years ago out in Arizona they've been tired and weary from preaching the gospel ready to go home ready to see his family looked up in the heavens and said God do you even know I'm out here am I even doing any good do you love me do you care for me and he pulled his car over walked out into a canyon looked down in there later coin out in the middle of nowhere and he turned it over and it said I know the thoughts I think towards you they are not thoughts of people but their thoughts of Peace what was that when he needed it look God of paradox come on the scene to remind him I know you're in the line of duty and I know you feel like turning around and I know you cannot go at home and I know this mind battle is whipping you to death but stay in position stay in the line of duty I've not forgot you I'm the one that said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you always even to the end of the age somebody shot we're not alone Oh shot it like some people are Paradox we're not alone we may look surrounded but we're not surrounded just by the devil there's an unseen host they're turned to fables from truth will not endure sound Doctrine father God said what is it you've let me live long enough God to see what's happened it's laying right here in the Cornerstone of this Tabernacle today 33 years ago he said it this way there will not endure sound Doctrine they will turn their ears from the truth and will be turned into Fables oh I think this is powerful God is calling a bride and the devil is calling the church yet somewhere somewhere out in this mess out of direct quote out in this mess is Still Honest people that's been ordained alive oh God that's Hallelujah out in this mess out in this deity in this this Corruption of laodicea there's still some people that is ordained alive what are you saying I'm saying you're the true bride therefore the true bride amen is a paradox you know what makes her a paradox is she stays with the word remember sit on the wings of a snow white dove the dove is always loyal to his mate never leaves her I could preach right there all night the dove is always loyal to his mate he never leaves her and may I stop here for just a moment and say this the true bride the female dove is loyal to her mate too she won't inject any Dogma any denominational Doctrine anything in the world it'll stay loyal to its mate the word always loyal I'm known Church you oh can I preach that's what's getting you through is you've been connected to your mate and you're staying loyal when you got every reason to turn around now you say what are you getting at I'm saying this the Bible is full of paradoxes I'm not going to read them all to you but I could tell you about one with a man named Noah it was unscientific to believe that rain would come out of the sky enough to flood an entire world Amen but a man would rise upon an r on an ark with gopher wood that was incredible Sister Janet but it was true I could tell you about the Hebrew children amen science wouldn't believe that a man could go into a furnace amen but those men went in there amen some think about this those man that went in there Amen to put them in there they perished amen by the intents he the furnace against them but prophet God said but oh God performing a miracle that was a genuine Paradox of the keeping power of God against any enemy when a man is ready to admit that God is true a paradox when a man is ready to admit that God is true but God of paradox will come on the scene and perform a paradox look at a man named Daniel in a den full of hungry lines a minimum for God of paradox brought him out look at a man named Samson I I could get a little Pentecostal here look at a man named Samson who was on Amen a journey and a journey for the Lord right and the Bible says he comes to a place and he was surrounded by a thousand Philistines amen he didn't have a machine gun he didn't have a machete he didn't have a sword but he looked down oh God he looked down for the Jordan and there laid in the middle of the road amen an old dry Jawbone don't tell me that when the moments you need him the most he will not show up there with Samson it looked like Sister Kim I feel good right now it looks like he was surrounded it looks like he was by himself it looks like it was all hope was gone but right there in a Dusty Road in an old drawed dry bone of a mule amen there was a paradox here there was a god of paradox that was him that dried tall bone and he said Sampson pick it up and he picked up that Jawbone remember said one hit on the thick helmets of those Philistines should have shattered that dodgeball try it's a tongue twister that dried Jawbone into a thousand pieces he said but instead he whipped a thousand for listings with an old brittle Jawbone a note watch rubber brim says then he turns it from the dry Jawbone of a mule Amen to the Jawbone of a Believer and he said if God Amen can get on a dead one then surely he can get an Irish that's alive I'm on Church you're looking for a drive you're looking for a paradox it's in your jaw Bones tonight it's called speak the word welcome can we preacher what it's Saturday night it's called speak the word and move forward come on oh my what are you saying I'm saying what a prophet said if he can get in the dead one if he can get in a dead dry Jawbone and whip a thousand Philistines then don't tell me that's a god of paradox cannot get in this bride and take possession of her voice and whip every negative devil from here to the Mississippi don't tell me that God cannot get in this bride and whip the demon a pornography don't tell me that God cannot get in this bride and whip a demon a suicide oh you are an irresistible you are a force to be reckoned with because the god of paradox the god of paradox is only inside of you has that ever dawned on you the god of paradox is only inside of you well y'all just got to forgive me tonight because I'm feeling pretty good the God of paradox is only inside of you what are you saying I'm saying you're not alone church can I preach here for a second it's time to get back in the battle it's time to time to put your armor back on time to put the Target on the face of that devil Time to whip that cancer come to whip that depression Time to whip that old suicidal spirit other than this too hard it's not too hard when the god of paradox is in you okay tell me it's too hard but tell me the truth that God of paradox can't do it if you're going to say it's too hard you're saying the god of paradox which is Jehovah cannot perform you're saying that he could do it for Noah he can do it for Moses he could do it for Samson but he can't do it for Poor Pitiful Andrew well I happen to be of a different lineage and it's not the lineage of Ahab it's not the lineage of weak Believers but flowing through the genes of my body of my spiritual DNA is the lineage of Abraham it's the lineage of Noah and I'll tell you why their names were Immortal tonight is because they didn't come up against the trouble and say well there's no way it can happen but if they stood there and they praise God and they praise God oh what about it tonight church is there any Miracles here tonight is there any people here tonight that says oh god I've let the devil clot my praise I'll let the devil quiet My Worship but it's time it's high time to rise up out of this condition and start blessing the god of paradox if he did it for Noah if he did it for Samson well we did it for samgar he can do it for you you know why because he's not a finite God he's an infinite Mighty holy he's a living God and he's the god of paradox and he's in Faith Tabernacle tonight to perform a paradox through your redeemed flesh oh somebody Praise Him [Music] somebody praise him I mean I'm not talking about a man I'm talking about for God of paradox well Andrew everything's against me everything's against me what does it matter what's against you when the god of paradox is in you what does it matter what's against you when the god of paradox is in you come on Church look at Joshua nature was against him help me Lord I'm trying to be a good church boy nature was against him nature but son was against him he didn't have a light switch Adam done forfeited that right he could no longer just stand there on his own accord and speak that Rod had been forfeited in the garden but he stood there knowing who he was watching the world turn and the prophet said he stopped the world he stopped gravitation held it right there and it dropped itself he said see what was it it was a paradox you say well that was a long time ago that is today the same God among Church the same God that was with Joshua it's with Josiah the same God that was with Joshua is with Thomas the same God that was with Joshua in the valley of angelon is with mad that same God is not in a tomb in Jerusalem oh God hear my heart tonight Church he's in the flesh of his bride a moments ain't Noah's Paradox this ain't Paul's Paradox this ain't Joshua's Paradox this is the bride's paradox if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that's a promise you can have what you said I love what program says that's defined nature but you have to have a motive and an objective to that that's connect with it find out in the word of God if it's supposed to be done and then God is calling you to do it and it'll do it when you know that it's spoken in the word to do it then God has called you I'm giving you I'm giving you principles right here when you know it's that it's spoken in the word to do it how many knows that it's spoken in the word to do it three of you do how many knows that it's spoken in the word to do it he said now watch then God has called you to do it now let's see those hands now it ain't a trick question it's an affirmation of faith if it's in the word it's his will come over to her some of y'all praying about things that you ain't got to pray about you know why because it's written in his word and his word is his will when you know it spoke in the word then God has called you to do it then it'll happen if you're motive and objective is right to God that's why Visions take place why things are going the way amen you have to know that God promised it this hour you cannot explain it you cannot explain how it happened no man can explain how certain things will be predicted and never one time fail to happen it's a paradox but God said to do it it's today that's the day we're living in what happened the sun Stood Still now I've showed you a time but Noah I've showed you a top Amen in the Hebrew children in a prophet called Daniel in a man named Samson now I showed you on in a man named Joshua now let's go to our Lord let's go to our Joshua the Lord Jesus Christ the promise in Jesus when he was here on Earth he walked on the water explain that to me I heard me say one the Paradox tapes today he said Jesus walked on the water he said a man's foot ain't that size I thought where does the 15 fit he said a man walked on the water but he said a man's foot wasn't the size to walk on the water science could not explain it he said watch but it was a paradox it's incredible but it's true I love this one one day he took five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand now I'm getting the preaching here can I preach a little bit one day he took a fish two fish and five biscuits and fed five thousand what kind of Adam did he turn loose wasn't even wasn't even fish alive can I break this down the fist they put in Jesus's hand was not even alive they had already been caught already been skinned already been putting cornmeal and already been deep fried fried catfish foreign no I'm not starting a Doctrine but it's a lot better than that black and stuff getting old deep fried fish right what's not alive when it got in the hands of Jesus but he got a hold of it and he broke the bread broke off a piece of biscuit and when he handed it out Tommy got his hand back again there was another biscuit there come on Church there was a hand holding a biscuit and he handed a piece of biscuit out to one of the people and by the time his hand got back he didn't he didn't grab another biscuit whatever was in his hand was biscuit making material whatever was in his hand was fist creating material among church and that's the god that's in you there was another biscuit there already raised the wheat in the field already cooked all the grease in it seasoned here was a piece of the fish he broke it off another piece of the fish cooked amen notice this that element is given to us that element is given to us brother Steve I feel like shouting right now that element is given to us come on Church whatever was in the hand of Jesus when he fed five thousand is not in a tomb in Jerusalem it's not at the right hand of the father on high that element is in the flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ what are you saying with Andrew I'm saying creation Power by the spoken word has returned to the church to perform another Paradox listen I'm feeling some cold air up here if you can turn it off it's going to rip my voice that element is given to us if we'll just abide in the word stay there I believe her on the verge of sin it happen live true to the word there you are he had cooked fish I don't think I'm making this clear enough he didn't go race the wheat I'm on church he didn't go raise the barley he didn't go catch the fish whatever was in the fish was in him can I say it to you like this before the fish was in the water it was in him before the bread was in the field it was in him before he fed five thousand people the means to do it by was in him then do you see why you're sitting here tonight it's because before you was in laodicea you was in him before you was in time you was in eternity come on Church you are the expression of the supernatural elements of the living Jehovah what do you think it's time to do brother Andrew I think it's time to let go and start praising and blessing and worshiping and glorifying and exalting the god of paradox until he comes on the scene and performs another one can I say what I believe Sister Janet it's not too late it's not too late the god of paradox that element is not dead that element is given to us how do we operate it if we'll just abide in the word oh abide in the word and you'll see the element manifested abide in the word and you'll see the bread before it's ever cooked abide in the word and you'll see the fish before it's ever prepared can I preach to you abide in the word and the Chronicles will be home before you got time to welcome them abide in the word and your body will be changed abide in the word and cancer will leave your body abide in the word and some morning between six and nine you'll see loved ones appear what are you saying about Andrew I'm saying the element is not in heaven the element is in the bride and the Bride is a bride of paradox foreign look at this word element it's a part or aspect of something abstract oh God it's a part of something that's abstract especially one thing that is essential essential we can do without music but we got to have this element we can do without a bunch of fancy buildings but we got to have this element come on church can I preach you tonight we can do without a lot of things but the brother Mark but we've got to have this element without this element it's another building without this element this is another Pulpit without this element I'm just another preacher oh but if that element breaks forth if that element comes in the church it'll call things that are not as though they are it'll call things that are as though they're not come on church we got situations in our body that doctors can't fix but before there was a doctor there was an element before there was a cancer specialist there was an element what was that element it was a gene seed word in your soul from the foundation of the world what are you saying somebody somebody help me preach here for a second take your foot underneath the Pew and just kick it like that kick your foot you say preacher what are we kicking we're kicking the human element out Verlander be careful no I can't be careful when I hear a prophet say this when the human element goes out then the spirit of God when the human element goes out then the spirit of God fills that vacancy oh my where they empty yourself then will be the church in power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus we will walk in his steps we will walk in his power we will walk in his thoughts we will walk in his being we will walk in this movement another place we get ourselves worked in with the human aim of the time element only thing we know is inches feet yards miles measurements days weeks hours months and years but God's Eternal somebody look at your neighbor and say the element is eternal brother Sean is an eternal ailment it's not a time element it's not a it's not a metric or imperial element it's an eternal element we have limited powers we have limited intelligence but our God is infinite in all things he knows all things he knew all things before the world began he oh god this is my this is my punch the devil's face he knew this meeting would be here tonight come on church when he stood there that day with the Sean and he fed five thousand he was looking ahead in time and he saw this meeting on a Saturday night in the house of God and there would be some weary soldiers there would be some hungry hearted Eagles and he said I will anoint my servant and he'll go down there and he'll preach the Paradox he'll preach the element and he'll feed him the fish and he'll feed him the bread and they'll begin to receive strength and that devil that chased them in here brother shamai they'll Square their shoulders back and say where is that devil anyhow where is that a line devil anyhow before there was a devil against me there was an element in me before there was a devil against me there was eternal element of God [Applause] I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do I'm Gonna Knock that discouragement never Plumb out this building and you can sit there and watch me before there was one day with discouragement before there was one cancer before there was one suicide before there was one depression Gracie before there was one mind battle there was a God who sets High and a God that looks low and he's not a weak old dirty Grandpa he's a mighty God of paradox he's not looking for wood he's not looking for stone he's looking for some flesh of some human beings he can come into and manifest a paradox through well somebody Praise Him no I'm talking about for God of paradox he'll come in and he'll change the situation [Applause] get that human element out of the way so we got it mixed up for Christian golly element they just get a mess out of it remember his word will not contradict itself his word was not contradict itself what are you getting at I'm saying this the mystery of a paradox can I am I going too long a mystery is a scripture previously hidden truth now divinely revealed okay well Amos it's a mystery but now it's a revealed truth it was divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element oh God Still Remains despite the Revelation so brother Tim the Revelation does not replace the supernatural foreign shampoo burning my eyes the Supernatural is not replaced by the Revelation what is replaced is the human element what are you saying the part of God said God is waiting this afternoon on a people that'll take a hold of that word and will hold on until it's accomplished come on Church they'll hold on to it until it's accomplished that which was purposed for you you say belinder how can I believe this God of paradox let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus brother Kevin if you're going to see the god of paradox we've got to lay aside the human mind because the human mind sees time numbers inches measurements yards weeks day but the element of God does not see nothing except a promise can I can I have some Liberty here as long as there are any human injections human ideas then God's germ of Life the Holy Spirit cannot work how many knows in about 1960s the prophet of God goes down to a man's house to squirrel hunt right he goes down there to a man's house of squirrel hunt walks up there and the guy says uh yeah Mr Woods you can scroll hunt here anytime your daddy was a good man he said mind if my pastor comes with me minding my pastor comes he said don't tell me banks you got so low and she got to drag your pastor with you everywhere you go now he said well he likes his girlfriend said I thought it's time I get out of the truck he said I walked up there I'm showing you the element of God okay he said I walked up there and he said the old man said well Banks here says uh that you're you're a preacher he said yeah he said well I'll tell you what I think of you guys I think you're always barking up around the wrong tree then I think you're always barking up around the wrong tree but remember said oh really he said yeah he said I'll tell you what he said there ain't nothing to you he said you all are he said y'all's like a bunch of lying uh dogs hunting dogs he said now what he said that man began to tell me he was an Infidel he was proud of it he said but Mr he said sir there's one man I'd like to meet he said who's that he said there was a man come in this country a few years ago he said they're always talking about how they can produce something he said but this certain preacher come here about two years ago with the Acton Campground and they had a meeting he said there was an old sister who lives up here on the hill was down with cancer now watch this he said now watch what this man says brother Sean this man speaking of brother random had never been in this country brother Amos he had never walked through Acton Ohio he had never walked in that person's house he had never been oh God I wish I was a preacher right now he had never been in that part of the country before he said now watch at the meeting at night there were several thousand people gathered and he said This Woman's sister was sitting over there in a crying about her sister couldn't get off the bedpan no more he said wife and I went up there every day amen to draw that bedpan and take care of the woman said this Minister looked at the woman and called her name never been in this part of the country before brother Amos and said you're weeping over a sister never been in this part of the country before that's down with cancer Upon A Certain Ridge never been in that part of the country before yes said the woman said the minister said thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord take that handkerchief right there in your pocketbook that you put in your pocketbook I'm on church I'm not giving you little lot simple details I'm giving you heavy Revelation accurate pinpointed come on laser radar sent inspections in your pocketbook when you left home took it out the top dresser drawer little handkerchief with an initial in the corner of it white handkerchief with a blue initial take that handkerchief and lay it on the woman in the name of the Lord and she'll get well for him said oh he went home and he said the next day that man said we heard some Screaming up there we heard some hollering up there and we went up there to see what was going on he said when we got a pair he said they were screaming and hollering and he said the woman whose Bed pain would have been emptying she was up doing dishes and taking care of her house remember said oh you don't say he said yeah he said that's one man I want to meet he had never been in this country before he said listen there was an intelligence somewhere brother Mark and I say it the way I'm seeing it there was an element somewhere before the woman was on the bedpan there was an element somewhere before her body become cancer-rated there was an element somewhere before her daughter went and got the handkerchief with the blue initial and the little white corner there was an element somewhere he said there was an intelligence somewhere he said oh brother you see this tree here you know the story goes through the death life burial Resurrection cycle of the tree he said listen he said now notice this he said you tell me wow that tree does it and I said the same intelligence that told me that woman that sister was dying with cancer in a vision am I preaching you out in a vision I saw her notice this and the same intelligence is so close to you till it controls the tree that's setting in your yard Destiny's still working brother Matt the intelligence that was in God when he fed five thousand was the intelligence who was in the roots of that tree was the intelligence that moved that woman to get that handkerchief was the intelligence that led William ran in that Campground and that same intelligence the prophet said you've been looking for it you've been trying to find it every day brother Sean he walked out of his front door he walked by a tree and there was the intelligence in his front yard what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the god of paradox is not a million miles away he's standing here tonight he's right in front of you you say Belinda I can't see it I can see it it's a vision it's a vision and it's breaking it's a vision and it's breaking brother Andrew what are you getting at can I have a few minutes here the bride's paradox it's what I'm getting to the bride's Paradox those in the bride do only his will [Music] those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have us saith the Lord or they keep still they know that what God Said in them he's going to do he will fulfill his word he said he did not complete all this work amen while he was here in Earthly Ministry so now his works is in and through the bride the bride's paradox The Works is in and through the drive watch this I believe devil I'm going to preach this if you don't like it I'm gonna preach it in here I believe I've had never been after me since I got here I believe is reincarnated in flesh [Music] I believe that Jesus Christ is reincarnated in flesh in the human Church here on the earth doing the signs and wonders 1963 the ministry of Jesus Christ is reincarnated in his church in this last day 1964. I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body what is it church it's a vision can I cannot get that picture we we brother Wayne spoke to the night on the on this part here it's it's the Rapture note spoke on this part it's been spoken shall come to pass but I want to ask you about this right here the vision of the Bride who is that it's you brother Matt well it's you Brother Sam well it's you sister hope well it's you Sister Anne well it's just come on Church the vision of the Bride this message is the bride's Paradox it's the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in flesh in the human Church through the bride's body what are you saying the human element has been removed the vision let's read this together the vision of the Bride you know what that is I'm not going to preach all night but I do want to share this with you if you leave that there where there is no vision the people perish what is a vision it's another dimension what is a vision help me Lord someone has asked many times brother Adam are you impressed to say certain things do you just think it in your mind no sir I see it that writing is not an impression in his study he wrote it because he saw it he said no sir I see it it's just there it's like I'm looking at you just as the same as you are only you're standing here yet you may be 40 years back in somebody's life seeing what's taking place even see them the way they're dressed the way they're dressed one group was dressed like the world marching to the step of rock and roll but there was another group there was a paradox there was a paradox she was not marching to rock and roll she was not marching to Elvis Presley she was marching to Onward Christian Soldiers come on Church before you got in this building you was in a vision glory to God I feel like dancing before you got in time you was a part of an eternal vision he sent a vision of God is a word of knowledge drop it in the person to foresee something tell something that's been or something that will be what is a vision it's something that connects two worlds can I say this to you inclusion a vision is the direct word of the Lord yeah Hallelujah the vision of the Bride the direct word of the Lord numbers 12 6. if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and we'll speak into him in a dream now I want to I want to labor here and I'm done remember I'm sitting out for instance sometimes what is a vision I'll be at home I'll be walking to the house not thinking of anything maybe sat down in the room and they'll come a vision maybe it'll set perfectly still for quite a little while he'll say now you're going to have a call in a few minutes from the phone you're running the city and when you go to this city you'll go to a certain place it'll be this away you'll go in the room and you'll lay your hat down or the lady will lay your head on the bed but it's supposed to lay there so once he get up do move it it's supposed to be laying over on the table and another lady will come in this way and you'll see it all acted out just exactly the way it's supposed to be done if I fell in one of those things it will not happen it has to be just exactly to the moment time this thing down to some morning between six and nine has to be to the moment to the time everything positionally the same for it's a vision and it has to be perfectly materialized it's a vision has to be perfect with your eyes let's go to let's go to a place called cupio Finland can we one day Birmingham is down in Florida has a vision when he has this Vision he sees a little boy being killed in the vision she's a little boy being hit in my car laying down the road and he's killed but remember said as I saw this he said the Perfect Details come I saw his eye color I saw his hair color I seen the color clothes he had on I saw all the details he said and then I heard thus saith the Lord oh God this Bride is a paradox she will not move without this saith the Lord he said then I heard thus saith the Lord he said now notice from that time he said different boys were actually killed and kids in car wrecks he said they would phone me Sister Janet and they would say come down here this has got to be the vision he said I would walk down there he got to stay with the word remember a dove is loyal to their mate he said I go down there and look and I'd say no no that that's not him that's not her he said I will quietly lay my hand on him and pray and I would back out of the way he said see when I saw in the vision had to be in the materialization what I saw in the vision had to be in the reality he said now watch he said when I got over there in Finland two years later he said driving down the road he said all of a sudden we come up on the scene and something speaks in my heart and says something is fixing to happen he said I'll walk down there I looked in the road there was a boy he said it was a tragic scene and I began to cry watch the human element I began to cry I began to feel sad he said but then all of a sudden don't you love those all of a sudden moments he said then all of a sudden in the back part of my mind oh God where else do we hear that in the back part of God's mind was his secret mystery he said all of a sudden I Heard a Voice say you've seen these mountains before come on church you've seen them mountains before you've seen the trees before he said I looked down and I realized I've seen this boy before Brother Moore go get your Bible more go get your Bible read me the details Brother Moore begins to read the details there was the mountains there was the trees there was the boy he said I began to look around and say everything was positionally placed it was now ready for materialization can I close tonight by saying this church everything is now in position according to the vision the god of paradox the god of paradox is in the church tonight the only thing that's going to happen brother Sean is the vision has got to materialize that brother Jordan here's my part that I love he said I went over there and the boy was laying there dead bleeding no life in him no breath and he said I knelt down see nobody could take his place he said I knelt down and he said I just laid my hand over on him and I said lying every devil and hell up and you won't stop Thomas hello this is not Noah's Paradox this is Terry's paradox this is Kevin's line every devil and hell up and nothing will stop this boy from getting off the ground and if he's not up in five minutes you put a sign on my back and run me out of town as a false prophet he said I laid my hand on him and I said in just a few moments in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I call lies back in this body he said and there was a dead lifeless boy rose up off the ground what are you saying it was a paradox but here's the bride's Paradox we were dead in sin beared in Traditions buried under condemnation but for God of paradox come on the scene thank you call our name and said get up brother Andrew I don't think I can believe this you were born to believe it you were born to believe it but Andrew I'm not a part of nothing I'm just a young person going nowhere going in circles doing nothing dead lifeless no vision no purpose how long are you gonna listen that line devil brother says someday I'll be included in that Paradox that's coming the dust to those prophets lay Yonder in the Earth and when the dust the martyrs who are eaten by lions with the dung of the lines were spread across the dust all over the Earth I'm reading about your paradox but yet Christ will raise that body again it goes to show that he is the resurrection the god of paradox is in US and we are in the god of paradox let our musicians come tonight we are in the god of paradox brother sister I don't know if you believe it or not but I do the human element's gone this message brother Mark finished the element of humanity finished it it no longer controls your direction it no longer controls your praise it no longer controls your worship how many can say tonight I was thinking today people say you know people say something about somebody else they'll say oh he's just eating out their hand they got they got him eating out of their hand you ever heard that that saying I got to thinking but Tim we're literally eating out of the hand of the son of man the human element is out of this hand Church the human element is out of the hand of God it's a supernatural element I'm gonna I'm gonna read this and I promise I'm done brother I was talking about the boy in John 9 how many members that boy he had a paradox right the prophet of God said when he took a little mud from his hand Jesus reached down got a little bit of mud right put it in his hands he said that he went over and put them on the eyes of a man who had never had eyes showed that man was made from the dust of the Earth [Music] and returned with eyeballs and could see the Creator that made him do you see who you are [Music] do you see who you are tonight Church you're not just human beings you're a paradox brother Brown says watch he said if God don't intend to raise the Dead then why did he become flesh like us and go back towards the dust and raise himself up again why did he raise himself up if there's no resurrection of the Dead oh let us not be children but let us be men and women in the spirit who believed God with all their heart imagine that brother Amos never had eyeballs Jesus knew exactly where his eyeballs were laying in the dust and with the same hand that fed five thousand Landon went over and picked up a handful of dust rubbed it in the Man's eyes and that hand created eyeballs the same hand that never greased one biscuit never caught one fish but fed five thousand the same paradoxical hand rubbed in his eyes where I roughed in his eyes and he saw him for the first time and noticed what he saw for the first time he didn't see his failures he didn't see the rabbi down in the temple that was teaching Messiah was illegitimate child and there was nothing this man named Jesus but when the first time his eyes come open he saw his creator glory to God friends you wonder why we're shouting on a weak meeting is because God has sent a prophet in this age that has taken the word and is rubbed it in the eyes in the church you did not have eyes to see predestination but he gave you some you didn't have eyes to see the resurrection but he gave you some you didn't have eyes to see beyond your past and teenage years but he gave you some eyes you didn't have eyes to see beyond your troubles you didn't have eyes to see Beyond The Cloud of condemnation but he gave you some [Music] when we stand our feet in feet oh God you didn't have eyes to see that you've never done it in the first place but he gave you some [Music] you didn't have eyes to see but to be on just a certain amount of time you know why because the human element only sees time in months and years and days and weeks and hours calendars oh I tell you why the devil hates you is you got asked to see everything about that liar God has given you eyes to live in an evil age surrounded by fiction but in the middle of it he's giving you eyes to see truth and the pride of God said truth shall set you free how many beliefs tonight that element of paradox is in this building tonight listen I realize tonight there's there's diseases in bodies he's here tonight there's diseases and bodies that doctors are puzzled to fix but there's an element in this building tonight [Music] how many believe she still performs paradoxes how many kids say Lord I'm ready to fulfill the bride's paradox listen I realize there's things that happen in our past lives in teenage years that nothing can fix the blood can there's an element tonight that can give you eyes to see beyond it say brother Mark all we could see was back to the day we come in the earth 424 1996. brother Junior all we could see was physical parents oh we could see Branson was physical lineage it's all we could see Sister Lisa but the god of paradox come in this generation claims your body brother Amos stepped into your flesh and give you eyes to stand here and look all the way back to the back part of God's mind and see before you as a sinner you was a dollar of God before I made one mistake I was perfect in the mind of God I'm on church I'm talking about a god of paradox talking about a god it can give you back your sight I know right now maybe all you can see is the clouds maybe all you can see is this but if you let the god of paradox come in the building sister came he'll give you eyes to see beyond all the sickness [Music] there's an element 's building tonight it's incredible but it's true [Music] there's some flesh here Sister Crystal that God has claimed in this generation to perform a paradox through it was just a few days ago that my wife's sitting right back there out in the meeting at Ron Spencer's carrying out a little boy up in a prayer line had a what was that a hernia in his stomach he's taking the doctor I think stick out about that long I mean it was horrible to look at Doctor looked at it and said well that's actually normal and it happens there's millions of cases every year but just because it's normal don't mean we got to live with it how the Paradox is here he said now he'll have it for four years and after four years if it don't hurt me but for God of paradox claimed that lady right there to come up in a prayer line and say I won't pray over my son and we join our faith together right there and you look at that boy's belly button tonight and there ain't no there ain't no hernia there it's incredible but it's true what are you saying I'm saying the god of paradox is in Faith Tabernacle tonight he's not coming here just to hear us talk about Georgia Carter just to talk about what he did for Florence Nightingale or William Upshaw not just to talk about what he did for Lazarus sir what he did for Samson but he wants to write a paradox about Martha he wants to ride a paradox about Connor he wants to write a paradox about Sam you are in position tonight for the god of paradox to write a paradox out of your flesh thank you now listen I'm gonna open the altar tonight for prayer if any hap if anyone has a need I believe it's time how many agree with me it's time time for some paradoxes listen you said but Andrew I don't believe in these prayer lines well tell somebody like me that who went in a prayer line one night an empty vacant void boy and come out on the other side full of the Holy Ghost [Music] listen I ain't got to be hundreds here tonight to have a prayer line the god of paradox performed a paradox in one boy's eyes and we're still preaching about it today he's in this building it's incredible brother Steve oh I'm making nervous Devils nervous right now it's incredible brother Steve but it's true really Amos it's incredible but it's true relievers it's incredible that a few years ago you and I and sister Lisa would meet up in the cold frozen tundra Manitoba and preach a meeting not in a building in a rented hospital room and rent a nursing home in a rented room here and stand there and fight devils like nobody's business young boys sitting there rebelling against God might as well just preach I'm here Hannah it was incredible that we would sacrifice ours and study and pray and leave there but Amos you made more trips there than I did it's incredible it's incredible to think about it it's incredible me to stand there and sin and leave there and think oh God what did I accomplish what what was that here that I could help but the other day I walked out and Kelly Hill the branch church and one of the boys that sit there and rebelled in those meetings met me I was preaching my eyes preaching he was on the second row pulling with everything within him I said there's something different about that boy I didn't know who he was you know why I didn't know who he was because he looked different he didn't look like the boy I saw Manitoba in 2016 and when I walked out the back door he said with Andrew I owe you an apology I said for what I don't even know you he said oh yeah you do he said a few years you and brother Amos come over and preached a meeting and he said I sit there and rebelled and rebelled and rebelled he said my brother rebelled he said but one day Jesus Christ got a hold of my life and he said I'm not the same boy he said I've Been Changed he said my attitudes changed he said I don't want to ask you to forgive me what are you saying brother I'm saying the god of paradox is back in the church today release your flesh release your elements release your human body and let that God come in your flesh and manifest the bride's paradox foreign you got a chapter in this book brother Steve you got a chapter in this book the bride's Paradox I spare harsh together tonight will there be one here tonight it was saved by the Andrew I want to step I want to step into this paradox will there be one here tonight I can say I'm ready I'm ready I'm not looking for fame I'm not looking for a name I'm not looking for publicity to be said about me and what God done for me to attach my name to something I'm ready for a genuine paradox I'm ready for a genuine now listen I know this sounds rational but I by the word of God have done everything I can tonight to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to bring the god of paradox present in this building for this moment right here tonight for this moment right here tonight [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah is it a sickness is it a disease is it a lie the devil's told on you that's plagued in your whole life it's time for a paradox it's time for a paradox the brides paradox it's moving right now heard Brothers saying like listen heard it quoted but Jesus Jesus when he was here on Earth he would have prayer lines he would hold prayer services for people [Music] now listen it's not Andrew Glover it's on my heart tonight to tell you this he's here to perform a paradox for you if you have a knee tonight if you haven't eat any any kind of need I I invite you right now just to step out of your pewing just to step here in this center aisle and say Lord I'm ready for a paradox I'm ready for a paradox we're going to pray for you tonight God bless you brother will there be another one here tonight say I need a paradox I need a paradox I need a miracle Lord he shared a performance listen he's here to perform it tonight he's here to perform it I'm not a crazy man I'm a son of paradox be sure to perform it and listen we're going to pray for these people tonight and I'm going to ask you in this atmosphere I believe we've had a week-long meeting here that's created an atmosphere for a paradox let's just consecrate
