hallelujah hallelujah amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen well let's go to Ruth chapter 3 amen praise the Lord let's go to Ruth chapter 3 start from verse one Hallelujah everyone love the Lord this morning amen Ruth 3 and verse one then Nomi her mother-in-law said unto her speaking to Ruth my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and no and now as not Bowers of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he winth barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee put on thy reignment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayth unto me I will do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk his heart was merry he went to lie down in the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly in and covered his feet uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered now notice she answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou Hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou Fest not a young man neither rich or poor and now my daughter fear not for I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than i t this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part pardon me but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee Then I then I will do the part pardon me of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning and she lay at his feet until the morning and Rose up before one could know another and he and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor may the Lord bless his word you may be seated now this may seem like a unusual unusual scripture reading but you know we I want to I want to approach a a a a topic if I may if I could put a title to it I want to speak about the responsibility of our Kinsmen now Ruth we understand you know the Book of Ruth is more than just a nice love story but but you're you're Ruth amen Ruth is a is a story of redemption and it's not just Ruth uh being redeemed you know it's not just put in the Bible just to fill in some pages buddies but God is laying out a patent for you and God is laying out a patn for all the bride of Christ now before so before this moment that we just read it was Ruth that was doing everything so she in the beginning in the in in chapter one you know she had to decide to to follow her mother-in-law to Israel and and she came to the conclusion in in in in verse 16 you know um because Naomi said to Ruth and to her other daughter-in-law go back to Moab I'm going to Israel you know just go back to your father's house but then Ruth made a decision she said I will not entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee forther for where thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God be my God where thou die I will die and where I'll be buried and and there will I be buried Lord do so to me and more also if I ought but death part thee in me so she had to decide that she was never going to return to Moab unless her daughter-in-law went back to Moab amen she had to make a decision I'm not coming back to this place anymore I am going where you go and if you go back here I'm coming back here she makes a decision I will never return to my old life anymore remember Moab and Israel they were different different nations they lived a different kind of lives amen so she had to make a decision this old life that I once lived I'm never going to live again Hallelujah and but you know I'm going because I will never return to this old life because I'm going with you Naomi now there is no record that Ruth ever went to Israel before there's no record of it in this scripture she didn't know where she was going that's right amen no doubt many of you were asked where are you going am me I want to I just trust God will make this just so personal that when you read the book of Ruth you always just see your name in Ruth and it's not the Book of Ruth it's the book of whatever your name is amen so many you know no doubt people would have asked Ruth where are you going I'm going to Israel have you ever been there I've never been there before I'm following my mother-in-law and so many many people would ask where are you going that's right amen Israel believed in a different God to Moab Israel had one God Moab had a whole bunch of gods amen Ruth you know no doubt people would have said to Ruth Ruth don't you know Israel doesn't believe in three persons in the godhead amen don't you know they believe in a prophet that led their forefathers out of Egypt into this land they live in and that this Prophet supposedly received the word of God on a mountain don't you know that they think they an exclusive bunch of people amen don't you think they think they're a special class of people God made them a special class of people I mean it wasn't you know it wasn't they made themselves special God made them special and it was it's not that we try and make ourselves anything God's made you something you got to know who you are in Christ amen so people no doubt would have you know and then they would have said that you know because Moab had had prophets too they had balam they had prophets but they say they have this prophet and and he received the word of God and he's the only source of Truth and they would have said Ruth that sounds a bit cultish to me amen amen and so people no doubt you would have had that conversation with a lot of people why do you go to that place why do you listen to what they're saying why do you listen to those sermons it sounds all a bit cultish down there they say they have truth we all have the Bible who has the interpretation of the word amen but is but Ruth was told Ruth was told that Israel had bread and she was hungry amen and there's something in the believer that their hunger is only satisfied from The Bread of Heaven amen there's nothing else will satisfy the hunger and the saint of God doesn't matter where they're born what they're from what they used to do there's something in them says I'm still hungry amen because in Ruth 1: 6 uh Naomi arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab that how the Lord had visited his people giving them bread so that's all she knew about Israel there's food there I mean there's food among these people that are not my people and that's what made her go amen amen she didn't know anything she didn't know anything about Israel's God the only the only living example of a was Naomi and when Naomi went back Israel she said don't call me don't call me Noom anymore call me Mara cuz my life has become bitter and Ruth was part of that bitterness amen Ruth was part of her bitterness and but yet somehow there was something in Ruth says where you die I'll die amen your God will be my God the only thing she saw Naomi's God do was afflict Naomi that's all she saw of her life Nomi wasn't living a prosperous life she didn't have it all together it wasn't all going perfectly well amen she didn't she you know Nomi didn't say well my God is a good God and you know maybe she did but oh look at it manifest how is it good if look what's happened to you but Ruth just said my God will your God will be my God where you die I'll die Hallelujah I trust that you've made that same kind of decision amen that you've you've burnt every bridge amen there's no turning back yeah I I I made my mind up years ago there's nothing to go back to the world has nothing for me denomination has nothing for me am mean there's just no appeal in there I know what it does and it just destroys people hallelujah so I made up my mind wherever this leads me I don't know where it's going to lead me I don't know where it's going to lead me but I'm not worried about the details just lead me Lord amen I trust that you you've had that same kind of experience now Ruth after this they come back in too they come back into Bethlehem the house of God's bread which is what Bethlehem means and there's the harvest season is going on and then so Ruth decides and you know if you know the kinsman redeemer sermon this is all in there and then Ruth labors in the field to find just enough food for her and her mother-in-law now but when she was in the field she finds herself in boaz's field she doesn't find herself in any other field and Boaz is the lord of the Harvest and he comes down and he speaks to his Reapers he says who is this gleaning you know among the other maidens and they say this is Ruth the moabitas and he instructs his young men don't touch her leave her drop handfuls of purpose for her you know give her a bit of food a bit more food along the way and it's so wonderful when when God drops a few more blessings your way am mean that's handfuls of purpose he just drops them as you're reading and praying he just gives you a few more blessings every so often he sweeps through the church every so often Amen to you know to give us a few more blessings and then so Boaz instructs Ruth you stay in this field you don't go to any other field you have protection in this field and we know that the field remember this is this is speaking of you you're not out in a literal field finding barley amen but the field is is is the word of God and if I had a message book I'd put it in here too CU to me it's the same thing cuz the message reveals Christ in here who who of us were trinitarian some of us were trinitarian some of us probably believed in two at one stage some of us oh how who got baptized wrong some of us got baptized wrong well what was happening you know because but what made this all clear not just by all of it clear the message made it clear because it reveals Jesus Jesus in here it's not another testimony it just reveals Jesus in here that's why just like when I first to do you first I do Mission work and I still do it this way to a large extent I preach the message but by never quoting the message amen because you go and you show them in the scripture this is what's happening this is where we are this is the baptism this is the godhead and it's just all in here and it's proving that it's not what brother Braham said the reason he said that is cuz it's in here and the reason he said it's because God revealed the truth of the scripture to him amen amen it's that simple because it reveals it in here so that is the field that you're to stay in you understand and if you stay in that field there's protection because she was protected when she stayed in the field now Boaz we know is Christ Ruth is you he I trust you say praise God Boaz boaz's fi is the word of God the true interpretation of the scripture which I said the Mage reveals Christ in the scripture the true interpretation but now but I want you to notice there is a time when you when when when the word begins to be opened up to you and you say oh this message feeds my soul how glorious it is yeah because she'll get a handful of purpose look we're going to eat a bit better today no me look we're going have a few more cakes we're going to have a feast amen and that's true that's Ruth getting food from Bo's F I've never heard the word like this before it fits all together I'm so glad we're not walking in confusion I'm so glad we're not walking in man's ideas amen but we're walking in thus sayith the Lord and it's glorious but that's still not it amen don't just now don't just stay at the point where the word is glorious you got to come into Union amen Ruth in boz's field though protected though getting drops handfuls of blessings she's still a moot us she is still a widower amen it's still not there now Ruth chapter 3 before that it was Ruth doing everything but then now she CES to a place where then after this now Boaz starts acting and she comes to a place where now Ruth becomes his responsibility Hallelujah amen if you want God to act on your behalf you have to find where he laid down amen Mark the place he laid Lord and uncover his feet and lay down there that's what Nomi told told her to do you to find the place he laid down and then when you find that place lay down at his feet and then he will begin to act on your behalf amen I try this is not complicated amen I just but I want to Anchor in real deep because the place he laid was Calvary amen I'm going to read this from the kinsman redeemer remember when Ruth came to this place then Boaz had to act amen Boaz had to act when she came here amen and we have a Boaz today our Lord Jesus Christ who's alive and well who's among us hallelujah now in Kingsman Redeemer 1960 if you haven't heard it please go listen he said uh now put thy garments upon thee s actually no me said this not take thy garments off of thee how contrary of today G thy garments upon thee when you go to meet him he's going to win oaly tonight go down put your garments on you cover yourself up to meet him says today they want to uncover themselves cover yourself go down where he winth barley and then Mark the place where he lieth did you go did you do it on gol gotha many years years ago I marked in my heart where he laid down his life that he might take me Hallelujah Mark the place that he lieth down watch where he laid that's what every believer should do mark what he done for you he says last Sunday's message to visit to Calvary mark what he did for you she said Mark where he lieth down then when he lith down to sleep to rest you go lie down by his feet not his head his feet unworthy take the blanket that he was covered with and pull it over you you see it oh my I know you think I'm a fanatic but that suits me just right and I say amen that's exactly how I feel that spirit of God Mark where he lay at Calvary where he laid down um that just suits me no where he laid down the tomb of Gethsemane Mark and crawl up to his feet and lie down there and die to yourself there you are cover yourself over with his skirt she said skirt she called it and Ruth said what what you say I'll do see this is why part of the Bride what everything you say that I'll do amen because it's a because there's a intent in mind and it intent is a union oh what a clear-cut decision for the believer this is the same quote what the Bible says that I'll do it says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll do it if it says go into all the world preach the gospel I'll do it if it says whatever it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday um today and forever wherever it says for me I'll uh to do I'll do it see the church taking its orders from the word she laid down now remember that was a disgrace for that young widow woman to be laying by the side of this man at his feet a disgrace to the outside world oh can you stand it here it is look here it is the church the young woman the young man or old or young as asked to separate themselves from the world come into a place a kingdom of a kingdom of the Holy Ghost that's disgraceful to the world in their own heart they know what it's all about but to the world they become a fanatic they become a Holy Roller or something on that idea some disgraceful name but the church has asked to do it are you willing to Mark the place and lie down and let the world call you anything they want to this is what she had to do amen and when she did this now and we read the scripture he woke up and she says to him cover cover me with your spirit amen cover my shame cover my first nature amen cover my identity so people no longer see me in my Brokenness they see you in your glory amen this is this is what she's asking him to do because she laid down where he laid down and she laid down at his feet and if you lay down at the foot of the cross where Jesus laid down then Jesus begins to act on your behalf hallelujah amen and then because this was her request I don't want to be a moabitas anymore Hallelujah I don't want to be a widow anymore I don't want to be an alien in a Strange Land anymore I don't want to be an alien from the economy of God anymore I want in Hallelujah that's why she laid down there and says cover me with your hallelujah it's like MTH which was Jonathan's son and then David after he's King he says now does Jonathan have any children and then he says yeah he's got one mbth then mbth comes in as a and and then David says you know what happened and mes was scared because they were there you know the house of Saul the House of David they were enemies but remember David swore to Jonathan I'll be good to your children you be good to mine and the o was forever settled and then so he wanted to so he made the oath and he wanted to put it right amen that's why he inquired about MTH and he was scared to come into the prince of David because remember if MTH M should have been on the throne you following me he should have been on the throne so he was David's enemy technically as we were amen but then God called us into his presence and we were born in a crippled State we were blind spiritually blind having no idea what was going on in this world we were crippled we couldn't walk the way we should have walked Hallelujah and then he comes and he because he's lame in his feet you go read the story it's a beautiful I trust you put yourself in that story and then David says come and eat at table Hallelujah and then when MF slip under the table you don't see his lame feet anymore Hallelujah he looks like every other guest at that table hallelujah it's the same thing with you amen he laid out a banking table in the prince of my enemies is that what the scripture says he's done for us hallelujah and then when MTH is there why I could say David skirt I'm not jumping a big don't think I'm doing a big Quantum Leap but David covered myette's crippled Hallelujah and he looked like everyone else at his household Hallelujah but that was David bidding him to come amen David wanted to act on his behalf because David swore to his dad I'll I'll look after your children Hallelujah and because an oath God swore by himself God SW by himself he's going to put it all right Hallelujah that's why he's acting on your behalf hallelujah it's not him that willth or runthe us Mercy Allelujah now I'm so glad Hallelujah now Ruth so Ruth is is is actually calling for Boaz intercede on my behalf Hallelujah and then now s she marked down where he lay cover me Lord cover my shame cover my sin because you're a Kinsman notice the reason the first thing he says cover me with your skirt because thou art a Kinsman to me Hallelujah that was the reason you have to you have to cover my shame because I'm part of your family Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you the reason you can come to God is because you're a Kinsman he's your Kinsman amen it's not a natural it's not a natural lineage it's a faith lineage hallelujah it's a seat of God that's put in you before the foundation of the world are you following me amen the first Declaration of jesus' name you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sin Hallelujah he's going to be the Kinsman Hallelujah why he put on flesh hallelujah amen because thou art a Kinsman now there is a law and we'll read it in Leviticus 25 if you want to you still got your Bibles handy we're going to read the law of the kinsman redeemer now in Israel well we'll just read this now the devil loves to tell us you'll Beyond Redemption who's who's been down that road who's received that mail hallelujah we're just going to rip that up because there's a law remember God works according to his law amen he he is a man of his word yes he doesn't go around his law he doesn't try and cut a corner he works according to his law now Leviticus 25 see this is what I love this is what I love about this message it makes Jesus you the Old Testament is not a story book that's right and it glorifies God it glorifies his Redemption all I see in this message oh it's from the from the beginning to the end from the opening of the seals I see a lamb step forth I see a Kinsman St forth we're going to come to that later but it's just so glorious now it says uh L 25 and 47 oh love of God how rich and pure hallelujah how measureless and strong Hallelujah I trust you're feeling like I'm feeling just now it says in verse 47 and if a so joura or a stranger wax Rich by thee that thy brother that dwelleth by thee wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or soier or by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his Brethren May redeem him so notice he may be redeemed that's you got to always remember this principle if you're a son or daughter of God you're redeemable and you must be redeemed amen you cannot be left in slavery you cannot be left in slavery amen either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him for if he be able he may redeem himself and he shall reckon with him that brought him from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of a h servant shall it be with him if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his Redemption out of the money that he was brought for and if there remain but few years until the Year of Jubilee then he shall count with him and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his Redemption amen so the law was if he's an Israelite he is redeemable and he must go free amen because there Comes The Year of Jubilee as well where everyone has to go free that chooses to go free okay so it's a law of God Amen so if you're a son or daughter of God you have to be redeemed amen hallelujah so the kinsman redeemer has to be a Kinsman or a relation yeah he has to be able to do it he has to have the price the money to do it and he has to be willing to do it amen you know those are the three things and so Boz now was Ruth's Kinsman but part of the Redemption of Ruth was that the Kinsman has to marry Ruth and raise up children in place of her first husband yeah that's part of the requirement and we can read about this in Ruth chapter 4 sorry just a second now this is it's going to read uh three verses in Ruth chapter 4 from verse three now we said unto the Kinsman so this is now the nearer Kinsman is actually the devil to humanity if you can accept that or not because when when the devil came in the garden and he injected himself into the human race that and we were born in a fallen State we're actually naturally more related if I can put it this way to the serpent amen than God yeah so the near Kinsman was actually the devil yeah and he does not worried he's not worried well let's just read this and he said unto the kingsman noi that has come again out of the country of Moab sth the pel of land which was our brother ales and I thought to advise thee now Satan and and Jesus aren't Brothers by the way it's just part of the story okay but don't don't go to that conclusion because Jesus says he has no part in me I have no part in him amen and you have to come to that same conclusion and I trust you come to it to the end he has no part of me I have no part of him I have no part of Satan whatsoever amen which was our brother ales and I thought to advise the saying before AB before the inhabitants and before the Elders of my people that if thou will redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it besides thee and I after thee and then this other Kinsman said I will redeem it okay but now notice the next verse but then Boaz then say Bo what day that thou buyest the field of the hand of Nomi thou must buy also of Ruth the moabitas the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his upon his inheritance so it's a requirement of the Redemption you have to marry Ruth and if you keep reading he says I can't do it amen because only God has life in him you understand so Ruth's Redemption was tied into marriage with Boaz amen that's was how she was redeemed is because she got married to Boaz you following me amen so now what so Jesus now why did Jesus die okay Jesus Jesus died for you that he would take your first nature amen he would take your first nature and he would crucify that man amen he would take him away and kill him that you can be married to another amen because you got to understand Ruth Ruth first identity I'm a moabitas I'm a widow I have nothing I'm destitute in a foreign land the only way that could change her station in life and her identity was that Boaz would take her and marry her and then after their marriage she's no longer rotth the moabitas but she's Mrs Boaz of Bethlehem amen and then everything Boaz is she becomes Hallelujah so she's no longer a moabitas who is outside the economy of God remember Moab it even says in the law Moab shall not come into the congregation of Israel you got to understand Grace oversteps the lawj amen it oversteps the law Hallelujah I find this real quick he says in the he says in the breach message he parallels now forgive me if I'm jumping around but brother B parallels Bo is claiming Ruth and redeeming Ruth as the lamb taking the book Amen to get you an understanding of oh it's a lamb taking a book no as I said last Sunday no it's God claiming you amen it's GL God claiming you and restoring you to what you're meant to be amen and so we needed you it even you know we read there in Leviticus if a man can redeem himself he can do it but no man naturally can redeem himself from being born under the curse of the law amen because we're born with a fallen nature so we're all in prison doesn't matter doesn't matter if it's a nice prison you know there's like overseas the gang leaders they have a like a palace in prison they're still in pal you know they're still in prison you can have the nicest prison you want you're still in prison we needed a man we needed a Kinsman to come we needed a relation to come who was not born the way we were born amen that wasn't born under the curse of this first nature amen but was born into the human race Hallelujah so blessed by the Anisa's Bible story their book there it's got a like a timeline and and the heading is the baby everyone wanted and it just has uh pictures of prophets prophesying of the Redeemer to come Hallelujah because they're all looking for a redeemer to come we need a Kinsman Lord when you will when you will send this Kinsman to undo all these things and God said I can't send someone else I've got come Hallelujah so God the word became flesh amen the Kinsman became flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah and he and he did that because he he knew you were coming remember God he does things once but he attributes it to all his Believers amen that's why Jesus had he only had to die once 2,000 years ago but he did it one by one offering and so then when he went to Calvary he took your son to Calvary you weren't even born but the joy that was set before him he knew you'd be here in this day he knew the struggles you would have he knew the battles you would fight and he and he knew all those things and he picked them up Hallelujah all my children are coming back to me Hallelujah and he took your sin up that cross that day Hallelujah and he died there he died in your place am mean cuz someone who's dead they're not subject to the law anymore you understand so if you're dead in Christ Hallelujah no you're not subject to the law anymore if you're dead amen because a dead man the law doesn't affect a dead man he's dead Hallelujah and if you're dead well the it doesn't bother me anymore why is that cuz this this guy's still moving but he's dead Hallelujah 2007 I died September time I died Hallelujah I'm so glad I died that day amen and then God has just been more glorious all the time sure there's been battles struggles ups and downs lefts and rights whatever more but the shepherd I the Kinsman grabs you by the hand and make sure you're going to make it Hallelujah and so now let's read in Romans chapter 7 let's just read this Hallelujah Romans 7 verse1 brother bam uses this uses this scripture as a as a text for a sermon the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and many people see it as a negative sermon I do not see it as a negative sermon because he's telling he's he's making a declaration let's just read this before I go on know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he lives for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she is also married to another man she shall be called an adulterous but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no more adulterous though she be married to another man therefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God so now in The Invisible Union sermon you go listen to it amen you go listen to it God's making a declaration he takes a scripture and he says it's a higher form of marriage and divorce and he speaking of a people now where Jesus at Calvary amen took your took your first nature took it to the Cross amen killed it Hallelujah by one offering remember the lamb was slam before the foundation of the world so it's already done but it has to be expressed down into time amen so it's already done the battle is over the victory is won you just got to walk into it Hallelujah just walk into it it's already done and so he took your first nature your first Union that you were born with and he took it to Calvary and he killed it there amen that you just wouldn't be now oh now I'm a widow no he didn't want to leave you in that state he wanted to unite him to himself amen but he knew he had to kill that first nature to kill your first Union I trust I'm not speaking Chinese or something to you I trust it makes sense amen oh he it's more than just him dying for your sin he died in your place to kill that First Union because he wanted to be married to you Hallelujah and that's why now but then when you come now when you so well that was 2,000 years ago what about today you've got to find where he laid amen like Ruth did and say cover me Hallelujah because you believe it happened but now you say Lord I want to see it lived amen that that first Nature's dead I want to see that expressed in this body Hallelujah and so now only God as now just jumping back again only God could be the one that could be our Kinsmen amen no man could do it no Prophet could do it doesn't matter if they Liv the perfect life we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen I want to say these things because brother BR speaks in perfect strength and perfect weakness he says you have to master uh human ability and what that means is you have to master the fact you cannot do it in your own ability that's what that means you have to master just come to the realization I cannot do it and don't sit back and say well what's the point in trying the only thing you can do is just surrender and die yield yourself and if you can master that fact that it's not you that works it out how you're going to do it you just have to stay yielded and dead amen you got to master he says it's very important you got to master that fact that human ability cannot do you nothing no good amen he says that's why the church is church world has miserably failed why because they Ed their own human ability we're going to learn the Bible this is what we're going to do and they where's it gone amen but that's still comes upon us we have to master that fact it's not by power it's not by might but by thy but by my spirit sayith the Lord amen so Jesus now so so in so in Revelations chapter 5 we won't read it but maybe go read it later but we have a picture now John's taken up into the eternities he sees a book in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne sealed amen and then there was a strong Angel proclaiming who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals and John wept because he saw no one was worthy amen all the prophets were there all the Believers were there down through time but there's no man because a man Adam with his eyes opened allowed sin to come into the world yeah so if a man lost eternal life then a man has to come to restore eternal life Hallelujah that's why we need to Kinsman we have a Kinsman Hallelujah and this said John WEP because he knew remember John was there at the crucifixion amen John was there standing at the foot of the cross because Jesus was there and he looked down and he said to Mary woman behold your son looking at John and John behold your mom amen so he says basically says John look after Mary so je so John was there looking at him on the cross dying and it and he went to the tomb after he rose and he wasn't there amen so so John knew that he died and he rose again he even preached about the blood he preached about the cross he preached about Redemption but then when he looked at this he says where is this one where is this Kinsman and he went much cuz he knew the whole Plan of Redemption broke if there was not a man who was worthy to come and take that book amen and then one of the elders says weep not because the Lon of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he looked and he saw a lamb Hallelujah and then so now and then he rejoiced because the lamb came and he took the book and brother Ram say the most Sublime act in scripture he took that book and then everyone all the elders everything bowed down and they said worthy out thou because you have redeemed us back to God out of every Kindred nation and tongue amen so here it now I I just trust I wish I had the vocabulary but here is John John is already a Believer like Ruth has become a Believer remember Ruth said your God will be my God she became a Believer before she left Moab then she comes to then she comes now to boaz's field and then she comes to where Boaz laid down and then she's basically crying out redeem me I mean cover me with your skirt Redeem Me undo my first my first part of my life wipe it out I don't want to be a moobus and here's John he's standing here saying I don't see a man who can do it someone needs to do it he's basic I I'm not no I trust you don't think I'm making a big Quantum jump but here he is and he's crying out basically within himself there must be a man who can undo my first part of my life remember that book that's the Lamb's Book of Life your name is in that book this is the book amen remember it's all symbolic but you're part of that book I said last Sunday it's like Jesus now the lamb Jesus comes and claims you amen so what what Boaz had to do because remember brother bam he he parallels The Book of Ruth and the lamb taking the book he says it's actually the same act so now what Boaz does as he says everything he says now everything that you've asked I will do if the near Kinsman won't do it and then after that scripture um the last part of Chapter 3 of Ruth she goes back to Naomi and then Naomi says to her then said then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day am me so now as I said the time where Ruth is doing everything now it's all Boaz and noi says just ru just rest so she made the appeal cover me with your skirt cuz you're near a Kinsman and then now Ruth I mean Bo stands up and begins to act on her behalf and she's just resting and then so John is there who's and and he was weeping cuz he didn't see anyone worthy all the prophets were there you were there cuz it's Eternal realm amen Moses was there Elijah was there John the Baptist was there Joseph was there who Abraham Isaac Jacob all the way down brother Brandon was there all the Believers were there but no but they were all we were all born by sex amen but one man was not born that way Hallelujah and it was God creating a body creating a sacrifice in the womb of Mary cuz you go look in the scripture he never calls Mary mother once he always says woman amen and you go look at the wording I'm pretty sure the the word mother and woman are two different words amen remember because he is the word he never brings an error so that's why he never because she wasn't naturally would say well she is the mother because she birthed him and raised him up but he called a woman because naturally they weren't related whatsoever amen and so John is there saying you know he was weeping because no one because because that's what he wants to see he wants to see what someone take the book he wants to see someone take the Lamb's Book of Life amen because our lives are recorded in a book amen just like Ruth's life was recorded in a book yep and so now but she is depending now upon Boaz to undo the first part of her life amen so so so put it this way when Ruth came to an age of accountability she was writing her life amen she made decisions now I'm going to do this now I want to do this oh look at these look at this Israelite family why have they left Israel oh now they're here oh he's he he's a handsome young guy and then you know they I'm want to get married yeah I'll marry you you know makes all these decisions but then there comes now a time in her life where it's actually Boaz is now saying now I'm going to write your life I'm going to rewrite your life look where you ended up now B wouldn't have said this to her basically Ruth's decisions even though it brought her into Israel but before that decision she became a widow amen she was outside the economy of God this was her decisions led her there until Nomi you know Nomi said I'm going back your God will be my God and so that's where where her life ended up as all God ordained sure but her decisions led her that way and but then now Boaz comes upon the scene and by him redeeming Naomi marrying Ruth he was actually taking her old book amen dropping it into the sea of God's forgetfulness Hallelujah and it came forth what it was meant to be Mrs Boaz of Bethlehem you understand so now when you come to an age of accountability there's a record in heaven and it begins writing everything you do think say whatever more but then now you come to a point in life and I trust if you haven't come to that point you need to come to that point where you say Lord I need all my sins washed away I want my first life eradicated amen and that's why you go find where he laid down and you lay down there then what's happening now Jesus says I'm going to take your take your take your book of life I'm going to put it in the blood of put it in my own blood Hallelujah and when it comes forth out of his blood it's not even there anymore it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness Hallelujah God doesn't remember it you should forget it amen all you need to remember is God delivered me god Set Me Free God healed me God restored me that's all you need to remember amen just remember that oh this person did this to me just forget it move on you know history is not always a good thing amen because many nations many groups of people are still bitter by things that happen to their fourbe fourbe fourbe and they live in the past and their whole life is affected by things they never did amen so just just forget about it amen am just move on with God amen amen oh it's hard no just just say Satan it's done I'm not doing this dance anymore amen amen so now Ruth so Boaz by taking Ruth and changing her nature is exactly well how'd she Chang her nature she wasn't known by her old way anymore she's identified with a whole different kind of Life Hallelujah and she could not go back to her old life because she was not that person anymore hallelujah amen and now the Lord by claiming you remember he died at Calvary that he would kill that first nature that you could be United to him amen that's why we can never be United to Creeds and dogmas of man amen we are not we're not United to a bunch of Doctrine we're United to a living God Amen and God knew you'd be born the way you were Hallelujah but that's why he died for you because he he knew and you was part of himself Hallelujah I may say these things every Sunday but just just enjoy it for what it is because you got recognize remember your position in Christ you must know in here you must know who you are you must know what he's made you and if you if you can recognize I'm a son and daughter of God I'm not in slavery I've been set free I've been restored to my former estate what I meant to be Hallelujah then you can really shake it in the devil's face amen amen because God wants you to know who you are in him amen that your old life your old nature what you used to be as he annihilated Hallelujah sure you still live in this body but I tell you what you have a life in you I trust you do that can overcome the desires of this flesh amen it could overcome the things you used to think about things you used to do amen you say well I'm struggling with something say God put a greater desire in me for you than that thing amen that's all you need don't say Lord don't you say I need to get rid of this no say Lord put a greater desire in me for you amen that is that is the great secret because if you love something you'll do it amen oh I just love to ice skate now I'd be there every day I enjoyed it it was awesome but you know what I mean if there's a passion if there's a drive if there's a love you'll do it amen it's not no I got to I got to go and do it it's such a weariness no if you love it why do people do crazy things they train they do all kinds of crazy things some people you know you admire them for it cuz they you know the determination everything do but but somebody say that's crazy because there's a love and a drive and a passion amen and so if you just just say Lord give me that because what does the devil try and do numb you down make you feel disinterested make you feel like everything's common you know because if you come to that place you say well I better find something else to do that's what he tries to do he tries to numb it down this is the problem with his age where you know everything's just trying to numb you you see the you see the mess in the world and all the terrible things that happened we're not shocked by it anymore amen and why that's because the devil wants to numb us down numb us down in our walk with God but you've got to understand God has taken you hello Ruth how are you doing today amen good Hallelujah such a ky answer but he's taking you amen remember we are not our own but his amen if you know who you are if you know who you belong to that changes everything Hallelujah now so in the breach message but the law required a kinsman redeemer and every man on Earth was born of a uh I was born of a sex now don't you see that's where it come from that's where sin started you see where it's at now there comes your seed of the serpent in see notice required a kinsman redeemer see John needed a Kinsman amen and the Redeemer kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race there that leaves us out on a limb but let me sound a trumpet to you the Virgin birth produced the product amen the Virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer none other but the almighty God became Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the kenman Redeemer was met you see how God makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then Grace steps in and overshadows that law and produces the product amen oh when you get over home when I get my little cabin down there as brother Neville sings about when you all hear something down there one morning Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wret like me you say you say praise God old brother Brandon made it here he is see oh yes it's Grace that taught my heart the fear it was Grace my fears relieved how true that is hallelujah how precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed wait till you get down there just in a moment oh my now we look The Book of Ruth gives us a beautiful picture of this amen because he pays for Ruth but then he marries Ruth amen and it's exactly what he did for you he died for you but now in on this day he comes to claim you Hallelujah that now he's going to unite himself with you that's what the this word does this is a this is a claiming word amen he said the bridegroom call will come right through this what's a bridegroom call the bridegrooms here go get married Hallelujah that's what the call is and he sends his word to prepare you Amen to become United with him Hallelujah and that's why you've got to understand if he's changed your nature Allelujah whose Nature's been changed amen you know there's a permanent you're not just living on you know there is amazing highs you know cuz it's cuz God brings emotion and something with emotion it's dead you should bury it and be born again amen but there's something you know something's happened to you and know your heart is turned towards heaven and you love him with all your heart so it's not just all the word blesses me it's something and you says oh I love him because he first loved me Hallelujah and you can't shake that it's more than a feeling it's more than a Something's Happened to you what's that you've been United the word has United you to Christ Hallelujah so now what you used to be is being annihilated hallelujah hallelujah amen and it's a reality yes sir amen I remember the day I died and was born again I've never been the same hallelujah amen nowall our Boaz and Ruth uh sorry Ruth uh noi had lost the estate and he says this Boaz had to become a redeemer he was the only one that could he had to be a Kinsman a near Kinsman now I say Boaz could be the only one that could do it because out of Boaz and Ruth came came David came Jesse OB Jesse David amen so there wasn't I'll say in the near the because it says in the book of Hebrews that Levi was an Abraham when Abraham paid ties to mzc yeah he says he was in there not figuratively Levi was in a was in the loins of Abraham great great grandfather whatever it was amen so now when so in Boaz was Jesse in Boaz uh forget I'm stretching it too far but but in Boaz was David he wasn't in the other one that David wasn't in the other Kinsmen he had to come through Boaz you understand and it so but but now the beautiful thing about Abra Levi being in Abraham when Abraham paid T to meis now is that was attributed to Levi I'm probably going down a rabbit hole but it's a glorious one now you got to understand that Jesus now you were in Christ when he went to Calvary amen because you are part of him you're part of his word and here's the fullness of that word the fullness of God a b was in him amen and he went to Calvary the word was made flesh and went to Calvary and you if you're part of the word you're part of them back there Hallelujah so now Levi was not conscious of when Abraham paid T to malisic but was attributed to him you following me you were not conscious when Jesus went to Calvary and died for you but because you're in him there amen his death is attributed to you Hallelujah him taking your sin upon his shoulders of Calvary is attributed to you Hallelujah and that oh well how do you know that well what's it happened what's it caused you to you what's what's happened to you amen because you see when he died he eradicated sin he he crucified your first nature he released an overcoming power to live above sin hell death in the grave he put Satan under your feet amen he put the device of this world under your feet he put everything the enemy has devised no weapon you know it says let's just go to Ephesians I'm just wanting to read the scripture let's go to Ephesians chapter 3 I believe it is I want to read this real quick sorry it's um it's Ephesians chapter 5 the enemy comes in this is my instruction to you this is Paul's instruction or rather I'd say it's God's instruction he says in verse 19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so when the enemy comes in and things begin to snowball in your mind what do you Calla to do God is telling us through the book of Ephesians don't think on those things cuz those things will lead you to stress anxiety and ruin amen but think upon speaking to yourself this is what he says you're to consciously you want to defeat the enemy in your life amen speak to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing making melody in your hearts to the Lord why Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs is because the right music brings the presence of God hallelujah that and that's how the anointing comes down and breaks the Yol you say well you're just trying to force it out maybe at first but then but then you get into the swing of it then you begin to sing and then you say what was I so worried about in the first place amen always keep down that road and you'll do well worrying about tomorrow and problems will do you no good amen pray about it but you should pray I can't remember who said it yesterday don't worry about the problem praise God that he's greater than the problem forgive me if I get that wrong but you know you should always just focus delight yourself in the Lord amen yeah you got just I don't know just but inscribe that scripture into your soul and say Lord whenever the enemy comes in and things go wrong cause me to do this Hallelujah now that's what we must do and so now our Kinsmen our Kinsman has come in order so yeah that's where I was now the reason he died our said was for us to overcome everything of the enemy amen and we know it's attributed to us because it's manifested in you amen that's how you know how do I know he died for me because I see the victory that he won at Calvary manifested in this flesh Hallelujah that's how we know hallelujah it's just like Levi why was it attributed to Levi when he wasn't conscious of it because it was manifested later on where where the law said they shouldn't pay do you know they have no inheritance among you and all these things because that was because Levi was an Abraham amen and it was attributed to him when he paid tithes same when Jesus you're in Jesus that's why many you know why do we what how do we live this Christian life it's so simple why why do we live a Victorious Life oh there's ups and downs and hard ship and stress and trial there's of course there's those things I mean God just you know God just doesn't Force us through a pipe and now we overcome everything amen there's there's things you must overcome amen but you're anointed for victory amen you got to understand that and that's why that's why we should never you know but that's why why do we seeall why do we see New Birth why do we see people be born again why do we see the very divine nature of God come into people because Calvary is attributed to them because they were in Jesus when he died Hallelujah put that on your fridge amen so now so Boaz had to become a redeemer now I'm going to wind this up soon and he was the only one that could then Jesus Bo typ in Christ and when he redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride Boaz redeemed Naomi and her land but he did that in order to marry Ruth amen so when Jesus died on the cross he redeemed Israel but he was doing that to get you Hallelujah so very beautiful he says he says we have it on tape somewhere said now notice he must be a Kinsman you see an angel couldn't do it a man couldn't do it it must be a man but he couldn't be born of a woman a sex act so the Virgin birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was not a gentile Jesus was God that's exactly his blood didn't come from any sex act he was the Holy created blood of God and we're not saved by Jewish blood neither we saved by Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God that's according to the Bible because Paul himself says you be overseers of the flock uh that's you by the that's been given by the Holy Ghost whose blood was shed for us amen now we're saved by the blood of God that's according to the Bible it says so we're saved you see Jesus was God he was not a third person a fourth person second person he was the person he was God he was God Emanuel God came down from his glory revealed himself that's the one met the requirement Grace produced the person of Jesus Christ and we find this book now God stretched his tent came from God to become a man he changed his strain from Almighty to be a man to take on the form of man so he could die to redeem man wait till we see him again when there's nobody worthy all right in the Bible in the Book of Ruth as you read it you'll find such a person who is called a go a g o e l was called a goal however you say it it was a person that could meet the requirement and the goal must be able to do it must be willing to do it must be a Kinsman next Kinsman to do it and God the creator of spirit became king kin folks to us when he became a man in order he could take our sins upon him and pay the price and redeem us back to God again there it is there is the Redeemer amen and that's what Jesus did you say well he died 2,000 years ago the god that is alive Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so he is still our Kinsman amen he is still our Kinsman Redeemer but I want to just give an invitation you need to lie down you need to Mark the place you laid down and need to lie down at his feet if you want Jesus to work on your behalf you got to Mark the place you laid and you got to go lay down at his feet and then you become his responsibility amen many times we make our walk with God our responsibility it's not that way if you've laid down at his feet I trust you have amen then you are his responsibility amen you come under his headship you and if you are his responsibity I mean responsibility all of the pressure and the you know all of the consequences and the pressure and what could happen lay upon his shoulder it's not upon you it's upon Him amen amen oh am I going to make the Rapture it's his responsibility because I marked where he laid down and I laid down at his feet and I said redeem me oh God you're a near Kinsman to me Hallelujah and then he and then he acted on my my behalf because I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man so therefore I'm under his headship and it's his responsibility to get me there amen but outside of that you can do all you want and you get a thing amen unless you're willing young and old to lay at his feet and die amen you're outside of his responsibility oh but he knows the end from the beginning don't lean I lean on predestination now because I know I'm predestinated because I know I met God Amen so don't just say well what will be will be don't lean on that too much amen say Lord I've I've decided I'm I'm following you I'm following Jesus I'm going all the way amen and I and I I have a choice every day and I want to live for you amen because of Ruth remember I said probably I don't think it's too many times but I probably say it every Sunday God is a gentleman you can't he can't force you to become a Believer neither can we force anyone amen you have to make your own conscious Choice Ruth had to make a choice wherever you go know me I'm going doesn't matter what people say and then n says find out where he lies down mark it down lay at his feet all you have said I'll do she had to yield herself to the word that was instructing her amen because Naomi's in mind she wasn't trying to humiliate Ruth or I mean yeah she wasn't trying to humiliate Ruth she wanted Ruth to be married to Bo amen but to the caral mind it seemed ridiculous and to be a believer to the carnal mind seems ridiculous oh you're Overboard you're just crazy you just got too much religion you're just too serious amen I I agree Hallelujah I'd rather be in the deep end where I'm totally covered you know if you jump into deep water you may drown but you won't break your neck you jump into shallow water you will break your neck amen amen and if you jump into Christ you don't drown amen this water you cannot drown amen so I'd rather be oh you you know you know I've been told years ago oh you just jumped in the deep end so praise God Amen praise the Lord because the water's good but you got to understand if you do not lay down at his feet amen then he cannot act on your behalf amen it's really that simple am mean we have some musicians to come but on the other side of that if you do then he's responsible for you amen and he's responsible for the restoration of you and your family amen amen and so if that's the case then I'd rather lay down at his feet well I'm a good person I've done nothing wrong the Rich Young Ruler didn't do anything wrong but he wasn't willing to lay down where he you know he wasn't willing to lay down his life take up his cross and follow him amen and he ended up he didn't end up in heaven amen and the problem is if you compare yourself with someone else you won't be in heaven that's right oh look but I'm better than this I'm better than brother so and so sister so and so forget it how Lord how do I compare with you amen because if you keep your focus if you keep your focus on the Lord you'll come out right amen because this is not keeping up with the Joneses amen oh but I've been a good Christian all my life what about now amen because because normally people say that they're actually in their mind comparing themselves with other people they know amen don't don't don't worry about those things I say have you laid your life down have you laid down at his feet amen because it's between you and God doesn't matter doesn't matter what everyone else is doing what have you done amen amen let's just sing that song shall we um down from his Glory Hallelujah he went from Eternal God he became a man because we needed a Kinsman Hallelujah we needed someone to make it right again
