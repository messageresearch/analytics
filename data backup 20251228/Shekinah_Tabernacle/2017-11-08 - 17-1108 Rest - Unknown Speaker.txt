night father we commit the service into your hands and Jesus Christ name Amen amen thank you musicians amen god bless you all I mean God bless you all it's great to have everyone here tonight I mean let's um let's go to Matthew chapter 11 and then we're gonna turn to the Book of Ruth as well so Matthew 11 and verses 25 down to verse 30 it says at that time jesus answered and said I thank the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemeth good at my sight all things I delivered unto me of my father no man knoweth the Sun but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the Sun and he to whomsoever the Sun will reveal him come unto me all ye that'll all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen let's just turn to the Book of Ruth and we'll read a few scriptures from Luke Ruth chapter 3 and we're just gonna read we're just gonna read verses 16 down to verse 18 of Ruth chapter 3 this is Ruth coming back to Noemi it says and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he mean four he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sits still my daughter until they all know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats I'd like to speak tonight about rest it's just a four-letter word but it's a very powerful word amen so for the Christian there is real rest as we read through in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus makes the call come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest I'll give you rest for your souls amen there is a real risk for the believer I mean we know that there's this you know there's these struggles and there's hardship and life and these things we have to do in busyness of life and we labor and so on but for the believer that truly enters into Christ is a real rest I mean there's a real peace there's a there's a risk for your soul that as Jesus was was a calling men to come to this wrist and we understand that he is still calling this night that people would take his yoke his word upon them for his yoke is easy and light and he'll give you rest for your souls now we read here in the Book of Ruth now The Book of Ruth we know is more than a love story it's more than just a you know four chapters of a nice story that that they were just put into the Old Testament but the Book of Ruth speaks of you it speaks of our Lord Jesus that speaks of Redemption it speaks of redemption of the Jews and the Gentiles or the whole plan of redemption is in the Book of Ruth it's more than a story book now reading and and in Ruth chapter three you know maybe if you still got your Bibles handy we'll just read a few more scriptures from here because you know when you truly enter into rest there's a far great there's a big difference between someone who's really entered into the Shekinah presence of God and dwells in his presence continually to someone who's maybe outside or even in the inner court but those who are in the Holy of Holies have really entered into rest they say that that doesn't make too much sense but I trust as we go on you know at will now Ruth we understand she is a she is a Moabite she's not an Israelite she comes back you know just to maybe give a brief summary you know Naomi is a Israelite she goes with her husband and two sons in the and Ruth chapter one you know there's a famine in Israel they leave the Promised Land they go into Moab you know they they dwell there for sometime to Ruth's sorry Naomi's two sons married to my wife girls one is Ruth and then and then noemi's husband dies her two sons die and she's left with her two daughters-in-law and then she hears that now grain you know food your harvest has come back into Israel there's no more famine there anymore so she says I'm going to return back to my homeland and she says to her two daughters-in-law you know stay here I'm going back to my homeland and all for the other daughter-in-law she she returned back to her kinfolk but Ruth said where you go I'll go where you die I'll die your people will be my people and your God will be my god hallelujah that was her resolve and it's the same thing with the believer something has moved you situations in life just like there's a famine it caused them to leave Israel and gone to the you know gone to Moab situation life caused them to leave the promised land then another situation and life came where where the famine was ended and they could return back to Israel and the situation life was now Ruth's husband dies offers husband dies their father-in-law dies and so this whole thing God is orchestrating because he wants Ruth hallelujah he was his ma black girl I mean who's the winner with nothing I mean to return back into not even her inheritance but but by Union by marriage to Boaz the mighty man of wealth I mean she falls into everything that Boaz has and she's and she's United into the promise of God by marriage hallelujah and it's the same thing with you or not by by union with our Lord Jesus Christ because we are married to him have you taken as your lawful wedded husband I mean to me he is the head and you are the body you subject everything you are to him I mean he's the head of the house humbly and by and by coming the head of the house he takes responsibility Amen he's in control I mean he's in charge I mean if he's and really in charge in your life you can rest I mean you can sip not just what's the woke up by but you know he's going to rule in control you don't need to worry what's going to happen tomorrow and what's gonna happen next weekend how these things gonna work out in life he's got it worked out I mean he's got a plan he knows what he's doing he's been doing it for thousands of years I mean directing his children and yo guiding them by his unseen hand he knows what he's doing but do you know he knows what he's doing I mean cuz if you don't know that he knows what he's doing then you try and deal with it yourself and you try and take these top two inches and mankind has taken these top two inches and look we're in this we're about to have another world war because man is taking us top two inches and had their own this is what our agenda is and this is what we want to do and look where look where the world's ended up not too good by this hey a lot of smart people in the world I give them that but we're going to go past this we're to go past this and we miss even we missed it please everything it's going to go bad you got to step out onto faith and say god I don't know how this is going to work I'm a finite being you're an infinite being a man cause me to understand what's going on so I can just walk with you and you may not even see the end Tunnel that's when you walk by faith that's when you really trust God but Graham says when he yeah he says you turn over every stone so you go so so when something strikes you turn over every stone in your life to see if there's something Anton unconfessed sin or something wrong and this is once you've done all that then just be certain to God he's in control I mean we're not the Rick we're not our own masters man thinks that there are their own master but we're not our own master amen so Ruth these all these events coming because Ruth had to be married to two - Boaz I mean because out of them eventually came the Kings I mean David David came out of there hallelujah Solomon came out of there no other woman could do it amen same thing with you friends amen yeah God had you in his mind I'm gonna use these people to express myself one this time maybe not another people this people I mean I'm going to put these people in this place and they're gonna express me I mean they're gonna be a surrendered vessel and gods and I'm gonna live through them I'm going to show my mercy in grace to the world I'm going to show my divine love hallelujah you're gonna say I find myself in that number I find myself in this category of persons I wasn't looking for it I mean but he was looking for me and he found me hallelujah said his Ruth now and she's instructed by her mother-in-law this is Ruth three and one my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee we're talking about rest that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he would have he winter with barley tonight in a threshing floor now before we go any further there's a law in the Bible the law of the kinsman redeemer where a near family man who's a kinsman can redeem someone who's who's had to sell themselves into slavery or has found themselves into slavery if someone is as part of the family and they have the money they can do it they can redeem their family members out of bondage hallelujah and that's why God became a man because we were in slavery we are born in slavery to sin I mean but he looked down at you and said I'll not leave my family in this street I'll not leave them with nothing I'll not leave them destitute upon this earth I'm in but I'm gonna pay a price I'm gonna play the whole price high lien is no interest are gonna play off I'm not gonna do some credit thing you never the criticality of the law I paid and food hungry that's why we need hang on the cross the last words he's what a last words he said as it is finished I mean I've paid the price hallelujah tis nothing nothing withstanding hallelujah I paid it all I'm in and he did that for you that you and you would not be a slave amen but you would hear the jubilee trumpet I mean you'd hear freedom reign hallelujah causes blood still cries freedom it speaks fair things in the blood of Abel hallelujah amen and then when you heard it something and you said how lujah I mean he's my kinsman doesn't matter what state you know Ruth was in the state she was in a real bad state the Bible says that a MOBOT could not come into the congregation of Israel that's what the law says I mean but grace overshadows the law hallelujah and here we are we were enemies not even in the promise of God I mean we were enemies we were aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and never by his blood I am in he Brooklyn that middle wall of partition he bridged that gulf hallelujah he bruises the Gulf in your life I trust he has he's not some you know well had he knows he bridged it well beforehand he's maybe a story or someone else's testimony some distant God someplace sometime oh yes he was there two thousand years ago and yes and we can a man of history a member that means there's a gulf hallelujah but when it becomes personal to you when it becomes a living reality to you I mean that's an bridging the chasm hallelujah and when he bridges the chasm there's no more chasm oh yes they both go hallelujah there's nothing between my soul and my Savior hallelujah so he is Ruth now he's instructed by her by her mother-in-law see it's gonna find where he lays he's asleep member the harvest yeah there's a Bali harvest going on and all these things happening the real harvest was Ruth hallelujah she was the one Boaz you know when Boaz his eyes fell upon this one I've heard you're a virtuous woman hallelujah he doesn't care about the barley hallelujah cares about what how was the crop this year I don't care just give me a number okay that's cool you know I'm not worried about that I want to marry this one I've fallen in love hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I amen it's a love story this is a love leader this is a love leader between you and God amen and if you're in a relationship you can read between the lines to see God's hardness in his word it doesn't take you out of his word but you can see what his heart says hello Lee just like if my wife wrote me a letter I mean you could read it could be nothing to you but I could say well this is how she's feeling this is how the children are this is how things are going because I'm in a relationship hallelujah I can see what she's really saying to me without even saying it that's the same thing with the Bible it's more than stories I trust it's more than stories to you amen it's a love letter you mean even the law yes even the law even Leviticus and Deuteronomy oh yes that's a love letter I remember first time I read it I was just plowing through I'm gonna get through this and get through this and then and then the Bible came up real yeah a different book it wasn't I was reading one of the epistles of Peter and it wasn't Peter to whoever was it was Peter to be annoying in 2007 it became personal I read it before became different book hallelujah same thing with the Old Testament wasn't just trudging through and I got to read a chapter and yeah it becomes alive hallelujah I trust you can say that's happened to me I mean brother BAM said when the seals come up in the Bible we came in new book it's got to be coming you book to you a personal love letter to you I mean so now Nomi instructs boys I mean sorry Ruth find where Boaz lays down he's at the threshing floor lay down at his feet and then he will say what he will do so she so she went down she lay down at his feet now brother Bram says you're gonna find where Jesus Christ laid down because in the story of Ruth Jesus Boaz is Jesus Christ Ruth is you I trust you can say Ruth that's me that's me right so the Prophet tells us find where he laid down and lay down at his feet and he says Jesus lay down at Calvary he laid down at Calvary and you got a lay at his feet I mean you're gonna die with your sacrifice you got to die out and be born again I mean you had a lady out of his feet and by laying down into the street Ruth is telling Boaz you're the head I mean I'll place my I would place myself next year I played myself beneath you hallelujah that's the same thing with us we're gonna be wind to lay ourselves down at his feet but remember he doesn't leave us down at his feet hallelujah amen he picks us up to make us joint is hallelujah we joint heirs with Jesus Christ amen so now and then there's an appeal let's go down to verse 9 of of Ruth 3 I will hopefully get to where I'm wanting to go but this is where we are Ruth 3 and 9 and he said who art thou so so it comes awake and it realizes what's going on who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman now this changes things I mean but God godness would you can't separate God in His Word God is his word so now she is she is invoking so it's actually her drug night of God and that causes Boaz to act on her behalf amen it's actually Ruth initiating her Redemption if I can put it that way now we know that God first draws us but we've got to respond amen and then so here she comes Kubby cover me with your skirt cuz I'm your I'm your there are a near kinsman so he is telling she is telling him cover my shame cover my life amen cover my old nature cover my Marwijk birth hallelujah that's not even part of the Covenant of Israel I mean because thou art a near kinsman and only you can change who I am because member in a marriage the wife loses her identity and takes the husband's identity I mean that's why in the West you know the woman traditionally takes the husband's last name because her old name Amen that has done away with and a name represents her life Amen you think of Moses you think of 10 commandments you think that's I know you think the Red Sea you think Jesus you think all the miracles he did and dying on the cross resurrecting the Apostle Paul you think of yo you think of a life right so a name represents a life so now when we so when when she is saying that a near kinsman she's calling on him only you can redeem me I need a near kinsman your loss is that you can redeem me hallelujah you can change me from being a widow with nothing because only marriage could do it only marriage cos could could change who she was only a union with Boaz could change who she was hallelujah and so now she's saying cover me cover my old life don't you want to be covered by the blood I mean don't you want to be covered by his righteousness and it covered in His mercy and grace only that everything you you you used to being used to thinking used to do it's covered hallelujah that now no one can see it anymore hallelujah and then now she says thou art a near kinsman and that's what happens when we really come to the Lord because he's a deep calling to the deep so there's something in here I trust that's drawing you you may not even know what you're looking for initially but there comes a time in life we say there's more to life than this it's more to life than just a job and a career and even a family and a house and a what and a holiday and what if it's more and and the begins to be alarming in here now that's called a deep and the Bible a deep and it says that they call us to the deep I mean so now God is the other part of the deep and in order for the earth to be in longing for more so in order for there to be something that I want to know who I am and where are from and what happens when I die that's a deep call that's a deep call and order for there to be a deep call there has to be a deep to respond and before there was any longing in here there's a God to meet that longing there is a creator to meet that longing hallelujah there was a God who made all things to meet that longing amen so now this is what happens when you come to him you're basically saying there's a deep and you answer my deep hallelujah and I'm being drawn to you and why is that now because I'm part of you you're a near kinsman you're a family member I'm in your blood relation not talking about natural natural blood you could be even if you could trace your lineage all the way back to Noah or whoever doesn't mean a thing I mean that's just natural lineage spiritual lineage is what I'm talking about spiritual blood hallelujah because he's a near kinsman so now he begins to act on her behalf and then now just the same time will not read the rest of the chapter but we read there in verse 18 be still my daughter until they'll know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day and then now there's a nearer kinsman he wasn't willing to to marry Ruth so he forfeited his right and then Ruth marries Boaz marries Ruth this is chapter 4 and then and one ceremony Ruth goes from a widow - mrs. Boaz of Bethlehem she goes from a widow one ceremony do you take this woman yes do you take this man yes I pronounce you husband and wife whatever they used to do in the you know in the Jewish waiting ceremony but she she went from an alien to part of the promise and one ceremony hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I we're from an alien I trusted and and you laid your life down and he changed you there's Holy Spirit came into your life I mean and then now you can truly rest hallelujah amen now let's just go to how we're doing this just go to Abraham very quickly that's what every day that's what I read as you're turning to Genesis 17 I want to read a quote from why people are so tossed about but there are pictures of sermon why people are so tossed about he says you find in two classes of Christians one that one that's just doesn't matter what comes there's strong and faith they just keep walking there's another class that's up and down and in and out and left and right and round all tossed about by everything he says now well why is this and he comes to the conclusion one is that one has intellectual faith and they tossed about by everything another one has a real revealed faith in their hearts and they can just walk on and he sees that the ones who are not tossed about if gone into the very presence of God and then living the prints of God continually Amen by the blood of Jesus Christ we can go within the veil into the presence of God I mean but the others haven't gone into that place yet I mean so I trust by the end of even why even now if you're the one that's tossed about you say Lord take me in take me into the Holy of Holies dad Abraham Abraham goes through many things it takes him 20-25 years from when he's first called out of what we call modern day Iraq he leaves there and eventually ends up in the and what we call Israel today and it takes them 25 years not only to get there but to receive the promised son Isaac and during the journey you know you go read you go read the times that God speaks to Abraham and it's about three minutes of just reading it but he's got a 25 year journey so maybe when God came down to visit um maybe as long with that but you just read it's about three minutes of God speaking I'm The Almighty God you know it comes down as now kids that can does all kinds of things 25 year journey no church to go to no Bible to read but God has spoken to him and he walks in that revelation that whole 25 years and then he comes in Genesis 17 it says and when when everyone was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I'll make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply the exceedingly now this when it says I'm the Almighty God so we just read this as Almighty God in the English but in the Hebrew it means El Shaddai ayah which if you which means which means the strength give of the life giver like a woman who breastfeeds a baby so God is telling Abraham just nurse off the promise come to me and nurse I mean that you can receive strength to fulfill the promise because you know there would come a time it's just like any believers life can God do it it's tarried will it be fulfilled well the word be fulfilled in my life who's had that kind of time I mean when you have a promise and you just walk and walk and walk and you wonder will it happen it's the same thing with Abraham he's 99 years old is he gonna have the promise son he believed he would but when it was going to happen I think God comes down and says I am I am I am the almighty god I am El Shaddai I the strength give her the life giver like a woman who breastfeeds a baby your nurse off the promise and you'll gain strength and that's what we need to do I mean if we're really in rest just rest and nurse off the promise amen I trust you know there should be a hallelujah or something I you say really is that all we mean to do yeah because we're gonna have faith in this finished work I mean we're gonna have confidence in his finished work hallelujah that it's already being done Amen we just got a nurse off the promise and gained strength hallelujah isn't that right that's resting I mean you take your baby in it well from my experience she's screaming and screaming and screaming and then you give us some some milk begins to seal down you know it just nurses off the promise amen isn't that right hallelujah and that's what we've got to do we're just got to keep walking with God and nurse off the promise now it sees in hebrews hebrews six and we'll just read verse 16 so i'm gonna try to move quickly because i don't want to i want to hold you that's it's for men it's a speaking of abraham's walk it says for me and verily swear by the grader and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife so what he's saying is when when someone confirms an oath both this there's a ceasing of all strife of as he cannot keep his part of the bargain is he going to do it you know when the oath is confirmed when they actually follow through with what they've promised then the other party can rest amen the other party can rest because there's now a ceasing from all strife now the strife we have as believers isn't isn't what happens you know during the week that's just that's just everyday life people who are not even believers have the same struggle as we do you know there's no temptation that comes upon us that's common to men we we face the same things but there's a rest and the soul of the believer because his confirmed his oath to you of his word hallelujah i trustee has amen where he said what he promised he would do he confirmed it and confirms it and he and he comes in behind his word and says you know what I've promised what does he promised overcoming power I mean to give you his divine nature hallelujah that the enemy would be under your feet and then your family would be safe I am in the yet peace that passes all understanding is that part of it by His stripes we were healed he's the law of God that heals all our diseases hallelujah you're gonna go on a rapture amen amen you're one of them I mean you want a vapor ham seed according to faith you're one of the ransomed I mean the redeemed has he has he confirmed those things to you I mean is he confirmed to you you're my child I mean you're my son or my daughter I trustee hands hallelujah trustee has that me because if he has that should be the end of all strife now you can just rest and nurse off the promise hallelujah because you already know he's going to do it I mean it's more than someone else's promise more than someone else's covenant with God that God made with them it becomes personal to you it becomes real to you then you can just rest hallelujah amen I'm glad we can do that don't you now very quickly the book of Hebrews Paul speaks about that by the blood of Jesus Christ we can go into the very presence of God we're in the Old Testament with the Tabernacle in the wilderness only the high priest has gone once a year with the blood the normal worshiper who wasn't even a priest they couldn't go into that place they couldn't go into the inner Court where the menorah was in different things they could just gone to the outer court right they couldn't go into the into where God was but but by the blood of Jesus Christ there's a new and living way and that veil has been rent and - that's why when Jesus was hanging on Calvary and he any and he gave up the ghost that that curtain which was more than what yours more than one layer of curtain massive thing rent from top to bottom I meant to signify by the offering that was just given on Golgotha I mean the people could step into where God was and in the Old Testament it was death to go on there I mean unless you're the high priest once here with the blood and then dressed a certain way I mean with the high priest garments and placed in the office and the anointing oil and different things that was it was taste to go in there hallelujah but now it's taste not to go in there I mean it's dance not to step into his presence hallelujah now in the article there's no roof it's just it's just open so these storms come rains come day and night comes and the believer who's standing in the outer court are affected by all those things is it raining no it's sunny I'm having a good day oh it's raining now I'm having a bad day in my walk oh it's windy no you are things aren't going so well it's daytime hallelujah it's that time where am I going I can't see that someone is in the out of court they're affected by the elements of the world now someone it goes into the inner court there's a roof so they say the storms indifferent yo what's happening in the world doesn't affect them but but the thing is now in the outer court there's the natural light of the Sun now there's a manufactured light of a seven golden candlesticks that was young me light in that place but there was a man-made light you had to keep topping there to keep filling the oil oil Bowl and the oil fit up into the candlesticks so men had to physically keep doing something to to keep light in the place you follow me man still had to do something you've still got to do something to keep life but it's but it's just a natural life right it's just a natural life I mean those in the outer Court act the manner in the wilderness and everyone rejoiced but then the man who went old and stale right but then in the inner court now there is the shewbread and different things but it was a man-made light it was a man-made life but those who we were into the veil they went through that in a veil where they wear the mercy seat where the artist was in the mercy seat in the cherubims and the ship kind of glory the prince of god came over the mercy seat I mean it wasn't a natural light anymore those are supernatural life because eternal life was more than just the light as a person hallelujah is God Himself veiled in a pillar of fire hallelujah and there was a thing of mana there that never got old and never went sales and never ran out hallelujah and it's the same thing out in the article people can all rejoice wasn't that a glorious meeting wasn't that a wonderful convention hey have you heard that sermon it was so wonderful and you're eating the manner but in the manner goes away and people go from Kent - careful Sunday the Sunday a we say - whatever amen but then when someone goes into the inner court and a veil goes into the earth the man who never gets old hallelujah and never yo it doesn't have to be collected every morning or whatever it was there's a pot over there that never runs out hallelujah and you're not you're not affected by by the storms of the world I mean in the problems show these problems and storms I mean but you're sealed in I mean you're hidden away with Christ your life is hidden from the world hallelujah brother Graham sees with us you're the teeth ceiling makes it sound proof I mean you don't even hear what the world is saying and doing hallelujah because you're hidden away within our Lord Jesus Christ amen you've gone within the veil with the glories never failed hallelujah no longer Tufts about of you know all these that manner and I can't eat it now because I've ran out and off you know different things are going on I mean your life you're living a hidden life hallelujah I trust you can say I'm dwelling in that place I don't just go on once a year and then go out again this is my dwelling place I mean I've really found rest hallelujah I really found eternal rest for my soul amen because I mean I've been bitten coming mother you understand this is not your ability to get into that place I mean as a deed calling to the deep I mean is a deep call coming to my presence coming to where I am I mean that it's not affected by the sunshine and whatever more but you're heading away with me hallelujah amen if you're in that place friends you're not tossed about doesn't matter what people do what's going on you're in there with your king with your bridegroom hallelujah amen and you don't have to fill up the oil that the light keeps shining here's the oil here's the life hallelujah and it never goes out hallelujah I trust to ask the musicians to come I'm just gonna in but hey where are you living I just want to really put it on you we're at the end of all things where are you living well I go to church I'm a good person doesn't matter doesn't matter how good you think you are goodness doesn't give you anything with God there's a thief hanging on a cross and their scribes and Pharisees there who are the good of people amen naturally would think the scribes and Pharisees who way better more people than a thief on a cross maybe but here's a thief condemned to die Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom they cease today you'll be with me in paradise Oh hallelujah and the other one said if you're really the Son of God come off the cross will believe you and they condemn themselves with their own testimony it's not how good we are it's I've heard thy voice our Lord and I come I mean because you've called me I've received your invitation and Here I am hallelujah so where are you living today I mean I trust you've passed the ribbon veil where the Glory's never fail amen you say well that sounds all but far-fetched no Jesus Christ is here he's alive he's present he's not back 2,000 years ago or with the Apostles or wherever you want to see him in church history he's present amen is that and there's a reality of a people that really walk into the earth and to the holy of holies well what does that mean you're sealed into the kingdom but with His Holy Spirit amen and your nature has changed your outlook on life has changed everything you are has changed because you become a new creature in home hallelujah and nothing they meant gee you can be like the Apostle Paul none of these things move me yes I'm sealed away you think the high priest was conscious of what was going on in the camp when he was in the Holy of Holies you think he said oh there's trouble in the tribe of Reuben and what's GAD doing and what's Asha doing and what's jutsu doing if he couldn't hear those things he couldn't hear the squabbling and and and the politics of what's going on out there he was shut in Alleluia and made you walk you into that place understand we may never see the pillar of fire visibly but we feel as a fix I mean when we feel this presence come down that's God coming into the room I remember to imagine stepping into that place now maybe in the inner court your baby have a look like this of menorah if you've never been in there before there's the menorah there's the you have a look around but then when you walk into thee into the Holy of Holies do you think you'd be looking at anything else is a supernatural being there's a god you see lifted be like mid there being Sun Moon and stars that's the God that dwells in the proper Moses and brought us out of this out of bondage into the promised land you'd be fixed on that would you know how lujah your whole life would be centered or Matt where are you living amen don't be distracted who who your eyes upon keep your eyes on Jesus amen let's stand shall we I just want to ask you the question where are you living amen let's pray together gracious father lord I pray you would take these chopped-up words Lord and may you just move upon every heart just now and Lord may you Lord because father unless you come Lord we can't see ourselves for the state we're really in or we can't even think clearly so father I just pray Lord you just move on every heart just now may they think where am I am i outside outside and the outer court and everything's affecting me Oh am i in the inner and a Court where I've got to keep topping up the oil that I can see it's my ability that gives me victory or am i in the Holy of Holies where your presences and I'm shuttin and the presence of the king and this the and there's the ark is the mercy seat it's got blood on it and I receive forgiveness of sin and all I see is you our God and your glory and I'm eating on the manner that you've allowed me to eat from and it doesn't get old it doesn't get stale Lord your word never gets old or stale it gets more glorious Oh father may you Lord I pray you'd bring each one and Lord that they would know that they're shut in with God in the secret place father may you grind it Lord may everyone truly be in rest Lord as you said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden take on my yoke upon take my yoke upon you and it is easy in light and I'll give you rest for your souls father it's an individual affair Lord it's not a ceremony or formality it's an individual thing between us and you so father I pray Lord Lord God if there's anyone here lauder he does it hasn't taken the yoke Lord if they haven't come and got rest their souls from you Lord I pray your Lord you just move upon their hearts father and Lord may they just be Lord just totally surrendered to you father and you had filled them to overflowing with your spirit granted father Lourdes want to commit the service into your hands and Jesus Christ's name may even be in rest I pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen
