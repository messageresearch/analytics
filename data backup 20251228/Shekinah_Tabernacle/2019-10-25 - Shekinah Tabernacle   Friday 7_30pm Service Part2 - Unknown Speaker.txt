saw that she was there fast minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her amen proverbs 20:1 proverbs chapter 21 Lester's reverse um as a reverse to the Bible says every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the Lord pondereth the hearts a man a Lord blessed meat of his word you can have your seats amen tonight by the grace of God I want to use for subject the power of choice the power of choice and if I could start by saying it like this everybody in this room today had to make a choice you made a decision on what kind of clothes you were going to put on you know what you're gonna eat which route you were gonna take to get down here some of you made a choice a couple months ago whether or not you were gonna come to this camp you know so God has given us the power of choice and from the first time when God created man he put them in position to make their own choices God is not a God to where he makes us do what he wants us to do God is a lover huh he's not a brute he's not in the business of making us do his will no God could easily strike all of us with the power of submission and we do whatever God wants us to do but that's not really love so God wants us to be in love with him and whatever we do whatever choices we make concerning the kingdom of God it's because we love him hallelujah I don't come to church because I made they come to church I come because I love it I don't sing unto the Lord because somebody making me sing I do it because I love it puh-leeze I live right because I love it I preach the gospel because I love it [Music] you have to make a choice nobody's gonna make you get anything out of the service you have to make a discontent decision to say god I'm choosing you tonight despite what anybody else may say you have to make up your own mind to accept Jesus Christ and everything that comes along with him and let me tell you something choosing Christ is not always easy it's not always easy but it's always gratifying it'll always work out for your good so by choosing Christ you can never make a bad decision holy but I want you to understand that this weekend and even even so tonight you have to make a choice you have to come see I had to make a choice you know even by making a statement of saying I got enough honey I got enough ginger I got enough now I'm making the choice to stand on the word now I'm making a choice and see one thing I want you to understand young people adults one thing about choices your choice really becomes an opportunity through church as far as alaman alaman Eve thank god gave them the ability to make a choice honey God he gives us his word but he doesn't make us obey he puts it in your lap and then he says what are you gonna do with this word I've given you and I want to tell you young people you have to make a choice you're not always gonna be hardly led by your parents but you're gonna have to make a choice and it's just like we say Adam and Eve had to make their choices but you know what the children also had to make that choice when you go and look at Cain and Abel earlier now it was the time for them to make their own conscious decision how they felt about God how what was there a revelation of God when it came to worship see some of your revelation is just let me come to church sit down be nice and quiet and nobody won't bother me and that's alright you can make that choice but does that choice give you an opportunity to experience more of God and some of us we make the choice to come to church and worship honey so if I worship holy then I step into the opportunity of the one I'm worshipping to come down and put me in to a reality so you hurry up you can let your flesh you can make a decision by what your flesh phone or you can make a decision about what your spirit won't and I guarantee you your flesh will never be right cuz your flesh I say I'm tired your flesh will make the choice to be tired and to be disinterested to be discouraged and all these things but your spirit man can hunger for more of God but I wanna I wanna go through the Bible and I wanna just deal with some characters of choice in the power of choice you know they're people in here who's made a choice that changed their life for the rest of their life oh yeah hey man some of us have made good choices some of us have made bad choices oh yeah but now you have the opportunity to make the best choice of your life yeah we made choices we were in the world but those were the good choices but now in the kingdom of God and we can make choices that will lead us straight to God you can make a choice to stand on God's Word and it'll lead you to healing you can take a choice hallelujah to receive Christ as your Savior hallelujah you can make a choice to receive Christ as your deliverer you can do that today and keep the benefit of that choice your choice will become an opportunity Wow you know to be a blessing some of us miss the opportunity to be a blessing cuz we let our flesh get it away hallelujah right now by your aim hands you can present an opportunity to the Word of God but letting the blessings of God come down in this place you ain't man annoys the word that God may come down and show himself but some of us make the choice to remain silent so she's coming he's he's you young people may not understand this but he's come and taking away everything that can hurt me every pain every discouragement every failure God has taken all of that away oh yeah he's giving me the choice to believe in his greatness to believe in his power to believe in Redemption money he's giving me the choice oh yeah to say my god is good and I'm trying to give you the opportunity to experience what I had and what some of these other adults have you make the right choice hallelujah and my opportunity becomes your opportunity you know right now you know we come to camps and we say Saturday night it's gonna be it's gonna be the explosion cuz we're expecting something it always happens on Saturday night why not make the choice to make this night you're not don't wait for another day another hour another minute God says today you hear my voice harden not your heart Moses head hallelujah who be on the Lord he said make your choice Moses and Joshua told the church make a decision one said choose ye this day whom you gonna serve did Elijah the prophet comes and he also tells his church make a choice if it seems evil to serve God you didn't did you serve bail he says what have you come on the Lord's side we want the real God the true God to answer by fire nobody's gonna do it for you look ya'll know oh my feel my help will coming on y'all know how I feel about the Holy Ghost receiving the Holy Ghost is a choice but it's the best choice you could ever make it's better than Krispy Kreme Doughnuts oh yeah it's better oh my it's better than a nice organic ginger beer y'all know I like curry but it's better than lamb curry with potatoes and spicy this choice the choice of Jesus Christ hallelujah gives you an opportunity to go to heaven hurry and beat his presence forever the choice of Jesus Christ gives you the opportunity to look at demon powers and say you got no right in me why not make your choice to seek to receive Jesus tonight or you can sit back hallelujah Church we look in the scripture as far as Cain and Abel God throws little boys he's okay so Adam and Eve say the day I want you to let the boys go to church by themselves and let the boys worship me by the sense mama daddy stay home I want to see what these boys think of me now I want to see their choices of worship I can tell what's in your heart by the way you worship I can tell what's going to home but how you respond to the word honey talking about the music how do you talk about the worship of music I was about to worship of the word cuz music will faint but the word is eternal and we can tell if you have an experience with God but a choice you make of worship you look at Cana name I was familiar with Cain and Abel but we want to look at their choice you know Abel came probably said you know cuz I believe Kane came probably came out first and you know he probably thought he was better than Abel please he came out he came to worship he probably told Abel let me show you how it's done oh look at his choice it was something nice and pretty that means it was never God because God is love now think about your choices if it's God it can never fail I told her I said girl that's going to preach in the next day I appreciate at a church but I can't what accredit God holy is love he meant love never faileth heylia so if it fails if you make a choice to love and it fails that means it was never God in the first place if you make a choice to do something and it fails that means it was never God in the first place why because God cannot fail we would take a poll right here tonight and say by show of hands how many of us has God never failed me I don't see has he ever failed you has he ever come up short anybody nobody so that mean just should be a supernatural visitation tonight because we all believe that there is no failure in God so as a collective group tonight we're making a choice to believe in the supernatural we'll make it a choice to believe that all things are possible if you don't know God tonight you need an atmosphere where all things are possible if you got struggles in your life you're in an atmosphere where all things are possible if you're sick in your body you're in a happy sphere where healing is here you know the price hallelujah the freedom of God is here in this atmosphere you just got to make a choice to receive it cuz we can't give it to you taking God and His Word is a conscious decision you know like I said you know how I feel about the Holy Ghost I have the Holy Ghost in bottles or in jugs and lying all y'all up one by one and get some mugs call the priestess I know we gonna pray we're gonna give me the whole that goes tonight wouldn't that would not be wonderful wouldn't that be quite lovely if we look at our children and say tonight I'm gonna give you the Holy Ghost whether you like it or not I'm gonna make you drink we don't drink like we're in college at a sorority house drink drink drink tank tank tank you know what I will do I'll make the choice every day my kids come home Hey time for a refill it calculate million parents dancing but daddy you gave us the Holy Ghost yesterday I say you can never have enough come on it's time to Train come on come on line up and we're all three of you the ladder let's do it again it's time to drink it's time for another dose here are some kisses they make a choice not to get the Holy Spirit but what wheels in that time brothers - oh yeah if we had kegs and bottles of the Holy Ghost around it wouldn't matter what you were saying my child you gonna get this holy ghost i tell you come on you call from school they say where daddy let me do my horn that can wait well daddy we've been in school all day I'm hungry that can wait Oh daddy I gotta take my social count that can wait it's time for refilling Wow but you know what hallelujah we do have kegs of the Holy Spirit in church tonight we do have the gush of the Holy Spirit and change tonight we do have the presence of the Holy Spirit tonight all you have to do is make a choice Lord fill me up let it overflow make a choice stop looking back on the sidelines and participate it's time to drink let this Holy Ghost choke you out so I don't see no more you hold I see is the Holy Ghost running at your mouth running lights and nose Tomodachi is Church what I'm preaching to you tonight is a reality there's enough power oh yeah there's enough Holy Ghost in here tonight huh - control your walk to control your talk to control your mind to control your whole body all you have to do is make a choice when it comes to God oh god I want you to do is say Lord I accept [Music] don't let your choices become a wasted opportunity hallelujah you think about God I was like some of you guys coming to church faithful depart act apart but you know what my mama she knew I had no Holy Ghost yeah you know she said huh my that boy need the Holy Ghost yeah he come to church he even sing a special every nineteen honey but he ain't got no life what good is your soul if the Holy Ghost ain't behind you what good is your attendance if it's not projecting life why didn't you come to this camp meeting I hope it ain't from just for brother Andy's food you have to make a choice and I know some of you have come because and I know some of you have come because he is here that's what you made your choice that's your sole purpose for being here because you talked about and you make choices based on your flesh and not on your spirit now don't get me wrong I'm all for Christian young people mingling but mingle with God first you need to dance with Jesus first you need to let God sweep you off your feet hallelujah and if God ever sweeps you off your feet I carry kale you'll make the right choice but you know kids digging digging disguise real will make parents don't be fooled they know how to play the game then you will leave them alone that's what they do trust me been there done I knew exactly what to do to keep mama on my back and that spirit has not change how kids know exactly what to do they'll dress the part they'll look the part they'll come to the meetings all these things and some of them don't even have a desire for God some of them already made a choice well y'all do that when I get a certain age deuces come but your prayers can change let me tell you young people hallelujah your deceit and your deception is no match for a praying parent it's no match for the love of a mother the love of a father honey your decisions don't mean nothing will you get a praying parent I wanted to be a football player but look at me now what is it I'm a product of Prayer a mother who made a choice despite what I saw despite what the church people said about me she said holy God gave her a promise that all of her children are gonna come back to the borders of the kingdom and they will know God I won't some of you parents to make a choice not to give up on your children but to pray and to pray and to praying listen your five senses does not declare the work of God we make choices based upon what we see what we hear I had people in church in my church tell my momma yo boy cuz your boy unstable and you feel like that but other kids in your church shame on you cuz you ought to be standing with that parent praying that that child could see who's always wanted this why do things have to happen to our kids before we pray like that we can see other kids going through it but we like you make the choice to turn your back you know what if that child has the seed of God that child is your brother or sister but we don't pray like that just something happens to our kids well let me say it like this I know you hurry up I love you I love you and your family and if demons are messing with your children they messing with me because we are a body and every every member olea has a need oh yeah let's make a choice to bind in together oh yeah and fight the good fight of faith coaches young people understand serving God is the best thing you could ever do Church let me tell you something let me tell you people something about this God we serve every every day I try to get something to myself so if I can find it in the word that means we serve a God that knows no failure we serve a God that whenever he steps into battle he has a guaranteed policy guaranteed to win guaranteed to come out also guaranteed to produce victory that's who we serve I've made a choice to serve a god that cannot lie and he cannot fail [Music] you know sitting in the house I was saying that to myself god I know you can't I know you can't fail and then he dropped something missing my spirit that goes along with that if God can't lie and God can't fail you know what else brothers do God does not worry so parents you don't have to worry about your children all you have to do is claim never claim them in the name of Jesus Christ call their name now hug by the token make the choice to apply the token of the blood of the Lamb to your whole household what we do we look at conditions and we make choices based upon what we see you ever been going down the road and you see a traffic jam different direction you wait five minutes so that knows the person to get out of the way the traffic was going smooth but you miss the opportunity to get there quicker because you didn't have enough patience to wait oh yeah stop making impulsive decisions and pray about things and let God lead you to the right choice cuz I want to give you an opportunity to make a choice let's go back to the boys Cain and Abel King he didn't brought all this stuff of the flesh to God in the Bible says God refused it you know why he refused it because God couldn't see himself in that worship all the greatest mysteries is receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation that may be all right for you but I like a little motion in church I like a little fire in church Church we're not at no ball game we're not into some concert so how emotion is spiritual emotion this is good emotion we're not excited earlier about the rugby game or some our excitement it's about the Word of God how excitement is about this atmosphere so why can't we have a little emotion if it's the right kind of a mossad and for those of you who need a quote the prophet of God said when the Holy Ghost comes it breaks our motion they also have a wildfire there's no fire at all but what we try to do is make everybody's experience the same I might wanna say I might want to do a backflip up here you know what I like about if I do it the old wonder whether is God and that is me and God God the only one know if I'm putting on because he knows what kind of life i'ma live I do that back asleep so make the choice to leave it alone robot was the messenger y'all know what is the most radical people in church was brother Brett - MS o now well y'all know he preached a message he went around and around and around the tree y'all know he demonstrated that in church he ran around the pulpit he kept running around the pool right in Jefferson field right in the Branham table right in front of all those still small voice were suppose and I got a picture oh yeah well he got so excited he jumped on the pulpit sat on top of it and started swinging his legs while he was preaching and you got another quote honey we saw a girl dancing in his church these are you telling my church until tavern he's a god show me where's a scripture and God took him to marry him God took him to Marian with the tambourine and she begin today's see we get to watch touch this is in the Bible [Applause] worship is in the pipe hoe emotion is in the pipe hope is that wasn't good enough God made the choice to destroy that thought and think God took him to David hallelujah and he said David saw the Ark of the Covenant on its way it wasn't even there yet and David began to dance and David begin to worship why because he knew what's that I got back they never lose another battle [Music] why do you are something I worship because like David in his presence hurry there is the fullness of joy I don't worship for you I worship for him there's only one audience in the audience of one is price you wonder why your kids not excited could they sit beside you Oh get mad at me brother being told me to be myself you want out kids shouting hey man the word when all they doing is pulling off your spirit and all you're doing is sitting there looking at the preacher don't a man don't wave your hands don't do nothing but you want your child to do everything that you don't do did you get anything out of service I don't know did you want a rebuke you want a job all the stuff you make them feel less of a Christian any name and they say it all I'm doing is what you do but you know what Holly I will never be guilty hallelujah in my kids eyes of not giving God praise honey they see me worship they see me run they see me give God praise they see me shout they see me jump they see me Street they see me love God Wow I make a choice to demonstrate how good my god has been to me never be able to say my dad don't love to be in church what it will say is Daniel a fanatical I know one time how the church I'm having I make people mad because they bound that's your choice whom the Lord has set free is free indeed so I'm not going to apologize for you be bound to your own ways [Applause] I'm not gonna apologize for saying hello yer gods occurred to me for me to be silent and when your kids get on board dare defend you with somebody else talking trash then one day I told them but you're not and that time supposed to be Fraser my daughter and my daughter read her lips leave my daddy alone let him shout let him dance let him watch up that's who he is and besides you need to shut up do kids know if you fake it or not well it's we saw king worship it's worse than was something of the earth but Abel made a choice to be led by the spirit and it didn't look right can you see him I will show you how powerful his choice for he wouldn't got a lamb he walking to go worship and you know Mom and Dad it was looking now mom and daddy you know they couldn't go window but they saw him going to worship they couldn't all the worship for them but they saw it now here comes honey they didn't watch Cain and God they rejected Cain now he comes Abel making his choice he comes with that lamb then he just the lamb kind of nice everything look all cute pretty nice and clean you know that'd be a perfect you know why cuz God had to see himself in that hole in that choice colors so now Abel everything he's doing he's doing it by inspiration who was making his choice God Church look he grabs the lamp across come across he turns around with a rocket shooting everywhere now oh yeah Kings really like if God didn't accept my pretty fruit I know he's not gonna set your mess but how many knows the Holy Ghost is a mess the birth coming to a birth is a mess oh yeah but once you come into that birth he's sorry warning it's so gratifying it's so sweet and pleasant once you come to that birth judging he's done hacking and blood start squirting everywhere and Eve grabbed him by the hand because you young people get your own experience with God God will show you things that mom and daddy didn't tell you you have your own experience with God cuz you make the right choice you look a blood squirting everywhere did you tell him skin cuz their choice was religion fig leaves just like cane something of the flesh oh yeah but Abel saw your choice was called the mind of God just like he did for Adam and Eve huh he wrapped him in skin dripping with blood no he knows offer a blood it's his own choice sacrifice why huh Leah because he seized the moment he seized opportunity honey to be a type of Christ and that's what happens will you make the right choice you become a type of the bride in Christ in his relationship but to come down Oh different ones had to make a choice Esther had to make a choice I say I had to make a choice John had to make a choice Jesus he led by example because I remember his flesh didn't wanna die his flesh had been beaten and whipped more than the other man honey but he had to make a choice huh what was his choice he saw all of us he made a choice to die so that we could him so why don't we die so he can live young people Christ died so that you can have the choice to live so why don't you die so Christ can live through you who make the right choice listen I want you to think about your choices you know properly God said it's not God's will that anybody go to hell he has no pleasure net remember God is a lover he's not a brute she's not a beast the Bible say what we think to be slackness concern and God has gotten long-serving long-suffering hug because he don't want to see nobody perish but he want to see everybody safe but he knows who's gonna make the right choice honey but a prophet of God say God listen listen good he says God let me read it listen he said it's not necessary that any man will go to hell what's God doesn't have a desire to see people burn in hell hell was created for the devil and his angels not for any of you none of you God didn't create hell were you in mine so if you find yourself in hell it was your choice it's not necessary we'll go to him thank God don't see no one to help you send yourself to hell God don't God done everything in the world he can keep you from going to hell and yet you're determined to go to this little prophecies he says you fight over every barricade God says don't do that you say I want him I want him so much because he's hot and God tells you don't do it he barricaded he makes it so hard for you to get next to that serpent you kick the barricade down cuz you in your feelings don't do it are you making the wrong choice you bust through the barricade when God is trying to stop you let me say this when we as an individual all of us when we are doing wrong we already know you know by the choice you make if I can say it like this Church oh yeah God doesn't condemn you you condemn yourself by the choices you make before I turn into the guy you see now I was like some of you sitting in church I'm gonna drop a dime on you now drop a dime on some you children so are you young people let me tell you Paris something if you don't see the fruit of the Holy Spirit in their life that means they're dancing with the enemy because you can only serve one master and if you don't see the fruits of the Holy Spirit that means they're entertaining of spirits so stop being all girly boy every time oh he's such a nice boy do you see the Spirit of God and if they're not producing the life of Christ that means something else is going on inside something else is going only they mind something else is going on anybody but if you ain't producing my life that means you dancing with something else they go happen you sit at home sneaking listening to the Meagles ain't go what is the car to be what you don't know but your children do it's the spirit you got in your house and they mostly in everybody's house the spirit that we're aware of it's called YouTube I hate to use this type but I'm gonna use it I feel gosh every spirit will mature have you nibbling and Ibelin with the devil it will mature to a full demon you know I was talkin me my daughter was talking you know she's not a drug user but I was just I was just dropping some knowledge or I was like look they don't even understand what's happening nowadays all of us make marijuana legal and all this stuff and they did it our way they making the holy stuff legal but what I want you to understand the marijuana they smoking is not real it's made in a laboratory it's synthetic because anything real comes from a seed and the stuff that they smoking now it doesn't come from a seed it's something produced and made in a laboratory so what kind of effect it's gonna have on them when they start smoking it it becomes an addiction but that's how start real simple real easy if you make that choice you make the wrong choice all the stuff that's going on now is original everything is a byproduct everything is something that the devil has perverted even your fun you have to make the right choice I'm gonna play Connect four what's the basis of Connect for making the right choice but if you really pay attention to the game the game is always about your next choice so you make a move to set yourself up for the next move in the next move for the next move and not only are you playing office but your grant defense everything about Connect four is about the next choice not only your choice but the choice of your enemy also so you need to look at hallelujah what you're doing the choices you're making your choices just don't affect you but it'll affect the people you close to you know affect your mom and dad either people in your house so you have to make choices you have to make the next room move earlier that works out for the good of everybody that loves you because just like honey playing Monopoly you make their own choice you find yourself in jail mostly every game you can play it's about Oh he says and yet you determined to go to hell you fight every barricade God puts in your way you just go right on over it don't believe in this and I don't believe in that and I don't believe in this just don't reason with the Word of God because the word is not going and I wanted to start the meeting with this vote because your choice tonight it will dictate the rest of your meeting you can leave out here closer to God was presented with the same situation all of you tonight are being presented with the same situation either you know God oh you don't and you don't know God what's hindering you your choice so Naomi says hey you know y'all just go back with your mama you know it's gonna be a long time and this is that whatever when she first told them to go back no no we don't stay with you no we love you and then Naomi start talking about life and she started talking about opposition and struggle and she start saying hey if I have another are you gonna wait that long you know are you gonna hang around that low you're gonna make this season to stay around that no when I have nothing to offer you all for say deuces see I want you to understand it rules my group was like I'm not going back to that I'm not going back to a more black religion I'm roof was like I'm the product of incest she's like I'm not going back to that brother branham said of

mom and and she was happy with me and but she told me that even though you have been released from it Satan will come back and try put that back on you and she told me that there's power and the power
