morning i mean i trust you all everyone's well and you'd be in the house the lord together and oh i i left the clicker i think in there somewhere anyway um hey god bless you let's just turn in the scripture too uh i just want to go to the song of solomon chapter eight and then we're going to go to i'm sorry that uh yeah that's a problem with me in slideshows because things change we'll come back to this at some time it's a song of solomon uh verses chapter eight and we're gonna read from verse five down to verse 7 and then we're going to go to matthew 21 amen so who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee set me as a seal upon thy heart and as a seal upon my arm for love is strong as death jealousy as cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which have the most vehement flame many are many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it shall be utterly condemned now and let's go to matthew i don't have it on here let's go to matthew chapter 21. and we're just going to read from verse 4 down to verse 11. and so i don't have it on the powerpoint as i say things change uh all this was done this is jesus telling his disciples to to go get the cult uh that he'd write upon him to do um into jerusalem all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh upon uh unto thee so i meek and sitting upon an ass and a cult the fall of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they set him there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed his is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee amen he's in a word of prayer lord jesus lord as we as standing here with our heads bowed lord this morning we're just asking that once again you would walk among us lord you would speak to us like only you can lord you touch our hearts like only you can lord we just want to just invite you to to this building

we are assembled lord might be done in jesus christ's name we ask amen god bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning i wonder if i could take a title um i want to take this question so where are we who is this that cometh from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved who is this woman who is this woman you know there's always a question you know people look and they wonder who are these people you know we read there and um you know we read there in matthew 21 that euro the whole city was stirred you know brother brown dramatizes it in the message what is the you know the attraction on the mountain he'd say it was like a hot kind of day and there was a expectation in the air and people were gripped by you know by by by what was going on and and many were just caught up in the moment they didn't really fully even grasp what was going on even the disciples didn't really know what was going on you know you know the master just said go to the certain village you'll see a cult there by the certain house and go loose it and bring it here and you know you know and but but prophecy was being fulfilled and you know the word of god was being manifest and here was the son of david he was the king of kings riding into the riding into the city and and we know if you look at history there were many great conquerors rode into that city many great conquerors alexander the great would ride in there you know king david would ride in there many great men many great generals many great armies would march in but here was the greatest one that would ever stand upon the earth in human flesh he was the greatest he was more than a general he was more than a king but he was the creator himself made flesh and he was riding up into the city now it's amazing when you think about it in the human mind you'd think he'd have the finest finest horse that they could ever be you know they would search literally the earth for the finest stallion or the finest whatever it may be the finest horse whatever color you know whatever height however many hands tall you know and it'd be right in the finest robes and the fight you know and the and the procession would be so great there'd be you know everyone would be you know dressed up you know you know the best way they can be who's seen a military parade you know who seemed like when you know royalty dies in england and there was a great pomp and ceremony as the carriage ghosts passed through wherever it goes and you know there's all the troops and they're all there you know you think it'll be that kind of possession but here were people a bunch of ragtag people cutting branches off palm trees throwing their coats down and i doubt you know they were ever really very clean you know a bunch of ragtag bunch of peasants we would call them you know just to the natural eye now and they were laying down their coats they were throwing down the palm trees out crying out hosanna blessed is he that you know comes in the name of the lord and and and the scribes and pharisees because the whole city was moved and they said who is this what is going on here what's this noise you know this is not what normally happens on this kind of day what's going on here and and and they told them this is jesus of nazareth the prophet of galilee hallelujah but what was happening the word was being fulfilled there was an attraction there was a drawing there was a pull but when they looked at him they were saying no this is not the son of david this is not him but it was him hallelujah now i showed you wait let's just i showed you this photo picture rather this drawing last week and i was talking about the heart of the people and you know how they are prepared and the arc was you know there but you know we would think if something was greater than this it would look greater right it would look greater so the temple would be bigger the you know the the the altar would be fancier you know the people would be more finely dressed it would be you know the trumpets would be tuned better we think would be greater but the thing is as the lord uh changes his form i'd say the outward appearance actually does not look greater but the inward glory is far greater right so so you take this now here is god coming to dwell among his people in the temple that that his son david had a desire to build and we know that when the ark took its place the glory of the lord filled the place and the ministers couldn't minister it was a glorious occasion but we know that that wasn't god's final resting place you know he says god doesn't dwell in a temple made with hands he doesn't need man to craft stones and build plans and you know put in a foundation and put rocks and you know this is not how god works this is this is not his final resting place i mean but but god dwells in the human heart and even even when he'd say in isaiah you know i made the heavens i made the universe i made you can't even see to the edge of the universe but i made everything in it heaven is my throne earth is my footstool but where's the place of my rest he's actually saying you know i made everything but where's the place i can rest holy i want a final resting place is what god wants i mean so we would think naturally that if if god would have a final resting place it would look greater than that outwardly that's not the case this was the final resting place god ordained amen because remember the the earthly tabernacle you know the earthly temple was just a transition but this was god's final intent was that he would dwell in man once again so you'd think it would look greater than this now to god this was far greater because he took 120 people i mean that gave their lives surrendered their lives to him didn't matter where they came from amen remember remember the you know the you know the material that made the temple came from many different places right many different places shoot out of different quarries and wood came from different places and stones and but eventually when the temple came together and god came and dwelt in the temple that was the important thing and it's the same thing with these stones as the scripture says we are lively stones we're living stones you know even even the disciples were amazed at how great the temple was now we know that herod rebuilt you know this is solomon dedicating the temple so it was destroyed we know rebuilt in nehemiah's day expanded you know in in herod's day and and that and the disciples said to said to um jesus what goodly stones are here because remember they're from galilee they're from the backwater but now here they are in the capitol everything's big and shiny and wow you know look at these stones and jesus just saying basically don't pay attention to these stones it may look fancy but it's not fancy you know it may look like the real thing but no no and he's actually jesus is addressing the stones that are the real part of the temple he's actually looking at stones you know when when jesus came into his ministry what did he do go go to peter james and john come follow me went to matthew come follow me went to the womb at the well basically come follow me and begin to call stones for the building i mean because he knew where those stones were he knew what rubber sheep they were in didn't matter if they were a tax collector if they zacchaeus if the other woman at the well if they are legion if they were ignorant fishermen that didn't matter it doesn't matter where we came from i mean the thing that matters is where we're going hallelujah that's the important thing amen so we must never ever focus on where we came from we should focus on where we're going that's the most important thing hallelujah so now jesus began to call stones hallelujah and and and he began to gather these stones but we know the intent of the temple is not to be a vacant temple right he didn't just gather people to see if he could gather people but he had an intent in gathering those people so now here was 120 in the upper room and i don't know if this is how it exactly was but you know here was this looked far worse than this i will agree here here was a bunch of ragtag people you take the head of this group he tried to kill a guy with a sword and then he denies the god he's trying he was professing to defend and the reason he he cut the guy's air off is because he wasn't a swordsman he's a fisherman so so now all so the past is an attempted murderer right matthew's a tax collector well they're dodgy to begin with you know there's the woman at the well well we know where she came from amen oh look at these guys who profess to be the ministry ignorant unlearned men you know how can you ever trust people who can't even sign their own name they're not really here you know they haven't learned anything but this was the people that this is the caliber of people that god gathered i mean it didn't matter what problems they had didn't matter what complexes they had didn't matter what pain they were carrying god wasn't looking at the pain or the complexes of where they came he said come and follow me hallelujah and they said lord let's go we'll follow you hallelujah so so he gathered these stones so here they were they weren't finally dressed the upper room wasn't a big fancy place this is in my opinion they weren't finally dressed they just looked like the common you know people even the lord himself when he was walking through jerusalem i believe he just would have walked past many people and they would never have never have noticed him you know it's just like you know it amazes me i wish i should take a screen grab of it i should do but who's seen the deep call to the deep film okay so there's this one part and so brother brahms here i guess there's someone here and he's discerning the hearts and things and you see a guy walk past with the newspaper who's seen it this guy is walking past with a newspaper just like this along the platform why did he get out of the service you know it's on film you can see it he's just like reading a newspaper walking by and here's god coming down the son of man is being revealed the most powerful jesus christ is you know brother braham said that jesus did more in his ministry than he did in his own earthly ministry because notice he did more not me he says i'm just your brother so god did far more in this end time than even in this whole scriptures being recorded and a guy's walking past it reading a newspaper missing the whole thing we don't want to fall into that category of of of people you say could people really do that well they did it when jesus was here they should do it when god is now in his church so here they were ragtag bunch of people and outwardly you know what are these people doing but this was far more glorious remember i started with the scripture from from the song of solomon who is this that that you know cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved who is this one who is this beloved hallelujah so this was far greater glory amen than than the temple because now god wasn't just dwelling in a temple of stone but he was walking in his people i mean where exactly he intended to dwell this is where he wanted to dwell and sometimes we allow ourselves not even just the devil to belittle who we are in christ i'm just a common person i'm not very smart i'm not very i'm just i'm just average i just hit average you know i just i i just passed my trick i just got my degree i just hit average solid average you know anyway but i mean look at the bride of christ even the apostle paul says where's the lord where's the scribes among you where's the great people you know he's asking these questions and many times we you know we even allow the devil allows you know or we allow him or even ourselves to we say there's nothing special about us okay maybe i'll just preach myself again welcome you know but look at these people look at these guys there's mary peter whoever you know nothing special about them they weren't the celebrity of the city no one really knew who they were but in god's mind hallelujah here's my beloved i may have been waiting for her to come to the earth and now i'm just not sending someone i'm coming myself to gather her hallelujah to me hallelujah amen so this is you know you're in god's mind these ones these were the these are the whole thrusts these are his motivation you say to get up in the morning not that god sleeps but you know sometimes we get up and we've got such a drive i've got to do a certain thing amen i've got to i've got to do this at work or i want to spend time with my family or whatever it is you want to do i've got to you know god gets up in the morning if i can say it that way say i want to spend time with my wife i want overall and i want to express my love to her and i'll walk with her through the day you know we're his motivation glory to god and we look at ourselves saying oh boy what am i doing upon this earth we have a purpose i mean god has given us a purpose amen and we should say lord what is our purpose hallelujah you know it was funny i was like well i don't know if it was funny but i was flying back from um sister val's funeral and i don't know what however many thousand feet i am in that plane you know i'm thinking what am i really here for what am i what are we really here for now i'm not just talking about sitting in a plane i know why i'm in a plane because i just went to a funeral now i'm coming home so i know why i'm there but why am i here why am i upon the earth is it just to you know is it just to have you know is it just to have a nice family and maybe have a career maybe have a nice church and you know have good friends and you know travel or whatever is it is that really it why are we here you know we should really think about that sometimes the reason we're here is god wanted us here and he wanted a place to express himself through hallelujah amen so we you know who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved we could go back to genesis i'm just going to leave that up there because um it will just leave it there but but i want you to think about it remember the same holy ghost that came on the day of pentecost is the same god that's come to us the exactly the same one not a different god not a lesser anointing the same one i mean the same one that filled them and they went out they overcame in their age and they spread the word and they were a living witness and whatever capacity they were ordained to be it was darkest making clothes for people it was people who went and preached it was those who just helped out whatever it was whatever their capacity was or whatever they were ordained to do rather they did it amen every every one of us in this room has a place in the body of christ every single one of us is essential i mean just like brother john andy said you know we're all essential workers amen in the in the body of christ amen we are all have a part to play none of us are spectators none of us are sitting on the ground eating the popcorn saying go go go no no we're on the field amen so now we could go back to genesis chapter two when when when eve was taken out of adam and when god brought when when when god brought eve to adam he would begin to tell her because remember he's named all the animals and he named them based on their character he called the serpent the serpent because he was a serpent the fox of fox right the rat cunning is a you know you know all those different sayings we have is because he he named them by their nature and so now when he's when he's now beginning to speak to eve he says now this is bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall she shall be called woman because she is taken out of man so now he's not just identifying a different species he's actually saying this is part of me you are part of me you came out of me and we're one flesh i mean so we're not two different kind of people actually one one hallelujah so now this is so this is now the question that's being raised is who is this and now here's the answer kind of unfolding hopefully amen you know so so it wasn't eve that that that she didn't work out who she was adam told her who she was amen and it's got to be the same thing with you and i let him tell you who you are i mean because i'm persuaded i mean that we are the bride of christ i mean we are the apple of his eye we are his beloved we are his redeemed ones and the reason i can say that is not just because i'm quoting it from a book is because god comes down i mean and vindicator says or so i mean because it's when he comes in behind his word and proves it that's when all doubt can go amen oh lord you even even just to be convicted on your heart that you're wrong that's the grace of god to you that's actually god dealing with you saying child come here child walk with me i want to show you who you really are i don't want you caught up in this world and what everyone tells you you know that you should be i want to show you who you're meant to be who you really are hallelujah so so just as there was a question when when jesus went into uh jerusalem who is this if that was this if that was the question about the bridegroom it'll be the same with the bride who is this who are these people you often wonder that who am i we've all had that kind of question who am i you know as you go from a child to an adult there's always a question where do i fit yeah where do i fit you know you know like you go to school you try and fit them with these kind of people and maybe you want to try and go and join the cool kids and you know okay just me anyway and then you find out you don't fit there so you go back to where you were and you realize who true friends really are right but you know he tries to help where do i fit and and there's always uh trying to discover i just need to know where do i belong and the lord is here trying to say this is where you belong you belong with me right you belong to walk with me i mean this is where you fit hallelujah you don't fit in the world you can try and fit but it's like putting a square peg in a round hole you can force it so much but it just doesn't seem to go sometimes it sticks but it doesn't go through right so i'm like oh i you know i finally fit here but then you realize no i don't fit here it's because the lord is trying to stir you up saying you don't belong in that you're a square peg come fit in a square hole what's the square hole my word you fit with me i don't want to sound too jokey there but amen now we have to realize that with us we're not walking alone we can go to song of solomon again again i go um i don't have this on here but song of solomon 6 and 13. remember it was more than just jesus riding it wasn't just a man on a donkey riding into jerusalem that was god and the unseen realm angels were there hallelujah god was coming into a city and we have to recognize and i and and and i trust you already do but you know there's more than just us walking upon the earth if i've repeated myself well i'll just keep sorry i just repeat you know i had a lecturer inorganic chemistry lecturer he didn't give us any much handouts we just said write down what i say he says if i repeat myself there's a reason you know and it was the repeating bits that were really in the exams not necessarily all the filler and it wasn't fellow because it was you know knowledge you needed to know right but it was he said the things i repeat those are the things you should write down so we're all listening is he going to repeat it is he not and you write it down you know so maybe i'm the same way i don't know but or anyway don't say anything about mage anyway song of solomon 6-13 it says return return o shulamite return return that we may look upon thee what will ye see in the shulamite in other words who is this who is this what will you see in the shulamite as it were the company of two armies now when it speaks about the company of two armies it's talking about the the heavenly host and the natural host so there's two armies when the shulamites returning now it's not just her returning but then in the unseen realm hallelujah there's an army with her there's angels of god in attendance amen and this is from when when jacob was returning back to to to see his brother esau and the angels visited him and he realized that there's actually two camps in this place or it's called mahanayam this place called mahanayam the place of two camps so it wasn't just an earthly camp it wasn't just jacob and there's his family there's his herds and his servants and things no there was more there than what he could see with a natural eye but a visitation of angels came to him and he realized i'm not just here walking alone hallelujah you know he still had to wrestle with the angel be changed to be called israel or you know uh you know prince with god and but he recognized it's actually not just me making this journey back to my homeland hallelujah but the angels of god are in attendance so this is why this question was asked what will you see in the shulamite now the shulamat we know represents you and i i mean this this this love affair between solomon and you know you know you know the bride and the bridegroom between solomon the shulamite you know this is an allegory speaking of us in christ amen hallelujah so now there's a question now what will you see in this bride amen you'll see as it were two armies hallelujah there's the natural hey we're a mighty army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army of the lord a soldier in the army yeah if i die let me die in the army that's why i don't sing specials but you know we're a soldier we're in an army but it's not just us fighting this battle remember we are fighting against spiritual wickedness powers and high places demon powers remember this fight that we fight is not a natural fight amen that's why you've got to be able to discern when the enemy comes into your mind i mean as i think the greatest problem brother brown preaches a sermon the greatest battle ever fought right and it's such an essential amen when we're walking through this life's journey because the battle is so much in the mind these days i mean in the dark angels i mean i mean dark ages rather it was more of a the saw it was demon powers fighting the believers but they were physically tormented they are physically tortured right it was a physical fight too but here it's all up in here amen so we need to be able to discern when thoughts come into your mind and your emotions goes up and down and you get in your withdrawn and unhappy and you know complex and whatever more what's causing it right we need to be able to discern it's a hold on is this my bridegroom is this my lovely lord jesus making me think this way um if you feel that way then no why does it feel like i'm going to have a heart attack i'm all strung out and stressed and worried and flustered and is this the lord we should just stop you know this world is so fast-paced just pull over and park sit get off the motorway park sit and say is this god or is this satan there's only two it's not you know it's not like a spectrum of fully god and kind of mainly god and you know it's not like changing the heat on your in your car it's cold or hot and you just turn the dial it's mainly you know it's not a mixture it's either god or satan so we need to be able to really identify lord is this you and it's real simple you know brother brown was asked how do i know i'm thinking the thoughts of god well brother ram says well his thoughts are his word right yo that's how you know if you're thinking the thoughts of god is because well is it the scripture is it the thoughts of peace amen you know paul says whatsoever things are good whatever things are lovely true think on those things amen we say well this person did this to me well that may be true but it is true because whatever things are true uh god's word right so you know we need to be able to discern because if you can't discern an enemy he will come and do what he wants and he'll go how is a battle won a battle's won you know a battle is not necessarily just one on the battlefield it's one in intelligence you know where the enemy is then you can move according to where the enemy is why did the king of syria get so frustrated he'd send his enemy i mean so he'd send his troops into the enemy land which was israel and and then the prophet would go to the king and say they're coming here go here and then it keep happening and he thought there's got to be a mole or a spy in my camp he told his people one of you is a traitor you know and then one of his men said no hold on don't you know that israel's got a prophet and he knows your thoughts in your bed chamber so how did they win i mean how were they winning because they they knew what the enemy was doing but if they didn't know what they were doing then syria would have conquered them you know because they were a far greater nation right so it's intelligence you know it's in the intelligence and even now what happens is is how how they try and win a war as they try and start thinking ahead of what the enemy command structure will think so if you know that your enemy will do certain things then you try and preempt what he's going to do and then you can cut him off before he gets there i mean so the devil studies us i don't know why i'm going down this way but here we are you know the devil studies us he knows our weaknesses he knows our mood he knows our temperament and he knows how to use it against us right he knows because he studied us so he knows if i get them to feel this way about this thing they'll do this yep if i get them to feel this way about this thing they'll do that and he just pushes play and exactly as he predicted it happens but we have a hidden source of strength we have someone in us that can break that cycle remember we have the right weapon to overcome the devil any place anytime anywhere father ham said this end time message meets end time conditions he said it was preached 50 60 years ago now this end time message meets end time conditions amen and the anointing of the holy ghost will defeat the devil any place anytime anywhere amen we have the soldier in the battlefield i mean the holy ghost himself i remember you let him come forth into your mind and conquer that thing i mean you can't just try and wrestle in your own self that's why you the bible says draw nigh to god resist the devil and he shall flee from you hallelujah amen but we have the battle remember when the shulamites there a place of two armies what is greater than the armies of heaven what is greater remember our lord jesus went down to hell took the keys of hell death in the grave totally stripped the devil stripped them it's like marching into america and taking every single piece of armament they have every single piece and bring it home every gun every tank every missile every bomb every plane every ship stripped and they can't build them again it's like that the devil can't he he has no weapon in it all he has is a bluff you know people many many nations around the world they'll have military parades and they and their enemies will examine the footage and they should say are those weapons really real they are goose stepping along all in one and you know carrying these big fandangle guns or these big tanks and you know driving along and the enemies will say is that actually real or is that actually just a mock you know a mock-up it's like in world war ii the british during the battle of britain when the nazis were bombing england and so on they would build fake planes just out of wood and and put them on airfields so the nazis were thinking oh there's the enemy planes we're going to bomb them they're fake but from that distance they looked real and that's how the devil does he walks around with a fake gun a fake fear a fake torment a fake worry a fake what oh this could happen of all you better oh yeah no way you'll save your children no way they're going to be there no way this is going to happen oh you know all this fake kind of fear but we really need to examine it with this you know how they prove if photos have been you know photoshopped or not people study them a casual guidance will say well that's real but people will put it through a program so no that's not real there's one program we need to put the thoughts of the devil through is this program right and it will show us actually if it's true or not and he never says anything that's true amen so oh is he really telling the truth no he's lying because he doesn't know the end he knows his end right but he doesn't know the end remember his brother kaijo preached it to be continued there's always the to be continued chapter amen this is not the end of the series oh this is not the end of the program i mean there's always a next a next season coming up to be continued hallelujah that's why we must never say well i guess this is just how it's going to be no no to be continued hallelujah amen so we have a we are a place of two armies have you ever seen the lord come on the scene for you why that's the heavenly host stepping down taking taking control that means it's not just you walking around the earth god comes down and proves himself in your life amen now can we have this again i'm going to actually use it i just want to read this and just say i'll say this oh here we are no we'll go back this way okay you can't i'll read that fast now it's amazing how the lord is not ashamed to be identified with us he is not ashamed he is not ashamed to be identified just like where you know we were in the song of solomon you know she's leaning on the arms of her beloved amen he's not ashamed to say this is my woman hallelujah this is my wife everything i am is hers everything she is is mine we're one you can't you can't separate us in any way this is how he looks at you hallelujah so he says here i think thou has put this is this hebrews chapter two that was put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put in all he put all in subjection unto him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him of whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren so the one that does the sanctifying i'm just gonna speak in my own language the one that sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all of one so now he came down he became man to to identify himself with human beings right to actually not just call the people and put them to one side but actually that he would actually join himself with those people in such a way that you couldn't separate him and those people i mean just saying like the bride amen and the groom they are one so he came down as a man i mean to identify himself with you hallelujah that when he did that you can't separate him and the bride anymore he can't separate himself from you that's why he that sanctifieth and those who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren amen so so the reason he says saying i'll declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praises unto thee i mean just think about god the one who filled all time and space the one who made all things even the angels appear filthy in his sight the great holy god came down became a man because there were people upon the earth there was this bride on the earth he says i want her to lean on my arm walk out of this wilderness hallelujah i want people to ask questions who is this who is this that leans upon the arm of her beloved and so he became one of us he became the poorest of the poor amen that he'd be able to identify himself with human beings they say actually adam's fallen race they're part of me hallelujah amen it's not just they're down here and i'm up here and i want them where i am glory that's how great our god is the one who's so great he became so little and brother ham says that's actually what makes god so great he can humble himself and become so little remember to the natural light that doesn't make sense because they think of god or some big you know some great being that summons some great eternity somewhere that's you know high and lofty no that's not how god is god came down to where we are amen and he and and he identified himself in such a way amen that so he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one who's been sanctified amen i've been sanctified by the blood of the lamb hallelujah so if you've been sanctified by the blood of the lamb he's actually saying no we're one and he's not ashamed to call you brethren he's not ashamed to call you family and that word brethren actually it means um actually speaks about a brother like natural family hallelujah so he's not actually ashamed to call you family amen remember we're not some distant cousin someplace remember we're his wife amen hallelujah so so we're the closest you can be as family is amen and hallelujah so you know why are you speaking about these things let's not be browbeaten the whole purpose of this world right now is you god's god's heart everything his affections everything is he cares for you amen hallelujah brotherhood says this in the unveiling of god because i was reading a story some years ago and in the story it said a great noble king i forget the name of him but uh just now i wasn't thinking about speaking of the story perhaps fiction but it leads us to a point that gives us a background on what we want to say this king he was such a noble king and had such a great and such a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you see me for your last time for many years and as gardeners noble said to him good king why do you say that are you going to a foreign country somewhere to become an alien he said no i'm staying right here well said i'm just going out amongst my subjects i'm going to become a peasant i'm going to cut wood with the wood chopper i'm going to till ground with the toilet i'm going to prune the vines with those who prune the vines i'm going to be one of them in order to get a better acquainted with what they're doing and i love them and i want to be more acquainted with them personally you know he's a king he doesn't go until ground he doesn't he doesn't work a garden he doesn't live as a peasant no he lives in a palace and there's always a separation between the people and the king he said no this is actually this king doesn't want to be this way they won't know me but yet i want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning when his delegates and all of his people seen him or the ones was in the palace take off his crown lay it down upon the seat the throne take his robe off and put on peasants clothes walk out amongst the common people now in that little story we find out then about god they said to the king king we we want you we love you we want you to remain king but he wanted to become one of them to know them better that they would know him better really what he was see really what he was see god is so misunderstood even even even you say down through the old testament you know the people got their mind by the time when jesus came they had in their mind what god was and the lord's basically saying no no you've got the wrong impression of me you've got the wrong impression of what the word really is so he came down in flesh to actually show them who he really was that they actually would not be misunderstood this is actually my heart how i heal the sickness is my care towards humanity i raise the debt i comfort those that have suffered loss you know i i you know restore sight to the blind i cast the devil out of lives you know this is actually who i am i'm not some mean angry god who just pours out judgment no i'm one of redemption i want of healing i mean i want a restoration isn't what the word and i think many times the message has been misunderstood through the ages the bible's been misunderstood yo god i say has been misunderstood they think he's three people up in heaven somewhere angry and you know this holy god that you just approached by ceremony you don't approach him by ceremony you approach him with a contrite surrendered heart hallelujah and he's not just somewhere far away i remember he's present upon there the spirit is here working you're following me it's the same thing with the message many people you know for years they have actually misunderstood the thrust of the message this message is a message of grace and that's not just turning a blind eye to sin no it actually gives you a power to overcome sin it changes your nature that you can't do it no more not because i better keep myself a certain way no he changes your nature i mean do you actually walk according to his word hallelujah have you this is what the well maybe maybe i just been living in a happy little bubble but just leave me my happy little bubble because i'm enjoying it just me and my lord jesus it's wonderful you know but this message is a message of restoration it's come to restore a people to their rightful position in christ hallelujah we know he is a god of judgment and wrath sure but it depends who you are in relation to the king when john was told in the book of revelation that the lamb of god you know he had prevailed and you know he was found worthy to take the book and then he looked and he saw i don't know the line of the tribe of judah had been found worthy to take the book and he turned and he saw a lamb it was the same person mean but but to some he's a lamb to the bride he's the sacrifice right he's their blood he's their high priest he's their offering he's their guide isn't he i mean to some he's that right amen but but a lion represents a judge a king cruel you know harsh to some people he will be that but it depends what you've given your life to if you've given your life to him now he's your lamb right if you accept the blood now he's your lamb i remember there'll come a day where you won't be able to accept the blood and then he'll be your lion he'll be your judge hallelujah so you know it all depends on on on your relationship with him but he wants to be our lamb amen amen see to display to them what he really was and that's what god did he changed himself from being jehovah god to become one of us that he might suffer he might taste death he might know what the sting of death was and take the penalty of death upon himself he laid aside his crown and his robe and became one of us he washed feet with the lowly he dwelt in tents with the poor he slept in the woods and in the streets with those who were underprivileged he become one of us that he might understand us better that we might understand him better amen that's why never ever think god don't understand you he understands he knows what it's like to be troubled he knows what it's like to be sick he knows what it's like to suffer loss he knows what it's like to go hungry he knows what's like to be homeless he knows what it's like to suffer hardship he knows what's like to be misunderstood he knows what it's like to be made fun of he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to you know you know just be mocked and talk badly behind your back and and slander and all those things he knows what it's like he's been there that when we go through those things amen we say lord you understand you know brother brown would pray for um doesn't experiences in 1948 it so he says and now they bring me a little cross cross-eyed girl with asthma affected head he says hear it thou art hear lord to make her well now you who was bearing the cross through jerusalem that morning and when you fell then simon this uh the cyrene that colored man came and helped you bear the cross he says god i know you understand and to prove to these people here in phoenix that thou art no more respecter of that they are no respecter of persons i therefore rebuke these cross-eyed eyes in the name of jesus christ now keep your heads bowed every one of you now almighty and omnipotent god let it be known today that you are god and i be your servant and that the people might know that thou art the only living god and you have anointed me and sent me forth and i speak not of my own words but then words in which you reveal to me therefore angel of god you who told me to go and if i'd be sincere that people would believe there'd be nothing stand before the prayer i ask for this i'm leaving phoenix and lord i love the country and and prove that thou art god and i be your servant thou demon i rebuke thee come out of the child name of jesus christ just keep your and and then now he's speaking to the little girl just keep your little eyes closed honey now raise your head but keep your eyes closed everybody keep your eyes closed now slowly open your eyes look towards me slowly there they are all right her eyes are straight and normal [Music] but you see when he was talking to the lord he says lord you understand lord i know you understand and god came down because he said he said you know there was a there was a colored man called simon you're from cyrene who helped me help you bear the cross now there's one of his little children here got cross eyes he says lord i know you understand do you talk to the lord like that lord i know you understand and he wants you to say and and he wants to tell you i understand i understand what you're going through i understand hardship because i've walked in it hallelujah i'll just finish with these and then we'll then we'll go now notice all the glory that was in god is in his word all the blessings that's in god is in his word it's hid to the unbeliever by traditions but see what i mean but it's all in christ all that god was he emptied himself kenos and came into christ and we into christ are behind the veil so all the blessings all the glory that's in god is in his word amen and he reveals it to us doesn't he i mean this book i trust speaks to you like no other book you know during lockdown i read a book i read quite a few times during my childhood it was you know you know a novel and it was exactly as i remembered it there's nothing more to it but this oh this is totally different amen so all the glory that's in god is in his word right and then now he comes veiled into us so everything else in christ is in the bride now now he changed his amorphy he changed from what he was to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the son of god he came not with the people he came in the people see the same god to carry his ministry on through this great age no i want this one sorry he says now what has it done no this is from the feast of the trumpets as he said he came in like like flattery speaking of the antichrist sorry this is very jumpy around but but now what has he done he is bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world council of churches the spirit of antichrist upon both them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did in the hour to call the bride how he loosed loosen the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time when you know when when everything shut down all those things he says the bride will not go through that time the bible says not the churchill but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ reflects the bride i mean a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a bunch of punishment i mean he's already found grace too with her she has found grace with him who is this that leans upon the arm of of of her beloved coming out of the wilderness this is what she has found i mean we have found grace with him right we have found grace with our bridegroom he engages to her and if there is anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so it will be upon the bride and so it is on the bride i mean we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many lost and blind how many how many sinners there was in the world the hour i got saved god saved me for a purpose and i'm determined by his will to do that purpose i don't care what anything else goes i want to do it amen but he says that the grace god's grace will be so great i mean upon her and so it is upon the bride amen his grace is so great upon us do you really i don't think we you know you know the thing is if you live in a certain atmosphere you just become acclimatized to it right just like us if we you know went from living at sea level then we climbed then we went and lived at a place of high altitude at first it would be a struggle you'd remember this is not how it is at sea level it's harder to breathe and it's you know the air's thinner a different kind of atmosphere you know but then you get used to it and it becomes normal amen and it's the same thing when you come into the things of god because you've been living in an atmosphere in the world i mean of unbelief and sin and demon powers moving and strife and anger and all those different things but then the lord calls you and he brings you out of that atmosphere he brings you into a heavenly atmosphere and it's just such a glorious place to live amen but then we're acclimatized to it we get used to it we should never get used to living in his grace we should never get used to living in his presence amen because not everyone has this and i'm just talking about every man woman and child around the world you know not everyone lives in his presence like we do if you really know so we talk about the grace of god is so great upon us we shouldn't take that for granted amen amen we should be so thankful and uh you know i'm not saying you're not but we should never take for granted that the lord has just got his hands on us and he's guiding us through hallelujah you know it's just like you just think of peter james and john there are many other fishermen they weren't the only fishermen on the seas of galilee but god called them there are many other tax collectors where matthew was there but god called him there are many other women that went to the well of samaria but god called one hallelujah there are many other pharisees but god called paul amen there are many other people like you but god called you why because he was looking beyond the skin he's looking beyond our intellect or maybe our culture maybe our personality he wasn't looking at those things he was looking at a predestinated cd on the inside of you amen and he called you because he saw that was in you i mean and that's why he called you we must never ever take that for granted that before the foundation of the world god put a seed on the inside of you and when he did that the lamb was slammed before the foundation of the world that god had already paved the way i mean that that god had already purchased our salvation right he'd already purchased our healing he already given us power to conquer every devil he'd given us the strength to overcome every circumstance i mean it was already purchased before the foundation of the world hallelujah and now we are just walking through life hallelujah and if we've walked so far do you not think we'll walk all the way amen do you not think we'll just be able to continue on i mean that's why i was thinking you know let's just don't worry about the past don't worry about what you see yourself to be you know they looked at jesus riding into jerusalem who is this they're looking at the outward and many times we just look at the outward and this is going on this is going on this yo things we wrestle with just leave it yes you know many times we go around the mountain and fight the same demon because we don't recognize he's been conquered right the same thing can come up but you've got to recognize that at calvary that thing was defeated and you've just got to bypass him and keep walking on recognize he's defeated right but if he keeps coming back at you and you got to pick up the sword and fight him again and you know and then he'll just come back again you got to recognize he's conquered you gotta you know isn't that right yes so we need to recognize the devil's been defeated he's nothing but a bluff he's like a bunch of troops go stepping down you know you know through the red square moscow with all fake weapons but if we think he's armed and dangerous then we'll just be living in fear this may be very chopped up this morning but take that scripture in song of solomon who is this that leans on the arm of her beloved coming out of the wilderness you say who am i as adam said to eve your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life brother braham said that the bride is bone of his bone spirit of his spirit power of power she is him why because we're one you say lord i'm actually here for a purpose i mean as as as the song goes you know he died to make men holy let it die to make men free god's truth is marching on you say lord i'm not just gonna we're not just gonna scrape through with the skin of our teeth the lord's gonna carry us through have you ever just found yourself in a circumstance say how did i get here right but then if you look back you see there's been all these providential things been happening and you just happen to find yourself there who's found themselves in that kind of circumstance you know we're going to be sitting around the wedding summer table one day and and we're going to look and say how did we get here how did we honestly get here and we'll know it was the lord of glory goddess here amen let's have the musicians please he said who am i i'm the lord's beloved i'm his redeemed one i'm his ransomed one hallelujah i mean let's
