just this week past so just please remember his wife is to pull it the family in prayer here's a real pillar and a strength there to the believers up there so he's going to be sorely missed it's just just keep them free at least it's going to Matthew chapter 1 and verse 1 now we're going to read the whole chapter if that's okay the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham [Music] Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his brethren Judas begat Phares and Zara of tamer and Pharaohs began ester on Islam began Aaron and Aaron began tabanid AB and AB in there began s on an ass on baguette Salman and Salman beget bows of Rahab and boys begat obed of ruth and obed beget Jesse and Jesse beget David the king and David the king begat solomon of

and Jotham began HS and HS but yet is he kissing his ekeus forget Meneses and Meneses forget amon and amon forget yours ice injures ice forget chicken OS Joseph and his brethren about the time they

beget saw and Zorba get so doc and so don't forget action and action beget Iliad and earlier began eleazar and eleazar begat matthan and matthan begat jacob and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born Jesus which is called Christ so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations and from David and to the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise we just had a very long natural lineage but now here comes here comes a very different way of being born now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise or when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost where then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately probably and while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bear forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled by us that was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted and which being interpreted is God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel Lord had bidden him and took unto her Marius wife and you heard not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called and he called his name Jesus amen may the Lord bless this word you may have your seats today I want to take a if I could take a subject out of there I want to take life you know we just read a as I said a very long lineage and we understand that in this lineage and then we'll go into a bit later you recognize a lot of names because it's not just a natural lineage but there's a faith lineage in there too and sometimes it rears and it manifests part of God's Word sometimes it's just generations of not much doing it's just a natural than is then God manifests himself and some more people then maybe you'll go back underground again so to speak there continues on and on down and now but we also understand so this is a record of a life now a genealogy or a generation it says this is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ which is his genealogy according to the flesh now we understand that when Jesus that's why when we got down to when Mary was was a well overshadowed by the whole it she was found with child of the Holy Ghost this was showing that even though God tied the coming of his son to the lineage that lineage had nothing to do with it Amen because God created Jesus Christ in the womb of Mary there wasn't any part of Mary there's no part of Joseph he was he wasn't created a meant a created person created cell in the womb of Mary so even though you know God attribute does yo he he he attributes you know Jesus being as the son of David the son of Abraham there was no real natural part of their lineage in him but down through this lineage deals of faith being manifested down through so you know the things that we see in in Jesus Christ was manifested partially in Abraham and David and Solomon a meant like we see you know you can see you know Christ was an Abraham you know all those things were shadow is pointing to him coming so so just as a maybe I should give the definition but the book of the generations so that's a genealogy now if you see a family tree you'll see natural characteristics being passed down right so you know you see how your children are if you knew your great-great-grandfather on either side you would have found that characteristic would have been there somewhere or the great-great-grandmother because these things are all passed down this is natural this is just natural traits are passed down through a through a lineage a meant but we're not talking about natural traits were talking about supernatural traits of faith right so now a generation so this word generation and the Greek it's the same as a nativity or figuratively it's a nature so it's the book of the nature of Jesus Christ although it's the genealogy of his nature coming down through human beings amen and so and then it's also part of the root word of that it is actually kin we're and to be kin it means you know it means a it means a kindred a nation and offspring or a stock right there you know that's why people they they slicks cattle and they breed them because there's characteristics in those cattle that they want to pass down into the offspring you know certain things maybe makes more milk or maybe more more more meat or you know bigger or your different temperaments same with breeding of horses or dogs or something there's certain characteristics that people are looking for and they want to pass it down to the future generations now that's just natural breeding I mean we know a faith a faith you know being passed down through that goes beyond you know we're not believers because our parents are believers we're not believers because we could even trace just so if you even could trace your lineage back to Adam that has nothing to do with it it goes beyond natural natural marriage and Union and children coming down but God down through us has has placed a faith seat I mean enter people and as Jesus would say to Nicodemus he sees the wind blows wordlist earth you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes and so does that everyone is born of the Spirit of God you know you can't tell you know you can't look at someone necessarily and say this one's going to be a believer or this was not going to be a believer you know you take the New Testament there's the woman at the well naturally if you look at her you would everyone would have disregarded her there's no way she's going to be part of the new creation there's no way she's going to be the Temple of the Living God I mean there's no way she's going to be there in the upper room I mean where God says is the body hallelujah my children I'm going to gather my bride I'm going to gather I'm going to dwell in them I mean I'm going to take her as a living stone shaper and molder and place her into the building of Jesus Christ you're never a thought you'd be that category but here there she was but there's a faith seat Holly there's a faith C dinner Amen a win and when the light shot on that cedar came to life what was really in her hallelujah so it goes beyond natural natural that's why I'm trusting it's a it's a generation or it's a genealogy of faith and you can take the same thing if you go into Hebrews chapter living we won't have time that is a faith seat by faith Noah Enoch whoever it was came down as a that's a faith being passed down and it's not by natural natural children natural ability of our parents having children that's God placed and God before the foundation of the world knew you'd be here and he and he put something in you he he put a seed in you amen that may have sat dormant I pray it's not dormant you know some people they come to church special young people and they try and play survivor can I survive another service can I just sit there do they do do you see people they try and write it out and it's the most ridiculous thing it is they try and write it out two more hours what's the time oh yeah okay it's it's it's 8 to 11 I've survived the song service he's not going to look at me so it's going to be alright I'm going to think about something else then I'm gonna get our church and I'll survive another service I've seen it wherever I've gone what's happened now the seed must die and rot then it can come to life I'm in but it's your own choosing if it dies and rots and comes to life I mean because the waters here the lights here talking naturally now I'm in the soils there the seats there we got to let it come to life amen so it's a no brother barren speaks about Christ revealed in his own word he says now we've take we've we've taken through the lesson to show that in your great-great-grandfather all the way back physically speaking then that's what you are in physical being nature sometimes a child is born in the family that's redheaded it astonishes the father because there's nobody he knows of as peoples redheaded or the mothers but if you go way back to several generations you'll find out somebody was redheaded that seed keeps coming on down and you find the nature of one from way back that's just that's just naturally speaking now I'm talking about life because life you know we think we think you know we have great times we have been great life or things go bad are we having a but hey yo that person had a hard life that's just natural life and it's Kenya and it's just based on conditions of you know how well things are running you know it's subject to time I've been thinking about this I've been praying a lot how do I convey this but you know life is life natural life when you hit about you know hit about eighteen to twenty one twenty five you're at the peak of life yeah you go you're go from a baby you go into a fully mature adult and you're and you're actually your life you're not you're you're growing into your fullness of what you are and then you begin to age then you begin to get older then the house gets a little bit older gets a little bit more tired some of the some of the hair begins to go my dad says I'm making room as well I don't know what he's making room for that's what he said that's what he calls it so I'm making room now me myself and you get older you're not really living you're starting to die as soon as you hit that age you begin to die I mean but people will come into that just after that stage and and I think they're really living because they can do what they can want to do and they go and live and how great this is but it's just natural life than a subject of time that will all eventually come to an end but there's a different kind of life eternal life which is far above natural life and that is the life that we are contending for I mean that is a life we really want to receive and if we have received it it's the glorious most glorious thing that you could imagine a meant to be a possessor I mean not just talk about it but absolutely and your very soul and you'll be a man then it doesn't matter first thing just ceased if my heart stopped and I died right here if I have eternal life hallelujah Amen oh won't bother me too much I'll be happier amen what Jesus I mean Paul said you know to be with you yeah I'd rather be with you with the Lord than here but I need to be here I mean because he received something that was more than just natural life you know a natural religion of of studying the Bible as he did and you know do it going through different forms of religion that was natural life that was a natural understanding he had but then when the very one who who gave that word that he studied met him on the road to the mass different life happened a different life came in hallelujah I say that that seed that was in him came to life hallelujah now eternal life it's very different Jesus it's let's go to first John chapter one first John one and one because we're gonna understand it let's just read this this means this is so dear to me it says first John one and one this is dear to me because if you've made remember God is eternal he doesn't change I'm God I changed not Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now he manifests himself in a form maybe different but there's very core being what he loves then he loves now what he hates then he hates now I mean how he deals with people then he deals with them now how he saves him he saves now I mean how he heals any heal spell all according to faith it's already a finished work I mean so now when he says that which was from the beginning now we could state I could take this and I could say this is my testimony that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life hallelujah now that's not natural life that's the word of eternal life I mean for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us hallelujah that is that is the believers he said oh this John writing about 2000 years ago I don't know it's not just historical that was a living reality to him and he was passing it down to future generations but now we stand at the end of all things and I trust it as a believer you when you read that scripture you say I have seen eternal life manifested I have handled other I have seen with my eyes I mean when you see God manifest that you see God Amen Joe you know brother BAM I preached a sermon I've heard of Li but now I see thee he took the text from when God came down in a whirlwind and spoke to Joe and he says that sermon when you seek God manifested you see him you see God amen and he say I've heard of thee but now I see thee at the end of the service and he ending God comes down as he does after the preaching the word God was in the preaching the word then God manifests himself because he wants the people to see this is eternal life coming I mean the worst that you've heard her eternal life and he begins to discern the thoughts and intents of the hearts of the people I mean everything is naked before God I mean that your people people's needs and people's ailments were made known he says there was God manifesting you've seen God in this place I meant and then we come down there's 50 odd years ago you come down to this day and that same God is manifesting himself hallelujah so we don't just hear if we see the Lord I mean when you see someone be birthed by the Spirit I mean God comes down an anointing God come in a night music God anoint preaching holy a God anoint life to live every day I mean we can say I've heard of thee but now I see thee I've seen eternal life hallelujah we've seen it manifested I mean because this Bible is not a date later to us it's a living reality I mean when the author comes hallelujah thousands of years later down here here it is I'm going to quicken this to you I mean this word is sitting here I'm going to make it live that's God manifesting himself that's not me just getting excited that's a reality probably used to feel that pulsation of faith hallelujah that's God manifesting eternal life opposed man was sealed off from eternal life when they fell in Eden they fell from eternal life and everything Adam lost with we're being restored - hallelujah so eternal life was sealed off they called upon God I'm in the lineage of Adam you go read it and Genesis 405 I believe it is well the end of Florence is then man begin to call upon the name of the Lord because they have a burden imagine imagine sitting I've seen it before but you're there at the end of the day you see all these stars sitting around a campfire there's Adam and Eve sitting there your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents or they begin to relate because they knew what the heavens were they say look at that that's Leo the Lion is the Virgin the seed of the woman is going to come this way I tell the because in the barb did the Bible was written in the heavens I mean but we read this one but it's all in the heavens and so they would begin to say look and we're gonna be restored see that see that constellations they look and we're gonna be restored back basically they say this chapter and verse here I'll make all things do you there's a new hip ins and you were basically there it's up there don't think I'm crazy it's up there they say because they're reading the Bible and they would say I wish I could tell you what it was like to wake up and I garden never a bad thought they were a pain of this burden of sin Oh Lu you knew no sickness or sorry we didn't know what it was like to be sad we would have no it was like they have a bad thought we don't know what it was like to to get sick or hurt ourselves we'll be hungry or feel alone or be afraid that's why you think about that you hear a testimony like there you go God when are you gonna restore this I'm in my yard they were they experienced it but they prompt you promised them they might have still had the lambskins I don't know you promised them the seed of the woman is going to come eternal life is gonna come and he's gonna undo all this then the serpent has done you'd call upon God it'd be a so so alive Allu you here we are right down at the end of all things amen as I said Christ was in Abraham it's the faithful Indians coming through you see it manifesting some of those names you don't recognize a lot going on something you do Christ was manifested it revealed an Abraham and his life crisis and Isaac is the promised son Christ was in salmone marrying rehab Alleluia member Rahab was in Jericho she believes the report of the spies she put the token on her you know the Scarlet thread on her on a window going down the gate of the wall and and that you know you know the story as relates took took Jericho fell down flat Rahab and her family were safe in the house but then she marries but she's still out of the Commonwealth of Israel hallelujah but then Salman the general of the army marries her Amen they're all passes not just destroyed years and you identity and it's the same thing with you and I God just doesn't wipe out our past a memory he unites himself with you I mean that everything he has you become hallelujah I miss a crisis in Salman marrying Rahab Christ for some boys Amen redeeming roof as kinsman redeemer Christ was manifested there's a life being manifested I mean Christ was in David as rejected King as the one coming to power I mean as as to be the king you know of Israel Christ was in Solomon building the temple they had they had like an amateur millennium there in that season I mean as the son of David and there's and there's others there but I'll just leave those but there's also five women of grace and that lineage Lou you because many times you know you read about Abraham and Isaac and Salman and Boaz and David and Solomon and the others you know zoobel they're rebuilding the temple in the time of Nehemiah and sometimes we can't necessarily put ourselves in those people right something we should be able to you should see Jesus Christ in every scripture see yourself in there too and so there's also five woman of grace in that lineage and there's a there's things that those people do that we can't understand with our human mind you take Tama for example she's the first one she was married to Judas son but he would not he would not have a child with her and God killed him and then she married the next son same thing God killed them too and he she was basically said well you just go wait in your father's house but then something possessed her now this is eternal you can't explain this or you can't reason it out it doesn't sound even reasonable but something interesting I must have a child of the lineage of Judah amen and she puts on the attire of a harlot go sits in the way and then Judah her father-in-law takes her a mint and she becomes pregnant by him and she she has the son that Judas sons would not give her she was driven I don't understand that but something in it was saying I must have a son I must have this life hallelujah and it's the same thing with you there's something in the believer when they first hear the word I mean when God begins to deal with them there's something of them saying I must have this I must have the life of God in me I want him to come and dwell use me as a temple Lord come and dwell in me hallelujah is something in you I trusted us isn't drawing why you feel drawn hallelujah I'll tell you why because he wants to live in you manifest himself Alleluia the brother Brahim seasoned thirsting for life in 1958 he says life what is life life is what controls you life is what makes you what you are and the life that is within you makes you the written epistle grid of all me so you saying the life that is within you controls you Alleluia I read the asset glory to God I mean because of life within you matter you know brother Bram says if I'd the spirit of Beethoven in me I'd write music if I had the spirit of Michelangelo within me I do great masterpieces but if I have the life of Jesus Christ at me I will do the works of Jesus Christ a means to the life serve the life of beethoven's was in me it would control me I must play I must write music at the life of Michelangelo was within me I would have to do some artistry of this because it is a gift is a life driving then there'll be a life driving me I must I must paint the ceiling not just one color either by the way hallelujah I must do something you with me because there's a life driving and so at the life of Jesus Christ is in me I mean what else can I live by what else could I do there's a life that controls me Alleluia now the Bible likens people to seats I'm gonna talk about natural things so Matthew let's go to Matthew 13 and 36 now we're just going to read the interpretation of this parable because many times you read in the scripture you read the people do natural things but there's a faith being manifested - and they do not understand really like you take imagine if we jump back into the days of rehab and sell money and said this is what you're really living out this is us Christ Salamone you bring a type of Christ and you're redeeming this this Gentile woman in the days of destruction he wouldn't understand that he says well actually I just like her she's beautifully something just draws me to her and and there's something she loves me and then something draws us together we want to get married but there's a greater depth of life the same thing with Boaz you're marrying Ruth do you know what you're - yeah Aliyah you know the story it's not just it's not just a love story just put in the Bible is a reason it's there hallelujah or you take David or Solomon or you know any of them you know what you're living out what do you mean I'm just doing this this is what I feel to do there's what I need to do right because there's a is within people it's more than just a natural life no sorrow Matthew 13 and 36 it says then Jesus sent the multitude away he went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field he answered it's in of him he that sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed of the children of the kingdom but the tears of the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world the Reapers are the Angels so therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world see so Jesus gives on I'm just totally plain as plain can be this is what the parable means there's people that are sowed into the world and they are what they are but there's something in the wheat amen there's something like a seed you can take two seats and if now when I used to work at my old job at a show-quality they had and I think in Palmerston North I think in Australia too they had seed lamps with a studied seats before they even plant anything because they had to prove that say this bag of pumpkin seeds or whatever seats is whatever percentage of the seat so they they spend years studying seats that when they when they examine a seed line that's going to be bagged and sent out or whatever they know what they're looking at now to an untrained eye well this is yeah is this a wheat seed yeah it is it looks like this one they could be totally off and train died so they all look the same when they're planted but then when when the Sun comes out the harvest season comes you know the rain begins to fall the temperatures just right they may begin to grow so what's in the seed begins to be manifested hallelujah so now so but in order for a seed to grow it has to be planted right once it's been planted it needs light and it needs moisture that's very elementary but you know and east light and it needs moisture so now in order for people now I'm talking about supernaturally down because this natural life this is not really what God ordained just to look you know the main part of us is that faith seat I meant that eternal part of us as this thing still needs a body change I'm glad it does I'm glad you know I don't know how people can believe that we're in the Millennium and we're getting older and people die well how does that work this is not a millennium to me I want a new one tried this one and I want a new one we're not in the Millennium but still they still you know sickness and age and death and so on No but supernaturally now people can it's it's that soul in you when that comes to life right because you say well I'm alive right now the Bible says in Ephesians 2 we were once dead in trespasses and sins so these are people they weren't physically dead but spiritually they were just dormant they weren't living spiritually but in the right season at the right time something happened to them and something came to life they meant and that was when the light shot the moisture fell the temperature was right spiritually and a birth happened amen because I see that just sits there on a table you say well it's not dead because it can live but that's not really living it's just sitting there as I say don't play survivor say yes enter in a Greek amen because you look at a you know you see a big you say you just take like a mustard seed it's this little thing but it can grow into a massive tree imagine if the massive tree could look at the mustard you know some other mustard seed sitting there and think why you still like that it planned to die be born again you know it's so much better being a tree than just being a dumb little seat amen so don't stay that way now so neat now let's go to John st. John 1 I just want to read a couple of things and then we're going to go to Genesis chapter 1 John 1 and 1 down to verse 4 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so his word God in his word is one in the same and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of me so in him is life eternal life and then Jesus says in John 6 and 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life so the words that he speak their spirit and their life I mean eternal life as being spoken the words that he released was releasing eternal life amen so he is the light and life of men now so an order in order to really come to life God has to quicken the seat this is very elementary but I trust at the end of it you'll you'll go out here appreciating what you are because a wheat cannot become a tear and a tear cannot become a wheat I'm just going to major on the wheat can only be wheat amen bride can only be bride hallelujah it may be born and darkness and may be shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies but that's just a natural part that's not the supernatural part Alleluia they mean so Genesis 1 and 1 the Gospel story is all on the Genesis one you know that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep now that was not all of us that was all of us once upon a time I trust you noted in that state still so you're just sitting there just you big big sea of humanity just living a natural life without form and void just in darkness we were all in darkness you following me we're all this way and but then I love these that there's a full stop at a conjunction and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters he had a purpose of doing it he wasn't just doing it for the sake of it but buried down now we're not going to read the whole chapter we're gonna read down to verse 12 but if you read the whole tration account it says he created all the animals and all the birds and all the fish he created man but there's no record of him creating the seats of the plants because they were already there right just like us and us was before the foundation of the world God put a deposit of himself a seed of predestination amen it was been sitting there but it has to come to life it was covered up and darkness amen you're covered up but then he began to move upon the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water so now he begins to brood over the earth because there's life in the earth hallelujah there's a life that must come forth it come can't come forth covered in darkness covered in water I mean he had the brood of the earth the separate light from darkness hallelujah and then now why is this message so precious because it as as as God's supernatural voice speaking it is the light of the entire a means and now through his word he's brooding over the earth how they were defined his elected once to find his one and then he comes to you I may be jumping right into my sermon but once you know where I'm going and then he comes to you and then you hear his word and the spirit of Noyce the word evening is a brood over you amen and you begin to recognize there's more to life than this there's more to life than being a good person and getting a job and maybe having a family and living here and buying this house and you know big whoa what's happening because before you're covered in darkness whether you recognize it or not leaving in the brood overview and something in you begin to forget to cry out something there's a yearning and as I begin to build although I don't even at this point know really who you are his name is Jesus Christ if you didn't know amen any begin to because there's something because he's a seed now because remember in the winter time you can plant seeds and they'll stay on the ground just dormant but then the Sun begins to you know the earth comes closer to the Sun our part of the earth the sun rays get a bit stronger the tent the soil temperature raisers now there's something begins to happen in our life there's a force behind life there is a force and life amen life will not quit if it can live it'll live I mean there's something net just just just naturally you know I heard and you're like in Canada you know down here we have the raw you know there's the stags and all you know up there they call it the rut and the bull moose they will they will go on to train tracks that they'll take anything on and they've had plenty of records of trains because there's a force of life because there's a seasons right life must be expressed and they go on to the train tracks and a train comes they steer that thing down you think that's insane no its life its life wanting to you know take anything on to produce itself and they'll take on trains you know the you know the end of the story but it happens because life has a force that's just nice just animal life how much more supernatural life I mean how much more the life of God and the people Alleluia so the so the earth comes closer the soil temperature raises because the sun is shining upon it and then now the seeds begin to come forth Ella lujah in the then the rain begins to come everything's just right and it begins to sprout up and it comes up breaks up above the soil and begins to grow up I mean grow towards the one that's giving it life hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I one time we're in darkness I think God begins to speak that's why the gospel is more than just words I mean but the Spirit of God transcends just language I mean where God can speak to someone in a supernatural way that even they do not understand you know when you begin to think why am I being pulled this way why why is it speaking to my heart this way and you can't even put it in words or language or even and but it's that life that's wanting to come up hallelujah there's a life waiting to come up amen that's why it's a supernatural gospel people try and reason it out and understand it intellectually you'll never understand it intellectually it takes God it takes God to quicken it to you to make it a living reality and then so now the seats come up so he so he moves upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light sorry Genesis 1 and 4 and God saw the light nur was good and God divided the day from the darkness and God called the light day the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let the and let it divide the waters from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament is so and God called the firmament heaven and the evening in the morning were the second day now he has a purpose to it in doing these things right and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land earth and gathered together of the waters called he seas and God saw it was good and God said let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed was in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit who see was in itself after his kind and God saw it was good so the seeds that were laying down there in darkness hallelujah when the light shot and God separated the light from the darkness life came forth I mean God is the author of life he wants life to be expressed Amen it's the same thing with you or not he doesn't just want us to express natural life we have this natural life but it's not the real life he wants us to bring fall is a supernatural life I mean there's a there's a life of the word that he wants us to manifest amen eternal life that once was with the father's manifested unto us we've seen it yes hallelujah you say well it's a bit hard to he says a bit harsh to talk about the wheat and the tares don't take the negative side it's like you know Hebrews six and seven for the earth with drinketh and the rain that cometh upon it and bringeth forth herbes meat for them by whom it has dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which Bharath thorns and briers is rejected as 9 - cursing whose end is to be burnt but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany accompany salvation through though we thus speak so don't don't take the negative sight take the positive side of it if I'm a wheat I'm a wheat hallelujah I cannot be anything that I'm not I mean so so remember the Spirit of God that broods over us the word that quickens us and it's just bringing forth What's in you hallelujah so don't take it as a negative thing take it as a positive thing I can't help being what I am I mean you say well what about my humanity wrestling just yield give it over just give it over to God because a seed it must die and rot the Pope must die and right about then the seed comes forth Alleluia it is just revealing what is in us amen God has so many children now whosoever will let them come we know that but God has great by knows who's going to be there and all that the father has given me will come to me so he has so many and he knows where they are amen and if you're part of that number I we should be the most happiest people in the land hallelujah even if we are homeless on the street I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them hallelujah because it's eternal not just natural things amen life that can be manifested I mean brother Brahim says and he sees him one in a million when God moved upon the water with light the light brought forth the first presence of God spoken light came by God's Word and God's Word is the only thing that still brings light and when the waters went back the seed was already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remained with German them come forth God making his creation and now on Easter morning there was another light struck the earth now is going from natural Genesis when he's going to Easter morning because that was a natural light in the beginning now there's a supernatural light yeah and it's given to bring light to those seeds that God by his foreknowledge knew would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seat he knows where the spiritual Cedars your body was laying right here on the earth when God brought forth the earth into existence we are part of the earth we you were laying here your bodies were and by his foreknowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve Him and who had not his foreknowledge tells that if it doesn't then he isn't God he can't be God without being infinite and if he's infinite he knows all things so you see God making so you see people making their blunders they stumble at it they run at it they think this and that but it doesn't work right you see but there is a working right that's to find God's perfect will and stand in it that God called you for me but God has not called us to wrath but God's called us to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ hallelujah he speaks you know Easter I'm gonna I'm gonna jump eternal life was released that day on Cobra eternal life and but he was eternal life was manifested but it wasn't the purpose of God becoming a man to die on the cross for our sins wasn't it was to it was to clear our selves our sin to wipe us of asset but it wasn't just that now we are forgiven but he had a purpose of that is because now he wanted to cleanse of people that he can come and dwell in and manifest themselves I mean many people talk about the cross but what is the cross to produce I mean in the cross was to produce the upper room when the Holy Spirit came down and dwelled in 120 and then it spread from there that was the purpose of the cross hallelujah so now now so as a natural light a light brings forth a natural seat so a supernatural light or life brings for the supernatural seat so now on that first sunrise and the very beginning let there be light and there was light go forth natural see lujah but then now that that day of the Resurrection amen a supernatural light begin to shine at the rising of the Sun hallelujah a new life was coming in a new era is being ushered in there wasn't just God with us or God above us it was God in us the Holy Spirit under people I mean to manifest remember in the Old Testament it was just God with them or God would anoint them because of the blood of bulls and goats God couldn't step until people like he does you and I I mean but under the blood of Jesus Christ he's not just with us or anointing as he comes in dwells in us I mean that now there's a quickening of a seat hallelujah you know we're not a bunch of dead people we're not a bunch of religious people I mean we don't just have a different code of ethics or a different bunch of doctrine but there's a life this this is a record of eternal life hallelujah and it's not just to read about saying isn't that lovely I say god this record of eternal life we must become part of it amen and I'll just jump to a hole but later on why why is this would become a living reality to you I may ask you a question you got a Luke chapter 24 you know maybe I'll just jump back a bit we read about a rapture in here we read about eternal life changing the bodies of a people we worried about now that people walk with God they're not because God takes them I mean that there's a winning supper of the Lamb where she is she has made herself ready because unto her was granted should be arrayed in fine linen clean and what I mean so that cities the people these are redeemed people that are gathered to a wedding supper of the Lamb now those things sound very glorious how do you know you're part of that number I'll show you a little bit now eternal life was released that day Jesus stepped down the tomb you just think about it as I said a while ago and I'll come back to my thought he's a force behind life he's a force I was talking about him just a natural move you take a supernatural life do you think they tried to seal Jesus body in a tomb he said Mary Oh Martha I am the resurrection and the life believeth in your brother there he did he shall live believeth all of us hila there was suit that was eternal life manifested and they tried to seal it in a natural tomb with some natural soldiers amen he couldn't be contained earlier he had to come out of the tomb and there's the same thing and then they try and put pressure on the disciples don't preach in his name anymore don't don't preach this word don't live this life they just basically laughed in their faces should we obey God or obey you if a man nothing could hold them I mean they tried to put conflict beat them put complexes on they just had a prayer meeting God came down and gave them boldness they went out because life had to go for hallelujah and so they couldn't be contained it's the same thing with you and I trust there should be such a force in you should be a life I'm this must have been the smashed par lujah and nothing devil contrived put on me it's gonna stop me no matter concrete no matter complex is know about affair it's going to stop this life Alleluia should be that way because of something and you driving you amen so now here's the here's eternal life has been released it's 2 on the way to Emmaus they knew the prophecy of Joel I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh they believed he was the Messiah they were walking away saying here he comes walks with them Luke 24 remember it's the time of Resurrection we're in the time of resurrection - how lujah well the resurrection that was what a resurrection this earth where our people that were dead in trespasses and sins just a bunch of dead sages come to life valley because there's the light of God a shock hallelujah amen so now they're walking along and they said their whole world's falling apart the one they believed was the Messiah we believe you deliver Israel these days they you know Judas who was the accountant of the church hung himself and all the all the ministry have locked themselves up someplace we'll just go home now they had no idea that they were part of the resurrection also wasn't just him raising as 120 had to raise and then the life had to go forth remember it was not just one resurrection morning earlier but now resurrection life begin to be spread upon the earth holy or that sunlight was shining hallelujah Jesus when He said preaching Jerusalem and in Samaria to the uttermost part of the earth he could basically said shine this light in Jerusalem and Samaria and to the other most part of the earth tell the people the sun's up a leader quicken them so they're so they're part of the resurrection and the whole world's falling apart now Jesus came walked with them started at Moses you can open up the word to them amen and then when they came into the house you know the story but what is he doing he's trying to get them to see by by by speaking the word to them in that way and then at the end of it they said did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way so it's more than just information something was going to hear something was quickening to them I mean something is becoming alive and he was doing that because he's wanting to tell the people you're part of the vision you're part of the resurrection you're part of the fulfillment of the word for this hour I mean that's what he's trying to tell them that's why when we read we read about David coming into power who loves the Old Testament amen you see David yo-yo being rejected he's anointed king and is there men to gather term all that are destitute afflicted and told me to whatever they give themselves to David and something in you says that's such a glorious thing why is it quit wise to speak to your soul why doesn't that's because God is trying to get you to see you've seen David Christ because remember he he's just a shadow Jesus Christ his reality you see he's a fugitive on the land Amen you see he's run out from every place but you see he know he's coming into power you know he's going to sit on the throne in the Millenium Alleluia and you've gathered yourself to him hallelujah I mean you've gathered yourself to him and then that same anointing that fell upon David to kill the lion and the bear and Goliath you know what David had five stones there are other giants in the land too so he knew remember it's faith in Jesus all those things but he knew if I have to kill them all well hey we just can't have a longer day he he said the king Saul this John will be like those animals they'll be dead seen you whatever would stand in his way is going to die and it did hallelujah and these are those ones that gave themselves to David that same anointing came upon them hallelujah so they one killed a hundred hundred odd and no they did great feats of things it's not Hollywood it's not choreographed battle scenes the guy with a sword or a spear he just pushes a whole bunch of soldiers why because the supernatural God you want to see that life you know we talk about a lineage I mean a you know a natural genes being expressed down through you take a supernatural lineage you see God in battle I mean you see Samson he's tied up the Israelites are going to give him to the Philistines this is the Philistines shouted and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily holy he broke the bans picked up the jawbone and killed a thousand or however many it were I mean you see the life of God in battle Harley when the enemy comes in like a flood amen he anoints his children who's had the experience I have many anointest children to defeat that phone hallelujah Lenya is coming into power they same anointing fell upon me and here we are we see this word coming into power we know that our lovely Lord Jesus is going to be on the throne hallelujah that same anointing was on him come upon us I'm in the same anointing upon the Prophet the ridi is a redeemed son revealing Jesus Christ that same son of man not the Prophet he's a son of man the son of man that came into well to them revealed himself that same one steps into us I mean that's why we see when the enemy comes around Allu you amen when the enemy comes around we're still in faith they were overcoming hallelujah the enemy is defeated we have a lot of trophies hallelujah why because that same anointing cause you know he's coming into power amen and so but why is that all done that you would know your part what there wasn't a shadow is now reality in this day Allu you where you can see now and the reason it speaks do you like it does is because God wants you to know you're part of the vision you're part of the word being fulfilled I mean well what is going to be fulfilled is gonna be a rapture a wedding supper hallelujah is going to be a millennial reign I mean where Jesus Christ is going to sit on as a son of David on the throne and is bright around him whatever Moors in the millennium and all that see all these things become real to you because you're gonna be there hallelujah you following me amen brother speaks about upon lily is that how can I overcome he speaks about a pond lily now pond lily it's very beautiful when it comes above the water and opens itself up to the Sun but before that it's just a little cedar under the mud under water but there's something within it that knows it cannot stay in that condition there's something in it that must grow it must push beyond the mud it must go beyond the water it must come above the water they'd open itself out to manifest what's really in it there's a life and the thing I can't just sit down the mud say well it's too deep I can't make it you know it doesn't consciously think but you know what I mean don't just so they say well the muds too heavy it's you know I can't I there's just something and it just opens up and it pushes forth hallelujah I trust that's the same with you how can I overcome it's just like a lily where as a lily I think it's one of the most prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond of those great calla lilies upon the lease I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big pond Lily call it water lily how its radiance where did it come from it's a little seed down the bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's in that mud amen but it has to strive daily knowing that there's something it's black it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy in that slime that's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above and the light and expresses what's been hitting it all the time I think that's an overcomer that once and sin once the things that was wrong don't worry about it now see he says once the things that was wrong now why look back into the pond again look you have God by His predestination sea has brought the seed of life and expressing itself seed coming to life and now on top of all that it has overcome that don't express itself down there it's getting up it's getting up to express itself neither did you and your son an adultery and everything that you lived that you didn't express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into life and now you're in the prints of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it's brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what I mean you walk in the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily hallelujah that's what we are amen hallelujah now grace the musicians to come eternal life friends we the believer is a possessor of eternal life amen he says and to whom shall we go you can't hide life when that Sun begins to shine that life will come forth a little seed laying back in the middle of the sidewalk will press its way around out through that concrete / around under rocks and sticks and everything else till it gets out it sticks its little head up to praise God you just can't hide life amen cuz life as a force behind it down the side of the house I saw yesterday it's a bunch of stuff I see just like you know for my for me the concrete part out the back of the house I just swept it round by the drain forgot about it I went out there yesterday and there's a patch this big sitting on concrete and all these little plants growing amen concrete bunch of maybe dirt whatever all these seats because you can't stop life life has to grow life has to live a mint the same thing with us I trust the same thing with you eternal life we are possessors this is more than this is not Church I mean we're not a we're not a denomination or a religion there's no others about Christianity is eternal life coming down into people and manifesting what you really are from the beginning they meant and that's why this message is so precious is because it takes that's the light of God shining to reveal Jesus Christ in here I meant to manifest what is in the word enter people Alleluia amen who has eternal life this morning I trust you can say me you don't need to worry don't look at why do you think it is just let it live we need to sing oh I want to sing how well I want to sing the original life hallelujah we have the original life I don't what number it is Amen you say well I don't see much value in me what what value is God put on you amen you say well there's nothing good about me you know you may be naturally the dumbest the agya list the most backward person in all the world that's irrelevant if you got eternal life amen it doesn't matter you can be you can have it all together naturally in the world but if you don't have eternal life you you've missed the very core thing lujah so let's not worry about the world what it sees I mean let's stand I don't want to just keep going on hallelujah we have eternal life God's attributes were manifested through his bride in this last date we had for the revelation by the last prophet method but we're in the brains of all [Applause] now ah five
