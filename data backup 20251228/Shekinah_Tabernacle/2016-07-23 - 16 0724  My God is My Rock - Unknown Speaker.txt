musicians amen God bless you amen it's good to be here today amen um we just got one announcement um we got brother Daniel fryo preaching on Wednesday now probably everyone says well so that's a brother he so he ministers out of brother Ron Peterson's Church in Arizona and he's in the country you know you know sister chth mounter that's that's that's her dad they're in the country and they're just down here for a couple of days and they're here on a Wednesday so if you can make it I'd i' I'd be here amen he's very good Ministry very mature Ministry you know so we'll be blessed amen amen and so yeah so that's this Wednesday um yeah amen so that's the on the um announcement um if you'd like to take your Bibles and turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 and then we'll go to Isaiah chapter 9 and I just want to say that you know uh so I came home last night after preparing and Christine says Isaac's going to sing this song and I say basically my my whole sermon was in that song Amen but I had no idea he was going to sing it God has a mind you you know you know let's not like you know you take like brother brother John in the pray meeting on Wednesday sing in the spirit a song came out that he never not even conscious what he sng you know and sometimes we just sit there and these things just pass Us by don't let it pass you by God did something in our midst am amen and we don't want to take it just for granted amen amen so Isaiah I mean sorry Genesis 1: 26- 28 and God said let us make make man in our image after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and then let's go to Isaiah chapter 9 so notice have dominion subdue it amen have dominion over it subdue subdue the creation um and then Isiah chapter 9 is 9 6 and 7 he says this for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace uh there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen m Lord bless his word you may you may be seated I was also yeah um there's also another announcement I forgot so a couple of months ago uh Christine went to the doctor and um we were praying about what we should do because we were very time poor you know me working full-time and she was driving to the doctor she said Lord may we get an answer from the doctor she goes to a doctor that she's never it's not a normal doctor and um so you know basically you the doctor said well you're you know you know you're stressed you're tired you know and then and then um and then and then the doctor said to her well he said if you don't change what you're doing she said now forgive me if I get this wrong Christine's really the details person but she said the doctor basically said if you don't change what you're doing in 10 years you won't be here and then this doctor said what is your husband do so describe me never met me before I didn't even know who this doctor is and she said said if he doesn't change what he does he's not going to be here in 10 years either he said what you should do is he should quit his job finish his job focus and then focus on the ministry and then let Christine go back and she said you need to go back and do your Healthcare assistant job because you love doing that and then whatever whatever doesn't make the uh and then let the church make up what what what doesn't come in okay no maybe I should let you tell the testimony sorry but but that's kind of the gist of it I dear that's basically the gist of it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yes if Christin do the shifts to to make up the Gap that the church can't provide yeah yeah IA I didn't tell of the situation yeah so yeah so she didn't say this is what we're going through this is what we're doing so la Friday was my last day but I'm on a casual contract I'm going back on Tuesday but now I'm only working like a couple of days a week maybe okay and Christine is casual at the at the hospital now this is that because the intent that I am here in Wellington is not to work full-time at a job but I'm happy to work you must understand I'm not doing this cuz I'm lazy but the focus is the work of the Lorden yeah praise God amen amen I'm sorry honey beer maybe I should have got you to say it but you know so I'm so we're a lot more flexible okay so we're we're more available okay amen that's why I want to be for for everyone amen yeah so yeah Christine she knows the testimony but but that's basically the gist of it the Lord okay so here we are so um and basically it's NE because I'm on a casual uh wage I can basically earn the same I would in 8 hours and 6 hours so I just I was working 6 hours Tuesday and Friday Lord anyway so so that's that's what's happening that's what's happened cuz we because you can't do you can't get a different result if you keep doing the same thing amen insanity is doing the same thing expecting something different yes amen amen amen right so you got to change things that's right now so we read there in Genesis chapter one that God uh that man was given dominion over the face of the Earth over everything and he was commanded to subdue it be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the Sea of the the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so have dominion so man was called to to subdue the creation have dominion over it and now we read there in Isaiah chapter 9 that you know a very very familiar scripture that For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever and the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform us so speaking of now the son that is given who is we know is our Lord Jesus Christ that his his his government will increase I mean his kingdom will expand amen and this word son in the Old Testament the word son is actually it means a builder of the family name amen a build of the family name this is what it means in the Hebrew and then of course it also means in the in in the widest sense of literal and figurative a relationship which is including a son a grandson a subject a nation or something but the main meaning of a son is the Builder of a family name and you know and and the primary primary root meaning of that in the Hebrew is to build so a son is meant to build the family name or to build the kingdom and but we understand that you know God God has to build us on something I'm just going to yeah let's just go to Matthew chapter 16 forgive me if this goes a little bit slow in the beginning but want you understand that we we are not built on shifting Sands we are not built on man's ideas or man's opinion or popular opinion of the day or theology or culture or what the church thinks or what someone else think things but we're built on thus sayth the Lord me we're built upon the revelation of who of who Jesus is in his season and I want you to see this in in Matthew 16 remember Jesus Jesus was to build the family name he's the builder of the family name so when God came in flesh his his purpose was to expand his Dominion upon the Earth to take Dominion back from Satan of creation and not just take creation under his Dominion but to gather sub to be built into the family of God am mean cuz he's a builder and a builder he constructs things he what is what is on a blueprint becomes material when he's finished amen amen so God has a blueprint of his word amen we know that the works of God will finish from the foundation of the world so even the New Testament it was already done and so God had a blueprint and he was going to build his people rebuild his people according to the blueprint of his word amen but he needs a builder to do the building am cuz there's no good having the material and having the section and having the legal document that you can build without a builder amen because if you don't have that guy with the hammer and the expertise and the knowledge your building is not going very far amen now Matthew 16 and verse3 I know this is very familiar but I just want to read it when Jesus came into the coast of cesia Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah so one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon by Jonah which is Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church I will build my church and the Gates of Hell bdon me shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so we understand that this this this piece of scripture here that Jesus is not you know the whole conversation is on Revelation he asks he he says who do men say that I am so what has been revealed to everyone that I am remember Jesus looked like anyone else he wasn't like the cartoon Bible stories where he six foot blonde hair Pure White robe you know looks very different everyone around him he looked like everyone else Isaiah 53 said that when we see him there'll be nothing in him that we would desire him so he wasn't even a great handsome fellow amen but in him he was God made flesh and so it so he they're asking what has been revealed and they was and and the people said because they could see what they read about the prophets doing they could see in the ministry of Jesus Christ because because he was the fullness of the godhead bodly so what was poured out in portion there you know there was a lawgiver in Moses and then there's so there's a portion of Christ revealed in Moses and all the way down through the prophets it was it was the part of God like if you take a three-sided um you know piece of glass you shine light through it you get a rainbow and it's the same thing the fullness of God in bod is reflected you you know refracted through the pyramid amen and then and then a portion of that light it's all split up I mean so all of that was gathered and the fullness of that now was in Christ amen and that's why they say well you seem like Jeremiah or you see like you know you seem to be like John the Baptist the spirit of Elijah or Elias or Jeremiah or one of the prophets cuz they could see what the prophets did he did but then he asked a question but whom say ye that I am because he wanted them he wanted because you have to remember God is looking for a response right I mean he's looking for you to respond to his word he doesn't want someone just to sit there and watch it all go by he's wanting you to personally speak and reply to him and that's what he was getting his disciples because he knew he knew Peter would have had the had the Revelation Thou Art the Christ but he wanted it to come out of his lips and that's why he asked a question but who do you say that I am and Peter Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and S blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it see it's talking about Revelation it's not but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so the rock he's speaking about is not Peter the man who would deny him three times try and kill a God the sword you know when pressure came down he denied him and all these things and it's not even Jesus but the river but the rock that the church is built upon is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is amen that is that is the rock amen amen that is the rock but I want you to know and it said that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it wanted to get to this last Sunday but I didn't have the time remember because there was a promise given to Abraham and a promise given to Rebecca that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy amen amen so so the people that are built upon the rock of who Jesus is amen they will possess the gates of their enemy because the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against them Hallelujah so we so the church is built upon who Jesus is not who Jesus was that's right amen because even the Catholics acknowledge he died and rose again even historians you go read the histories they acknowledge Jesus was alive amen but that's just a historical God and we understand what good does a historical God do to us it doesn't do any good you can't get you know your brother BR would make the saying you cannot get warm next to a painted fire the fire it may be it may be more real and you know HD and all the whatever high definition picture it could ever be but you can never get warm next to that thing you can never get the effects of it if it's just a painted fire and it's the same thing with the Bible what good is it quoting about a just a historical God if he's not the same today what good does it do it just makes us a bunch of historians we're not historians I mean God is not a god of History he's a god of the present he said I he you know you know when Moses was speaking to him in the Burning Bush Moses asked asked this one in the pillar of in the burning bush tell me what your name is that I can tell the Elders of Israel who sent me he says I am that I am he's the present God and that's why the scripture says he is the same yesterday today and forever but but the sad thing is man is forever thanking God for what he did looking forward for what he's going to do and missing what he's doing but he he's in the Today part we want to know what God is where is he today amen amen amen that's what we need to know and so the question is now and I put this very much on your lap who do you say who do you say this is amen oh brother brandom you're a prophet of God Malachi 4 but who do you say when you look in the mirror for yourself and you look into the word for yourself and you see what God is doing Among Us I ask you the question who do you say this is amen amen who do you say this is because the word must put on flesh in every generation and the word must be pre preached through a living vessel it's got to be it's got to be lived out of a living vessel amen it can't just be historical but that same God must live in this generation as well and that's why the question always comes upon us who do you say this is is it is it just a personality of a man or a group of people that are enthused about some Doctrine amen who do you say it is what caused brother John to just sing in the spirit like that wasn't his own ability he says I didn't even know what I sung Don't Let It Go by you young people when God do you know does things like that hallelujah amen cuz we can just go oh he practiced that now he sung it no he didn't even realize what he was doing God took over a man hallelujah amen I want to see more of it amen we will amen however God wants to manifest himself I say God you do it amen whatever you want to do amen Hall and so it's the revelation of who he is in this season amen and and the prophet tells us that Christ has put on bride form am mean he's veiled behind human skin in this generation amen and I trust when you if you've met him you're going to say God is in me amen remember Jesus said I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world Amen I'll be with you even in you what does that mean if You' have met him he's in you so you if you had a cross-section of your body and you goone to another dimension you'd see Pillar of Fire in you hallelujah amen you'd see the same God that came down that's why he came down the day of Pentecost and it's not a painted fire to us but he came down that logos light came down separated himself into 120 people amen amen then the word went forth what was happening God was expanding his kingdom God was taking out this this this world under Dominion amen hallelujah he was expanding his kingdom and then the word went forth and then the kingdom was expanded I mean people who are in Chang of of Darkness they saw glorious light and they walked free am hallelujah amen so it's the Revelation sure we must know what God has done yeah that's right but you cannot personally know a god of History amen even studying the science of the creation it's a wonderful thing I spent a lot of time in University studying creation science but it didn't help me meet the author of the word amen sure it was helpful but it didn't help me meet the author but when I Heard a Voice on a tape one day amen and God Came Upon the scene but I had to be willing to give myself amen you got to be willing you can be convicted all the day long you can know you're wrong deep down in your soul but unless you're willing to give yourself over just give yourself over amen amen hallelujah Mery I'm afraid what someone will think of me what is who do we live before I ask your question who do we live before do we live before our family who's our God I I just want I just want to really put it down who's our God because the one you make your sub yourself subject to ultimately that's your God that's right that's the god you serve so is it your family or your culture or the popular opinion of the day right or is it this right amen just you just just just just think about that oh I love the Lord but what are you bowing to amen yeah amen amen God have mercy I would bow to this amen amen because he's not a mean father he's not a cruel Taskmaster he doesn't beat you and wear you down and you know he's a loving God Amen all I've seen is love these last however many years Hallelujah all I've seen and it's just got greater amen hallelujah yes Lord amen so Upon This Rock the spiritual revelation of who God is who Jesus is I'm going to read this from the Rapture message he said bless blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you Upon This Rock the spiritual revelation of who God is who Jesus is and here is the revelation of God God made in flesh and revealed to the world he was in the world God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself revealing what God was in a body of Flesh Thou Art Christ the anointed one the Son of God he said flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you Upon This Rock I'll build my church The revelation of the word and its season which is who Jesus is I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen amen amen now let's go to Matthew chapter 7 you know we love to maybe we should sing it a lot more you know we you you there's a song that the wise man built his house upon the rock and the rain came down and the floods came up and the house stood firm amen amen yeah praise the Lord amen but let's let's just read thisall because it's very interesting when you see you see what uh because there's a reason as as as the word is ordered so Jesus he has a purpose of going from one Parable to the next or one story to the next yeah there's a reason why he spoke things in a certain order yeah and so if we go to Matthew 7 and verse 21 look at this and this is just before the parable that we're going to read but there's a reason it's there not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven we know the will of the father is the word many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so he he doesn't tell them you never did those things yep so these are people who are anointed with the spirit of God doing miracles in his name but yet they are workers of iniquity now why is that because a worker of iniquity is someone who knows better but is not willing to change that's what a worker of iniquity is amen and I believe that none of us are in that category amen now look so so and then he goes from there then he goes there therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which which built his house upon a rock let's just say there quickly remember a worker of iniquity is someone who heareth the sayings of mine and doesn't do them yeah so now he's making a contrast because here's a group of people we just read about who will be bitly disappointed but the word came their way it's like even you read you know you know you make it such a simple illustration water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you take all the scriptures of baptism you can see it is the Lord Jesus Christ it's very very straightforward but yet there's but there there's ministers upon the Earth that have read those things and heard about those things but because they are not they're afraid to do go against their church and against their denomination they will keep quiet about it and they'll compromise on the word that's right amen so instead of staying with the truth because remember if you stand for God God will stand for you if you do not stand for God God will not stand for you he is only obligated to his word amen so if you stand upon his word he is obligated to you amen right you may not understand how the outcome works out but he will stand job stood upon the word of God in his day hallelu remember he he he killed the sacrifice for himself and his family and that sacrifice was God's provided way in that day amen and he didn't understand what was going on he didn't he didn't he didn't understand why he lost everything he's covered in boils head to toe he lost his children you know he's on an ash he he didn't understand it but he was standing upon that sacrifice God ordained he was standing upon the word and because because he just stayed there sure he complained you know he did but and he didn't understand what was going on but because he stood on that sacrifice I put the way he stood on the word then God came down and God revealed him God revealed himself in that trial in a greater way than job ever knew him because he said I've heard of thee but now I see thee and at the end of that trial he says now I know my redeemer lives he didn't know his Redeemer lived before that he had no idea what the resurrection was all about he says you see a you know you see a tree the Autumn time you know the leaves fall off it's it's there with no leaves in the winter and then the spring comes forth and the life comes back and sees a flower you know same thing the flower dies drops the seed and then the seed comes up in the next you know Springtime and the cycle over and over again he sees a man he dies where does he go you read about the Book of Job he had no idea where it was you know you know the her Afters he had no idea but through that trial he said now I know my redeemer lives and in this flesh I'll see God and I'll stand with him on that day am hallelujah amen why because he stood he stood on the word he did not move off what God had ordained amen amen and because he stood for God God stood for him amen amen and that's why job was considered a perfect man as he said as God said to Satan because he took God and his word and he stood upon the word amen amen and it's the same thing with you and I remember if he didn't yeah if job did not stand upon the word I don't believe God would have stood for him okay brother Braham says job knew he wasn't righteous but job knew was putting trust in the slain blood of that lamb and that's what made him righteous so he knew you know job in his own ability he knew wasn't righteous yeah cuz he said if there's only someone who could who could lay hands on a sinful man and a holy God and basically reconcile them cuz he knew that he wasn't you know but he was righteous because he had confidence in the blood of the Lamb amen amen amen and that's why now if you stand for God if you remember one with God is a majority amen amen one with God is a majority we don't trust in the flesh and blood we see around us though it's encouraging we put our confidence in God oh yes Lord so then now therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I'll liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it amen this world is falling apart amen there's been another shooting in Germany you know these things have have just become common you know people they take their weapons they you know they just gun down heaps of people few years ago that would have been a great jot but now we just become numb to it and people in Iraq are being butchered and you know all the you know Syria and all these terrible things going on you know and we can become numb to all these things it's become almost common it's become everyday event amen and the world and you see what's happening oh you know people get so caught up in the American elections I'll say this it doesn't matter who's in the office they will fulfill what God has ordained them to do amen amen and Russia's going to Nuke the pl you know he's gonna it's prophesied to happen he said in the last version he says I saw this brother bam 1933 I saw all of America just covered in smoking craters amen amen and it's going to happen because Russia's coming to her position and all of all of the westers playing Pokémon go blinded to what's going on I saw a headline wasn't even a bunch of believers they said that that all of the world knows that America is going to be in a next major war except America because everyone's playing Pokémon go all caught up in all these things blinded to what's going on Amen thank God we're not blinded friends because we would be in that same position if it wasn't for the grace of God Amen it's not him that willth or runneth but God that show us Mercy hallelujah amen so this world is falling apart and it will fall apart it has to it's been ordained to fall apart that's right amen but those who are built upon the rock amen of revelation of who Jesus Christ is they will never fall Hallelujah the you know the storms of life may come that's why it's such a victory you see a house that's that survived a great flood you know like wow how did that Sur you know what a tremendous thing it's the same thing with a Believer you know we're not fly by night people am in one day out the next day Come Rain hail fire persecution hardship division whatever it may be War famine Strife we're standing rugged because we're built upon a foundation we know in whom we have belied and it's not shifting SS of this you know as as Peter said we these are not enticing words just of man's fables amen this message is not just man you know enticing words and man's fables and things these things really happen amen and the evidence of it is you because normally you know if you go look at the history of denomination there's a move of God with the founder yeah but then you just just go one two generations down the road and all they say is look what our founder did amen but you see in the see in this though brother said this will never denominate that's right and you can see that because we're not always looking say oh what happened 50 years ago we're saying look what's happening today look what God is doing among us today and that's the proof of the pudding is that God is the same in all generations that we don't we haven't just gathered ourselves on a historical figure but we've gathered ourselves to a living God Amen yes amen and so if you're built upon the rock amen doesn't matter what Storms Come and Go you know there's that song you know don't build your house on the Sandy land don't build it too near the shore you know but it says but build your house upon the rock a good foundation a solid spot the storms may come and go but what the peace of God you will know and that's exactly right now if we go to the book of Deuteronomy 32 I just want to show you that you know Moses and it's a few places but I just wanted to take a few here where he speaks of God being their Rock Amen our God is a rock of you know he's a rock and so let's go to Deuteronomy 32 we're just going to skip down through this chapter just to save time so Deuteronomy 32:15 say Amen if you're there okay verse 15 he can read the whole chapter no sorry verse one Deuteronomy 32:1 give ear O ye heavens and I'll speak and hear o Earth the words of my mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the Jew as a small rain upon the tender herb and as the flow showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord ascribe ye greatness unto our God he is the rock his work is perfect and all his ways are judgment a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right as he that's go to verse 15 he says but jesam which is actually Israel not Israel wax fat and kicked Thou Art wax and fat Thou Art grown thick Thou Art covered with fatness but he forsook God which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation and let's just go to down to Verse 18 of the rock that begat thee Thou Art unmindful and Hast forgotten God that formed thee May he's talking about this is not a piece of masonry a piece of stone he's talking about a person amen and then he says in verse 30 how should one chase a thousand and two put 10,000 to flight except their Rock had sold them and the Lord had shut them up and verse 31 for their Rock is now not our Rock even our enemies themselves being judges so he's saying that the people of Israel their Revelation is not our Revelation amen their God is not our God you understand so our Rock remember our rock is firm yeah we are not we may be troubled on every side but we don't forget in whom we have beli amen we may have troubles all the day long but we know in whom we have believed and we we are built on this Foundation this Rock Amen because the Gates of Hell how do they Prevail WIS of false Doctrine formality just having church just just having a church culture that's how the Gates of Hell Prevail against Christendom amen but if you're built upon the rock those who are built upon the rock they want a living God they're not satisfied with just what happened yesterday year but they want them to live today amen amen want more of him yes do you not amen and verse 37 and he shall say where are their gods their Rock in whom they trusted yeah and it goes all the way through the Bible I just wanted to go there now a rock this word Rock in the what we read here in Deuteronomy in the in the Hebrew that means properly a cliff or sharp rock as compressed generally a rock or Boulder but figuratively a refuge yeah and our God is a refuge yeah we can take I trust you have I take refuge in my rock amen amen because you know you know someone that it's been revealed to you cannot get them out of it by an argument amen a revelation becomes part of you yeah it becomes very part of your being it's not something that's learn and your mind changes a revelation you cannot deny a revelation amen so in times of trouble you can go to that as a refuge because if God has revealed himself to you in the past yes amen if God has made himself real to you and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church then you can use that as a refuge because instead of turning to your own top two inches here your brain or people around you only you can turn to him amen amen in times of trouble you can turn to him amen hallelujah now I want to and then so David now I want to speak of a couple he says this here this is David in in in second Samuel 22 is everyone with me amen 2 Samuel 22 God is our Rock if that's all you get out of the service praise the Lord amen you got to you got to know in whom you have believed and you have to have confidence in whom you have believed amen amen because remember the training anyone's training doesn't matter if it's military police paramedic doctors whatever nurses that is never put to the test when there's nothing going on it's when there's a time of Crisis then what has been learned absorbed comes out am amen you take like the SAS you you the elite you know military it's in times of great pressure when when it's Split Second decisions come but it's a result of training they receive amen and it's like it's like when when I've never had to do military training but you know those those those those new recruits they begin to hate their sergeant major with a passion they hate them because they drill you know you know he abuses them he shouts them gets them up early makes them do all these exercises and they hate the guy but then on the battlefield they love him because they appreciate all the training that went in is actually saving their lives and they love them yeah because it's on the battlefield everything that they learned now just comes out amen so it's the same thing with us yeah it's it's it's in the it's not in the easy times oh praise the Lord I believe the message I'm going in a Rapture it's in the hard times that's right amen that that that what God has has has has put into your soul everything of that it comes out in the hard times amen oh my help us godone hey I put myself hey I have hard times too we all have hard times we have good times we have hard times but the important thing is now remember a Mountaintop experience is a good time take but when you go down you find yourself in a valley take the Mountaintop experience to the valley amen so take the victory that you had take and take it down into the trial cuz it will help you in the valley but we understand that on a mountain top you don't grow fruit on a Mountaintop Hallelujah it grows in the valley amen amen so oh I'm going through a real blender of it your real hardship time and then you'll come out of it you'll say thank you Lord I'm so glad I went through that cuz cuz you can see what God has done for you how he's molded and shaped your your character yes Lord Hallelujah and character is the only thing that you're going to take with you by the way cuz remember death doesn't change you it just changes your Dwelling Place remember when when Samuel when Saul went to the witch of indor because he couldn't hear from God about should they fight the Philistines or what shall it be he went to that witch and then the witch called up Samuel he had a mantle upon him and he prophesied this time tomorrow or something you'll be where I am and in other words he prophesied you're going to die in battle and he did so here was someone called up from the other side and he was still Samuel amen he was still so death just changed his dwelling place that's why if you love the Lord here you'll love him there amen if people despise him here they'll despise him there you know and so 2 Samuel 22 and verse1 and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hands of all his enemies now the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock my Fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in whom will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower my refuge My Savior thou saveth me from violence I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies when the waves of death comp pass me the floods of the ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of hell Compass me about the snares of death prevented me and my distress I called upon the Lord and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his Temple and My Cry did enter into his ears now you can read the whole chapter but he's describing now he says my lord is my rock now I'm going to jump back to the very beginning of the service and we'll come back to this but remember God told man have dominion subdue all the Earth Yep and the increase of of his government there shall be no end Isaiah chapter 9 so I'm going to take later but I'm going to come to this now I'm going to take two characters in The Bible I'm going to take David I'm going to take Paul both of them expanded the borders of the Kingdom one was a natural Kingdom David the other was a spiritual Kingdom Paul right amen so they were fulfilling God's Commission in a way to take the Earth under Dominion yep but they both so that was number one but number two they both knew God as their rock yeah now I don't remember Paul ever saying that he's his Rock but you can see but he was built remember Jesus when he's speaking to Peter James and John the apostles Upon This Rock I'll build my church he had in his mind Paul's going to be built Upon This Rock because on the road to Damascus he sees God come down the great light shines upon him and and go and and well he was Saul at the time he you know he speaks to this being he says who are you Lord and the voice speaks back I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted you know and so and so he was built and then what happened was whatever came their way remember they were like the wise men that built their house upon the rock because they had storms David had a lot of distress he had a lot of hardship he was on the run for a long time from Saul he had a lot of close close run you know scrapes and things where it could have gone this way or that way but he had confidence that he was was anointed by a prophet of God to be king and that was his Refuge amen trust me that was his Refuge because it anchored in his heart I'm going to be king of Israel and so what does that mean it means exactly what was said to him you will be king over this nation over these 12 tribes but he was on the Run he was a fugitive in his own land you know all all kinds of things there's a time when he when he had to flee to the land of the Philistines and and act crazy in front of the king that the king wouldn't take his life you know there were there were a lot of places like that in his life but deep down in his soul he knew I'm going to be king and that's why he didn't kill Saul the two times he could have took taken his life because he knew when God was ready and when he was prepared then David would be upon the throne you understand he had confidence that at the right time at the right season he would be on the throne and that's why he was his Rock and it's the same thing with you and I friends you just have to have confidence at the right time remember the scripture even says in the New Testament and this is not verbatim but it basically says the current state you're in take it as the will of God for your life am that's what it says just be content in where you are amen amen because you I trust you know I know the rock my God is a rock it doesn't matter where I am what situation I'm in this is where I meant to be am hallelujah hallelujah that's right amen so if you have that if you have that Revelation then it doesn't matter like like we'll come to it later at the end but Paul says None of these things move me a lot of things tried to move him a lot of things he said none of these things move him amen amen he was a little man but but but he could have said like David my god Jehovah Jehovah's salvation Jesus Jesus means Jehovah salvation my God Is My Rock and I shall not be moved amen amen hallelujah and I say these things because the same God back there is the same God today I mean you don't just read these stories and say oh wouldn't it be neat to be like that you got to say I am that person I know the same God I'm built on the same Rock Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah that's right and he'd say in the Psalms I'm just going to read this quickly Psalms 8926 he shall cry unto me thou art my father my God and the rock of my salvation Psalms 92 and5 to show that the Lord is upright here's my Rock and there is no unrighteousness in him Psalms 94 and22 but the Lord is my defense and my God is the rock of my refuge these are David's words amen so he knew he knew exactly amen you know it wasn't nice ideas to him God became personal to David amen it said when he was anointed by Samuel said the spirit of God was with him from that day on that's right amen and he could always go back to that time amen he could always go back to that time and I trust you can always go back to a time where the anointing came up the anointing of the word came upon you and you're a different person from that day on Amen now as I said a son I'm just going to I'm sorry I'm just going to jump right back again a son is a builder of the family name yeah that's what the Hebrew word means a son now Paul would write in Ephesians chapter 3 and maybe let's just go there if you don't mind now Ephesians chapter 3:9 says this here and you can read the whole thing but I just want to take these scriptures he says wait let's go from verse eight unto me who am less than least of all the saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which was from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God Amen according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen and so Paul Paul's Paul's purpose was to build the kingdom was for its borders to be expanded because he was a builder of the family name but it wasn't his name he was he was putting forth but the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and the whole purpose of him of him going on his missionary Journeys and things was that the kingdom would be expanded that this creation would come under Dominion again yeah and now in Genesis 1 we read it he said to subdue it and have dominion over it okay I trust now I trust this all comes together to have dominion to subdue it and take dominion over it now how did God I was want to before that how did God bring order out of chaos because you're ordained to have dominion over this Earth am mean you're ordained to subdue it because by God telling them in the beginning to have dominion over it to subdue it they actually told now you what does it mean to subdue something you've actually got to take a hold of it you've got to put it in its place amen you've actually got to have dominion over it yeah so he told them this is what you have to do but now how did that now how God did this is how man does this okay so how did God bring order out of Chaos in the creation by speaking his word he caused Eden to come out of Darkness yeah remember in the beginning the world was out Fullman void Darkness covered the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God began speaking and then at the end there was there was the there was Eden there was Paradise there was a man and a woman in a garden so everything was how it should be but it was by him speaking order came out of chaos that's right yeah and you can see the world I'm just going to go jump back to how the world's falling apart they're trying to they're going to try and bring order out of this chaos that's happening amen because in order to to to change something to change a world order there has to be there has to be a revolution or chaos to happen and then out of that chaos they can bring something new it happens everywhere you see the French Revolution chaos happened and out of it came a republic amen the you you the king of France would never have just said now let's have a republic and gone somewhere else they had to be chaos and our order came out of that chaos you can see the whole thing around the world now so he spoke now and every part of creation was subject to God's spoken word in the beginning yeah all of nature this entire Earth was not one of it resisted or stopped what he said that would happen he said let there be light there was light let the waters divide and let dry land come forth all these things exactly what happened yeah but now so man before the fall had dominion over the creation by the spoken word yeah man man had Dominion because Adam was made in the image of God yep so what God what Adam did is because God Did It Before you following me it's like our children you know you know you see anyone's kids and you look at the parents and say they're just like you are they so you know you like you see someone who's very gifted in in art or music or whatever it is it's normally in the parents they're just like you because the ability is passed down amen yeah that's so OD your son so good at sport well look at the parents that's normally in them you got a natural ability well where' that come from the parents yeah so Adam's ability to have dominion by the spoken word is because his father God had that same ability amen y amen now but then when when the fall came in Genesis 3:1 17 and this is God and he says and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and have eaten of the tree which I Comm commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall th eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth uh to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and dust thou shall return now he said he said by the sweat of your brow you'll do these things so by physical effort this is how you're going to get food before the fall it wasn't that way amen otherwise why would that be a curse you understand so beforehand he operated in a very different way to after the fall yeah and so Genesis but but you say well in Genesis 2:5 it says there's no man to till the ground and true because man was Spirit man yeah and then he was put in a fleshly body yeah and so but I do not think it was physical strength that they would use to till the ground because before the because otherwise it wouldn't have been part of the curse that would have been physical effort or sweat of the brow to bring forth food now amen the second Adam reveals this because Jesus was called the second Adam and he did everything the first Adam did yeah I'm just going to come to that now God became so as I said children get their nature and abilities from their parents or or forbears yeah but remember there was no one before Adam it was God then Adam so everything he received his ability his nature was from God yeah there wasn't something that was hidden in the family Tre that suddenly sprung itself up because that was the family tree amen yep so children are an expression of the life that was in and the father yeah and the scripture says Christ is the image of the invisible God yeah so God became flesh now remember he is the second Adam but I just want to get this as a you know a bit of background God became one of us you you know we know John 1 and verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God yep that and the word became flesh verse 14 and dwelt among us and we beheld as Glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so it says there very expressly that Jesus is not another person from God the Father they're the same being that's why when Jesus revealed himself to Thomas after the resurrection Thomas says my Lord and my God Amen he's he actually had the Revelation this is god Jehovah God incarnate in a body amen it's very simple he didn't say you know oh my Lord you know he said my Lord and my God yeah amen now but you see God had to come down as man in order that we could understand him but also so he could understand us yeah so brother Bram says in Christ the mystery God revealed he said the first thing that God wanted to do was reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he could not he was too great to ever be Reve revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do um he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man yeah because he couldn't Express you know how can you think of Eternity you know you I remember when I was young one of the first things I have in my mind is who made God but God doesn't no one made God he's always been what do you mean you know you can't fathom that really even as an adult so where's his beginning he has no beginning where's his end he has no end what do you mean he doesn't have an end yeah how does that work eternity is always this there's no time in eternity you know you can't you can't mentally work you know really comprehend that that's righten you see so he couldn't he's too big and mysterious to really understand but that's why but he loved fatherhood he wanted to be a father and the only way he could fully Express that was to become a son of man become one of us amen amen because if your father if you never knew your father how do you really know what a father is that's amen you can read about it you can kind of you know read stories and things but until you experience a father being a father to you then you know what F you know what it means to have a dad it's the same thing with God you know even David I think he said we you read one of those psalms he's my father but he didn't he didn't he doesn't he didn't know it like we know amen because that was before Calvary yeah and so he had to become one of us that he could express he loved fatherhood for he was a father the only way he could do it was express it was to become a son of man so he did that that we could understand him but he also became flesh that he could understand us better yeah because we understand it's like learning anything you can know all the theory behind it but when you do it it's when you experience it it's a whole different thing so I said like driving a car you can know everything about the car but when you sit in the driver's seat you turn the ignition you put on your seat belt and you pull out for that first drive it's very different it's very different and so God he knows all things but there's a big but he had to experience what it was like that's what it says in Hebrews that he took on he didn't take on the nature of angels we took on the Flesh and Blood of us that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest that he could understand you and understand the infirmity of this flesh that he could relate to you amen amen right I'm so glad he did you lordes now brother says in the um in the sermon the Mighty God unveiled before us in 64 he says I was reading a story some years ago and in the story it said a great Noble King he says I forget the name of him just now I wasn't thinking about the story it was perhaps fiction but it leads us to a point that gives us background on what we want to say remember a sermon is the Mighty God Avail before us this King he was such a noble King and such a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you see me for your last time for many years and his guard and his Noble said to him good King why do you say that are you going to a foreign country somewhere to become an alien he said no I'm staying right here he said I'm going out amongst my subjects I'm going to become a peasant I'm going to cut wood with the wood Chopper I'm going to till the ground with the toiler I'm going to prune the vines with those who prune the vine I'm going to be one of them in order to get better acquainted with what they're doing and I love them and I want to be more acquainted with them personally they won't know me but yet I want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning when his delegates and all of his people seen him or the ones that was in the palace take off his crown l on the seat the throne take his robe off put on peasant clothes walk out amongst the common people now in that little story we find then about God they said to the king king we want you we love you we want you to remain King but he wanted be to become one of them to know them better and they' know him better what he really was it would display to them what he really was and that's what God did he changed himself from Jehovah God to become one of us that he might suffer he might taste death he might know what the sting of death was and to take the penal penalty of death upon himself he laid aside his crown and his robe and became one of us he washed feet with the lowely he dwelt in the tents with the poor he slept in the woods and in the streets with those who are underprivileged he became one of us that he might understand us better and that we might understand him better Hallelujah that's amazing last time up in New Guinea you know you know I talked about that I said how Jesus said foxes have dens birds have their nest but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head and these are people this is the poorest region of the country in its third world and they could see Jesus became poorer than them because they had homes they had food they had a village they had he didn't have these things the great king of glory became poorer than the poor hallelujah that's how great that's how great God is so great cuz he can make himself self so little am that's what makes him great amen that we might understand it so he might understand us better and we might understand him better but now we see in that form now he began to demonstrate everything Adam did before the fall so man before the fall as I said had dominion over the creation by the spoken word because the second Adam demonstrated everything the first Adam lost so he spoke to the storm and nature obeyed him he said peace be still as we sng this morning amen and and the storm had to be still he cursed the Fig Tree in Mark 11 showing that he is Lord over everything he went to a funeral every funeral he came across it never stayed a funeral I mean Lazarus didn't stay dead in the Tomb the you know you know the um lady's you know son that was being carried out to be buried Jesus intersected that funeral and the boy didn't stay dead I mean D's daughter didn't stay dead I mean there was near a funeral that Jesus went to in it day of funeral hallelujah hallelujah he multiplied the bread and the fish amen because showing he is the very Creator Hallelujah he fed thousands showing that he is the creator sickness had to obey him the kingdom of Hell had to obey him death couldn't hold him amen he he demonstrated dominion over everything that could be could have dominion overl amen he defeated everything yes Howell death in the grave couldn't hold him Hallelujah so he was demonstrating you know but the very fact that he had he he took control of nature from Satan that was squatting am mean in the storms and everything he took dominion over these things amen and Jesus would say in Matthew 28:18 all power on Heaven and Earth is given un me but then he would tell his disciples to go into all the world and to preach the gospel baptizing them teaching them all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and L with you always even to the end of the world and we know the name of the father and the son the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ but so now here was here was the second Adam remember the first Adam was told had Dominion subd it take dominion over the Earth and then now here comes the second Adam Hallelujah and he and he's actually the body he was in was part of the creation amen the Earth was cursed and God put on cursed Earth amen sure he is Virgin born but the very his body he suffered infirmities he was sick like we get sick am mean he was tempted like I'm tempted on All Points oh and you know many times we think that we're the only one who's gone through these things Jesus did it all amen amen he was suffered on all points I mean he was tempted on All Points yet without sin amen so he understands what it's like to be to be pressured to conform as a young child as an adult finding his way in life he knows what it's like cuz he's been there amen hallelujah and then so and then and then brother Braham says in the future home he says when Jesus was baptized on the River Jordan and the voice spake out from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased God was basically saying this is my piece of the earth that I'm going to use to redeem the rest of the earth amen and so that was the commission Jesus had remember the increase of his government what's he's going to have dominion he's going to subdue this creation and then he calls his disciples that his work would continue amen because their their um their Ministry was a continuation of his ministry but instead of being in one man he was now in a many membered body and Jesus when he was on Earth he cast out the devil wherever he found him he set the captives free he opened the eyes of the blind he set at Liberty those uh you know chained amen and then he commissioned his church to do the same thing amen because the Devil is a squatter we understand he is a squatter in this Earth but we have the privilege amen by the anointing of God to cast out Satan wherever we find them am mean to take this Earth under Dominion amen that's that's that's the right that's the preaching of the Gospel that's the living of this word amen it's not just me standing here preaching the gospel you preach a sermon every day amen amen your life preaches louder than your words amen that's right amen amen so you go and you create an atmosphere around you amen and then when you really meet people you say Lord open their eyes amen set them free amen amen cuz they see a life I trust they do amen and so the so the commission given to the church was subdue this creation have dominion expand the borders of the Kingdom right amen that's the that's the reason we're here friends we're not here just to have church and oh yeah believe in a prophet whatever more but the same God Amen that same anointing that was on Adam amen that was on the second Adam as now in the second Eve huj as in you and I amen the same one in the book of Acts is present among us and that's why it says in Mark 16 he says go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and these signs and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe now it's now you're going to demonstrate What I've Done remember he cast out Legion thousands of devils out of that one man Mary Magdalene had Seven Devils in her you know what was all the sicknesses that he healed he cast out you know brother says what is cancer it's a demon Spirit now perverting cells in a body that's right amen and the life has to be driven out of it what's a virus it's a life oh you say well it's a b you know you can see the biochemical mechanism of how a virus spreads it's still alive yes amen that's why I pray God kill the life out of the thing then let the body heal itself then now so he says now and these signs shall follow them that believe they'll follow you just walk with God remember this is not a checklist God will vindicate your life in whatever degree he wants to do it he's going to do it amen and these signs shall for them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils who's asked for healing who's prayed for someone who's sick what's happened a devil's been cast out amen amen they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpant and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover who's who seen that happen they shall recover that's why you just got to have confidence it doesn't matter if you don't see anything straight away remember it's your faith sometimes God does it like this for you CU he wants to build your faith other times he wants to see do you have confidence in me amen do you have confidence in the prayer you have said amen oh I don't see anything do you have confidence of you know what you've prayed hallelujah amen and then whatever the outcome is you just say praise the Lord cuz ultimately remember he's Sovereign amen he's Sovereign and is choosing you know David David and his first child to bash Sheba was was sick to death and he prayed on his face asking that God would intercede and and and not take the child's life amen so so David wasn't just blaz about it cuz sometimes people get very blaz well if it's God's will it'll happen if it's not you know but he he prayed with everything was in him Lord child you're my rock but then God took the child what did he do he washed himself he went into the temple he said glory to God you got read about in the scripture amen cuz he knew God was in control of everything you have to that's not being was it fatalistic whatever you understand God is Sovereign he's not an Aon boy amen amen he's not our little mascot that we go get and do things God is Not That Way amen a lot of people these days try to treat God like a mascot or an Aron boy right and what does that mean that means the person's will is greater than than God's will that's right amen he is a sovereign God he can cause us all to cease to exist if he wants to he can do whatever he wants am amen he is Sovereign this is not a democracy amen Us in God is not a democracy he's our King and we love him and he loves us and the reason we love him is because he first loved us hallelujah now and then he says another place he says you shall tread on scorpions and serpents they shall not harm you it wasn't speaking of literally you see people they do snake dances and things he's not talking about natural natural things necessarily he's talking about demon power he says you'll tread upon on them you'll have dominion amen amen we're called to subdue these things friends Hallelujah and then so the expans so the book of Acts is the kingdom expanding amen amen it goes from 120 to 5,000 then how of many more and the kingdom expands so I could say the garden expands like in Genesis 1 subdue go subdue it replenish multiply upon the face of the Earth subdue the creation and that's what happened in the New Testament now because you see real to to to Really uh what do you call it natural birth wasn't God's perfect will yeah but but God allowed it CU this is how he knew it would happen yeah God really ordained in the beginning that his children will be spoken into existence y that's right yeah that was God's perfect will but God knew that we'd have to be born how we're born amen okay and there's nothing wrong with that in marriage you understand don't get all uh Victorian about these things right amen amen amen okay but you see God's perfect will was that we are to be spoken into existence you understand and so now when when when someone is inspired to preach the word and someone is born again you understand that is actually man multiplying and replenishing the Earth because it's actually bringing to birth real sons and daughters of God you understand Hallelujah that's why that's why the word must put on flesh in every generation amen that's why there's ministry that's why there's Sunday school that's why you create an atmosphere remember everyone has a part in the church everyone has a part in the church you Cate an atmosphere you pull on the gift that's in front of you you sing and worship create an atmosphere around you you bring God down oh no one ever notices me the people in the Pew is actually the most you pray for the services brother Braham says the the reason I'm successful is people pray amen and that's the reason his ministry was so successful because people genuinely pray to God Mo take that man and use him amen it wasn't it wasn't him remember everything you know you know you look at an iceberg they would say it's the tip of the iceberg that's out of the water it's actually The Underneath but the actually the important part of the iceberg the the Unseen part it's the same thing with a group of people it's the Unseen part that is the most important amen and remember we're not here to get uh praise from man I mean sure it's nice brother R says if you don't want praise for Man actually you're you know you know you're lying because we like those things do you know you oh I appreciate that I was that was so nice but at the end of the day we want praise from God amen amen amen and so now that is the that is the order of the kingdom is to expand it and to bring this creation to subject Amen to the word of God and now it's the same thing with us you say well how do you now I'm going to bring this into your life CU how do you bring things subject Amen in the Book of Revelation 12:9 it says this and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night so there Comes A Time remember before this says Michael and his angels fought with Luc for the dragon and his angels and the enemy was cast down to the Earth but he says so this is not the ones that overcame him is not speaking about angels because there's no blood for Angels there's only blood for men and women you understand so they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen so this scripture must become lived out now I'm going to try and wrap this up I see I see that that thing on the wall moves you see but we we are here Amen to live out this scripture amen because this salvation that he's speaking about is actually full Redemption coming I mean cuz Satan is cast out upon the Earth in the end time and as the bride goes up Satan comes down and we're seeing that right now and me because we're ascending we're ascending the bride is coming to her position and as the Bride Comes to her position Satan is cast out Hallelujah you see the mechanics is all there for his last ride I mean the pale horses you know all of his mechanics are there you see this last Pope everyone you know it's like a day night change everyone hated the church he comes in oh he's so wonderful you know oh can't get enough of him why cuz the mechanics are here and I'll say this if he's not the last one there'll be someone in the office that will fulfill it it doesn't matter who it is I'm saying the mechanics are all there amen for for Satan to become incarnate in a man and that's because we're ascending that's why he's falling the devil now amen so these people we the bride in this day overcomes them by the blood of the Lamb amen the revelation of who he is what he did for us amen he's our Rock and by the word of their testimony as I said in the very beginning you have to speak amen if the first Adam took Dominion amen if he had dominion over creation by the spoken word and that same anointing that was on him was in the second Adam amen the fullness of God every B was in Christ Jesus our lord amen and he had Dominion by speaking amen and that same anointing is now upon the bride of Christ hallelujah amen then what happens now is you have to speak amen amen amen the word words of your testimony and that is not only your experience but this is your testimony that's why don't confess negative things amen you may say I need prayer saying you need prayer is not negative actually saying I want to join forces amen I want to drive this thing out amen amen oh I'm going through a patch that's not negative say fight me in this battle amen I so I so moved just thinking about you know there was the brothers in Japan and you know people we pray for you know people who not the Prem I think we're with them amen we're with the bride of Christ Hallelujah they might never know us or meet us what it doesn't matter but we're with them Hallelujah because we're not divided amen around the world there's a body moving under the same inspiration that you know the same God that's in US is in them that's why you know that's why I just pray Lord let them know we're with them that there's people praying amen hallelujah but you know so there's nothing wrong with those things and we should it doesn't show weaked Faith we're just in a battle that's right amen so you should say yeah help you know pray for me I'm going through something but a negative confession is you know is is basically denying What the Lord Has Done you know cuz you get down you get weary you say is God really real is this really happening you know don't go down that road I told yeah I say it's like a hamster wheel don't get on that hamster wheel cuz you don't get anywhere you just get tired amen David both David and Paul they knew their God was their Rock Amen and whatever came their way they knew God was able amen amen amen you say well what about praying for a Believer but that say a cancer or something takes their life well that was God's ordained way for them to go and remember as soon as they leave that body to their glorified body amen that cancer is defeated amen amen because that cancer was only a vehicle for God getting to go to that place you understand amen but if God heals them praise the Lord amen whatever God wants to do amen amen is that okay amen you understand it's not a defeat it's only a defeat if people die in unbelief but if someone dies in faith that's a victory hallelujah amen and that's why the victory is not your Circumstance the victory is Are you standing upon the rock and do you have confidence in your rock right amen that's the main thing because if you know in whom you have believed like Paul said amen nothing will move you Upon This Rock I'll build my church and a good Builder doesn't let his building come off its foundation now we have to speak now brother Braham says I don't have the quote on me but it says of someone is Anointed and they're speaking under inspiration it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to move nothing can stand before that man or woman amen because if if it's not me speaking or me praying speak about you as well if you're anointed to to to pray or to speak that's not you speaking that's deity speaking and nothing can stand before that kind of person right amen amen amen that's why that's why now when you have a confession if you're inspired something grips your heart I'm going to get well or something's going to turn out right and you speak it out then actually your situation comes subject to your testimony amen and I'll show you that in the Scripture it says in 2 Corinthians 4:13 we having the same Spirit of Faith according it as is written I believed and therefore I have spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen because God's looking for a response remember Adam Jesus spoken word everything was under their Dominion the same God is in you that's what I'm trying to get you to see you've got to speak to your Mountain amen amen it may not be a literal Mountain it could be sickness it could be trouble in the family whatever it is you've got to speak to your Mountain the enemy May may be going Toe to Toe with you you've got to speak to your enemy don't cow don't cow to the devil amen now there's a story I won't read it but I'll just I'll just paraphrase it quickly it say behold the greater than greater than all of them is here in in in 62 and he speaks of a blind man who who comes into the comes into the prayer line and this BL blind man was a Catholic and he comes up brother Braham sees a vision over him that that he can see and he prays for him he says thus sayith the Lord you're healed and he goes off but then he comes back into the prayer line again and then and then um and then and then the guy says to brother Bram I thought you said I was healed and then the and then brother says to him I thought you said you believed he says he says just just just go on your way thanking God you can see this guy's blind he selling pencils on the roadside all the and he says praise the Lord I'm Healed and selling papers extra extra I can see the Lord's healed me he started to make fun of him two weeks later he's sitting in a barers you remember you got to speak it until you believe it you understand speak it till it anchors down here yeah and so he's sitting in a barber's chair Stone blind and then the Barber's giving him a shave starts to make fun of him I thought you said you know you're healed you're down this me and then he says yeah praise the Lord I'm Healed and his eyes came open and he ran down the street rejoicing it took a couple of weeks you understand but he spoke broke it and eventually his situation came subject to his confession hallelujah amen thank you Lord hallelujah amen David and Goliath now I'm just going to maybe mention this and I'm sorry time has got away but David when he came to Goliath David didn't have a sword you understand but he is speaking he is speaking now and the situation of that outcome of that battle was the result of what he said amen because he said to he said to Goliath I'm going to cut your head off he didn't have a sword but he says I'm going to cut your head off this day amen and what happened he took Goliath's sword and he cut his head off amen amen he killed you know he hit him with the stone and he jumped on him cut off his head with gone sword and so what happened what he said came to pass exactly as he said and I believe because David was walking under the inspiration of God amen amen because they all believe remember Israel there they all believed that God was a god of war that could fight their battles they all knew it mentally but it took someone for it to anchor down in their heart amen and when it anchored down in David's heart nothing could move David amen you understand and then now he says this in works as Faith expressed he says why David was no kind of match for him speaking of Goliath with any kind of weapon he was no match that's man's shoulders speaking of goaly says was probably 10 12T across he's probably standing 14 15t High spear like a Weaver's needle probably 20t long the blade on it maybe 4ot across and a little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheep skin and two piece of of of string tied to it remember that's a sling but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him amen he said God that took me out of the paws of the bear and out of the paws of the lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand his brothers way more able to do it cuz they were fully grown men in armor wait Saul Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them he says amen there it is they believed it could be done they believed that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them it was revealed to David now there's the difference right there if it's absolutely r reveal to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get well amen you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what what's the odds it may be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you amen so if it's not in here not because it excites you but because it's anchored down in here cuz that remember he said his brothers knew it could be done Saul knew it could be done but it was revealed to David amen and because it was revealed to David he said I'm going to cut your head off this day amen he didn't care he didn't have a sword God had provided a sword that just turned out to be Goliath sword amen that's right Hallelujah so now we we are called to do the same thing you understand you have to speak you have to speak to your situation that's right you understand God has to come anoint you doesn't matter what age you are David wasn't that old amen you understand but that whole battle was the outcome of the battle as I said before I trust this SS in it's because he spoke those words as why it happened that way it happened exactly as David said yeah exactly as David said and so you've got to you know I heard this testimony from from brother Tim PR's Church there was a man there who wanted to go on this Japanese trip but he had no money to do it he wanted to go he felt he felt wanted to go but he had no money to do it and so he goes and and uh he meets this other man he's never met before not even a believer and he begin to tell him how you know you know how they do Mission work and he has a burden to go and this guy said I'm going to pay your trip you know you know I'm going to help fund it and then and then so he said you know should I make a check out to you or to the church what should I do and then he said I'll just make it out to the church and you know and he didn't see him after that and then he goes see and then he goes to see brother Tim he says you know this you know I just had this meeting with this man he says he's gonna help donate for the trip and then he says I don't know yeah but maybe he'll just give like $500 or something and brother Tim says no he's going to pay for your trip and he's going to give us $10,000 to help for the rest of the missionary work and it happened exactly that wayen amen that wasn't him speaking God you understand but it happened but the outcome was what happened came out of his mouth you understand amen hallelujah the same God there and this was not that long ago the same God there is the same God here hallelujah he's still Jehovah Gyra now I want to I just want to read one more scripture maybe if we could have some um um have the musicians come now Paul he was built upon the rock and he said this says in 2 Corinthians 11:23 are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a full I am more remember the same God the very same God in his life is in our lives yeah the same one not in a lesser capacity amen the same God but it's as if God God has to call you personally to whatever it doesn't mean you have to be a missionary to be a housewife to be a work to be whatever it is hallelujah you have to be called you got to know God's called you are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a full I am more and labor is more abundant and Stripes above measure I just want to say this I just it just came to mind when anal and I've told the story hopefully I'll tell it right this time when anal was tongue tied and we prayed I felt de as a post I said Lord before they go on do the operation cuz they had to do an operation on her tongue before they before the surgeon cuts her tongue may the May the surgeon not find the tongue tie there Christine is taking her to the surgery yeah and then you see a bit of blood or something come out mouth she she's still happy and well and then the surgeon goes to open her mouth and tongue ties are very obvious you can see especially bad ones and the surgeon says there's no tongue tie hereall amen what happened God by what that happened cuz I said before the surgeon cuts her tongue amen you say oh that's overseas that's why I about to say this right now what not even conscious what being saying not even feeling anything I said before the surgeon cuts the tongue may not even find a tongue tie and it happened exactly that way amen whatever your move to believe for lay claim on it amen amen he says are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a full Li more and labor is more abundant and Stripes above measure and prisons more frequent and death and deaths of of the Jews now now this is this is his this is Paul's missionary Journeys remember he didn't live on a flowery bed of ease and man is still the same yep of Jews five times I received 40 Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck and a night and a day I have been in the deep and Journeys often in Perils of waters and Perils of robbers and Perils of my own countrymen and perils by the Heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false Brethren and weariness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fast fastings often and cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the church so he's got all this stuff but he's got a burden that the work would go forth who is weak am I not weak who is offended and I burn not if I must needs Glory I will glory of the things which uh concern my infirmities but he said in Acts chapter 2024 but none of these things move me amen here was a man that that's a big list if you just really sit down and just think about it's very easy to read but you really got to think about everything he went through he says but none of these things move me amen hello amen he said God is I i' say I'm not putting the words in his mouth but I say God is his Rock and he knew in whom he believed and that's why he could be victorious he said a Crown of Life is laid up for me death where is thy sting grave where is thy Victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory hallelujah amen because he knew God is his Rock and he even in those circumstances he' speak the word and everything would come under his Dominion
