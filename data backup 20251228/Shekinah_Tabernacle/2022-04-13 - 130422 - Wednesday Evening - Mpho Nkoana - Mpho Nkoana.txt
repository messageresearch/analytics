and i greet you once again in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and um thank you so much musicians and for the music and for just creating the atmosphere for the lord amen i'm just trying to put this watch into a um a counter amen um i'm i'm happy to be in the house of the lord amen amen david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord and then we make a song and we say let us go let us go let us go in the house of the lord don't you sing a song like that so our sled and it was a glad day when you were born it is a that day when you come to the house of the living god you know the god that you are coming to listen the god that is speaking to you and telling you to come to church can i tell you about him it is the god who created the heavens and the earth ah what a privilege brother and sister it is the god who made everything that you can ever imagine that you can ever see he made you and me that's the god we are saving so you're not on the low bench tonight you are on a high bench realize that you are on a high bench amen so having said that i would like you to have it to i would like us to read first in respect of the word of god amen let's read john chapter one and my brother i was trying to think to look at the screen they're hoping that i can see because tonight i'm a bit disorganized i'm a bit disorganized in the sense that i didn't send my my document to a powerpoint because it's usually bigger so i was i'm going to rely on the weight document that i've put but i'm hoping that um i will see amen i hope that i'm going to see but you don't need to panic so i'd like us to read the book of john chapter one john chapter one and we'll read it and then we will see down amen that's our subject on the board there tonight and the title is upon thy confession that is the title upon thy confession whose confession your one my confession upon my confession and our subject line is that the power of a heartily confession that's the line of thought that i would like us to to follow that's the line of thought that i would like the thought that i want us to just to flow you know when the river flows you know and it flows and and you can see it when you on your in the aeroplane you can see a river going you know like it's following a line of thought of god so that's the line of thought i want us to think the power there is power in your confession so that's what we are going to speak about after reading this scripture right it says the bible here in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen verse two am i oh yeah sorry i made a mistake so i want us that will read john chapter one is down the line but that's genesis it's because i couldn't see i'm sorry i apologize apologize uh on the on the video line with the video length and some something said to me john reminds me of genesis the lord was trying to tell me no no no no no go read genesis so if you can magnify it a little bit further then then i'll see unless if you don't mind i'm gonna read here that's much better a little more one more thank you i can see much better now it's because i'm not young anymore now genesis 1 john chapter 1 is also our main scripture but i want us to start with genesis it says the bible in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth right where in the beginning and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now there's verse three that's what i want you to look at and god said listen listen to this god said god he speaks god is starting to confess i want you to follow the thought god starts to confess now uh and he and god said let there be light you see that's what god said and then it says end there was light you see god confessed and then something happened what god confessed it happened amen let's just buy our hearts and pray our heavenly father lord jesus i know there's nothing that i can say that can save anyone but my father your weight is eternal life your weight is so powerful that father right now each one of us can take it and confess it lord and we can receive what we're asking make us to believe your weight lord take our our coming here and make it beneficial for us to ask coming here make make it make it further beneficial to that one who press that streaming and is busy following the service with us that one sitting in their little place alone somewhere father joining in the service with your children bless them father we just want to commit your weight into your hands lord all those that could not make it as well bless them father be be their portion as well lord jesus christ we just want to ask these things humbling ourselves in your presence in the name of our lord jesus christ amen you may enjoy the comfort of your seed of your seeds now verse 3 is it i want you to think about vestry along our title god said you see to to let's just go down a little bit brother ben and then we have already read john i wouldn't mind to read it again it's such a wonderful piece of scripture in the beginning was the word you see and then we can see because god in genesis chapter one he said when you say something you speak a word isn't it even brother daniel when you speak you speak a word that is why john there says in the beginning was the wait because it was that that's what that is what was there at the beginning god the word spoke right that's what happened in the beginning was that wait and the word was with god and the word was god so the word spoke at the beginning the word spoke you know to confess is to is to to speak to profess we'll see as we go along is to profess i would like you to follow me i'm going to give you a quick one then we are done but i would like you not to lose me along the way is to profess is to speak now many times when we say speak we are only thinking about verbalizing it you know with our mouth you see but but you see there's so many things that communicate in us around us there's so many things that we do and communicate and and actually speak in them without even verbalizing them in our hearts in our minds with our actions so there's so much that we are confessing sometimes away sometimes and away yeah are we together so so that is the thinking that i would like us to follow but at the beginning was the way let's read romans romans chapter 10 hallelujah you can see today um i'm i'm a little bit relaxed so i said to my i said take it easy so that's what i'm going to try to do to allow the lord you know to speak the way he wants to speak romans chapter 10 let's read from verse 8. i just want to see if i can tie these three scriptures just to link them up with thought now it says here from verse eight but what sayeth eat what sayeth it the word is naidi you know who knows the meaning of the weight nigh it's nearer isn't it it's close right the weight the weight which weight huh his weight right that the weight there's no difference from the way that the lord spoke at the beginning when he said let there be there's no difference between the word that is spoken by john when he says in the beginning was the word and there's no difference between this word that paul is saying to the romans here and me and you that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth now listen and in thy heart i like that this is what i was just trying to tell you now and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach you see that way which we preach which is the weight of faith ah did god use faith at the beginning yeah ah can you see now so that word is naidi even hindi and in thai are we together now that is the word which we preach it is the word of faith verse 9 that if thou shalt confess man i like this if thou shalt confess you see now now that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus shall be and shall believe in thine heart that god had raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved let's just pause you know when you're traveling on a journey like like the clowns went to taopo there comes a point in your journey when you pause and you say okay let's put petrol and then we buy some mcdonald's we are passing you see but there's one thing that you are also doing and when you are on that journey and you pause like we are posting now on this verse you are not thinking about where you are coming from yeah huh i've never it's very rare that when you are traveling on a journey you are your discussions in the car are about where you are coming from of course there may be discussions about where we are coming from maybe we forgot something but the primary discussion of the or the primary communication is about where we are going i can hear brother ben asking sister christine lavi when we left there did when we left home on friday did you end the close for the kids for school tomorrow i can hear him i can i can i can hear them andy and ron when travelling maybe to live in in the morning saying oh yesterday i wonder if i lock those doors and they think today they are not saying uh no no the very little of the discussion can talk about did you make the bed when you left home they are talking about where they are going because there is a day ahead of them you see now when you wake up in the morning and you are on a journey of your daily journey you are thinking of your day ahead very little if if not nothing you are going to say oh let me just think about yesterday now okay what happened yesterday how is that going to benefit you you are thinking of the destination where you are going and that's how and what we are doing right now on this journey what brings me to that point what brings me to that point is that now and i don't know what brought me to that point but because i love this verse so much is that that if thou shalt confess with your mouth the lord jesus and sorry with thy mouth the lord jesus that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus you confess him with your mouth and shall believe in thine heart that god had raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved so what if i don't confess where will my salvation be if i don't confess will i be saved we shall see verse 10 for with the heart men believe unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto did you hear that now your salvation my salvation is not just a an automatic incident it's a process in this process of doing a number of things of coming to a level of maturity of doing so many things in this process confession is one of those are we together because if you can't confess okay i'll ask you a question if god at the beginning he just thought about these things that are in his mind and he knows he's a heel he wants to be a healer and then everything about himself he knows right and then he never confessed he never spoke do you think that would have been creation right now god had to speak it doesn't mean he doesn't believe in his word no no god had to speak because confessing is part and parcel of salvation right so god had to do that now now we can just go down again brother man and see and just read the last one hebrews chapter 3 yes thank you and read hebrews chapter three are we going to hebrews chapter three are you or are you depending on my document god bless you that's still all right hebrews chapter three thank you and let's read one because you see the bible says here wherefore holy brethren am i among the scriptures yes wherefore brethren holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high consider the apostle and the high priest of our profession jesus christ christ jesus you see the prophet taught us that profession is is translated in confession you see when you hear let's not talk about but when when when you pro when you profess when you con you're confessing something right profess is translated in confession right and i want us to go down a little bit again sorry my brothers today i'm gonna give you full-time work i thought i could just fold my hands here like like brother ben no you know there's people who who who copied one of the brand name you know when he works like this they also so so i i'm sure i won't get i'm working on the right footsteps every other bit now if i fold that now let's just unpack that with confession they say from the greek is an original word that came from the greek and the word confess it is this they say they say a homologio homologio if you can just a little bit more one more just extend it zoom zoom it up sorry and homologio homo homologio sorry homologio meaning to say the same thing to say the same thing and then agree admit acknowledge all right that is the meaning of the word homologio i'm not talking about hormonal lady who knows hormonal lady i'm talking about homologio it means to say the same thing then agree admit acknowledge they say the emphatic the emphatic meaning of the word you know otherwise the more emphasized and more stronger meaning of the word homologio is exomological [Laughter] yeah that's in greek that's the emphatic meaning of the word homologio so they say is it means to promise to consent to admit confess or acknowledge huh from this praise right to this to to praise right so homologio that is now the bottom one homologio uh from a comp of the base in in three three six seven four and and all those years and then there is like a covenant to acknowledge to confess to profess see the prophet said it the prophet it's not the prophet here this is the this is the greeks and the dictionary and dr google but the prophet also already said it that to profess confession made give thanks promise now if we unpack this weight you see there's a lot loaded in this weight with that in mind that means to confess has got so much to do with our day-to-day living [Music] confession has got a lot to do with our day-to-day living because if i'm going to admit to agree to acknowledge to say the same thing how many times do we do that on a daily basis even now me and you are busy agreeing admitting acknowledging or not technology right now she's sitting there confession is busy taking place are we together let's go down brother ben now it just depends you see confession has got the upside of it and the downside upstream low stream i'm still talking about the upstream there is the downstream of it where the devil comes to eve and confess things you see that's the downstream that's the bad part of confession now what makes confession alive and successful in the life of a believer or what makes confession successful in anyone's life in any person think of good good confessions bad confessions but what makes it really successful what brings it to pass is when you believe in it think about this do you think uh i wanted to bring but the example that i wanted to give you it was not so appropriate but the point is this that if you believe in something and you confess it it comes to pass in other words your confession right your confession is activated by the amount of faith that you put in no use to confess something and if you don't believe in it because it will never come to pass you understand it won't come to pass because you don't believe it that means confession starts actually from the inside confession in other words is not just a verbal mouth thing isn't it the bible says out of their hearts yes doesn't the bible says god does not look at what much not much what i say on the lips no god looks at the confession from inside you'll see now as we go along now what makes confession successful is when you believe in it or you put to put it differently when you believe that what you confess that's what makes confession to be successful are we together yes are we believing together don't doesn't matter much from your mouth as compared to your heart it is important what you say from your mouth i agree but it is not believed it is not supported by this operational man called faith how is it going to pass it is just vapor right it's just excitement ah it's just feelings right huh it's just to pass time huh so you don't want to live a life where you are just passing time you want to to believe in what you are confessing if you say i believe in jesus christ believe in it don't just say it believe in what you say believe it because it must be coming from the heart otherwise that's what the prophet isaiah said oh this my people that they're out of out they just talk to me about their from their lips but from their hearts they are not they are far away from me i'm going to read for you as we go along so as we go along our nation is very short tonight but i want us to go down just to somewhere right and pause there the prophet someone says but the lord said unto someone look not on his countenance this is the story of choosing the king of israel you know the story right now he was saying the lord saying to someone no remember someone was the prophet but he was also a human being god tells him don't look at the outside don't look at the countenance or on the height of his teacher but i have refused him for the lord seeth not as a man see it for men look at on the outward appearance but the lord looked on the heart you see god does not does not worry much about the outside appearance which we spend so much time decorating oh yes brother i must just talk to you properly even when the brothers come here to the pulpit they change the work when the brothers go when they go for a communion everyone is humble just hug your wife the children are together oh lord this is holiness but god does not actually look at god that is important as long as it comes from there is that confession you know when i hold my whole family and many times we just want to make sure that the pastor my friends and the family and we can say oh that's your humble brother look how he's holding his wife oh look how he's greeting that brother oh god bless you my father which is good but it must come from there otherwise god is not looking at it doesn't shake god it doesn't move god you are just performing now performance must be supported by all right are we together brothers and sisters when i say i love you my brother i must mean it yes and i must believe in it i'm confessing love unto thee right when i say i love you oh god bless you my brother i must be meaning it otherwise i'm wasting your time otherwise i'm wasting whose time my own time otherwise that is just vapor otherwise i'm a hippo finish it up right now and a god that's not like a pretending heart yeah god does not like your pretending heart no god hates it a proud heart a pretending heart a hypocritical heart god hates it it's better to say i don't believe you hey brother i don't like you because of this this this this let's talk it please then we talk yeah then it's done then i realized i get a new revelation i get the real revelation that actually i love you so it is better that way but many times we just want to polish it up you know oh yeah oh god bless you man of god oh yeah you know just polish but that's okay but it must come from the heart otherwise that confession is meaningless you are putting effort on the wrong thing the efforts should be on your true confession because you are about to take over you are preparing for your destination if you are preparing for your destination why you want to talk about things that are not real why are you telling me about uh in the cargo when i'm going to vanguard right why if i'm going to wangaray tell me about phangare tell me about the rules there tell me about the science don't tell me about don't waste my time telling me about in vicar i'm not going there i'm going to hungary when the time comes for me to go to indicator we'll talk about invokage the two thing must be what i'm saying from my heart and i want to emphasize on this why because god does not value what you are saying on the outside god does not care much about the countenance about the race about your your your how you station that you look i can go and lift and pump those things at the gym god doesn't look at those i can leave myself to be hopeless and just be unfit which is bad but still god does not look at that i'm not saying don't go to the gym or go to the gym i'm just saying god does not look at pastors at the countenance should we then rather just live anyhow no you should live according to the word of god because the word of god is the one that is going to guide you how oh it will say okay go to the gym god god will guide you whether you go to the gym or not he'll get you whether your weight is okay the way it is oh no it's okay you don't have to lose my sister you're okay he will tell you are we together god is able to do that he was the first person to confess all right let's go down my brothers he's worried he's concerned about what is in the heart they a strong link between the heart and the mouth the heart and mouth link there's a problem when you say something from your mouth but your heart is not saying the same thing ah then there's a problem that that that the mouth says something and the heart says something or the heart says something the mouth what this is that's the contradiction you see we don't like we don't want to live a life of contradiction we want that because because matthew says that these people draw it nigh unto me with their mouth and honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me that's a problem there must be an alignment there must be a collaboration between what is being said on the heart and what is being said in there will you be all right if you just plant a tree an apple tree and then when you are supposed to harvest your harvesting oranges will you be alright with that it cannot be it's against all the rules i don't want to say the rules of nature but it's against the nature of god what you see god what he says is what he means and the god hasn't got the time to say no no no i was just joking no god hasn't everything that god does is serious i'm not saying god he's a shrewd man who says hey i'm sick no no god he's a wonderful handsome and a wonderful man but what whatever he says if he looks at you with a smile and he says i love you he's serious about that he means it and that is what the reality that's the confession he is saying upon you right because there's a strong link between the mouth and the heart and if they start not to say the same thing there is a problem something is in between there that needs to be removed are we are we together god bless you ben and maggie welcome now now let's go on with it and verse 10 it says oh yeah let me finish verse eight verse nine but in vain they do worship me touching for a teaching for doctrines and the commandments of men right and he called he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goes into the mouth divided a mouth but that was coming out of their mouth you followed a man sorry it's not it's not much that goes into the mouth that divided a man but that wish it comes out uh we understand that verse but what i want to to think about is that the confession that i make can be can give life or it can destroy and that's that's that's why it's important that there's a link strong positive link between the heart and the mouth the confession because both the heart confess and the mouth speaketh it out or my actions or whatever i do speaking so there must be that link a strong one right let's go to isaiah 29 brother ben sorry i'm preaching with my back today wherefore the lord said first for as much as these people draw near near me with their mouth drawing near to god with your mouth i don't want that lord please my father and i with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far but have removed their heart far from me and their feet and and their fear toward me is taught by the percept of men by the precept that's a bad condition brother andy that's how powerful confession is confession can come out and it's not from the heart i don't know if there can be a wrong confession in the heart or can be a good con there can be a good confession from the heart and a wrong confession coming out or a good confession or what's the opposite of it bad confession from the heart and a good one coming out or a good and a bad that's possible i don't know if that's possible it's possible but now that's that's that's the warning that god was as i was telling this these people of israel and that was said also in matthew that ah you are worshipping me just with your lips your heart is not there why is that important for confession because out of the heart the mouth speaketh should speak ideally right let's just go down a little bit brother ben now you see if we pause there on that paragraph i wrote the title there that 95 percent truth five percent lie the prophet taught us he said the la the lie that came that satan told eve was 90 90 oh i said he said 90 i put five i i did it i wanted to write 90 ninety percent tooth eh the devil confessed truth ninety percent of it because he knows that he you know your heart can confess ninety percent truth and a five percent lie we must be able to confess hundred percent truth and be the one that comes out i used to write chickens in my previous life in south africa and they applaud there at the lord what do you call here what did they call it live life lifestyle lifestyle blog i used to have chickens at one point we had 250 chickens just for eating just for fun so now if a chicken was laying eggs and it brews over them 20x imagine you find this ambitious with a lot of eggs it lays them and then just two chicks hedges just two chicks and it was sitting on them for 21 days that chicken must go to the pot it must go directly to that pot because firstly we should have eaten those eggs given the believers at church to eat or it would have increased the chickens in the farm but now it wastes time it sits on those eggs and and they never they never hatch and why in the first place they did had to lay so many eggs if it can't cover them that chicken goes to the pot a heart must must confess hundred percent truth and the mouth bring same hundred percent not a percentage half person no no hundred percent now that's what the prophet says that what the otherwise we become like the devil otherwise we come and tell 90 percent truth and god never told 90 percent truth god always told hundred percent the moment you find yourself did you hear the pastor preaching about lies the moment you find yourself saying ah no no i i didn't mean all right you might need to watch out you need to be careful mama chanted isn't it i need to be careful that what i'm confessing is hundred percent otherwise i must shut up otherwise i must keep quiet because i don't i don't mean 100 i mean 90. you see so i must go back to my heart before i even tell you that i'm sorry when i'm not sorry i must go back to my heart and say am i sorry i'm not saying sorry meaningfully 100 when i say sorry to you i must mean sorry not sorry but but what but what there's nobody in god hundred percent or nothing the devil is the only one who says who reasons he reasons he when you go to university they say they analyze they tell you to take the statement you know they just tell you okay analyze this mic meaning they say reason reason with this mic this mic is good and it was made in japan and it can do this and can do that but it's not so good because you see you're listening that's university that's the devil that's king are we together god says this mic is good period oh this mic is bad period he's got no time for analysis critically evaluated no he's got that time for those things the devil has got time for compare and contrast ah that's the university language please apply your mind on this apply my what in the word of god apply my mind i believe it and say it and uh and the lie that you can tell how i've heard men bypass pieces of the scripture just to keep from it has their theology you see see but if if if this part is right that part's right let's put it together and make it fit through the whole bible now in the beginning when god you see then he continues to point where a minister ministering in front of the believers when he finds that oh that basis he's him oh i just i just i just passed there quickly because the bible is saying to me hey pratham paul here speak it loud then i say okay let's rush you need to finish now huh because it's not fitting with my with what i don't want to take correction from the lord that's the problem let's go down again i'll read for you some more golden nuggets from god in his people now the gift doesn't heal no one all right the gift doesn't heal no one a gift the gift is not for healing the gift is not for healing no more than a gospel preacher is sent for saving he can't save anyone he can preach under the power to bring people to a knowledge of the way of the of the word of god and come to their and and the word of god and come do their confessing and god does the saving is that right that's the same thing isn't it he he's got a sign god is the only one i preach the gospel people come to the point of confession yeah i can't save you i can't heal you the gift is there but what is the purpose of a gift if you never come to a point of confessing your healing right happy you need to confirm isn't it you need to confess and say ah what you are saying is true right yes the problem when he was asking the people when he was praying for them he was praying for them and he says this this this about your life is it true sister do you believe the lord jesus christ you need to to be part of the confession you must confirm and say yes i believe yes it's true because words of confession when they are said from the hand are powerful they make miracles they make they activate the sign they activate the gift the gift can't work alone are we together let's go down a little bit we just we just relax isn't it and they have done pretty near but they can't that's that's as far as they can go but now you come to the lord jesus to heal you but come confessing your faith in him come confessing my brother come but come confess it come confessing to the lord because the minister whoever can do nothing even us we can pray pray pray for my brother of course we must pray but all we are doing i i if you for the revelation i can even pray for you when i'm praying that god help my sister or my brother to confess your weight help her to confess lord that's what you know the bible says we must be wise to be wise is to be it's not to be clever you know to be clever that they say this is a clever child it's good to beat level ribbon isn't it but we must also be wise the bible says you must be wise and a wise person it's not the person who always wants to win all right no no is there a person who is oriented towards the solution right now you see that there's a situation here that you are struggling with and then this situation you can't seem to overcome it right but now uh at the same time you don't you don't seem to to be praying for that situation and you're not investigating and asking the lord why am i not coming to a point of praying for this situation i mean why do i not come to the point of praying for this problem that i have so that my situation can go and the devil can make a long list of you without you realizing that wait i am i've got a situation i'm not praying about it and i don't know why i'm not praying about it but i'm not praying about why i'm not praying about it huh you need to be wise if there's a the lord said ask anything yeah if you've got a situation and you can't overcome it and you find that ah but it's a problem for me but i'm not praying about it okay why can't you pray for this not praying about it pray for this not praying about it to go so that you can pray for this situation to go isn't it so the devil wants to to to to entangle you in some misunderstanding and you find that you just say i don't know what's the pro you know yes you know that the problem is that this situation won and you are not giving enough time to pray for it why are you not giving enough problems i mean time to pray for this what you need to be doing you do is to ask lord help me to be able to come to my knees because i am not coming to my knees and that disturbs me getting rid of that situation because how can god help you if you don't confess let's move on a bit pray for the problem of the problem and the problem of the problems problem so that can all go right if you are not being able to play surely one of your concerns should be why am i not praying what is causing me not to pray and you pray for that thing to go and there might be an ape and what do you call an enabler to that thing that is causing you not to play you you know when you kill an amalekite is it an amalekite you don't kill just the elders yes the whole you need to cut and that's the problem of aiken that's what he did he didn't have bad revelation that a problem of a problem can become a problem and another that doesn't make it that this problem linked to this one it actually affects the whole picture like brother andy says we must always know the bigger picture what is the bigger picture and what is causing the bigger picture not to work there are some so many things that are linked to many things too many things and the devil made you get lost in those single them out yes out out out they must all die their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and their relatives and and their friends if possible they must all die of the lord there was no amount of sympathy that the prophet of god was going to say don't kill them who was that man who said akin who was who was the pro the man of god at that time bible reader joshua there was no amount of sympathy that was going to be given to aiken and his family no because this is life and death the problem of a problem must be identified and i say okay this is my problem i've got temper all right all right that's the problem clear one amalekite okay can i get rid of this timber no it has been bothering me for three four years that's the problem he doesn't want to die what is causing this chamber not to die oh i find that oh lord i i like being upset and temperament nah that's another i love it one side you're going to kill them one by one lord before we even talk talk of temper i found that i like it a lot sure okay why do you like it you see the grandchild is coming now everything from them must die the grandchildren everything otherwise we become bacons pray for the problem of the problems problem in their older cousins let's go down my brother sarah you see sarah made a confession in her heart yeah by laughing and out of bed she created another amalekite by saying i did not laugh you see you see how confession how confession becomes uh we say oh sister you laugh why are you laughing he said no no i did not okay let's say sarah maybe did not know didn't have the revelation that that's that's malik he said visiting abraham but why why if our sarah maybe i would have said ah i don't know i was i was just amazed and that could also be a lie because i laughed so sarah loved and when and the lord says why why why did you say you know what always amazes me is the lord brother daniel did not ask him the bible says and he turned to abraham and said why did sarah laugh i always i asked myself why why didn't the lord say sarah why are you laughing the lord instead said to abraham why is sarah lovey i wonder what abraham said and sarah he's the one who said no i didn't love okay let's read the story therefore sarah loved within herself within herself from there she laughed after i am worked old shall i have a pleasure my lord being oh she knew that's not that that's not the law being all old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore this sarah saying shall i do shall i of a surely bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord is there anything to have for the lord bring them all amen all of them identify them one day the pastor gave us a task i don't know who is still doing it he said do you have a paper and a pen and write write them your knees because the devil you see the devil is like this you know the parable of a sower about this is where the soil went out and so some fell on the good ground sun fell on the background on the wheaty ground they fell everywhere some of the wisdom the devils some of them they fell on the good ground but the base came and picked them up that the devil is that dead when the word of god goes out he's got a thing of wanting to pick it up while he's still fresh and you find that you can't even tell us what was the pastor preaching about two weeks ago why he first removed the affection brother andy the interest he removed that thing and he said if you find that you've got no interest you've got no affection to the word of god but you've got affection to mr youtube then that's that's another item for you to be praying for isn't it pray for your fingers not to touch there don't come now preach it because it's an amalek height if i find that her if we just analyze everybody and then we come sunday morning brother ben we we put the screen there we are now connecting connects that we start with the pasta we connect we analyze you now we see the amount of time you spend on the word now we are going to see things on the screen there yeah that's the analysis the word of god is doing you don't have to plug anyone on the screen the word of god just displays it in your heart allow the screen of the lord to show allow it don't plug it allow the screen analysis of the lord to show that yes lord but don't don't be careful be with the lord yes right because the daniel has got the tendency of lynching in there when you and the lord are communing the devil can do so that's why when we pray we invite the lord we don't just start off by praying and just shoot this in order yes that the spirit puts for you to pray you see to a point where the lord said to them when you pray dude say you say they say you said when you pray the lord put the lord's prayer not necessarily our father who had in heaven no no the lord's prayer of your of you for that day the lord puts it and the spirit prays through you that's when you are able to know that you praise the lord and tell him how big he is and praise him and worship him and never forget to say lord forgive me and never forget to say lord as i'm starting to pray come now because i by myself i can't talk that's right that's the order isn't it now you just start by saying oh lord and i want them to say this lord like brother andy i never even told the lord how big he is but i already won the message i never told the lord that i am sorry lord during the day i shouted at my daughter i never said that i never went to my daughter to say you know what please before i go to pray can you forgive me i didn't speak to you well i never even went there but i already said lord i want to pay rise please father you are my god i want pay rise for my work is that how to ask the lord god wants to be recognized that he is god because he is god glory right yeah i may be deviating let's go down here a little bit sarah laughed that was part of her confession and she did not want to to agree yeah you see god the bible says and i'm finishing god at the beginning think about john john 1 huh think about john 1 that we read god at the beginning was his weight he confessed himself right and then things came to pass now you and your confession are one you become your confession what do you say what you breathe what do you water what you put menu on every day you become thing what you say water from your mouth meaningfully not meaningfully from your heart meaningfully not meaningfully but you are busy watering it every day lord make me aware when people are motoring the wrong thing lord make me aware my father that i'm watering a wrong thing i'm not aware lord the devil wants to take advantage of me watering something wrong and away lord expose it so that lord it can go away i can water the right thing every day what am i confessing every day right because you and your confession becomes one you are your weight god was his weight the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was god was with god and the word was there was no contradiction what was in his mind he spoke it out and it happened exactly that way right now but they mean oh sorry i wrote here that you see some some people some of us the devil put this a weak point where what we say is not what we mean [Music] you know you know politicians i'll speak low but they mustn't hear us that's a good example of wrong confessions that's why they never they never they say something else but they do something else or they say something else meaning something else that's the nature of politics that's why the prophet said he said it is rotten politics i don't advise you to be a counselor or or go to beehive no no don't do that i don't advise you to get a career in there because the prophet that it is rotten politics it's written children don't want to become a politician no it's a wrong trend not wrong in the sense that it does not help us but the moment you land in there how is the holy ghost going to operate if if you are operating on a rotten thing the prophet said is rotten so as believers we don't encourage our children to go and be i want my child to be a minister a behind a minister happen to be a minister you must first join a political party to be a political party you must buy and confess into their philosophy and confess and buy in into their printer principles which you don't know where they come from who started them when you've got your own principles here when you you have already confessed in these principles and these principles are contradicting to those principles no no don't be ministers be ministers of the way we want them to be ministers of the way let them be engineers still better pilots let them be those are approved let them go and feed the tires and they do and let them be rather but don't i wouldn't advise children to be politicians even you adults don't walk where they are at run away in other ways don't get the spirit of politics yeah yeah it comes in different forms and shapes this thing is the one that makes me to speak about politicians of saying something that you don't mean so we need to be conscious to your confession be alert led be aware look at it and be aware what are you saying the bible says be sober right now let's go down a bit now perhaps eighty percent or ninety percent of the audience tonight will be christians well then if you got in your mind that you wasn't a christian any longer and you will quit confessing that that's what was that you you was a christian you got dropped out out of the picture because that's what you're confessing you keep on you believe it you confess it that you are not and you will be not is your right hebrews 3 1 he is the high priest of your confession he's the high priest of our confession he's interceding for us in other words he's making intercessions upon our confession i like it when when the prophet says what we are confessing that he is that that's what he's confessing that we are you see when we confess things about him he is confessing through the intercession that we are he's an intercessor he's well you're confessing the truthful thing his word he is also confessing before the father about you so it closes the whole loop the lord is not quite the intercession it means that you say lord forgive me father i love you lord before the father says father he loves you oh lord forgive him i don't even see take his sin i i died for him he's my daughter he's my son what you are confessing not not not not not wrong things confessing them from your heart not about your sister or your brother or about the situation complaining and murmuring about it god said these guys they must die they are murmuring and i don't like a murmuring heart [Music] he wants me and you to confess the weight the more we confess the word he is confessing the word upon us through his intercession then we become we can sweat we become his weight right making intercept making intercession on our behalf i'm sure the prophet wanted to say that let's go down and finish up with that one brother ben now now notice oh yeah we found read that one eh but that's from a different meaning i mean it's just an addition it's just you know you know you know when you put bread and butter you put bread in butter then you just put peanut butter on top that's the peanut so that's that's the topic man he is the high priest of your confession you get what i mean do you get it he is amen therefore what i'm confessing you must know what you must ask yourself what is the lord going to be confessing before the father about me therefore is very critical that what i confess should be in line with the way what i'm saying what i'm asking because here on the other side the intercessor the high priest of our confession standing before the father to intercede for me and for you he's saying things what must he say what must he say because you are saying if you are saying a wrong confession don't say wrong confession from your heart from your mind from your mouth say the right one yes say the right ways eh likes to hit you right any man will never leave anybody okay what am i saying here you get what i mean what you confess you are that's what you are i didn't put it in bold brothers and sisters any man will never live any further or any higher than what he believes he is living if you want to live too shallow you become shallow yeah if you want to live in christ jesus in heavenly places you become you don't worry about the noise of the squirrels here and this and that no that's wrong confession heavenly places yes the sister do this to you you draw a big circle she cuts you out of the second you draw a bigger one love her more love your brother and your sister more unconditional that's the confession of a believer when you confess that that's how that's why confession is so important let's go down my brother and finish off here i'm gonna just give you a little exercise you know i love teaching i should have been a teacher here i'll give you a little exercise i've got given you example then you're going to say other examples you see confession must be supported by action you'll see now i'm gonna read for you supported i mean supported by an action i cannot confess that oh my lord my savior you healed you healed me and then i says oh yeah you hit me lord i must stand up hey man you know what the prophet did one time he ate that food he tried to come up he pushed it back glory that's how faith works that's how action of your confession works that's right don't wait for the angels to come they're coming you act on your confession you found the right part of the lord you are you you find everything is in place all your dogs are in a row now it's time for you to act upon your confession david actions you know them he went and picked up the stones he actually confessed first he said you i'm going to cut your head you today right now they said what is this boy he says you can translate [Laughter] david he made a confession and then he made an action abraham who in their right mind you see the confession our confession according to the word of god is not in the right mind according to the world it's in our right heavenly mind because you know that the bible says brother ben that god's mind is completely opposite from this earthly mind just like the east is from the west hebrew the baby that's what the bible says so we work according to the mind of amen that is why we can believe that this man and this woman can have a child at 90 years old another 100. moses he confessed and that happened the egyptians that you see you shall see them no more amen there was a point where moses made a little mistake and instead of speaking confessing he cried yeah god said why you cry confess don't cry fast speak and you must believe it amen remember it goes with you you mustn't just say it i want you to get this it's not just about confessing it only no no it must be believed i must say from here believing it and i confess it speak to the sea don't cry i mean to the rock what was he crying for moses he was crying god said no moses until the prophet made it a title of samuel why cry speak but some of us it looks like sometimes we say why speak cry you mustn't do that no no no no no we must not cry speak wisdom this man confessed he said never give up never give up no you see but what kind of mentalities bring the mentality of victory if you never give up it means even if your your food get chopped never give up there's a song that we sing big in africa we say please never never give up amen oh please never never give we'll sing it after here i'll sing it for you winston churchill said that that was a word of confession he didn't see himself defeated he said never give up never give up never give up if you never give up what do you do you never give up you go forward you win no no no cut my head if possible i'm not gonna give up amen one day another lady i used to work with is a bad example she said you know me if my husband catches me doing something wrong even if he saw me i'll until the night can you hear this person believes in what they say they say they what they say they mean it i'll still refuse all right so what prevents us from being from being believers to say to the devil never the devil i told you one time that even if the devil tells you the truth tell him you are still alive never believe the truth from the devil never tell him you are still a liar otherwise you make him god all right you make the devil a true speaker if the devil says you are beautiful say you're lying only god can tell me i'm beautiful if he says you you are beautiful you say devil get thee behind me yes it is written only here only my god not you i don't even entertain that statement oh you're hi what's your name oh you're beautiful i'm what come now i'm coaching the angels now don't take it rebecca i'm not beautiful in your approach my dad my mom my god will tell me i'm pretty don't tell me i'm pretty amen come down that's true if you're a sister and you go to work and then another man says oh today you are beautiful say no no my husband already told me amen thank you my husband already [Laughter] and smile [Laughter] oh you're handsome you're handsome as a brother and you take compliments like that confessions from from jester bells oh brother oh today today what my wife already told me let's close up with this one am i finished i can't believe that why is confession so important and i think that's our closing paragraph you see confession is so important because we see the outcomes of confession when we see the outcomes of confession that's when we realized that oh it's so important either the good ones or the bad ones you see when i grew up with unbelievers in a rural village they they used to tell us that you know if you say something to someone one millennial in other words you are what can you help me laugh you know what when you say oh brother man you know you just say something wrong to brother all the time like not in a bad way but yourself negative big negative perception and i keep on reiterating to you i'm actually predicting nothing upon you and it will happen because i'm making you to believe that and i keep on saying that and i keep on saying that you must shut me and say no brother correct me cut that thing off because it's a wrong confession any people who say that until your child believes in that until they become like that you keep on confessing them that they are useless when they are not tell them they are useful when they do a stupid thing say you are clever and give them a weeping while you are telling them that level that one don't ever preserve it the bible said so the pastor can vouch for me if you don't want to whip your children with love you are not fulfilling the scripture with love you see with an attitude that is godly you can't confess anger on your children no confess love my boy how does it feel i won't do it again if you don't do it okay come touch your toes you see but you must do it with love right you become what you confess you and your testimony becomes one i'm just summarizing i wanted to give you a task but the time is finished i wanted you to tell me the examples of the actions that were given as a result of the testimony you know they they they they're there you've got plenty of them they're supposed to be on our on the tips of our tongue the previous part that we're looking at i gave you for example and i was i was about to say another action can you give me an action that joshua who made and who confessed with an action in the bible anyone just was still thinking brother daniel who joshua who else brother production aiken he can confess a wrong thing but what he did came to pass because they told him that they killed them good example you see that's why when the word preaches we don't only show you the good side we saw the dangerous part of wrong confession noah sorry i'm just putting everyone on the spot but you know those we've got a cloud of witnesses who confessed and it came to pass right let's go down so we'll do that exercise next time when we say you you you you they just come out right let's go down further i think this is the last stanza your wealth becomes a living high priest is to make intercession upon we already pass professions and confessions is the same translation that's what i was trying to tell at the beginning that's what the prophet and there is there he is sitting at the right hand of the father making intercessions upon our confessions he's not just making intercessions he's making intercessions upon what we confess how can the lord be making intercessions on what we are not saying right we are not praying we are not asking we are not doing anything but we want the lord to intercede because the lord must intercede what we are saying our lives that we are giving the lord is interesting saying no lord they are justified they are just can you hear them lord you see now he cannot heal you he cannot save you and do it and do one thing for you until first you accept it and believe it and confess it that's the truth my brother you need to come to a point where it's not just confessing accepting it believing it confessing it the least goes on and on but confession is what we are focusing on tonight because there's power in there that's right you've got to confess it no not you got to feel it you you got to confess it he's not the high priest of your feelings he's not the high priest of your he's the high priest of your confession that's right what you confess you can finish up the missing way what you confess you can finish you know that when it's primary school they say feel in the missing way there i become what i confess anyone can say anything there right i want us to stop there tonight but i wanted i wanted to go a bit slow so that it can sink in about this aspect this teaching of the power of your confession right and understanding that confession it means that's what i'll become that's what i'll get that's what the lord says about me before the throne of god so many things around the world the confession part right and we saw at the meaning of confession it's got a lot to do with what you say you know if you want some some connection we can take each one to the doctor to have a pipe directly from the heart to the mouth so that what you know a direct connection from the heart and the lord is doing the same confessing about me and about you what we are confessing to him that's what their relationship is all about we confess things to one another i never had a man and a woman who always confess things that way but they're still together stuck together you see mike and men they're confessing to each other sorry to use you isn't it beautiful they confess things to one another which we may not even understand you see because there's love there's a relationship there oh you know what no no your room is going to be that way oh no this this you see they confess things to one another that's what us and a lord jesus christ do it's about us and christ everything that you see here on earth is about us and christ therefore you play a very pivotal pivotal part not even in the economy of this world in the economy of heaven bigger scheme of things are we together brethren can we clap hands for the [Applause] daniel lord i went a little bit below my analysis last time said i was on the one hour mark today i went 14 minutes above but i'll improve i'll improve what song did i say i promise to sing for you oh please never it needs to take left hands for me give up oh please never never give up please never never give up please never never give up listen to this oh there are many oh please never [Music] never give up oh please never never give up you see now this song is so easy to see just those two sentences that's it you just need to confess it just sing it you see he says those words and that rhythm of course we can get musicians to put the right key i'll fit in they put the right key and we sing that song just a repetitive song it's so easy isn't it mama mama landy it's so easy right let's let's let's give it a try let's side with that it's a key with the willington key the correct not an african key a wellington key right i want someone with a willington voice or let's say a kiwi voice to to bring us the proper way just studied sister for us okay [Music] otherwise i would i would i got different hundred keys give me a second please [Music] never you must never never [Music] but you must never never never oh my brother oh all night because the life of a believer is a life of not giving up doesn't matter whether the devil kicks this way or that way we understand by the revelation of the word of god that there are many mountains to climb and there are many rivers to cross and there are there's a lot of seas to swim in but you must never give up i like that that speech that winston churchill made amen amen let's just uh be reverent now and pray brother daniel i'm gonna ask you to come just to close the service in prayer for us please and among us there could be a is this one working brotherhood among us as we are let's be reverend before god you know let's be reverent and just bow your heart before god close your eyes lift up your hearts and your hands there are knees among us brother and then those knees must come to pass and we want to confess them tonight there are people who are not well there are desires there are expectations among us we want them to come we want to pray for all the barriers and obstacles that the enemy comes and bring them into our lives if that is the case lift up your hand boldly before the lord as my brother prays the lord has already answered you i believe it amen [Music] yes my father my king lord jesus [Music] hallelujah confess lord not what we think of ourselves lord but just what you say of us hallelujah we want to take that we want to apply it to our lives lord jesus just if we've been wrong lord help us to confess it lord and and put those things right lord jesus or just may may we not confess one thing but our hearts say another lord may just be sold out 100 lord to you lord jesus and heavenly father just in our daily walk with you may we just walk so much closer lord and just that's our whole heart's desire whether it's healing whether us just in our walk lord jesus we so want to be in your hands heavenly father lord i just pray that you bless us each one even as we go our separate ways lord just have these things be on our hearts yes meditation of our hearts lord be acceptable unto you and lord jesus
