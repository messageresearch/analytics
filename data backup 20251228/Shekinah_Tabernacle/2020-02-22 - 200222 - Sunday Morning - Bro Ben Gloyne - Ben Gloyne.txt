here unfortunately it's just amita's last last service with us she's heading up to auckland on the 22nd to study so yeah but yes we'll miss you but yeah trust god's speed and all goes well amen um let's so and this coming sunday we're going to have uh brother ferdi's going to be preaching here for us we have a lunch afterwards as well but yeah we're gonna have a powerful time i believe but i believe we're gonna have a blessed time today amen so let's go to matthew 24. uh if you've got your bibles handy we're going to read a couple of places um we're going to read matthew 24 and we're going to read from verse 44 here and we're going to read down to verse 51. amen so everyone's everyone's there praise the lord who's who's happy to be a christian today i'm real happy praise the lord i'm saved amen matthew 24 and verse 44 therefore therefore be also ready for in an hour for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord deliath is coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and to drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and then we're going to go to revelations chapter 10. i'm going to read the last portion of this chapter we're going to read from verse 7 down to the end of the chapter of um down to verse 11. i believe it's very important that we look into the scripture we're ordained to fulfill as uh brother ahmad was saying on wednesday thoroughly enjoyed that service that um we need to know where we are in the scripture uh if we don't know where we are we need to find where we are you know there's no point having a map if you don't know where you are on the map you know so and we know that this message is opened up reveal to us where we are on the map of god's great plan so revelations 10 we're going to read from verse 7 down to verse 11. he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery god shall be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sin upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make my belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly became bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning if you ever need you just want to raise it to the lord because he knows even before we ask are you such a mindful god lord jesus we just want to come before you this morning with such thanksgiving lord we're once in darkness but lord now we are walking in light with you lord jesus you are the light of the world thank you for taking all our sins away lord that day on calvary and father we just want to pray dear god may our whole lives be under the blood this morning lord may forgive us of all of our sins from the past father even this morning lord i just pray that our entire lives not lord all the good and all the bad father may just be covered in your blood lord that when you hear our voice lord jesus you hear it through your blood you don't see us you just hear our voice through the precious blood of the lord jesus lord we just want to ask may you just ignite our faith in our hearts like never before lord may you increase our faith oh god may you open our eyes of understanding may do an incredible work in our hearts oh god father may you grant it lord we love you we just want to dedicate our lives once you get into your hands take control of every thought lord take control of every spirit take control of all of us oh god and for those who may be streaming this service lord i pray you get a hold of them as well father if their second body may you touch them father any need that we have lord we are a needful people but i want to thank you lord that you have the answer to every need and to every question so lord may just take control for your honor glory and praise we thank you lord we surrender the service into your hands in jesus christ they may you anoint speaker and hearer one more time we ask for your glory amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning so i want to um i i trust this will tie together in some fashion but i was sitting there on wednesday night and i got a bit of paper i started scribbling down some notes and you know i want to talk about the danger and the delay there seems to be a delay as as the you know peter would say in in um uh one of the epistles of peter he'd say that you know there'd be scoffers would rise in the last time saying where is the sign of his coming the world's just gone on as it has and people would say the same thing today they'd say well we've had wars before we've had rumors of wars before we've had economic trouble before we've had nations rise before whether that we've had nations fall before we've had pandemics before so it's just going to continue on but we know in the scripture that there is three woes in the book of revelation and a woe equals a world war we've had two already the third one's coming that third one will be a nuclear one but then that third one the bride will be the one absent from the battlefield we won't be here we're going to be taken off the earth before that ever happens but as we see what's going on in europe and around the world you know it's it's marching that way the tension's building the tension's rising something's got to give somewhere just like the uh you know in the earth there's a tectonic plate there's a pushing there's a force but eventually something slips and an earthquake happens and we are in the fulfillment of prophecy but we have prophecy to fulfill you know we're not here just just haphazardly we're not here just to occupy time we're not here just to live life but we're here to fulfill scripture and i can say this actually everyone will fulfill a portion of scripture but it depends what part you want to fulfill there's some parts we don't want to fulfill i don't want to fulfill being thrown into the lake of fire i don't want to fulfill going to the great tribulation i don't want to fulfill being left behind those parts are not for me that's not in my script i mean my script is i'm going in a rapture and if god is ordained i'm going in a rapture he'll give me a faith to take that rapture i mean we're going to understand that this is not a natural this is not a christianity is not a natural thing we work it out with our mind and try our best with our mind our human ability it's not that it's god's ability amen that's the thing that counts now i'm so glad when god when god you know the bible is a book of prophecy it's not just a book of history it's a book of prophecy and every scripture actually in the bible speaks of today and so but when god prophesies something he doesn't just throw it out there hoping someone will catch it one day and say that sounds like a good idea and i'm going to do it no when he prophesies a word he knows exactly who's going to fulfill it he knows exactly the season it's going to happen he knows exactly the conditions are going to be upon the earth he knows every minute detail of how it's going to happen i mean when isaiah would be inspired he'd say behold a virgin shall conceive god didn't just throw it out there hoping one day a virgin will believe this word and we'll fulfill it mary was part of that prophecy she was part of that she was the prophecy right her name wasn't specifically put in that because because the lord could have spoken through isaiah behold a virgin named mary shall conceive and it shall be by the holy ghost and the romans are going to be in charge of this nation the romans weren't even a nation then when isaiah spoke it but he's gonna say there's gonna be a power from from from italy they're gonna come and take over most of the world they're gonna be the world power of the day and you know there's gonna be all this going on and you know you're not gonna be your own nation anymore there's gonna be a woman called mary she's gonna be raised in nazareth right and she's going to have a visitation of an angel and she's going to believe his word because he's going to say to her you're going to fulfill this prophecy i'm just speaking he could have said all that but he didn't say that he just said a virgin shall conceive because he knew that that prophecy is fulfilled when when faith or revelation anchors into a predestinated person and she was that woman there wasn't another one it was her amen i'll say about the rapture there's not another one it's you i mean you've got to take a real person off if there's going to be a translation of a living people you're going to say that's me he's talking about not just someone else it's me hallelujah amen when god would tell abraham that that his seed was going to sojourn in a strange land and that'd be afflicted 400 years then he was going to bring them out with a mighty hand moses was part of that i'm just basically going to want to i was going to repeat what i said about mary but i want to emphasize this he could have told he could have told um abraham abraham your seat's going to go down into egypt they're going to be there 400 years it's going to come to a point where they're where the male babies are going to be thrown to the crocodiles in the in the nile and they're going to be you know they're going to be used as slaves but in that season they're going to cry out to me and uh and a husband and wife are going to begin to pray amram would pray after he got beaten in the field he'd come and pray and his wife would say you know jehovah would say you know why don't you let someone else pray tonight someone's got to pray if no one else is going to pray i'm going to pray if no one else is going to have a burn to see this fulfilled amen i'm going to have the burden and then the angel came to the house and said you're going to have the promised son and by faith they hit him hallelujah and abraham could have been told all those things you know he's going to be called moses and and his mother's even going to put him in an ark and throw him down into the nile it seems like it's a death sentence but but in the unseen realm there were angels lining the nail i mean gabriel the prophet told us actually stood on that little basket and whenever a crocodile came along he would push its nose down amen and and and and that and that you know that ark didn't just just wander half-passively down the aisle it had a path because it had a destination amen it was outside of moses control where he was gonna end up and he was predestinated to be raised up in pharaoh's palace and many times we think we're just going through life and it's out of our control and everything it's under god's control it's under god's control we may go through some whirlpools or some hard times but we'll come out of them i mean because we've got a predestinated destination but you've got to believe it if you believe it your whole life will be this is for me amen sir he so abraham could have been told by that told that by god he could have fulfilled the details of the red sea crossing that was all in the prophecy the death angel coming the blood being applied the nile turning to blood god could have told them all that because in god's mind that was how it was going to be fulfilled and it was fulfilled exactly as god ordained it to be so now here we are in this time and we have to look at it the same kind of way where where where it's being prophesied there'll be a bride in the end time as god started the church he's going to finish the church because he he's the alpha and the omega so how he started the church on the day of pentecost is how he's going to finish the church i mean so the church started in power demonstration of the holy ghost politics wasn't known among them they were one heart one mind one accord i mean one burden hallelujah being led by the spirit of god it was god's organization it was god's government it wasn't man's idea that's how the church started being filled with the holy ghost that's how the church started and they walked in power they were hated by the world but they didn't care because they knew where they were going i loved that quote uh there it said you know this world is not our home we're just so journeying through amen that that that we would call other citizens amen from darkness into light hallelujah so this was this was their burden and this is how the church started and this and if god started his church that way he's gonna finish his church that way i mean he's gonna finish with the same kind of people he had in acts chapter two he's gonna have the same kind of people today amen there's a prophecy of the bride tree being restored hallelujah there's a whole subject in itself but you know the prophet would preach a sermon the restoration of the bride tree and it wasn't just to make people excited he was declaring what you saw in the bible of the believer is being manifested again today there's a restoration so there's what was there in the beginning is it's not being replaced it's being restored the same life the same fruits of the spirit the same overcoming power the same faith as in a people hallelujah and he would go to ezekiel and he'd speak about the four strangers of the dry bones being restored and the last part of that stage is when when when ezekiel was said to prophesy son of man and he prophesied that life would come into the bone life would come into the army and then brother ram said you know he would just say prophesy son of man he got all look you're excited at that point the reason he was is because he was realizing the spoken word was being preached that had power in it i mean to bring life into the church hallelujah amen so here we are living under that you know we get worried about the we shouldn't get so caught up we should be aware of what's going on in the world but that's not the main sign that the end is coming the main sign is the bride's come to her position because nothing can happen until she's ready and taken out hallelujah nothing can happen until we're ready amen hallelujah now it's amazing to me how even when prophecy is fulfilled the devil makes great effort to explain it away the ministry of jesus you know i just i just marveling to myself last night thinking about this there were roman soldiers that were standing guarding jesus's tomb they were there for three days no nothing went happening nothing was going on there was a guard there change of century every whatever time the the tomb was sealed but then the angel lord descended and when he descended it says there was a great earthquake now to me that great earthquake wouldn't have just been felt by the gods it was a great earthquake if maybe it would have just me it would have woken up the chief priests had woken up the high priest well it would have woken up the sanhedrin maybe they were asleep in their beds in their finery thinking that they had gotten rid of this jesus but then there was this earthquake and they woke up and then shortly up so and then if we just go into those soldiers it says their great fear came upon them and they fell down as dead men this was the experience they had so they saw an angel come down a mighty angel come down they're experiencing a great earthquake they are filled with fear and then they fall down as dead men and then they run for their lives this was not a calm experience this would have been a very emotionally traumatic engraved in their minds forever kind of experience and then so just to dramatize a bit you know there's a chief priest he feels a great earthquake maybe he just you know oh well that's unusual then he rolls over goes back to sleep and next few minutes after is a knock on his door master rabbi there's some soldiers to see you you know and then here's these you know because it says the century of the watch came and they would have run in there and they would have reported what had happened this wasn't just another day this wasn't just another guy duty they had seen something they'd never experienced before and they'd never experience again hallelujah and so they would have run in there distressed trouble maybe all the color had gone from their faces they fell down as dead men and then so they begin to tell him about the events of the mighty angel come down there's a great earthquake and maybe in his mind he thought oh that's what woke me up so he knew what they were talking about and then and then you know they'd say well this angel came down the great tear of phil was so even now we're shaking in our boots from what happened to us and we fell down as dead men we ran here to tell you what happened and then he just said take this money tell everyone that the disciple stole his body and and he said if anyone you know says anything about it we'll we'll back you up we'll preserve your lives and it said that that was noise abroad you know from that day how could you live with that how could you ever live with that experience and television i know that the disciples stole his body what happened there in judea with this oh no the disciples stole his body and the coins are rattling in your pocket so the devil will go into great so he explained away he explained away the ministry of our lord he'll explain away prophecy being fulfilled today he will do it even you know the devil even uh is is so busy that that before the truth ever gets to a place there'll be a bad name associated with it before it gets there the apostle paul would end up in rome and and the jews would come to him and say we want to know this is an acts 28 we want to know what you think about this sect that's spread everywhere we know that everywhere it's spoken against so the truth haven't even got to the romans to the to the jews in rome but yet already a bad name had been associated what do you what do you think of this cult what do you think of this movement it's spoken everywhere against so the devil will do this kind of thing but i'll say but to the elect all that won't matter but to the elect amen that won't matter that won't change amen god fulfilling it in their lives amen that's what i said you know we've had we've had economic problems before we've had pandemics before don't don't let it harden us against the fulfillment of prophecy you know we don't want to be caught up in that bracket because you see here this servant that we read about and i'll and i'll come to revelations 10 soon the servant we read about he said in his heart the lord delays his coming so he didn't he didn't he didn't proclaim it out loud he just began to think he's he's lingering there's a delay i thought he would have come back by now and you know you see it the danger and the delay is that the devil gets in and tries to get the people off the course from what they started that's why how we start is how we should finish how we start is how we should continue well how do you start in your first love god's everything a total abandonment to god come what may i love him i want everyone to come in he's the greatest thing there was you know and but the devil tries to put discouragement and fear and disappointment in our way that we won't continue how we started but the holy ghost is here to take all that out of us right remember when the enemy came against the apostles and you know they were dragged before the sanhedrin and they were told don't preach in his name anymore and i think they were beaten i think it's more than one occasion but on one occasion they just went and they had a prayer meeting and god filled them and shook the place and filled them with boldness to overcome what the devil tried to put upon them because he wanted to disable their faith i say god remember god is here to enable us this is not us just trying to be a believer no no all of heaven's behind you irrespective of how you feel about yourself all of heaven is backing you up we're ambassadors for christ an ambassador speaks for their nation all of that nation is behind them you think when the ambassador of the united states goes to a country all over all of the army the equipment the weapons the military force of america is behind that person that's just a natural army how about the whole host of heaven amen is behind you that's why when elijah said about you know you know gehazi his servant went out saw the syrians and kept around the you know city he yo he begin to panic you know he runs in you know we're going to die we can't get out they're going to get us you know and then no doubt elisha because he knew that heaven was backing him up he knew he was an ambassador for heavens in an unseen realm god's armies were around him so he just said lord open his eyes he didn't pray that the angels would come they were already there the angels were already the army was already around right but but gehazi's eyes had to come open to realize they already were there i prayed this morning may our eyes come open that we wouldn't look at the natural things of the world but we'd realize actually i'm the the greatest military force known to man or known to hell is actually around me hallelujah remember gehazi was full of fear he was worried he was troubled but the angels were still around him hallelujah amen praise the lord so this so the servant began to say in his heart the lord delays his coming now well we'll just go back to that soon but you see it's the delay where where the devil tries to derail us from where we're going and you can see that in the scripture you know where where the apostle paul has to address something basically in every church in the corinthian church i mean they had signs and wonders following but they begin to bring in a bit of respect of persons and they allowed sin to be in the church and paul says you know it's even things that the gentiles don't do you're allowing you know how that man was sleeping basically with us coming adultery with his mother-in-law or something you know or stepmother-in-law whatever it was but but because of a respected person's things they just allowed the sin and so the devil brought that into to derail them and then they begin to form clicks saying well some say they're of paul some say they're apollo some say they're of christ you know this is the ministry i like to follow so basically it's whatever ministry there christ well i just read the bible i don't go to church i listen to tapes that's christ bring it into today i do this so it was factions being formed they didn't start that way but the devil tried to because of the delay right he tried to derail them the galatian church did not start legalistic they started in the power of god when the apostle paul asked the simple question he said he said did the spirit come to you by keeping the law or hearing by you know faith cometh by hearing so they didn't start that way but because of the delay people we when we lose our focus that's when a winner when a deviation of a walk can come in that's why we should finish how we start and we should continue how we start hallelujah and so so the apostle paul but remember they were believers the galatians were real believers the corinthians were real believers right the thessalonians were worried he said don't be you know because they were all troubled because people had been writing war bringing out new doctrines saying well you know the resurrection's past this has happened whatever you know to overthrow the faith of some but you know so there was fear controlling them but the apostle paul addressed it he says don't be troubled by by by literal by spirit let's just read it second thessalonians let's just read this book because i feel like i'm not quite getting there but it's very now so second thessalonians 2 and 1 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of christ is at hand and he begins to talk about the um mystery of iniquity working and the antichrist all those things right but he says don't be troubled by these things so they were living under a fear they were troubled what was what was the purpose of that to try and derail their walk are you following me right so so this is what happens in the delay but the lord allows these things to happen because he wants to test our faith he wants to give us victory he wants to give us reasons to worship him more he wants to give us reasons to praise him more that's why he allows the devil to come in like this that we can praise him all because you know if you've never been healed by god you can't worship him as healer if you've never been saved you can't worship him with savior you can know he's to save you in your head but when you realize i was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see i was bound now i'm loosed you can worship him you can praise his great name i mean every revelation he pours in you can wash him because he pours in that revelation hallelujah so the devil you know the devil doesn't win everything the devil is allowed to do turns into praise to god that's how it should be it shouldn't make us bitter it should just make us praise god more hallelujah everything should just just produce a worship out of our lives hallelujah you say well i don't know how to worship on this one just praise him give him glory hallelujah and one day you'll see but everything sickness comes in financial trouble whatever it is it's that god would get praise hallelujah amen so we can just praise the lord amen amen so there was so in the delay there is danger but that danger should produce praise so i'm not trying to you know you got to twist it round i'm going through this real big battle it's all right wait till you get to the other side i just actually just start praising him now praise him praise him now not just not just after the victory praise him in the victory i mean praise him in the trial hallelujah amen to change change your whole thinking now so so this this servant he he said in his heart the lord delayeth his coming and then he shall it says in verse 49 and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken so we know this is a parable right so he's saying that now because because it appears that the lord delays is coming but the reason he delays is coming is that all of god's children must come in amen amen he could have come i know how many years ago we know all the scriptures here and everything i mean all the prophecies here but he he it's actually the mercy of god that there is a delay hallelujah praise the lord and so but the thing is because there appears to be a delayed this evil servant it says actually now he says well he's delaying his coming so the diligency that he started with begins to wane because he thinks now he's got time and when he thinks he's got time his focus begins to shift his his focus went from serving the lord out of a pure heart to now he begins to smite his fellow servants so in in today's language he now where initially he could look past the faults of his fellow servants right because of his love and diligence serving god out of a pure heart he couldn't look beyond their troubles no more then he'd begin to smite them then he got mad at them then he wouldn't forgive them then he would the spread gossip around murder their character that smiting some smiting a fellow servant dragging down this church dragging down this ministry dragging down this person dragging down an office in the church whatever it is disrespect you know spreading an attitude that is smiting a fellow servant we don't want to be smiters or fellow servants we're here to smite the devil amen push the battle and smite the devil that's why we're here so we don't we ever want to lose our focus if your focus is everyone else's problems then i'd say you've actually been derailed you've actually that the delay the danger and the delay has actually distracted you but you can get back on the road hallelujah amen but yeah like the scripture says that we are not ignorant of satan's devices so this is one of his devices so so this evil servant begins to smite his fellow servants as i've said and to eat and drink with the drunken now we know in the bible there as we know there's literal drunkenness right but there's also a spiritual drunkenness now if we go to revelation i believe at 17 we'll see that there is well i'll show you this world is drunk if we go to revelation 17 and we're going to just read verses 1 and we're going to go down to verse 6. and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i'll show thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters now we know the book of revelation is a symbolic book it's a book of symbols the symbols actually interpret themselves now when it speaks of a woman in the bible it speaks of a church and there's many waters as people's multitudes nations and tongues okay and with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious jewels and pearls and having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her name was written i mean upon a forehead i was written was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots the abominations of the earth and i saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wandered with great admiration and the angel said unto me wherefore does thou marvel i will tell you the mystery of the woman and the beast and the carrot that carries her carryeth her which had the seven heads and ten horns the beast which our source was and is not and shall ascend out of the bomberless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wander whose names were not written in the book of life and the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is and is not and yet is now we're just going to finish there but you can read the whole thing but but this is a power remember we're actually all cow brothers we're actually all sisters because we're all women in the bible we're a church right so this church has actually power to actually cause the kings of the earth to commit fornication with it now this is spiritual matters right and the whole world becomes drunk with the one of her fornication now we won't read it but but if if we continue on in revelations 18 is the judgment of this great hall we know this is the catholic system and she's a mother of harlots the denominations are the daughters of the catholic church because they live they don't live pure to the word they live by their creeds they love their creeds more than the bible right so but but this power has made so it's not the people in the churches it's the system that binds them it's the system that's bad it's not the people right many good genuine people in there but it's the system that holds them down it's that religious spirit that holds them down but you see it's actually made this system has made the world drunk and in revelations 18 there's a judgment of the great and there's one where where where she's burnt with fire and then there's a second one where she's cast like a millstone into the water there's actually two babylons we know that don't we two mystery babylons one is rome and one is los angeles so one is burnt with fire the russians are going to drop a bomb on it brother brown says that there'll be some fanatic drunk russian will push a button and then there will go right it'll be destroyed but then the los angeles is going to slip into the sea as it has been prophesied so so because many people say well how's the world drunk if people aren't even religious well it's because there's two babylons there's the religious babylon and there's the entertainment world babylon that's why so people are drunk by these two systems and so this is what it means by this evil servant being able to eat and drink with the drunken so they get under the influence of that spirit why because the lord they said in their heart the lord the lasers coming so they instead of being focused on what they're here to do they get sidetracked begin to be critical of everyone and then they start and then they begin to feed off the wrong things because remember everything has a spirit and everything has an intent just like i heard brother kaido digs he was um he was he was speaking to some youth and he's talking about samson and delilah and you know samson would say um sorry delilah would say to samson but you love me tell me where your strength is you say you love me why won't you tell me your secret and basically delilah's saying to samson tell me how i can destroy you if you really love me tell me how i can destroy you that's what she's saying so the intent of her question was tell me how i can kill you i want to get paid for this and that's what the devil does he'll project something out there on social media whatever it is and but there's an intent behind what he's doing just like music there's intent behind the music right different genres have different spirits country western music has depression pop and stuff has lust rap has murder and anger all those different genres they have different spirits so there's an intent behind the music there's an intent behind stuff that's pushed down our throats on social media different things on youtube you know there's good in those platforms but don't get drunk on the evil is it taking you from god is it bringing you closer to god does it bring god into your house or does it bring the devil into your house i want god in my house that's why i love living over the street here because god visited us so many times that's what made it home hallelujah and that's what cal man you know what i mean but but but that's what makes home special of course it is the people my wonderful family but it's when god comes in because we want a place where he feels welcome he can come and have a break hallelujah amen so so this world is drunk amen it is staggering under an intoxication now it's amazing well now if we look at natural drunkenness if i have a there are some there are many things that alcohol does to the body right many things one is you can't so so here's a few physical effects you can't see straight you can't see straight if you're drunk trust me i've been there been there done that wish i never did but hey god richard mercy that's the main thing i'm not that guy anymore praise the lord but so you can't see straight your focus is all out amen now now keep in mind the spiritual application right so when you're sober minded when you have the mind of christ you can see straight you can see things for what they are your vision is not distorted it's not blurred you know your picture doesn't move like this now you can see straight right so so if your people are drunk with the world under intoxication of the spirit of this world their vision gets blurry i could say they actually can lose their vision you know where there is a where no vision is a people perish amen the challenge you know the challenge can be to run this race with patience that's what the apostle paul said this is not a sprint this is not a sub 10 second dash this is a marathon but the lord has made us to run this marathon he's built you to do it amen so your vision gets bl blurry someone who's drunk can't walk straight they stagger back and forth that's why i used to be a test i know but still is if people are pulled over by the cops they say now walk down this line and they do but the line keeps moving so what happens is if you're sober minded you can walk straight in the middle of the road of the word right neither legalism neither liberalism but divine love is driving you right you walk straight down amen so you don't try and justify yourself saying you're better than the next person and you don't say well who cares because it's all grace don't turn grace into disgrace amen but it's divine love motivates your christian walk so it's not thou shalt not you know thou shalt not do this no because i love him i want to please him amen so you can't walk straight your speech becomes slurred amen some of you know exactly what i'm talking about you can't speak normally you jumble your words they slur so you can't speak like the word would speak right it becomes incoherent people can try and put scriptures and quotes together to try and fight a battle but if they're drunk and they just slur and mix and it makes no to them it makes sense who's that who was ever back then what you're saying you make perfect sense and someone says you made no sense no in my heart i was making perfect sense no what is that your speech is slurred right it's not actually the mind of christ speaking the word forth it's carnality and just your because your vision is slurred you can't walk straight i mean i mean your speech is slurred your vision is blurred you can't walk straight amen we want to speak because remember the the voice of god is in the bride the voice of god is in the bride again amen not just a preacher but lived voices where the word puts on flesh in you and i brother braham said that the world will hear direct through the bride as it did at pentecost what was that god filling a people speaking his word forth that's why this word must become one with you i mean it's not just pushing play listening to a message no that word message must become flesh where you become the manifestation of the message that's the purpose of it where you become the manifestation of the word amen where you become a lived voice that's why god wants to empty us of the world and fill us with himself that you can shake this world amen that's what god wants to do that's our calling you say well i may not be a very good witness don't worry about that you just live true and love the lord amen remember the lord would say well done my good and faithful servant he didn't say well done my good and successful as you thought you'd be successful servant well done my good and faithful [Music] amen you know i'm glad that we are not called to do what some of the prophets did in the bible one had to land aside so many days and the other side so many days i think it was ezekiel or one of the prophets you know the lord actually wanted him to take um flour and stuff and make cakes with human dung as a physical representation of what he thought of the people god was saying about the people and ezekiel said this is too much i can't do it so he says okay just just use animal dung instead one of the prophets had to walk naked through the street all these different kind of things they were assigned a living sign to the world i'm glad we don't have to do those things right but we're still a living sign we're still a living voice they their their lives and what they did preach to the world amen and we are here to be lived voices and we'll get into that soon amen now when when someone is drunk they're not so sensitive to the cold like they used to be their feeling becomes numb they're not as sensitive so so if they're sober they walk out and it's cold they'll say no it's too cold to need a jacket same person same condition as drunk go out i'm fine so the atmosphere of the world doesn't bother a person who's drunk when it when it's cold you're following me right says the same thing in the spiritual climate someone who's drunk with the world the spiritual climate of the world does not affect them like if they are sober-minded we do not want to become numb to this world we don't want to become different know it's amazing i think it's in hosea i don't have it in my notes but the lord says to hosea i've sent the sword to speaking about israel i sent the sword to this city and i've sent rain on this right one and withheld it from this city i've seen to famine here not to this one but he says yet my people will not return to me so all of those things did not stir the people up for them to come to the right senses and say hey we should something's wrong something spiritually wrong in our lives we need to return to the lord so he says no those things actually don't grip a people to wake them up it takes the word of god it takes the anointing of this message to wake up people up that don't realize you're at the end but don't despair there's a way out of here which is a rapture i've gone to prepare a place for you and if i come again receive you unto myself where i am you shall be also so that's not you know what i love about the parable of the wedding feast there's three calls go out the first two the people make excuses you know i bought some land i married a wife just well okay you bought some land it'll be there when you get back i married a wife just bring her with i've got some oxen i haven't tried them don't you see what yeah was it 12 year old cause a lot of oxen wouldn't you go inspect them before you you know they'll be there when you get back you know god makes it in such a way there's no excuse not to come but yet they still turn him down so he just says to his servants get the good and the bad so i'm glad that you know when he sit down the bad i'm like i can come hallelujah hallelujah i can come and then but but the nice thing is you can be bad so so who's in that range of good and bad wow where's the angels take off your angels wings for a second we're all human right i'm in that bracket i wasn't good i was wretched and horrible i was in the bad basic get the good and the bad i fit i fit the criteria i got my invitation so i came hallelujah but then when you come to the door which is christ says hold on i'm going to wash your feet wash all the muck of the world off you amen holy wash all the muck of the world off you and then i'm going to anoint you that the stench of your old life is gone you know what i love i maybe i shouldn't go into it but you know god can make it in such a way that your accuser can be living right next to you but he is silenced amen the woman who was caught in adultery her accusers brought her before the before the lord says we've caught her in the very act where was the man if they were really scripturally right they would have brought both of them and then the lord jesus ignores no she's she knows she's guilty she was there when it happened she knows she's worthy of death but then yet the lord he doesn't answer them he just begins to ride in the sand and he just says then without sin let him cast the first stone so now from the elders to the youngest their conscious gets a hold of them and they know what they have done they were going to drop their stones and they walk away and then the lord says woman where are your accusers it says there's none lord he says neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more now the devil if he was honest he would he would admit he's a liar he's a murderer he's full of pride he's arrogant he's wicked if he was honest he's not honest but if he was honest his conscience would actually grip him and say yeah i did it i did it but now you think about that woman those those priests knew her address they knew where she lived maybe they're in the same village or town she was in and so the next day she goes walking along doing her thing maybe comes across one of those ones who wanted her stoned in this silence why because the lord had had had given her a pardon but those priests and pharisees didn't get the same pardon and they could maybe try and bring up the same accusation but she said hold on hold on your own conscience convicted you and you walked away you did not receive the same pardoning grace i did their voices were silenced yet they were walking around where she lived you know we're going to tell the devil to shut up we're going to tell him you have no right to hold my past against me i receive pardoning grace where's yours he ain't got none he can't get any amen maybe i'll bring that out some other time i was just thinking about that because you know rahab's accusers or rahabs the men that rahab slept with before jericho fell they all died when the walls came down right so there was no physical evidence that she had her former life that was under the blood of bulls and goats but under the blood of jesus christ if i put it this way i hope it comes out right your past can still be walking around but if the lord has judged you sinless then you can walk on amen you're not under the condemnation anymore amen maybe that was a bad segue but you know we're free the blood of jesus christ is lucius from all sin hallelujah so now so yeah so if you're a person who's drunk the garden the cold they don't become as sensitive as they are to the to the atmosphere like they used to be now a drunk person's reality becomes distorted you cannot think straight you cannot think how you were when you're sober your reality becomes distorted now this world's reality is very distorted you think about the cataclysmic event that's about to take place on the world and yet people are doing all kinds of everything else trying to just think they'll just somehow get through it we have a way of escape you're a person who's drunk their inhibitions go the things they wouldn't do when they're sober they begin to do when they're drunk so the things that people never used to talk about watch do listen to when they are sober when they get drunk with this world they do things that they'll never used to do a person who's drunk has big mood swings they can either be very depressed or happy or violent outbursts can come out because they're drunk so they don't so they're no longer just you know calm and collected level-headed having a discussion just like a violent outburst can come out especially when it's against something they are drunk with this is all con symptoms of someone who's drunk i trust you're not under the influence today but then the sad thing is that people who who who get used to being drunk it's how they interact with others so they need that in their hand to become naught become normal that they can talk to people i'm not talking about just drinking a liquid with alcohol in it i'm talking about devices it can be anything that you can be drunk with right you need this to talk to people you can't just have a conversation you can't have a normal relationship why because you've got to interact via something else i trust we're all sober today amen so we don't want to have big mood swing yeah so so these are all symptoms of someone who's drunk they smite their fellow servants and they're becoming they come under the influence of what's going on in the world now you know we have a mandate today this is someone who's drunk with the world shall i go through it again they can't walk straight their speech becomes blurred their vision gets blurry they're not sensitive to the cold or whatever like they used to be i mean their reality becomes distorted you know any reality that's contrary to the word of god is a distorted reality their inhibitions you um go they have big mood swings violent outbursts and they need to be drunk to be able to interact with others they need that thing to be able to live a normal life functioning alcoholics they call them but we're not called to be filled to be drunk with this world we're called to be drunk on the holy ghost amen that we can be drunk every day in the holy ghost till we leave this earth hallelujah we're unfortunately people because the the big trouble in this day is a mental health crisis and that's around the world a mental health crisis you know i remember when bernie and noelia first came here from argentina and i and i told them about how our suicide rate is what are the highest in the world and they couldn't believe it because to them this is utopia this country so why do we have everything but yet there's a mental health problem because people are crying out for some satisfaction to live some kind of life and it doesn't fulfill really what's within them even normal family dynamics are broken you know a big problem with addiction is the reason people get addicted to something is because actually they have they they lose the ability to relate and interact with even their family that's how why people go into addiction but we have a different course we are not like though i i trust that i'm looking at a group of people that have not said in their heart the lord delays is coming and that they have not begun to smite their fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken this world is drunk it's staggering it's staggering left and right all over the place because the lord will come in a day when when there's some people are not looking for him they can be going through the motions they can be coming to church they can be saying all the right thing but in their heart they're not looking for him you know i heard brother ron spencer say about his um his father that just passed on here's a believer as a preacher there in america and his father would say that every day he's looking for the coming of the lord and then the last day he was upon the earth brother ron spoke to him and and his father said i'm looking for the coming of the lord today and i believe he's coming for me today two hours after that phone conversation the lord took him home i believe we should have that kind of an attitude oh but i've got all these plans and all these things i need to do the lord the lord's schedule is different to our schedule we should we should be focused if he's not coming today because remember in the delay in the delay some people get the derailed or distracted but some people their faith gets stronger in the delay abraham had a delay of 25 years and his faith got stronger every day hallelujah he got stronger in faith he staggered not at the promise of god but was fully persuaded god was able to do that which he had promised hallelujah so his faith got stronger in the delay amen we're the sons and daughters of abraham are we not amen so now john would john would be here in revelations 10 now i want to go into i want to go into very quickly now we have we have a mandate to fulfill that's a trending word so i looked it up mandate is an official order or commission to do something that's what a mandate means so if we're under a mandate we've been given a commission or an official order to do something now our commission is the great commission it is the great commission that commission is not going to finish until our bodies are changed that's when we know it's done but until then we are fulfilling the great commission so we're under a mandate now we know revelations 10 we didn't read the first part of it but in the first part we have a mighty angel coming down rainbow over his head is the covenant angel the angel of the covenant which is jesus christ and angelic form he comes down to the earth and he has an open book in his hand now that book was closed in revelations 4 and 5. that's the book of redemption we're part of that deed right it's everything adam lost from the fall but but but we are part of that book because brother brown would tell us um in the in the breach message he'd say that that that act of of of the lamb taking the book is as the same as boaz claiming ruth hallelujah amen so so he's taken the book he's loosed the seals and then now he comes down and he gives that word to a seventh church age messenger that's why i read that verse seven in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mysteries of god should be finished right so what's already in the bible will be made revealed it's not adding to the bible it's not taking away it's just revealing what's in the scripture amen so now brother ram says that that mighty angel coming down what will happen when the seventh angel is on the earth that's already come and gone but since christ himself has come down now i mean to gather a bride to himself this is the mandate we're living under this is what this is why we're here amen and then john now john in revelations 4 and 5 it says that no man was found worthy to even look upon the book he went much because he knew that if no one could take back that title deed of redemption that actually all of creation's in jeopardy no man said there were angels there they were found you know gabriel would have been worthy michael wormwood any of the angels because they'd never fallen but no man there's a call there has to be a man as adam forfeited eternal life there had to be a man come and redeem it back right so so john was weeping but then but then and but then an elder came to him and said weep not john for the land of the tribe of judah has prevailed he's been found whether he's wrestled with and overcame how did he do that he wrestled with in the garden of gethsemane he said not my will but thy will be done he he submitted his own flesh his own body to the will of god for his life and he went to calvary victorious the victory has won that day or that night or that morning in gethsemane and he went to calvary for you and i he took our sins upon his shoulder i mean he purchased with his own blood it wasn't the blood of a jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile that was the blood of god that was shed upon the earth the highest price that could be paid amen because the highest value that god could esteem to any object is you hallelujah amen then he went down to hell amen the devil remembers this moment amen satan lost the keys of hell death in the grave he ascended up victorious amen rising triumphant of every sin every every devil every every doubt every situation battle you know what i love brother armand was giving that prophecy about hell you know israel will come into the land and they'll come into the land of the amorites jebusites different arts and i just rejoice because god is prophesying i'm gonna give bring you into direct conflict with your enemy i'm going to bring you into direct conflict with that thing which hinders you i'm going to bring you into direct conflict with your enemy but i will consume them hallelujah so sometimes we just yeah life is going fine but then we come up against an enemy maybe it's a spirit from our past maybe it's some pain maybe it's some generational curse that's come down but god's saying i'm bringing you into conflict with this thing not for you to wallow and say i'll never overcome it but for you to know this thing's coming to an end i'm in the cycle of sinners broken in your life by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah i'm bringing you into conflict with the sin but it's gonna die hallelujah and what did joshua do after that great battle he got the kings those kings those nations that hid themselves in a cave whatever it was brought them out and he got the captains of israel he said put your put your foot on the neck of your enemy i want you to feel what it's like to have dominion over this thing i want you to experience this i want you to remember this moment because if you've conquered this one you'll conquer the next one hallelujah amen serve you so if god has overcome one thing in your life have confidence the next thing's gone down and then the next thing's going down then the next thing's going down it was lust went down then then pride will go down the next whatever it is amen that thing's gonna fall hallelujah amen amen i enjoyed that on wednesday amen so now john as he said john whipped much but then he said no the lamb the lander that not the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed and when he looked he saw a bleeding bloody lamb step forth from eternity hallelujah that's our king that's our lamb amy took the book and all the elders everyone threw down their crowns hallelujah and actually we're in that scene because it's all the redeemed through the ages worthy of thou amen you've prevailed amen to loose the seals with your own blood you've redeemed us back to god hallelujah but then now i said john wasn't worthy to take the book or even look upon it because no because john was in the scene too but then john is now commanded in revelations chapter 10 to take that same book and to eat it up hallelujah now john is a symbol in the book of revelation himself we understand that so john represents the bride of christ down through the ages because after the church ages are done in revelations 4 1 john says now that same voice that spoke with me i looked up and there was now a voice from heaven a doors open says come up hither and that speaks of the rapture of the church which is the dead in christ and those which are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the age right so one man in a vision represents a whole body of people amen so now john is now told to take this book and eat it up and he's told it'll be sweet in your mouth isn't the word sweet to talk about isn't a great thing to talk about the goodness of god but it'll be belly in your but it'll be bitter in your belly why is that because it will purge things out of your life that don't need to be there hey man you have a real good healthy meal after you've been living off junk food your belly gets a bit bitter why because is it purging out all this stuff i mean it's like the word i've just become ingested you talk about the sweetness of it i mean there's a there's a bitterness in here and a sweetness here sweet because it's great to talk about the goodness of god but it's better because it's purging things out if the word cuts you left and right that's that's like the same thing it's purging things out that we don't need hallelujah so so he took the book but now then he ate the book but then that's not the end of it he says thou must prophesy again now if we go into history we see john after the isle of patmos never fulfilled that he went to ephesus he passed to the church and he died of old age the only apostle to do so and so this is now it's actually a prophecy knowing that the book of revelation is a book of prophecy amen speaking of an end time people that will become one with the lord jesus christ and will prophesy again now the word prophesy means to speak under inspiration so it's not to say something different but to say the contents of the book hallelujah to preach to live the contents of the book so in that book is redemption hallelujah in that book is healing remember it's christ revealed right brother braham says that the opening of the seals reveals christ amen so in the book is healing in the book of redemption i mean and and the book is redemption and the book is the forgiveness of sins it's all it's all in christ right amen in that book as a rapture hallelujah in that book is dominion over satan and that book is as dominion over every evil spirit hallelujah and that book is actually dominion over nature everything adam lost is restored now right now oh one day it'll happen we're waiting for a surge of the holy ghost to make it live it's happening we're here right now the former and latter reign are running together hallelujah amen in in that book is all those so now we are mandated we are commissioned to preach the contents of the book so we're preached we're sorry we're mandated to preach or to live out amen the contents of the book the revealed word which is christ that's our mandate that's what we're here to do we are commissioned to do it now if you're commissioned to do something you'll be given the ability to do it amen you will not just be left there and say no now you work it out no that's not a right commission if someone's commissioned you're given the tools you're given the ability amen and the reason you are called to do the job is because you have the ability to do the job even if you realize you may not realize you're able to do it but actually deep within you you have it amen so we are here brother braham said that there is a cycle of revival and death but that cycle will come to an end in the end time amen amen where is no longer revival and go down to death and there's another revival no that cycle is to be broken it would say in revelations 3 where the lord would the complaint against this age and i'm gonna i'm gonna close just after this thought i behave i'll behave there is there is he says because they are neither hot nor cold but lukewarm i'll spew the out of my mouth now we know that in the scripture because some people say well if you're lukewarm god will spit you out of his mouth so he'll you're not part of him anymore but it's that but in the bible we're engraved in the palm of his hands we're in his bosom but we're never in his mouth the word is in his mouth right the word of god is in in the mouth of god so when god says that you're neither hot nor cold but your lukewarm will spew the out of my mouth spew the out of my mouth that means that you'll no longer speak for me you'll speak for yourself or speak for your church whatever you no longer speak for me but in order to preach the contents of the book to prophesy again we are not here to speak or live our own opinion we're here to speak or live the word above all things amen above all things we're here to speak that's why we should edify one another in love that's why we should build up one another we're all on the same team there's not the government and the opposition and the greens and the whatevers no no we're all on the same team right we're all in the same body towards the same goal wanting to do the same thing amen amen but if we're here to live you think about now if you've received salvation if you've received mercy you will extend mercy because in the book you've received the book i mean if you receive pardoning grace you'll impart pardoning grace amen if the lord has forgiven you you will forgive others amen if you've received divine love and divine love is in you remember divine love is a person it's christ right if he is in you then divine love will be extended hallelujah hey why because you've become one with the book amen he says now he says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is that thought is that you know he says i'll spew the out of my mouth because you no longer speak for me in the dark ages the word was almost lost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creed and not the simple word they could no longer speak for god the god sent wesley and god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles rather known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until on this last day there will again there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final h they will be the final voice of the final age there's not another age coming this is the final h amen but god is looking for a people who will actually receive his mandate amen i will live according to your word lord i will surrender my whole life that you'll take over you know you know the olympics is going on i don't know i probably say this every big sporting event people give their whole lives for a moment just for one moment the person who runs the fastest hundred in the world ten seconds on a bad day about nine something but they live for that one moment their whole life what they eat what they do all their focus their sleep their whole routine is because of one moment just for one moment amen now we should live for one moment what's that moment when the holy ghost sweeps through the people and you see your bodies change you become young again or the children now 18-21 that's the moment we should be looking for hallelujah that is what we should be living for and we should be living in such a way that whosoever will let them come lord let them come they may be my worst enemy let them come lord let them come lord that that person who won't forgive you let them come lord lord jesus touch their lives lord move in my life that that that you will impact them not me this is not a personality cult we're not trying to get people to receive a church spirit or my spirit or something ridiculous like that no the whole purpose is that people would fall in love with jesus christ the word and their whole being would now i keep falling in love with them over and over again amen that's our mandate hallelujah let the world do what they do you can't stop it we live in an age called the age of ladies here the age of people's rights look around the world what's happening that's a manifestation of that spirit oh but there's a lot of injustice absolutely there is but we have a different mandate we have a mandate that when the lord comes we are ready we're found doing hallelujah if you're a housewife be housewife as unto the lord if you're a worker be a worker is unto the lord whatever you are in life father son husband wife brother daughter sister mother whatever do it as unto the lord i had that i wouldn't call it an epiphany but it just came on my came on my mind last week everything i should do it should be is unto the lord amen so i was like lord help me is everything i do maybe it's unto you that's how we should be i think lord help me put that into practice though you know but we have a mandate god gave you this man i haven't given you this mandate this is not my word this is god's word he has commissioned us to fulfill the great commission there's a cloud of witnesses waiting for us to cross that finish line amen you say well i can't do it in my own self none of us can that's why the lord jesus wants to because of his blood come and live in us change our being transform our nature that his word would put on flesh in you and i and he will finish the race in you and i amen let's let's finish there this morning i mean we have the musicians please amen but let's not be drunk with this world let's be sober-minded hallelujah praise the lord you mean should i quit doing everything not study whatever no no brother brahm
