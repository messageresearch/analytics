[Music] yeah [Music] miss lourd [Music] right now [Music] amen some reason I'm getting nothing up on that spring I've just the skinniest let's write a script but before faith hang we would keep that under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster my thought was evening as we are no longer under earth under a schoolmaster and I can't get my slideshow to work some reason it's just the devil that's just every time I don't know why I bother after you can try and cancel that and plug in my teeth ii will try that the last time i you can be seated so i try and gain any of all times last time i preached i preached on divine love or perfect love for perfect faith a perfect killing and something was speaking to me since then something a bit more to that and that's what i want to talk about tonight so i thought what is a schoolmaster who knows what a schoolmaster is i mean and some of the older people may know what a schoolmaster was that was maybe a bit different than what your kids know as a schoolmaster oh my and the schoolmaster would bring correction and if you had to be brought before their headmaster it was not a pleasant thing because we knew did something wrong that schoolmaster brought correction and it wasn't nice it was hard but we're not we're not under that same anointing right now something's taking place amen because that that schoolmaster that that pained that what that cane would bring pain will bring scars and sometimes those scars would last and that's what's happened in a previous generation of what's come up and the message as we've had people that have tried to take the place of school must and then what the bride and caused scars pain but with we're in a different dispensation now something's something's changing and something's changing in the believer because it's going to got to bring some more life out of the believer man the Lord never justified us the law brought us price that we might be justified by faith and then after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster so we shouldn't be serving God out of fear we should be serving him out of love rather next slide give it boss I want to read you this quote because this quotes really where I I drew my inspiration from you can't have faith without perfect love Bible teaching is usually a little trick teacher Asst rigorous a little you know kind of walking out on the nice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother bila that teaching goes beyond that and especially to the church now preaching usually catches the sinner brings them under condemnation by the word but teaching places the men positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so I my prayer is that everybody would know where they are positionally placed in Christ because then you can help me but the promises that are written in the word and everybody's in a different stage not irrelevant in their promised land right now what I'm gonna say tonight is nothing new you've been there for 10 years seven years you know I've maybe been there for two or three years everyone starts off and and they grow into this as a process and I want to show that we're a free people hey man and there's something that makes this church this bride different from other believers you are a different Church you're not like the pinna coastal Church you're not like the Baptist Church there's something that is different in this body of people hey man thank you peculiar people that's going no man can be saved by the law the law doesn't save anybody no matter whatever you do how good you look how many good deeds you do you're lost that's all you've got oh you say brother Brennan might give so much to the read father I give so much to charity I feed the widows I clothe the orphaned children and I go to church Caine done as good as that any time and was lost it's not by good works that we are saved that's by the grace of God we are saying the law was not a savior after all the law was a prison house the law only made you know you was a sinner the law pointed out your sin but it doesn't have any remedy if the policeman comes and arrest you and throws you back in jail that's the law that shows you you are a sinner but how are you going to get out that's the next thing the law was just a schoolmaster that pointed out then the law was just a policeman it had absolutely no grace you say this I want a speeding ticket a few weeks or a few months back and I was coming up over the Hayward's Hill I knew the cops they radar there all the time I'm looking at my speedo I'm going yep sweet doing ATK's I go fast maybe I was doing 82 where either I go past and I look at them as I go fast the next thing I see this guy run to his car and then jump and his carrying come and chase me I thought oh yeah maybe he's gone for the next person and he pulled me over he goes you know how fast are you going I'll swab ya about ATK's I was watching my speedo and I had my cruise control on I was just watching it he goes you're done 94s no I wasn't doing 90 a speeding I'm sorry I broke you know I broke your roll and I'll pay the fine I wasn't stealing and so he said well obviously you want to debate this they will put you're a leader and the nails so the leader come through and I wrote a nice email up and explained to them the situation on top of that the next morning I rang my boss as our vehicles have a real accurate GPS system that tracks and logs everything and tell you we how fast you were going where so I rung the boss and told him what happened and I said was I speeding and he brought up the record he said no you weren't speeding it wasn't a single point on that Haywood wrote that here were over the speed limit and so I put this on the leader and everything and sent it off to the place and I get an email back and it was harsh because it was the law as a policeman there's no Grayson at all and it said I'm sorry games are over I'm not willing to pardon the Sun thus the speeding ticket its way and a law and then have you bring this to court the judge in the jury will always take the policeman's word over any uh Nick Garrett untested GPS system I thought that just unjust you know there's no way I could get out of it I have to pay the fine I get the demerit points but I didn't thought but I'm glad that our God's not like Amen that he's made away he's made away the law pointed out there couldn't let me go but Jesus hallelujah he forgives every seven remember the harlot that was caught in the act and brought unto Jesus and all those men that they were righteous in himself and they wanted to cast the first I wanted a stone it Lord she should be stoned and Jesus said ye that are without son you cast the first stone how guilty do you think they felt ye that are without sin nobody's without son not in their flesh unconverted flesh and so he starts drawing in the sand and i wonder what he was drawing in the sand I've often wondered what he was drawing in the sand you know was he writing out the ten commandments or was it like a discernment line where he was calling out his name and then he started saying which road he walked down that night the previous night and then which door he knocked on and that one quickly got up and left before the story went any further son will always catch you you know Paul was a man that thought he was a pretty good pretty good by the law there weren't many people in the land like all he was he was up here I want to read this Philippians 3:5 circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless blameless he was a man that was right there with the law but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord the whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I made I love that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and in the Fellowship of the sufferings and they made conformable and to us here a me my righteousness comes from my faith that's then God not my own action but if the love of God's and me those things will come anyway man Abraham was not justified by his actions but by faith in the promises and we have a promise that will take us on this day from a newborn baby right the way to an adopted son I want to know Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection not and not an Noddin not on as in his order as doctrine I don't want to know him as a man that beats his wife with a stick I want to know him in the power of his resurrection oh no no I'm honor on a one-to-one basis I want to know him when I can't find the answer in the scripture than my problem that's how I want to know him then I can go straight to him and he can give me that answer I want to know what he likes Hebrews 5:12 but when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and I become such as have need of milk and not strong me but everyone that uses milk is unskillful and the word of righteous here's a babe but strong meat belongeth them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil and that's what I'm going to come to a bit later as what's taking place in us as giving us the power to discern right and wrong everyone starts this journey as a baby and if that baby doesn't grow that baby doesn't get a bit taller you start going what's wrong with my baby there's something wrong with my baby it's not growing am I not feeding at the right food as it got a disease is something the baby has to grow and a healthy baby when it grows and it comes off milking it's its appetite starts to change and these son needs a different kind of food to grow that to that next stage and then you find it grows up into a teenager and then it just eats everything because as consistently growing and it's consistently changing its appetite and that's the way we should be the more we grow into God the more our hunger changes and hungers for the Word of God and what the more I want to die then and find out what the mystery is for me yes amen you should desire for more revelation brother Branham says pray for Revelation pray for Revelation he really drives to them but if we get too busy that's what happens we get too busy and it robs us of our time that we've been to God but you are pulled to have a revelation of this message that's your right it's not too complicated you know the devil wants to tell you that it's too common it is not complicated at all right show this Daniel 12 10 meaning shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand you know God God works through the fivefold ministry right and he gives a minister a revelation maybe a tithe and the Old Testament and he opens up and he shows that and it reveals something and it reveals who you are and it reveals something to you you go man you know he needs us rejoicing do you think God gives that revelation to that Minister so he can enjoy that revelation by himself if God gives the mystery to that Minister to understand he's only giving it to channel it through him to us that you would understand that mr. Washington's 1:9 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that he might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God I mean I believe that I believe that everything that God wants to show to his bride he wants to show you if he has put something in your heart he wants to show it yeah it's given a fivefold ministry wife yes and that's God's a number of brace because it's His grace to you that you would understand this that you would get a revelation you have an attitude you know every believer as a wintered as a pointer to come to that adoption yeah if you have started there's an appointed time when you will get it maybe it's right now right tonight maybe it's not for another couple years but if you've started your journey there's an appointed find that you will come have been a full adopted son of God having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of as well so it's heads good pleasure that you would be prison predestinated unto adoption because he's the author and finisher of your faith not just the author that has finisher Donna door just a little bit of an overview of adoption because I know it will have been taught but I just want to go over it I just felt to go over it from the adoption message now what is adoption listen your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placement when you were born again John 1:17 I believe when we were born of the Spirit of God we are the sons of God but we are predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get but the sons of the last state see we're predestinated unto adoption now here we are now this is what hurts inter crossed a little they say I got born again praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about so you were predestinated unto the adoption that's a placing of a son so your baptism was not the time when you became an adopted son that just started your journey that was your birth and now there's journey you have to go through but there's an appointed time when it all had the first stage of your adoption as justification because it comes in a three-stage process God's perfected entries and he perfects his bride and three and brother Branham types up to Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan zli and he said this is this is the three stages of adoption in the first stage under justification is believing Moses and coming out of Egypt and sometimes that can be the hardest thing to come out of Egypt I'm gonna show just in a minute why this is so hard even Jesus when he was baptized he had the hardest temptation in his ministry and after he came up out of the waters that devil takes it and now that dealing bevel gives him all the temptation at the time of his baptism it's a dangerous time at the time to pilot through the in Egypt the death angels coming to strike the firstborn there's people coming out and at birth out of Egypt and Pharaohs army is chasing chasing he he doesn't want to let you go as you're coming out of sin you're coming out of the world and he's right behind you chasing you he doesn't want you to make it across the river doesn't want you to cross the sea he's not just going to let you leave gonna put up by ya and you have to be prepared to lay everything down so there's a song a worldly song and I just want to bring up the lyrics because this is I've really identified the song in the past and I just think well because you know we have a song that the Lord and that's anointed but year every spirit has a song and even Satan can anoint and this song really shows one of these fallen angels that was deceived by Satan when you weren't deceived by his life before the foundation of the world there were people that were to see and they didn't want to be deceived they one of the worship God God created the angels to worship but Satan to see and now there's these spirits in the earth that have fallen angels you know or not sure so this is a song written by the Eagles as funny it's written by the Eagles been there their real Eagle anointing is for the bride and they wrote the song Hotel California and I want to show you how each up to such a threat it says on a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair warm smell of colitas rising up through the air up in the head and the distance I saw a shimmering light and this is what brother Brennan was saying about the gospel the gospel doesn't shine it glows a Hollywood shimmers like that snake that gets up it does it dancer it catches your your attention at the hid in the distance I saw a shimmering light my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night there she stood in the doorway I heard them in Bell and I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell then she lit up a candle and showed me the way there were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say welcome to the hotel california such a lovely place such a lovely place face plenty of room at the hotel california any time of the year you find it here it's sin it's this is a place that looks good it looks attractive such a lovely place such a lovely face and it draws you in but you're going to see what happens this that was the first verse and I've skipped out a bit I want to show you the last verse just so I can show you a trap of this mirrors on the ceiling the pink champagne on ice and she said we are all just prisoners here of our own device and in the Masters chambers they gathered for the face they stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the Beast the last thing I remember was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before relax said the night man we are programmed to receive you can checkout any time you like but you can never leave that's what Egypt does you can never leave once you once you give over to Satan and you go and you get to a point where you can't come back and look at the spirit saying it's saying last thing I remember was running for the door I had to find a passage back to the place I was before you think son looks attractive you will find you do not want to be it's a trap that it's a little shimmering light and it drew you in but then you find that wasn't where you wanted to be at all and it says they stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the bees they don't want to be there they want to kill this base and a stealing knife will not kill it a devil because our weapons are not carnal but we have a we have a sword that is not made of steel and it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it will kill the devil and we'll tell the beasts and we can use that don't be caught up in this trap as this as a trap I actually have passion for this person writing the song I feel so bad for them because I know it's it's an anointing as a spirit trying out of something that was happening beyond a dimension we can see you know and and the devil can anoint our flesh because as brother Nathan was saying our souls converted you know but the spirit and the flesh is still subject it's still subject to this fallen world and so now you'll see young people when they come up into that time of life and then things are happening and the devil can anoint your flesh and you have to be so careful because you know you'll see you'll see a girl and she and she thinks this boys so cute and attractive you know and it looks like he's headed here depth on a deep fryer and been dragged through the bush backwards you know and and she and she guys doesn't he's so cute you know and we all think he looks like a deep-fried rooster it's but it's insanity it's it's an anointing upon the flesh when when when you know you're looking at something and it looks so pretty and everyone else is going what do I don't see what are you looking at yeah that's an anointing that comes on the fish and that's why brother branham see we should be filled with the Holy Ghost before we even start looking for a part because we need to be able to discern between good and evil if you've heard something in your heart saying come out of Egypt that's Moses speaking to you leading you unto justification that's just your first step and adoption you know I was talking to brother Ben we were out fishing and it's as fresh over the boat we've just been talking about winner when a Christian comes into church you know and and like Nadine and I when we first come into church and I've probably come in a hoodie and she was wearing her jeans and Ben and I were talking about this and and you know he let's fish over the boat I said when was a lot less at fish clean you know especially not cleaner it's as dirty and slimy and it's just coming the boat and it's it's gone and why kill even its Karlovac it's as a table fish but it's got something that's got a process of time before that becomes a clean fish on my plate and at this stage of your journey when you are under justification a child a child is not responsible for a sentence because it doesn't know the Senate that's just justified you come to the Lord and things cling to you and they come with and you don't actually realize those things as sin and God Betty says you know well right now at this stage of my child's life maybe the child is just young there's a small trial and daddy's is taking here a small child and daddy takes upon the son of that child he's responsible for that child he doesn't want to see as as child go astray he that he teaches it right but he's responsible for that child responsible for what that child does that's and as that child is growing he's under a tutor he's and brother branham said the Holy Spirit is our tutor so when you were born again we knew when you were baptized you received the Holy Spirit there's something as it's going to change along your journey in there you still have the Holy Spirit the whole way that's something when you become an adopted son changes and I'll get to that soon Scripture I don't have it written down lations for this one now I say that a year as long as he has a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed so an ear is as long as he has a child he different nothing from a servant I don't want to be a servant of price I want to be his bride so I want to take the next step in my journey and move on to sanctification so once you've come out of Egypt and you come to that red sea and you go through the Red Sea and the Devils dying and the river as you come through because you're about to walk through a new stage under sanctification and sometimes this is the longest period and a person's journey from birth to adoption as Israel spent such a long time in the desert wandering in the desert and a time of Saint Haitian and you know this this is the time when some people maybe receive every think they needing and wash themselves and go straight into adoption but it's a time when we can you know these things that happened in the desert a lot of complaining and and and I was thinking about this this week and I thought you know the people that would get in complained it were generally the people that were in charge you know Moses is not the only one not the only holy one beause you know his other holy men that was always going towards the hid and I don't even want to get to a place where all I can do is complain about church you know my brother Andy was singing this song I was glad when they said let us go into the house I love God it's a joy to go to the house of the Lord I don't come to the house of the Lord the fine fault I have made a conscious decision in my mind that I do not want to come to the house of the Lord the find fault I want to come here to worship God my purpose is to come here and worship God I don't want to look and you think well when on baptize everything's going to be good from now on everything's gonna be fine you know and you find out that your troubles only begin this is a hard fight because God really wants to kiss you and see what you're made of so we know look at adoption I like to face it by that color Hebrew child would be placed and around the age of 12 to 13 a child comes to a ceremony called Barnet's and I thought I wonder what Bar Mitzvah means so when I was looking at this ayat I looked at the meaning of the word brother Tuen Bar Mitzvah it means one who was subject to the law so at that time when you were a small child daddy was responsible for you under justification daddy took upon yourself he forgives you but then you come to a time maybe about 12 or 13 where now you're getting an understanding of what what is good and what's wrong and now you become one that is subject to the law you come under sanctification now daddy's no longer going to be responsible for your son's here if you sin you're going to start to pay there are consequences of some of those things that you're doing so every believer comes into this period of sanctification and you are now responsible you're coming to a point in your walk with the Lord that you're responsible for your action and it's a second stage in your journey to adoption and Jesus you know I was thinking when Jesus was twelve years old as they went to Jerusalem and his parents when they leave they're like we're where's our son and Jesus was in the temple teacher and as he when his parents come to him they said well what are you doing he said don't you know I should be about my father's business because about this time and the Hebrew tradition their child had been under atutor up until this time dad was too busy to look after the child though mom or auntie's whoever had been looking after the child now he comes up to a point where he's going to start to learn the trade of his father so now the child would learn what that is like and under the sanctification we begin to learn what there's life and Jesus was saying don't you know I should be about my father's business but his natural family were saying well he's going to start to be a carpenter and he's going to build tables or do whatever they do but he was about his father's business and the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 was because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right it's not a man got it in his right mind that what wants to do right is something that won't let you do right that's that right that's the devil right you say I want I want to make this decision now and I'm not just talking about a 12 and a 13 euro but you've been living under a period of sanctification for a long time you've been in Egypt you've been wandering around in circles and you couldn't quite get their vote and there's something that's just stopping you from doing it and he says it's the devil but you can have the book you don't have to be stuck by that devil his time is up giving in those eviction notice you know when they were stuck there and they were complaining you know what were they really saying there was you know they came to the mountain to Mount Sinai and there was a trumpet sounding on that mountain and I was looking at the Hebrew meanings of the word because there was there was a trumpet that sounded for war and there was a trumpet that sounded for Jubilee they were they were a secret trumpet they had a different meaning but this trumpet that was sounding on Mount Sinai was a jubilee trumpet trumpet of Jubilee and they were saying well we don't we're afraid Moses we don't think we can speak to God but but we want to pass there but we we want a man we want a denomination we want we want a bore of looking a book of law and order you know Moses you speak you speak the God but God wants us bright to come to a place where it's direct and line communication between you and Christ that's where I want to come behold I Paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing brightest afire game.the every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law Christ has become no effective effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law you have fallen from grace but we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith so if you want to be stuck under the law and be so critical on that thing you have to be responsible for all of them yeah and I can say myself I'll fail I just couldn't do it I can't be responsible for that so I'm glad that the law was only my schoolmaster I would be in big trouble you know these people didn't know how to be a free people they come out of Egypt they've been slaves they didn't know how to be a free people and many message people with being slaves to under man's tradition because they doesn't know they've come out of the nomination a time and denomination when Pentecost really sprung up from Azusa Street and then it big what CLE quickly began to denominator you know it was only a few years after the Pentecostal revival that it started to denominator and to baptize free times faced board backwards five God's all these different things then men became slaves under bondage and then when this jubilee trumpet sounded we're like the people in Egypt we'd been slaves and we didn't know how to be a free people but Christ is leading us to be a free people my brother sister we are trying to make denominations we're trying to build churches we're trying to organize people educate it's all in vain until the love of God comes you want to speak with tongues you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to do certain things to make yourself a Christian you'll never be until the love of God takes over in your heart that tears the middle out of them that makes you feel for your brother that'll make you act like a man like a child of God and put Christ and knew the hope of glory amen let's move on here on our journey because I don't want to get stuck in the desert I want to enter into Kanaan's land glory and you know the longer you spend under that time the more you get eaten with a stick tired the law was necessary for a time but that was a past age and the pillar of fires moved on the pillar of fire is not an Egypt anymore and I'm following that that pillar of fire so they come to the Jordan River and Canaan's lands just on the other side there's another step of faith you have to have to take to get in the devil does not want you to that but one foot in that land something a step that you have to pay and as you go through the Jordan River all those last little things that that really nagged you for years and years you couldn't shake off they just somehow get washed down the river as you go through its brother handy said right down into the Dead Sea because your old husband has to die you know you cannot if you are a married person you cannot get remarried if you have another husband so their old husband has to die that old suddenly nature you were married to has to die go into the Dead Sea as you can't just be divorce insta go into the Dead Sea and then you can come into Canaan slain because in Canaan's land as where you get married to Christ hallelujah amen and you know Canaan's land as this is the bride age that we call Taleban on the other side and Egypt that's Laodicea but we're coming over into the space and to this bride age and and and it really is just an anointing that lets you love above the son of a Jew you have to come to a place where you're you know you're you're only one-third converted right your soul is converted it's taking a rapturous and a bride ages it's in this breach between this sinful horrible place we are in the Millennium your souls of sinning that we're stuck we have to come out of it amen amen and so by the time this Hebrew son is around 33 naturally speaking because I'm talking this a natural spiritual type this child's growing now that's progressing it's been in an apprenticeship up till the time he's a young man and he's been learning his father's trade he's getting pretty good at his father's trade and dad's getting it but older dad wants to retire now and he wants to be able to pass everything down to son and sons names gonna be as good as his name on the cheek this is the third stage so when Jesus was adopted on Mount Transfiguration he was 33 years old and God was saying this is my son and whom I am well pleased he him and when you can't enter this adoption your work is just began to because you become a final voice to the final age and thus 33 I just kept seeing its significance and dates and events so it was 19 and 33 when the seventh angel messenger was standing in that High River baptizing the seventeenth verse them was seven thousand people standing on the bank as a witness and that pillar of fire come down over him and said as I was most was with Moses so will I be with you and your foreign the second coming of Christ 19:33 god ties his word together with numbers like you know I've seen that and there's word for quite a while so a Hebrew son by the time he's 33 is reached maturity but there's still a work to be done I want to show you a scripture that I just it just spoke to me and I know with a sort of mind if I just wanted to bring it out if it will count me out I think I could stop working oh there we go first kings and the days that David reigned over Israel for forty years seven years reigned here in Hebron and 33 years reigned here in Jerusalem so now David's reign was like a type of Christ reigning and through seven Church ages in Hebron because he wasn't in this promised land of Jerusalem but he was still raining he was still the son of God and he was raining through those seventh Church ages but there was a time that he was going to be raining and the promised land just as we are going to be in the promised land we come into a promised land when we can him to adoption and his reign was 33 years in Jerusalem go right back to genesis of the original what is earth now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true sons born son build sons speak and their word is back I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so certain thing I am a believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you a raining in the name of the Lord there shall come I waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave a man the domain he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with assurance ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it oh brother Palmer waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the position of the church I want to come to a time in my walk with the Lord we are I'm a man of peace of the Son of God I'm not just a head and son of God there that there's no power you know I've been writing a song brother brother Isaac trying to help me you know if you want to see his power within stay around me as the same things he did I am manifesting as someone is going to manifest it and I'm holding on to that we're not living under a law in this land where our holy people a royal priesthood and what makes us this way if it's not the law what makes us a holy people that that's not the law on a go back to the scripture that strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age even those whose who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil and the adopted son as one that's of a full age beam has sense as they exercise but discern both good and evil though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey so when you run the speck in there and Greek meanings of this word all age that's the same word that's used here that Jesus was made and being made perfect booking about the Lord as the same word for age and perfect and it means it means to finish to fulfill to concentrate to make perfect the complete the carry through completely we accomplished the finish to bring to an end strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age for them that are complete in Christ that's the same as and you have to come to a place where you've got your complete with that stature of that perfect man has come up and it's now it's in the headstone and we're living right there's an adopted son now you don't need a law because the Spirit that is within you will soon good and evil you've come to that plate of face of being weak positionally place Luke 6:40 as if the disciple is not above his master for everyone that is perfect shall be as has mastered the answers Master amateur God's this bride age is for mature adopted sons of God to be manifested you know you may be the only Jesus Christ of this world sees they might not see him in his word they'll see him when he when they stand before the judgment every man or seeing then but you may be before the rep's of the only manifestation of Jesus Christ see as he is you are in this world brother Branham said she is him adopted caught up into his likeness just like him be like Jesus and when the Hebrews son was adopted into the family the garment that father made a big scene of us if this is my son he's kind he looks just like we here is exactly what I wanted them to be when he was just a child and I had this thought in my mind of what my child would look like and that he would take over my family business and now he's here and so this is a big thing too far and so now father will take him out and he packs a finest garment and he arrays him in his finest garment this is my son he's going to take over hit that he has my inheritance and it was what was taking place on Mount Transfiguration when Peter James John and Peter they've Jesus was and his glorified body God was showing this is my this is my son and whom I am well-pleased and when the bride comes to this place is this should be arrayed in fine linen gamma because it's a wedding garment when you come to the place of adoption it's your marriage to Christ you come as just as he as you're in home and when you come to this position you are a very peculiar these people very strange very strange to the world nobody understands you and you were a royal priesthood there's something other than the law that makes you live a clean life and the Lord just gave me this little thought and it's an exodus 2830 and now shall put in the breasts place breastplate of judgement the Urim and Thummim and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth them before the Lord and Aaron shall bring the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually now in the Old Testament when somebody had a dream or a vision and they would bring it before Aaron and he had this it was like some lights that were on his chest and they would they would tell the vision and it was bright they would light up and they would know that it was right but we are called to be a royal priest and now when you come into this place of adoption there's something in your heart and when something's brought before you by the minister or somebody sharing and and it lights up and it sees a me and that's the truth or or it doesn't flash it's the person's telling you what they're believing and it doesn't flash because now there's something in your heart is a urine thumb and it's telling you whether this is right or not and it's it's letting you discern both good and evil not because you're scared that you're going to get a beating up from the Lord that's something that's within you I don't live a holy consecrated life because I feel the law as only my schoolmaster I love a consecrated life because I love God I want to know what he liked you know Easter when she when when she was just learning what the King likes you there were many girls there were many woman that were a spouse a Solomon there they were training to that poppy potential wife and they were probably all been silly and and wanted you know they had a image in their own mind of what the king would like you know they probably thought well if I just wear my top a little bit lower and this you know certain dress in a king will like me more but Esther didn't listen to what was in her own head she wanted to know she wanted a man to tell her what the King liked she wanted to know from her heart what the King liked and she found out what the King liked and the King chose her to be be his bride not because she had to do it she didn't have to do it but she wanted to know what the King liked and that's paid off later on because when all of Israel was in trouble and they were going to die and she hadn't been before the King for a long time and she was now again going to have to go before the presence of the king she could go and before the king and make a decision because she knew what the king was looking for she knew have I coming before the king that he's going to receive me I want to know that when I come and before the king he's receiving me because I'm manifesting what he has in his mind I'm manifesting the image that he wants me to look like I just pray that you know we can all come to that place of adoption because when the church comes to a place where it grows up from a little baby and to an adolescent and then it comes it's learned of God it's been through a period of justification it's been through a period of sanctification now it comes all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we get the church in that place where everybody is living under the baptism of the Holy Ghost I see it before you had the bat you have the Holy Ghost right from your birth you receive the Holy Ghost even a child when it is born it receives its spirit brother Brennan see but when you come up to that place of adoption now you become a manifestation of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost inside you is coming forth and making manifestation just like your father so don't think the devil hold you back don't they don't only don't trap you in Egypt don't mean don't stay there too long you stay there too long and you stuck that's somewhere that you can you can check out in check out anytime you like you can you can come to church for a few weeks but he'll never let you leave it has to be a consecration made from your heart as you love amen I love brother Andy would you come up and the musicians and we'll sing some songs and let's just make a consecration to the Lord say Lord receive me Lord I consecrate my life to you not because I have not because I fear you know not because I'm scared i i i worship you because I love you and I just want to express my love you and I want to learn of you not because you're beating me with it with a cane not because you're a schoolmaster and you're beating me but I want to serve you because I love and I want to walkin out I want to walk in the power of his resurrection so I just request we sing one song at the set song and their brother Ben how how I am Lord okay one verse in the chorus a min it'll do you'll have to swap your own you gotta you know how to play the song or hey see ya they stand on Calvary he died to

[Music] bye babe and I was ready dad bye I can't see praise God praise God I'm a child [Applause] [Music] oh yes [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] blah by me I was ready and now can sing oh praise God praise God I'm a child of the [Music] I mean god bless you richly I mean I'm happy to have hit the weight tonight are you happy I'm very excited that the world can speak to us in such a way god bless you so much for other james and my testimony is very big very very big but I'll make it short I mean that is the Wednesday night until now the Lord has has been wonderful to us and Dave I just yesterday sister Robin Cynthia daily a daily devotional from the book and it was reading the scripture was Psalm 1 1 6 I don't know if any of the few ready it was 1 1 6 and the verses that blessed me so much was from verse number 10 if I'm not mistaken amen I don't read it every day and and I know you do and also but yesterday's one the Lord made me to read it all of these and it touched my heart I don't know why but he just talked to my heart I was busy studying and I read that and he just stuck to my heart only later on I understood why the Lord wanted me to read it it was talking about giving thanks to God and making to appreciate all his benefits that he has given you and you know and he says I'm just paraphrasing that I was seeing and I'll praise him and I'll thank him in the midst of your people I'll and worship you or I'll thank you in Jerusalem can you remember that one so later on my wife sent me a message here that the immigration people have just approved our residence okay so I thought it was a joke so I thought it was not I thought she didn't see properly then she sent me a screenshot of her profile that has got to to deserves one my current work visa that shows that when I finished my studies in much sorry the visa was granted until twenty first twenty twenty one much so now it shows a new one that says residents approved so I thought the first thing that came to my mind was that that that this a scripture that I read in the morning that says from us give thanks to the Lord and and and and before his people and ensure glory to the Lord for all his benefits because I realized that he's the wonderful God and he's got so many ways to show you how much he loves us like my brother was preaching tonight amen so it looks like the Lord is slowly he's slowly making as part of you sing we are now stuck with you looks like it's Muse now start with you but it's wonderful to to be stuck with one another because you're going to be stuck with each other through all eternity so with those few ways brothers and sisters it may not be such a big thing but for us it means a lot because so many people come to this country and they look for resilience and therefore this and that and there are much better people much better qualified people know eloquent than us so they can rest they don't get residuals some go home some get frustrated different things happen some of them they just approved the one partner and they disapproved a partner some of them they said no I discharge why are the eyes red you don't approve this one is sick so there's so many dynamics around the issue of residence we haven't received the letters yet we only saw the profile that said approved and we are taking it by faith that the Kiwis are too slow they'll send a letter C they'll send a letter soon but all we can say is that we want to give glory and honor and thanks give him to the Lord and the only place where we can do that is to come before his people according to that scripture of Psalm 1:1 six just from verse 10 to make its praises and glory and known before his people but this is where we meet God is an omniscient omnipresent God but if you want to meet him and talk to face him you see right now on facing him I'm talking to him because you are part of him so with those few words I want to thank you all of you for your for your an ending prayers and your life in prayers let's continue to pray for one another and I believe God is going to do more all these things they are happening in our lives it's not much about our worldly well-being of course it's about our worldly welfare but it is really about our heavenly welfare if if God can do anything to help you to see that we've got a home we need to come to that stage of adoption so that we are ready when the lifeboat come we'll jump in and we have gone if the Lord can do anything you know if if we can do anything you will do it for you to see that he loves you and your journey doesn't end up here so thank you so much and may God richly bless you and there we are happy I'm a Kingdom priests to God amen hallelujah to the lamb list and we'll sing this before
