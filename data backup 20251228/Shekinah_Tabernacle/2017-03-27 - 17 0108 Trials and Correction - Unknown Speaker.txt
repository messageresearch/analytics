glory amen amen brother Isaac positions I mean good morning everyone amen god bless you all good to be home it's good to go away but it's good to be home amen I'm in scraping off it I was great too great to be at Melanie Moss is bleeding it was neat it's always neat when you're at occasion where everyone's happy for the people you know everyone's happy to be there and it's just a beautiful day so um yeah phrase the Lord Lord willing they'll come visit us before they go to Switzerland so it should be which we great I mean let's just go to Deuteronomy chapter 8 and it's got 8 and verse 1 down to verse 8 see all the commandments are Deuteronomy 8 and verse 1 all the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your father's that thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God has led the least forty years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee and to know what is in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and he suffered eater hunger and fiddly with manner which thou knowest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make the know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live the arraignment wax not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years they'll shut also considering thy heart that as a man chase it with his son so the LORD thy God chase nathie therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear him for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains and dip set spring out of valleys and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey amen may the lord bless us would you may you may have your seats I want to speak I want to speak today about about trials and correction may seem a bit of an odd odd kind of subject but I was just thinking about a watch-night service and I just want to make a few comments about how you know man does God it has different personalities but there is not one personality that God uses above any others so some are like Peter some are like Paul some are like Andrew they're all very different but God does not use a one personality above another and then also how God and in the trials that that people I go through is not necess sometimes it's because the gift of them is great like like brother BAM he went through some great trials because he was the message into the age but sometimes it's a trial other times it's a correction and the scripture says there yo there's no trial that we suffer which is common to man Zevon has trials everyone goes through the same things but sometimes it's God correcting us sometimes it's just a trial but there's a reason all for it so you know she takes so so brother brave season things that are to be he says some mean a real blusterous and some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom look at st. Peter and judging by Andrew Andrew as a great prayer warrior stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like more of more of like the prophet or something and sit back see so they're all all different kinds but you see Paul was different to Peter and Peter was different to Andrew but they all had their place in the body so they didn't hit they didn't just have all one kind of personality and so our trials and so many times that you know trials can be or correction can be depending upon us and if we're willing to take the easy way yo yo just like children you know the more they don't listen the more you've got to apply the pressure on them to change their ways a little bit because chastisement which is actually correction is because you have their best interest in mind it's not just to be mean and and you know make their life real rigid and all these things but it's too it's to set them in a certain direction and the more yield that they could say you could say they are or the more yielded we are to the to the will of God then the easier things get when it comes to correction but we can still have very hard trials but so this I just want to make that differentiation is a difference between a trial as in a trial and a trial as in the Lord correcting you now I want to let's go down to 0 it's just a Hindu tirana me act which get a bit of a study today but you see it says in the scripture that God led Israel out of Egypt as it says out of Egypt have I called my son so this was now God as a people he was calling Israel his son or his child and now he had a he had a place in mind for his son and that was have dominion over his inheritance and so God had to mold and shape his son in order to possess that inheritance and it's the same thing with us you know the scripture tells us we are we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons and that word adoption of sons and the Greek means the placing of the song it doesn't mean that I go to another country and I find a child that's not my blood relative and then I take them into my family I signed some paperwork saying legally though now my son that is not viable adoption Bible adoption as a son and a son is the same as a daughter is birthed into the family and then the father faces that child under tutorship until finally that child comes to a place of maturity where the Sun or the daughter I put it that way acts exactly like the father and then the father places publicly gives a public declaration in a ceremony that this child is that there there would as good as my word and actually gives the son or daughter dominion of everything the father has so it's placing the it's placing the child into the family okay so so here in Deuteronomy 8 we see that the reason God was taking Israel and through the wilderness and the way he did is because he was wanting them not to lean upon their own ability he was he was wanting them not to lean upon what they could do because remember all they knew so okay so then you have to be slaves in Egypt but they knew how to grow crops then you had to provide in a certain fashion for their children and for their family they knew how to do those things but God was going to take them on a journey where it was really going to turn all that on its head where they had to come to understand and to know that it was actually God providing for them that through every trial in the wilderness God gave a way of provisional way of escape that they could not trust in their own self and their own ability but they would lean upon the father and this is very important because you know even it says here you know we read there how they you know how he humbled the verse 3 and suffered lead a hunger to feed the with manner which thou knewest not neither did thy father's know so they so they were experiencing things wasn't just the miracles but they are experiencing things their fathers knew nothing about then you one day the promise was going to come but now they are living at the promise so they were they were living a way of life that was very different to their previous generations of of Israel and God was doing this because he was trying to teach them correct their ways that when they come into the land they wouldn't turn out to be like the Egyptians or the other nations they wouldn't lean upon their own understanding of their own ability but they would they would have a rest and an assurance that if God had brought them to such a place thank God would look after them it's the same thing with us you know we our lives when God came your way you look at your parents and your or your grandparents your your forebears and I'm not talking about the kind of society they lived in but what did they do maybe that you know maybe go to church have some religious thing they'd work they had their family you know God would deal in a certain way but now comes into a different kind of season a totally different kind of season where God doesn't want us to lean upon maybe the thinking of our forebears even though there's a lot of good in it but he wants us to walk in a way that they know nothing off because it wasn't their season whatever God that in their season doddle you know doesn't mean they're lost i'm not saying that in any way but now God brings us into a different season and brings a generation into a different way and he does that so we have to as as believers we have to walk in a certain way believe in God in a certain way that is different to maybe what we've done in the past we do because he's wanting to see now now when no this is my thinking but when God says says that he brought them into the wilderness and led them 40 years they're too humble the in to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart I don't think he was he was doing it in a way just to show all the bed he wasn't looking for the bed he was looking he was really wanting to prove to them what was in them this is just my thinking because he because God he doesn't he doesn't crush people sometimes he does but he doesn't just leave them crushed but he rebuilds them and he had to take them into the wilderness because he had to rebuild Israel because you know why did one generation say we can't take the land the other generation there was no question you know they didn't have a big public meeting in then and in the spice you know the two spies give their report after they came out of Jericho they just followed they said as you're with Moses as God wills as Moses Joshua sighs with you you know there was no dispute they just they were just in harmony they were under expectation they are full of faith they were yo it had been bad been proved you know God was God was really revealing to them what was in them that's the same thing with us we don't really know what's within us we look within and I was thinking this morning you know you know you can look within yourself and all you can see is mainly maybe you know you're the failures of your character you know your pain or hurt or whatever you may be carrying or bad memories or your limitations but God doesn't want us he doesn't want us to look at those things you know he doesn't want us just to that's not to prove what's within thee because that's not the thing that God is leaning upon or trusting him he's wanting to prove to you that your faith is real that your faith has work and it is working and you have a full confidence and assurance you know you have to really look at and say God you called me in spite of me you saved me in spite of me you sanctified me in spite of me you transformed me in spite of me you're walking with me this great holy God that they couldn't even approach in the Old Testament they had to set boundaries around Mount Sinai they couldn't go near where Moses went up and Yong Yong to the Prince of God only the high priest should go into the holy of holies once a year with the blood they are all you know if we were there we would be in the outer court they see the priests Cohen that come out you know into the inner court then you see the high priest going we couldn't go in maybe see the pillar of fire come down on the tap on the tent I don't know but we couldn't go into his presence and even even you know God judge sends so severely it's like leprosy is a type of sin he said anyone that's got leprosy has to be thrust without the camp they couldn't even be in the camp that's how much God you know views views sin but yet he found us and by the blood of Jesus Christ he cleansed us a mint and and it's not and even in our failures in our fluster a shins and what we can see will think ourselves to be he still walks with us he doesn't get sick of us he doesn't you know many times I her brother on Spencer say this he says yeah many times he he thinks God just going to throw them in the rubbish bin and just walk on I'm sick if you you know but God doesn't get that way even if we may get sick of ourselves God doesn't get sick of us because we are his children his children are going to make it his children cannot be lost you know people say how could a loving God send his children to you know to be destroyed in a lake of fire he's not sending any of his children they're not one of them are going to end up in that place and so he's not he's not going to you know he's not going to let you go but that doesn't mean the road isn't rocky yeah because he has you know he's a father and he's not maybe a lazy father or indifferent father he's a very focused loving father I'm so glad that's true so he's wanting and Israel that's what Israel they went through the Red Sea you know they had all those things happen to them because they really needed to sit back and say God brought us out of Egypt that's why they are told tell these things to your children and to your children's children keep the testimonial life because they had to tell them God did this for us God even told us these are mightier nations that they're stronger nations in the land but it's not you you have to go fight but but the Lord will fight the battle God gave us Jericho we didn't have the equipment to do it God brought the walls down God open the entrance into the land God open the word to us I think God gave us you know let our places of of your cities of refuge God placed them there amen owl city of refuge is Jesus Christ hallelujah you know yours reading and you know I was reading Deuteronomy I was just enjoying it yo there's the you know the law of the kinsman redeemer it is a gesture edema you're near family member that's fallen into debt but part of the kismet Redeemers role is to be the Avenger of blood now what that is now is that just say if I mistake well just our win and murdered someone but I was trying to say it was an accident I could run into a city of refuge and I could profess dollars an action because of us an accident you kill someone it comes before the court and you can get off you get off as an accident but if you willfully kill someone then run to the City of Refuge the Avenger of blood who's the near kinsman has the has the privilege to go take that person and and revenge the death of their family member upon that one and take his life we have a kinsman we have a kinsman that didn't just redeem us out of out of slavery and bondage he has thee he has the privilege now to exact all the judgment that we should have received has now gone on the head of our accuser amen and now now our Lord Jesus is the Avenger of blood hallelujah that he's going to now drag Satan he's going to throw them into a lake of fire and to me I don't think there's going to be much ceremonial time he's just going to throw them and I may not know I was thing to myself I'd love to see him going but do I want to waste my time has he gone he's gone good praise the Lord let's move on I'm not going to give him that you know you know what I mean you don't want to drag it up just it's just get rid of this guy I'm done Alleluia so we have an Avenger of blood amen and he's our kinsman now so they they they had to God was proving them and he was hump and any humbled them that they could understand what they would know in their hearts not mentally known their hearts God brought us this way God place us in the land God did all these things for us but it was their faith sees what he who you know God told them you're you're a special nation of people you're my you're my holy nation your royal nation and he wanted them to to recognize that not in a proud way but in a humble way there no doubt would have been other slaves in Egypt there would have been Ethiopian slaves there would have been all different kind of nation slaves in Egypt maybe not at the size of the Hebrews you know in terms of population but there would have been other slaves why didn't God deliver them because he delivered Israel because they were the ones that he wanted to place in the promised land and it's like us you say well this world is very dark it is but I'm glad he found me I'm glad he saved me there are billions of people upon the earth the day I got saved by a Yeti you know he saved me and he had a purpose it's like he saved you he got ahold of you because he's a P as a purpose in mind Amen because he saw he saw a part of himself in you hallelujah no this word chastise earth here in Deuteronomy reread chastise it means literally with blows or figuratively with words as to instruct us to correct to instruct to punish to reform so God has a God has a certain way he wants you to go and he will and we'll go into the new test me sir every Sun that comes to God must be chastised must be corrected and it says he scourges every son that comes to him so I went on Google looked at scourging I looked at Jesus and the you know it's not a little there you go that's ask you lose a bit of skin a lot of skin you get flailed but this is what God you know I remember when I was with the Lord start dealing with me and then he still does feels like he just rips my height off me but it's always for my good amen praise God because He loves us is that may sound pretty strange but it's like if my girls ran out on the road I wouldn't just call out you know do you want to come back and you know I'd grab them I gang them up I'd throw them inside you know I would make them remember that day because I don't want them getting killed but if I didn't really love them I let them go on the road oh there's one gone oh well see you're such a nice girl I really loved it no I didn't if I really love drug would have got her out of harm's way now the word humbled it's having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's importance that doesn't mean if you you have low self-esteem or low but to me to be humble is to have low estimate of one's importance compared to God or compared to other people I mean where you make where where your heart is you are the servant and their greater than you remember a great person makes other people feel great amen now this is just in the message of grace I like I was searching a humble heart he says but it takes the simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever takes a humbled heart dedicated to God bring Jesus Christ unto present tense I mean if it had taken theology then it would then it would then what would the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance us poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge not by power by might but by my spirit saith God I'll unfold this mystery and he'll try to grace grace with shoutings and crying's that's what it is today God's amazing grace to his people how he takes the illiterate the unlearned and shows that Jesus is the same Alleluia so it takes a humbled heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into the present tense and that's exactly with all our hearts that's what we want to do now let's go to first Peter 1 and 7 now first Peter one and seven I know this is all we'll go from verse 6 wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be yea in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth that be tried with fire might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love and whom though you now see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so he says the trial of your faith there's much more precious than of gold that perishes thought be tried with fire so there are trials which try our faith I'm just going to cover these things kind of briefly there are trials that try our faith because God is willing to prove your faith that it works that what you've what you've received in your heart is not in your head because it was just in your head when trials come you know it won't hold you but when it becomes a living revelation in your heart then it will be tried but then you'll you know God knows how important revelation is God knows the value of who of him imparting his word to assault he knows the value of that but we really but us your infinite of a finite rather human beings we need to learn the value of it we need to actually end with God you don't learn up here you learn by doing you learn by experience and so God has to show you yo how great your faith is because it's when your faith has tried you could look back at that trial and say I'm still on my feet I'm still praising God and you may not be you may be like job on the ash heap he didn't understand what was going on but he was still you know he did complain about it but he was still standing he lost everything but he was still standing but his faith was being tried and it's like us you say well that's blind faith faith is blind sometimes faith is blind we have the assurance of a rapture so we have the assurance of a body change we have the assurance that we're going to crown him king of kings and Lord of lords we have the assurance that that we're going to be on this earth for a thousand years in the millennium and the devil's going to be bound we have the assurance that we're going to rule or reign with Christ we have the assurance that we're not coming to the great white throne judgment to be judged but we're there with the judge judging the world and the angels we have that assurance we have the assurance that you know that we are literally going to walk within the New Jerusalem and we're going to see it come down upon the earth and we're going to walk in the gates lift the upper gates and be lifted up that the King of glory may come and we have the assurance of those things we have the assurance that if we all have cardiac arrest right now and die that will be in glory we have the assurance that God will take us there it's not anything that we all have we done everything just right have you've committed your life to him he'll take you there so we know those things and it's in here that we know those things we know that Jesus has he's come to prepare a bride and however we found grace on the site we may never really fathom it but we know that we're one of those number their blood wash number we know those things and we know he's preparing us for the wedding supper of the Lamb we know those things so our faith in those regards is not blind because we see it that's in here we see it we know it amen more than just reading Scripture and all that sounds lovely but something in us identifies that's us that's you that's me but there's sometimes in life will we don't know Lord where are you taking me and we may go through it though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil you know we know as long as we know he's leading us that's the main thing but sometimes you're walking and you say Lord what's going on and there's no answer that's when your faith is being tried that's when it's being tried because if we had you know even even brother Bram said he doesn't need because he receives he received so many thousands of visions he saw the vision he knew was going to happen he said you need more faith than me because we don't have many of us at newest envisions you know we don't know what tomorrow holds but if you saw a vision you want help tomorrow you wouldn't really need to have faith the whole dogs you knew what happened such we're now so many times we have to walk by faith that we do not know the outcome and that's when your faith astride praise God because he's wanting to he's wanting to show what you because remember faith is a revelation that's nothing you conjure up as nothing you really possess unless it's given to you you can't make it just like you can't make someone else believe without God come and go and confirming it to that person even though you may lay it out logically and it all make make sense and all those things without God giving them faith to believe it then it may you know then it will never happen and it's like us we didn't give ourselves faith they say well I prayed and I sought God and all these things happen the scripture says there's not one that seeks after him in Romans there's not one that seeks after God it is God having to put that within you and that's why we have to cry in the hunger because he put it in us so and if God has done that for us he doesn't just give it to you just say he'd go and then pull it away you know he doesn't do it that way he has your interest in mind he's interested mine now let's go to James one and one so James honor one James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren cannon all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowingness the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that he that he giveth to all men liberally and uh praedyth not and it shall be given to him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering he that wave earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wounds and tossed now a braid a--the it means to defame that is to rail to chide or to taunt and you know so it's saying you know he he doesn't upgrade as and he doesn't do that to you when you asked for wisdom he gives it liberally but notice James's go straight and count it all joy because when you fall into diverse or many temptations because it's the trying because it's the knowingness that the trying of your faith worketh patience so when you fall into diverse temptation it's actually working patience your faith worketh patience and even jesus said have you not considered the patience of jobe he was in his great trial but it was as great patience I mean but he didn't know God would answer him he didn't know he didn't know God comes down in a whirlwind and speaks he didn't know those things he just had questions and he pondered things and he was asking you know and he's talking to his friends about you know I know the tree and the seasons and nature goes round like the death burial resurrection but what about man what happens to me I don't know you know and but his patients held out that I think somehow doubting himself in you that maybe one day he'd get the answer maybe he didn't know it'd be then but if God came upon the scene and gave him the answer but it was great patience it was as patients where he could stand there in his condition and I still even though he slay me you don't trust of the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be his name and this was a man without the Holy Ghost that side of it's meant to be the oldest book of the Bible so I don't think they even had the law in those days of Moses and all those things you know all he had was the shed blood of the Lamb that's all he had all he knew was God requires a sacrifice and that's all he that was his Bible that's all he had he knew how the stars were and everything but that's all he really knew and yet he could stand there with his great patience and here we are but you have to but why is it so those those stories are the place in the Bible not to make us feel little necessarily if that makes me feel little but is to encourage you if this man can stand with the faith with the revelation he had how much more the bride of Jesus Christ where the whole word is open we were not under the blood of bulls of growth brother under the blood of Jesus Christ with a very god that came and spake how the world wonder job comes and dwells and his children hallelujah it's meant to I trusted encourages you may say Lord I can never amount to that but you have to remember the same faith that was in jovah's in the believer amen you've gotta tap you've got a rest and what you have how's this going to turn out I don't know but I know who's going to make it work out for my good all things romans 8 28 all things he says for we know this is ball now he didn't have a flowery bed of east he didn't set up in jerusalem and write letters and send the mountain that was it he he endured a lot of things he said before we know all things all ALL work for our good those that love God and are called according to his purpose and I trust you can say I fit that category yeah you know I trusted something he says that's me so that means all things work for my good well we may never know our police it as before but we may never know you know you take one event well how did that work for my good I had a lot of pain and scars and hurt from that thing but God has an Ingo and so heal heal heal use that event as part of what he wants to get out of you in the future because he knows that it'll work for your good you may not understand there's a lot of things in life though well why did I have to go through that it was for my good amen and we just have to rest in there one day we may know but it's interesting you know we live in this day and age of instant answers so many times you sit around talk with people and someone says something and so I want to see I was that right you go and welcome what do you say mr. Wikipedia mr. Google and yeah that is right you know you continue no I yeah I trust you've experienced that if you don't but you know but but here's now here's now God and just imagine that that you're the Apostle John and I I think he would have written down afters majan he was actually there and writing basically in real time what Jesus was doing and then so they asked him when he going to restore the kingdom Jesus says it's not for you to know Johnny said it's not for you to know it's not for you to know you know he's actually a you know he's riding down the it's actually not for me to know you know and why am I saying that sometimes we want the answer instantly but sometimes God actually says no it's not for you to know yet he's got to walk with me God's timing is always different to our timing now first Corinthians 10 and 12 it's just it let's just read this first Corinthians 10 and 12 it is wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to men but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be I'd be tempted above that you're able but with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it so you sing there's no temptation that you know there's no trial there's no hardship that we injure that's common to men so people in the world suffer the same things that believer suffers they go through the same hardships we go through but God now maybe one day down the road God will get ahold of those people but with the with the believer God has an engl member he wants us to come forth as gold he wants to mold and shape our character and correct us a certain way that would go in a certain direction and so people just go yo this life is full of trolls everyone goes through trials believer make-believe or unbeliever whatever but the believer goes through these things because he wants us to understand that is not as it's not how we should do things or how we do things it's how he does things and he wants to mold and shape us in a certain way so we go through all kinds of things and even Peter in first Peter 4 and 12 beloved think you're not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice and as much as your partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy so she just think you're not strange why this happened think are not strange these things just happen but God has an end goal for you and so he uses these things because he wants to mold and shape us he was to place us in our position he wants to adopt us and then even after the adoption the trials can still come you take David David had to be adopted as King placed his King and God proved you have proof does faith you know he anointed him by the Prophet he killed the line in the berry Kilkelly you know but had to go through a lot of hard spots in his life and through those hard spots we've got the book of psalms so God was mauling in check you know God put him in a pressure cooker not to not for David to be expressed but for Christ to be expressed for God to be expressed out of his life and then finally David comes to be king he's now on his place as king but then now the trials are still there you know sometimes you know people in the past of thought you get the Holy Ghost life's a flower bit of east know that no that's when the battle starts that's when there's real victory to be had that's when the real testing comes and so David's on the throne well what happens up that is Bathsheba there's absalon you know Satan tempts any numbers the people all those things happen but he's still king he's still king as the same thing with us we may we may fail in those kind of ways but doesn't make us not a son but because but because remember because what he did with Bathsheba the Prophet said the sword will not depart out of your house that's why epsilon read up and all those different things so we reap what we sow that law always applies to everyone it always applies to everyone and so God doesn't just you know God forgiveness of what we do but we still have to reap what we've sold yeah God forgives us God forgave David but he still reap what he sold and it's the same thing with us because we have the blood we're forgiven but we still reap what we sow sometimes God may just take it all out of the way and make it better but sometimes though you actually have to learn from this praise the Lord not saying that as a joke because he wants us to learn amen now this is in the faith of Abraham in 55 jacent did you ever have any of it child training bringing you up giving you a little proto plasma stimulation once in a while by the gospel making a correction my daddy was awful good at it yes so he believed in the golden rule it laid up over the door all the Ten Commandments out on a Hickory stick about that long brush on the end of it I tell you that made discipline in the brand him home but we love him what would we have been if we if he hadn't done it that's the way god is he brings discipline to his children trying them whipping them when they're wrong I'm happy that our Heavenly Father gives us whippings to those who are wrong and corrects me when I'm wrong Disney whippings makes me straighten up walk like you should walk as he told Abraham he's truck he's going to try him or give him trials and every Christian every Christian has to be tried Peter said think it not strange beloved when fiery trials come upon you for it's only done to prove your faith that that's more precious to you than gold we say this is not the greatest of subjects the reason you say well why do i keep getting corrected because god loves you he doesn't just let you go and you should value it amen you should value value because he because he's very interested in you you know then just let you wander off and they always he gone and go where she got and go get them back now he's very interested in you and he's hovering over you like a hint does her brew hallelujah now let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 I thought I just read all these because ultimately you know we want to we want to stay balanced well I do and God's Word is always balanced it says and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint we're now at rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chastises now this word chest either as two turrets that is education or training so it's not just it's not just it's not just you could say it's not just getting a box law for the sake of it okay but but God has your he has your training your best interest in mind and God wants to train or teach you through trials that's what he wants to do so he's actually and and his tailor-made our lives and he allows trials to come in your way because he could basically say now here's lesson number 75 but we may not know exactly you know normally when you go to a lesson the teacher says this is the outline of what I'm going to teach you today and then they then the lesson begins and then you get the homework you know and you do it you know but God now he brings you into a trial and this is always stuck with me with what brother Tim Dodds hit at our camp he said you know you know when his first wife just died very unexpectedly they did a full autopsy didn't find anything wrong with her he said lord help me to look around in this trial because I may never walk this way again so he was he was really wanting to receive the full impact of what God was trying to teach him in that moment and I think that's an incredible that's an incredible statement that he made because he's wanting to every situation is one to teach us through it could be small thing could be a very great life changing thing but he wanting he's wanting to tutor us or show us through the thing so it's not just I you've done wrong you've done wrong you've done wrong it's not that at all is like now I'm going to teach you why that's why God that's why God brought the children of Israel oh we're thirsty well i'm going to show you that i am the god that provides water you know are now we're hungry i'll send you food you've never had before to show that i'm going to look after even at a desert I'll look after you he was teaching them he was tutoring them now I brought you out I'm going to look after you I'm going to place you in the land every step of the journey I am right there nor faint without rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chastises and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chase inning God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasing earth not but if you be without chastisement where of all our potaters then you are bastards not sons furthermore we have had our fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for very for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastising for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which handgun in the feeble needs and make straight paths for your feet lease that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently least any man for fail of the grace of God least any root of bitterness springing up trouble you if I whereby many be defiled so if we endure che sitting we take the correction he deals with us as sons as I said God deals with us as sons and if he's dealing with us his sons which he is now a son is a position that's why can say son or daughter it's a position so if he deals with us a sons then he wants to place us in the fact he wants to place us in the family that our word is as good as God's Word because the father when the when the Sun came to a certain maturity or he was acting and conducting himself the same way as the father that then the tutor said now he's ready and I see the beginning and then they had a public ceremony where they said now and and the father said now now my son is as good as his word is as good as mine and he places him in charge of all things and it's the same thing with us now God wants to adopt us or place us as sons and his kingdom and we have come to the age of adoption remember Adam and Eve they were placed had dominion over all things they were you could say they had their adoption in the beginning because they were they had dominion over all things then send Cayman I think God had to rebuild Adam and Eve again because as the scripture says that Jesus was a second Adam so there's a second adam has to be sick and Eve and that's the Bride of Christ and so the second Adam came to his adoption on Mount Transfiguration this is my beloved son hear ye him and so he was placed but then now the woman has to be placed has to come back into her position and Ephesian says that we are having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we predestinated or our destiny has been predetermined so our end so so the end of our journey is as a adoption or replacing and the churches traveled 2,000 years to finally there's a bride on the earth where there is to come the season now where there's going to be an adoption or placing and we're living in that adoption age we're living at adoption age and that's why God deals with yahoo say well he's been dealing with me quite quite heavily it's because he's getting you ready for an adoption because he has to all of his bride has to come to that position hallelujah because that's the season that we live in now he deals with us in that that way so now it's season Galatians 4 and 1 now I say that the year as long as he's a child there was nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all we're joint heirs with Christ remember that but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were under bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent for the Sun made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he our sons God set forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father or my father my father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son in an air of God through Christ so this is the hour where is the placing or the adoption of sons so God if if God has two wants to adopt us or place us then he sure gonna chasing us and correct us now I'm just going to i'm just going to one this up but so let's hope you see there's Charles because there's trials and this trials because there's chasing it and those two different things and the and God doesn't make it easier for one kind of personality to walk with them then than others because otherwise he has otherwise he has an unfair favor on some group of people and a disadvantage on another group of people it's all the same doesn't matter if you're a Peter or you're an Andrew or Mary or a Martha or woman at the well or Legion in the tomb or Paul or wherever it was doesn't matter what kind of personnel you have God doesn't make it easier for one and harder for the other they're all the same but trials and correction can be one the gift if the gift is great God is going to because especially if you think God doesn't want his gifts outside the body to to to be serving the devil he doesn't want his sons and daughters to be worshiping Satan out there and he doesn't want because the gift has great influence and and Satan knows if he and get a gift it influenced it the wrong way they can do a lot of damage and so that's why people with great gifts they go through a lot of trials until they give over yeah but then some people go through a lot of trials because they can be stubborn and you can be a Peter and beast Avenue you can be an Andrew a prayer and be stubborn it's all the same so we have to I think if we could really just look at how God sees us and the engl and every day God is molding and shaping us a certain way but you have to understand now now the placing of a son I just went maybe want to close on this because it just comes to mind now sometimes we think we listen to the message sometimes we think well we have to be adopted or placed and then God could really use us because our name on the chick is as good as the father so to speak but it's not necessarily that way you take you take Israel they came out of Egypt they go through the wilderness now they come to Jordan they're going to be adopted or placed in the promised land they're going to be it's going to be the placing of the Sun now in the land when they crossed over Jordan they weren't placed but in the body so they went over Jordan which is death to self they gone to land they receive the Holy Ghost but they're not placed in the land they still took Jericho they took a I you know mighty things happen because they are in their land and then God placed them so they had the they had the ability they had the authority to do it even just when they crossed over they didn't have to wait I've got to take my mountain then then then I can chase a thousand and to 10,000 though they had thee because they were walking with God you said in the beginning they they had the same authority and power as weather with her in their land okay but now but when you're placed when God adopts or places you in the body then the gifting or yo that's within you whatever it is can work better because you're in your correct position or when will that be you'll find yourself doing it before you realize that's who you really are because it's the Spirit of God putting you wherever you meant to be and it will become natural even in spite of your personality and think what you should be sometimes God makes give someone a gift and it personnel is totally different to what that gift us it's just how he does it because he wants us to know that it is not our it's not because we're wired a certain way is because God has made us a certain way and this is all the mess that's how God works amen this is Bauer he's in word of Prayer shall we does anyone have a prayer request have have anything specific it does just raise your hands if you ever need on your heartless you know you want to raise your hands to the Lord gracious Father Lord it's always a joy to look into your word because we know it's not a storybook it's not just a myth or Allegiant but you're a living God and everything we read is is for our benefit for our good and we want to thank you Lord we can just look into your word we can look into how your children walked Lord and yesteryear and we can we can gather we can glean for other things from their warp which can help hours and dear God we're praying just help us Lord babe we always just what if we go through trials and hardship and we may not know we may not see the light at the end of the tunnel but lord help us to ways to be of a a teachable spirit Lord because you are there you're wanting to teach us and guide us through everything and father help us just to say say Lord what are you wanting to teach me in this and father may we just run this race with patients Lord because faith worketh patience our God lord I just pray you take this kind of scrambled study and put it together by your Holy Spirit and Lord may we just have a greater confidence Lord an assurance that you're our Father and you're guiding us through this journey because you want us to be conformed to your image and we just pray Lord just ask you would help us to be more yielded to your spirit Lord in every situation may may pride not even be a memory Lord may always be humble of heart and yielded to you may we never think we're better than anyone else but Lord may we always just father just may we always just thank you for your grace and mercy Lord upon us knowing that it's nothing we could ever mirror it or do even just to continue to walk with you Lord it's not because we did anything right it's because you are merciful to us and we accepted your mercy so father I just pray you just take these words Lord may dismiss us with your blessing granted father we just want to commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean this
