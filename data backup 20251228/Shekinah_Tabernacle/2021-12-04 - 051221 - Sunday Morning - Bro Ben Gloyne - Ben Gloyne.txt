and verse 15 we're going to read down to verse 20. and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shoot us our therefore should us thou therefore serve me for naught tell me what shall thy wages be and leban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leah was tenderized but rachel was beautiful and well favored and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve these seven years for rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning gracious lord we just want to thank you that lord we can look back in our lives and we can see lord your eye defuse just a just a ray oh god of light in it just lord our dungeon was lord flooded with it oh god and our chains fell off and we walked free to walk and

people today we just got to receive it in the name of jesus christ and we thank you we could read your word this morning i pray father that you're just you the great author would anoint both speaker and hero one more time we want to commit the service into your hands may come under your great divine control i just want to yield myself into your hands lord have your way today we love you so much we thank you for the special day in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning um i'd like to talk about this morning uh bringing out the best in us now we read here you know the scripture when when we look through the old testament we know that the old testament's a shadow of the new and brother branham would say in christ as the mystery god revealed we um we uh heard it um on wednesday just this but he says he's the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again see if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you've missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there's christ see every you're from that to amen and revelation every word testify of jesus christ so the prophet is telling us if we don't see christ in every scripture we need to go back and read it now there's some bits of the scripture very easy to see him in the old testament you know it's very easy to see him in the life of joseph for example you know he was the promised son i mean he was the favorite son the promised son he was a he was given the code of many colors which represents a covenant you know he was hated hated of his brethren loved of his father you know he was he was you know went down into prison just like christ was on the cross and you know one thief died one thief was saved you know like the baker was killed and the butler was restored or i hope i got that the white right way around but you know and then he was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh just like christ has exalted the right hand admit you know of the majesty on heist it's very easy to see christ in joseph's life but you know this you know there's some some characters in the scripture it's really hard to see see the lord you know but but deep down in them because they are expressing christ in their age deep down in them you could really see them now jacob's a very interesting character you know it's amazing that god would take people such as him and he would express himself even maybe just a short portion of their lives but but it would be it would god would so inspire their lives that when that when moses was inspired to write the first uh first portion of the old testament he would see their lives by vision and god would command him to write this about him and you know so jacob we know his name means supplanter and and he lived up to that name real good you know he was cheating you know he cheated his brother out of the birthright you know as you know but the thing is when when when situations come it brings out really what's within us now i pray that you know when we when we look at this today we're not just talking about good human traits this is goes beyond that it's talking about christ being expressed you know because we can look through there's many accounts of great heroism in the world but it's without god but it brings out the best in people but this is more than that but it's actually bringing out christ and the believer so jacob you know you know when when situations come it really shows what's in someone jacob though he was a scoundrel he was a supplanter he lived up to his name you know he really wanted the birthright more than anything this was this was the central theme of his life though he was the second born though he didn't have right to it because of his natural birth the order that he was born in he wanted that birthright to him it meant everything it meant everything it should be the same thing with the believer the baptism of the holy ghost being sealed into the kingdom should mean everything to us it should be more than who our friends are what our job is what people think about us it should be the main purpose of our life and what i love about jacob being a supplanter he looks for the occasion to supplant because that's what he wants he wants that birthright right and so here comes the occasion esau comes in now esau just thinks well i'm in the message i'm in the church i have it it's all fallen on my luck because i'm the firstborn and you know he felt entitled to it but just feeling entitled to something doesn't mean you it's yours amen but there's a very difference with than just taking something for granted and being entitled then really going and getting it you know the whole human race you could say is entitled to eternal life but those who really want it go and get it hallelujah so that's the kind of people we want to be and so so it came down to the crunch you know and and um and uh he saw he would he would you know he was hunting he didn't catch anything he was starving to death he thought he he wanders into jacob's tent and you know he he says i perish you know give me something to eat and we know these stories really well but let's just go through them because i want you to think about this you know jacob your esau said well i might die what's the youth of the birthright to me because jacob had his occasion he said now i can get it off him now i can get it because now he really because he wants to preserve his natural flesh and that's the carnal believer they want to preserve this thing right but we don't care about this thing we care about our soul right because jesus says don't fear that which can hurt this body but fear him that can destroy the body and soul in hell so that's the kind of people we want to be we're not trying to save our own skin right though if we have to give it you know in death whatever be martyred who cares it's just a body i've got a new one waiting in the heavens already which is far better hallelujah so so so jacob said well oh oh i'll give you this i'll give you this mess of pottage just give me the birthright and so esau because remember when pressure comes what's in us comes out and so esau decided well actually this next meal is more important than my birthright how short i he couldn't see far how short-sighted all he cared about was it there and now and so he sold his birthright for a mess of pottage and it says the bible says he despised the birthright by doing this now you think about it was jacob's tent the only one there they had a they had herdsmen it wasn't just it wasn't just you know isaac and and and rachel or rebecca sorry and then the children and that was it there were herdsmen there were there were a lot of people it wasn't just them there was a lot of people as a community do you think jacob was the only one who had had had afternoon tea he was the only one with food there were others what if esau just said no no my birthright means more to me than this i'll just go i'll find food somewhere in this camp he would have found it but all he cared about was that there and now god help us that we don't care about the there now we have we have long-range vision amen hallelujah brother brahm says this and um if i can find it i really like this he says others in handwriting on the wall he says oh god when we're there ten thousand years as the part said will be no less days to sing thy praise than when we first begun what a time that will be knowing that it's in the near future that we have this great hope and weight with great anticipations on looking upon the face of him who has been invisible in helmets and has blessed us so miraculously hallelujah so the one who's been walking among us god's done incredible things in our lives hallelujah even just to be saved you know have eternal life that's an incredible thing but he's done more than that he's healed frozen shoulders in our midst you know how how how important is it to stay in harmony with the holy ghost you know brother brown said in um i can't oh it was questions and answers he says it's so important he says if you want to see spiritual gifts you want to see god live he says you just stay in harmony with the holy ghost and then so so he said you stay in harmony with the holy ghost so i just came to a conclusion yesterday i said lord anything that causes me to be in disharmony with you i want it out of my life i want to stay in harmony with you because i want to see you live that you'll be glorified i want to be a living witness on this earth i want to see him manifest his power that he'll be glorified he says that if you stay in harmony with god then then the whole church stays that way so it's not about what is this person doing what's that person doing what this dog you just add harmony with god and if we all stand harmony with god he says then the spiritual gifts will just spread but he says the problem is is when is when is when difference comes in the vision comes in as is and our setup now people would say but a setup is a good thing no you can you can have your life so itemized and standardized and you know sectioned off and that you have your own setup that god can't work i don't want my set up i want his setup i don't want my church order i want his church order right i don't want my conduct door to doctrine i want his i mean that that that that god because we don't want to get to such a place that we cabbage down and just go through the motions and god can't live oh but we've had a good church service no i'm not this is not a lecture theater this is not a hall of learning you know forget that i've said in many a lecture probably too many in my life and it gets real yeah and you just try to absorb information and it's real tough when you're trying to learn you know um mathematics and you know and then and the lecture is some guy just walked out of a somewhere and he this droning voice and just writes on a overhead predictor i mean i mean projected enough they do that these days it's just hard but this is not that's the kind of lecture theater i'm used to in the world but this is not a lecture this is where we come in contact with almighty god i mean to see him live so who wants to see god just just spread let's stay in harmony with god amen so let's just purpose in our hearts lord anything in my life now this is that makes me to be in disharmony with you i want it gone because i want to see you live hallelujah let's live a harmonious life with the lord jesus christ because remember god wants to shake this world one more time he wants to live in a people amen one more time hallelujah we can't just look back in history and say well god did great things there this is 20 21 and soon it's going to be 2022 and i'll say this world needs jesus christ more than ever amen people are scared people are worried people are double-minded all kinds of lies and misinformation truth mixed together and you know people don't know where to stand on christ the solid rock you can stand i mean if your life is firmly founded on the revelation of jesus christ doesn't matter what category storm comes through it can be the biggest storm in history you'll just stand like the rock of jebulta the prophet says hallelujah unwavering amen amen so this one that's you know i'm under great anticipations that the one who's walked among us invisible but we feel his presence will see him face to face hallelujah and it says in the book of revelation that they that are sealed with the seal of god in their foreheads will see him face to face i'll look forward to that day that scripture is going to go from prophecy i mean to reality it's going to be manifested then it will be you can say history if i can put it that way but it's eternal but you know what i mean hallelujah so jacob you know it's hard to see the lord in his life he supplanted his brother and then when the time of the blessing came it's amazing how god would actually cause his father who was a prophet to become blinded you know because his bro his father loved esau because he looked after his daddy really well naturally he was a better son he went out hunting and everyone loves free free free venison hallelujah hey amen yes sir i'll be honest everyone loves free venison everyone loves a charcoal bride venison praise a lot so that's what his father loved and so he loved esau but the thing is um his mother inquired of the lord because there was strife you know her tummy would have been going like this there was fighting going on in the womb maybe she saw a foot here and a hand here and all this what's going on here and she asked the lord lord what's going on and it's good when you can actually seek the lord and he'll give you an answer you know i was listening to the sermon i think it's um hear his voice and brother i'm saying is that we need to actually hear his voice don't get so busy in our own lives that we don't you know don't get into a realm where god can speak to us now you can be driving the car remember it's a condition of your heart not it's not a condition of an instagram picture of a prayer closet where there's candles and pillows and everything's nice and you know no no this is not what it's talking about it's where you can walk in such a way that you're in harmony with god that when god wants to download what he wants into your heart he can say boop praise the lord you hear his voice you can be walking along you'll be on your job you can be washing dishes the greatest experience i ever had with god i was washing dishes i was working i was i was working in a kitchen in a commercial kitchen a student hostel kitchen washing up after lunch thinking on the lord i love him i love him because he first loved me that was the first christian song that really anchored in my heart we had bible in schools growing up i went to chapel three times a week at boarding school you know we you know there's the great pipe organs in the you know those songs and you know the angle but just that simple song meditating upon it and the love of god filled my heart when i was washing dishes changed my life because i realize how much i love him because of how much he loved me first that day on calvary hallelujah i was just washing dishes so don't you know there's some people in our household that kind of anyway we have trouble with that and and they're younger than younger than 21 i'll put it that way but you know you could god can meet you in mundane things hallelujah god can meet you in mundane things but sometimes we see something we've got to do and we just kind of roll our eyes and say oh why do i have to do this look at it as an opportunity for god to meet you you say well it's my numbing work no no no it's only my numbing if you look at it that way you say no it's an opportunity lord i can actually have a conference with you while i'm doing this mundane work praise god so you know look for god in everything amen so so here comes uh yeah so um there yeah rachel no sorry rebecca god was told because this was going on in her womb because jacob and esau were fighting god told her that there's two nations in your womb they're striving but but she was told the elder shall serve the younger yes so she had in her heart sure there's two boys coming out but it's the younger one that's going to be the main one hallelujah and then so now there came the time but but of course um um isaac loved esau because of the free venison because he was more of a man's man you know the scripture says that that jacob was a plain man he dwelt in tents you know he probably didn't spend a lot of time out in the fields with the flocks and doing here's a plain man the scripture says and so but then the thing is the time of the blessing came and because because um jacob wanted the birthright he wanted the blessing he wasn't just satisfied just with the birthright he wanted everything that goes with it hallelujah so he was willing to deny himself put on put on the persona of his older brother just like us we have you know we are born wrong right but if we just and you know the devil says you're not worthy and i can agree with him on that that's the one thing i can agree with him on everything else is no but the reason but doesn't mean i kind of listen to him after he says that because he says you're not worthy therefore you can't get it i say yes i'm not worthy but i've got an older brother holly that is worthy amen and he's worthy to go before the throne of grace and get whatever he asked for hallelujah and if we go in his name which is going in his dead this i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ that's a powerful greeting so all all the crisis i'm greeting you in all that heaven is i'm greeting you in so he put on eso's clothes because remember his mother knew that ella is going to serve the younger so her whole life was now governed around that and so when the time of the blessing was going to come she's like listen i heard this you know jacob put on put on esau's clothes and we'll get kids skins and put them onto your hairy and different things and you know he walks in with not even venison it was something else that his mother had made and then but he was jake um jacob was such a man that his own fear of being exposed was secondary to getting the blessing hallelujah because remember his daddy was a prophet he was there and he saw he saw the stairway to heaven there at bethel god spoke to him just because he was physically blind it didn't mean he wasn't spiritually blind but god and you know so so jacob did not know is god just going to expose me when i walk in because that could have happened you know isaac could have been lying down there and you know and then and then uh jacob would have come in i'm you saw you know and then and then isaac could have sat up pointed his finger at him said you you deceiver i cursed you in the name of god he could have done that how dare you come and try and get your get your brother's blessing that could have happened but god blinded god blinded his father's eyes so that jacob could get the blessing hallelujah why because jacob was willing because he would have gone in there in fear what if i get exposed what if i die today what if god just kills me but his desire for the birthright was greater than any fear that was in the back of his mind and it should be the same thing with you and i what if god doesn't doesn't receive me what if my sins get called out what if this and this and this and what if what will this person think of me what will my family say of me what will my friends say of me what will my colleagues say of me he didn't care about that i want the blessing i want the blessing of god i want the blessing of god to rest upon my life because what god is blessed is blessed and he cannot reverse his blessing hallelujah so he went in there he denied his own self when i went clothed as esau and said i am esau and we have to go before the prince of god that way we're not worthy we don't deserve it i remember we say you but you deny yourself go and say i am worthy hallelujah amen so he got the blessing so naturally we can if we can look at his actions we say where is christ in that where is actually the attributes of of our great lord jesus in his life but you see none of this came into being until his eyes fell upon a certain woman hallelujah amen when he saw rachel because remember he had to run for his life after that esau swore that as soon as isaac's dead i'm going to kill my brother so he had to run for his life and he went down to where where rebecca came from went to his you know family there and and when he saw rachel he fell in love with her yes and now laban is an interesting character god's amazing the bad character traits in in us we can always we'll meet our match somewhere hello we'll meet our match somewhere here was jacob he was a supplanter he come to find out his father-in-law changed his wages 10 times god knows how to outmatch us with someone remember we are all god's agents for our for each other iron sharpens iron hallelujah fellowship there's rubbing that's why we can't be christians you know we can't be christians isolated somewhere it takes it takes the rubbing of humanity hallelujah i'm just like children they're god's agents amen oh my you know it's funny it's funny you know you meet the lord before you get married you think man uh i've arrived and then you get married you say lord help me and then and then eventually because it's actually your own character flaws coming out it's things that you need you know and then you get to a place praise the lord and then and then the first one arrives and you cannot negotiate with a six-month-old it just doesn't work if they're sore they tell you if they're hungry they tell you if they need changing they tell you if they can't sleep they tell you you know and you can't just say no hold on this is not reasonable this is not rational no it doesn't work and then you begin to see walking on two feet is your own character and it's not you looking in the mirror by the way they're about this tall the good and the bad but for some reason there's something about humanity the bad seems to outweigh the good in our own little minds are we are we together are we together and you know but what are they they're god's agents because god is doing a work many times we pray for our children lord help them but really it's helped me hallelujah lord i need help they need i probably need more help than them praise god why what happens is because you begin to your match may be this tall but it's not the size of the package it's what's in the package hallelujah anyway so so so laban jacob met his match in lebanon he would change his way just 10 times you know sure you know jacob being jacob he would try and you know you know trick him out of everything got the best cattle different things but laban he was a real match but the amazing thing is is that when when when real love came in we read there in verse 20 he served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her you think about he was a man who was who used to dwell in tents he was as he he was a real mama's boy you know he was he was her favorite son and so maybe he didn't spend a lot of time with animals but here he was it's amazing love can lift us above everyday life you know what i love about this is this really brings out christ in in jacob it really it goes beyond his humanity and goes down to really who he really is just like esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage that brought out who he really was so now when love comes into the equation in jacob's life it shows who he really is now i say this i hope jacob did not stop loving her and the trials did not get more grievesome after they got married i hope it just seemed but a few days and everything was fine because remember this was seven years out in the elements he didn't have some big shed to put the sheep in you need to follow them around you know he had to you know in the rain in the cold in the baking hot sun whatever it was you know but it seemed but a few days because of the love he had for her amen amen as i say i trust that brothers when you're courting your wives it's just a few that day all the family things going on and it's just but it seemed just a few days but i trust that didn't change after you got married it just got greater i mean that the love that you have gets greater and what should it do it should bring out more of christ in you right they shouldn't now bring out you know you shouldn't walk down the aisle one man and then wake up the next morning a different man right i love you sweetheart you're darling all these nice things and then and then you wake up the next morning and you're back to your old self no no it should bring out what's within you it should be more love more of the lord hallelujah amen that's how it should be so jacob you know even so so the love that he had amen made those seven years seem but a few days praise god here we are now see love should bring out the best in us it should bring out the character of christ because remember he was because the you know paul would say in hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing where also compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god so that you know i know i've said this a lot but there's a joy set before him and there's a joy set before jacob i'm getting married i love her we're gonna get married sure i've gotta work seven years but we're gonna get married and you know the lord has been interceding for us for you know there's been seven church ages but there's a joy set before him even when he went to calvary there was a joy set before him you know and that joy was us redeemed you know would say in the theater's dictionary the definition of joy it's joy or gladness it's a joy received from you it's the cause or occasion of joy so there's a cause in his life that this joy was a cause i've got a bride i'm gonna make her in my image i'm gonna purchase her i'm gonna pull my life out upon the earth i'm gonna give my all amen that joy made it seem that the great trial he was going to go through being marred more than any man he'll be marred beyond recognition amen he would be bruised for our iniquities you know the devil would anoint those soldiers to beat him like they never beat another prisoner and whip him and you know they would he would anoint the pharisees to pull out his bed and spit in his face and mock him and make fun and you know all those horrible things that he had to go through and even you know and then jesus would even come to a place where he would he would feel so forsaken on the cross he'd cry out my god my god why is that forsaken me but yet he had a joy before him and that joy far outweighed amen his present circumstances the then and now didn't mean too much to him it was it was the joy that was coming hallelujah amen so there was an occasion he was looking for and that gave him great joy we know that that that greater k that great occasion was now he was going to come and dwell on his disciples that he loved and not just that he was going to redeem a people down through seven church ages and they were going to be gathered around the throne hallelujah you know how god's under expectation we're under expectation we want to see a body change we want to see the dead in christ rise but our god is under expectation for that moment he's been waiting for thousands of years for this moment i mean ever since that he he would stand in the garden and he would speak to adam and eve and you know enter the serpent and he would give the first prophecy of the redeemer coming hallelujah he's been under expectation to see it unfold he knows how it's going to end up but you know it's like a great artist they have in their mind what they're going to paint but when it actually becomes material before them that the thing they had in their mind becomes material then they can rejoice because it's now expressed the same thing with god in the back part of his mind was redemption was you and i being redeemed hallelujah and he knew what would look like and he knew our character traits and knew how tall we'd be and he knew the struggles would go through he knew everything we'd go through but yet and and even with all that he knew that you would one day in his timing say yes hallelujah and he knew that you would actually lay it all down and say yes and he knew that there would come many points in your life where you wouldn't know which way to turn your turn to him and he would guide you through hallelujah and he also knew amen that there will come a time when you step from this dimension to the next dimension you think we're excited for that moment now we can only imagine what it's going to be like you know the prophet could go beyond the curtain of time and he described that world it's sublime you know or he would he would he would rather describe the condition of the people in the green grass and all those things but that but the atmosphere and the feeling of the place that's what he couldn't fully describe he said it's it's above sublime it's the greatest place he he just couldn't there was not words to describe that land beyond the river and he said whatever you do don't miss it lay aside everything till you get perfect love which is the holy ghost and get to that land so it was easy for him to describe the people in their condition but the atmosphere hallelujah you think of place there's no sorrow pain or death this is a real world it's more real than this world there's no devil there's no bad thoughts there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no separation death can't enter there there's no separation there's not a bad day there's not a bad week there's not a trial there's not any tribulation no trouble nothing the devil's not there that's nothing it's like the best day you can imagine but time's a billion hallelujah he says make sure you get to that land and that's why jesus died to get to that land i mean that we would get to that land but you see now the lord he's already seen it just like a vision a vision brother brown would see what's going to happen in the vision that he'd walk into the vision right so a prophet who can see a vision sees the future before it happens and that's god just just showing that man or woman what's going to happen right so now when the lord the lord's already seen the rapture he's already seen us round the throne hallelujah he's already seen it because the works are finished before the foundation of the world the apostle paul said so he's not just imagining it like we do he's already seen it so now he's coming he's watching it become more material all the time hallelujah and now to me that would make that would make me real excited if i was in his shoes hallelujah soon and very soon we're going to see the king amen so you think we're going to be excited that day he's going to be excited our guy's not a robot he's not some just um you know something like cold indifferent he has feelings hallelujah he's not indifferent towards us the bible says that he takes pleasure in his people he delights in our prayers the bible says hallelujah he actually cares for you and i yes amen he's not indifferent he's not some just some like a working relationship doesn't care about us we're the apple of his eye we're the redeemed of the ages hallelujah you know many times we go back to the back to the time when we first meet and we think lord why did i meet you earlier we just had a few years upon the earth which is not even a i don't know how long in god's time and he's been waiting thousands of years for us to come here for us to express himself to us hallelujah the reason i say that is because we get excited when we see someone we love he's been waiting a lot longer than we've ever waited for someone hallelujah amen so the great joy so jacob could express christ there because of his love for his bride-to-be hallelujah now i pray that we would be the same way when we when we see even each other or our families that the love we have for one another which should be the love of god not just human love that goes up and down or the love we have for our children for our families it would bring out the best in us maybe before we became a christian maybe we were like jacob we cheated we did everything we could maybe even when we when we came in among believers we became that way but then when the but then when we really met god because of love you think yo jacob had seven years of hardship but love lifted him up above the hardship we're living in a very troublesome time in a time of trouble we've been reading about it for years in the scripture now we're here right now we're living in this time of trouble but does the love of god lift us up above the trouble does it lift us up above the storm it doesn't mean the storm stops it's still there we can be standing in the middle of it but does the love of god lift us up that we don't get caught up in the storm but we can just keep walking on you know jacob would after this when he went back to his brother he was still a supplanter he was still a deceiver he even sent his own family that's why i said it's a small window in his life where you can really see god because when he's going back to esau going back to where because because the lord told him you got to return home now and then so he gets a report that esau's got 400 men waiting for him and remember when they parted ways it wasn't i love you see you bro i'll come back soon he ran for his life and there's something in human nature we we we just hold grudges you know carnal man holds on to things they just can't let it go but a christian can amen and so and so jacob is such a deceiver he said yo he would rather push his own flesh and blood in front of him than actually go first and actually meet his brother he sent the flocks to try and buy him off and he sent his children and his wives first so where is he in that where's god in that i mean yo where's the christ-like character in that we should be in the front we should be the shield hallelujah but you see it's just that small window but because of love it seemed but a few days lord jesus may we be the same way may we be the same way that our lives because of divine love amen that the trouble sure we have troubles we're not exempt from troubles we're not exempt from hardship but we can live such a life that those things don't bog us down it should just take us in prayer to god what i love about the scripture is it's not just god being expressed you know so so god brings out the best in us but we can live in such a way we bring the best out in god you know the scripture would tell us of of of abigail she was married to a man called nabel and there came a situation where where david and his men were actually camping around where nabel and his flocks and his and his farms were and they were like a wall protecting protecting naval in his and his and his flocks and so david sent some men to nabal and he said am i saying that right is that the right name i think it is yep um you know can you give us something to eat and abel just got mad who's this david what's this you know and just sent them away with nothing and david got real mad he basically said to most of his men he didn't um um i think 400 of his men and him arm yourselves we're going to deal with this guy but the bible says that abigail if i can find it here she was basically beautiful and of a good understanding i like it when when we can yeah she was a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance i like it when the lord tells us we're beautiful and we've got a good understanding because abigail here is a type of the bride you know there's some types in the scripture that are just us like ruth or rahab right or abigail here and so the lord is really showing us in the scripture this is what i think of you you have a good understanding because you've got my mind and you're a beautiful woman amen the lord doesn't hide us in the corner the law is not ashamed of us i if i have to start every service till you get it i'm going to say it the lord is proud of his achievement we are his greatest achievement amen we are his victory we are not his defeat we're not his embarrassment we are his victory he is proud of you and i god is in such a way that he lifts his bride up i believe i know we join ears but my feeling is he just lifts us up because remember we're jewels in his crown you see someone decked out in royal apparel like crowns and stuff you don't see the person you see their crown and their fancy stuff why because because they wear it in such a way that the attention does not go upon themselves but goes upon their crown their robes yes and the lord is showing that to us because he's he's saying actually i you are my greatest achievement i'm proud of you i'm not ashamed of you even in spite of our troubles ups and downs lefts and rights and you know personality peculiarity all those things we are jewels in his crown to reflect the light because god's proud of us i just i'd say lord thank you you're proud of i don't see the thing is i don't know how he's proud of me but if he says he he takes pleasure in his people and i'm one of them i say thank you lord hallelujah i pray that just because you know we get so scared will i be accepted that day well the bible tells us that he goes to prepare a place for us and if he does he'll come again and receive you unto himself that where he is you'll be also that's in john 14. so he says i'm going to go prepare a place for you and he's done that and he's going to come again and receive you to himself and he's doing that hello this is what this message is that's why christ and the believer becoming one what is that that is you being received amen because remember he gives you the holy ghost because he receives your faith right he receives your faith if he's received your faith in the blood then he's received you amen so if he's who's been hey is anyone in that condition right because many times brother ram says people misunderstand me sure we have to receive the lord as our lord and savior but he's got to receive us how does he do that he receives our faith which is just a common thing take him at his word believe in what he's done for you right so he says i'll come again and receive you unto myself and this is what this message does it's a receiving hallelujah hallelujah it's actually us receiving him receiving us hallelujah just like i said on wednesday i just think about maybe it's a turn of phrase but i was thinking about how you know people say are you prepared to meet the lord yes but he prepares me to meet him right because we are his workmanship i'm not my own workmanship this is not seven steps to becoming rapture ready in your own ability no this just repent and be baptized name the lord jesus christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's how you become rapture ready hallelujah so it's actually us being prepared by him to meet him amen praise god praise the lord so she was of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance now abigail because remember david was a man of war he was a type of christ but in him was a heart of mercy and that was really like the lord brother brahm said that you know it used to be that he thought that that that god was angry with him but then jesus loved him but he found out jesus is the heart of god right so so the heart of god is mercy really you know sure he's got judgment but in his core being he's mercy and deliverance and salvation that's really what because he's a life-giver right he wants to impart eternal life he wants to give life he doesn't want to destroy life because of judgment right so his core being is actually mercy and grace so now here's david on the outside we're just going to modi we're going to butcher these people but then abigail because she is of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance speaking of you she went she it says that she baked 200 loaves of bread made all this food don't know how she did it but she did it you know and then so she went with these to david like prostrate herself down before him and and interceded for her husband and then so david his wrath was turned to mercy and we know god took care of nabal he was he died all these things but the thing is she brought out the best in david amen what about you and i can we i pray not by our own humanity this is not by our five senses and even how we articulate a prayer it's not about a pretty prayer it's a half-out cry hallelujah and it's about can we i believe we can because we're being made thus to bring out the best in the lord hallelujah amen who wants the best out of him not just the surface there but but the depths of salvation to intercede like she did for her because remember if david walked in there he would have just killed everyone killed all the men he says i'm going to kill every man in this place but because abigail brought out the best in david amen they're all spared so can we be the same way i believe we can amen if we've been made new creatures in christ we can bring out the best in the lord hallelujah that that that eternal life is imparted that salvation comes amen amen now brother bam says i'm going to i was going to read some read a few quotes and then we actually were going to finish maybe a a bite size portion today but i just i just wanna you know sometimes the mail will get as long sometimes it's very short but you just deliver the mail right because i want you to think is my life bringing out the best in the lord and is my life that i'm now living is it the love of god that causes me to not be burdened down by troubles in life but does it bring out the best like in jacob's life because of love it seemed all the problems he had for seven years it seemed about a few days you know because it brought it love caused christ to be expressed out of his life and is that the same thing with you and i and and i very much whenever i preach something i always put myself in it you know it's because of love that's why we should never because the bible says because the knickers shall abound the love of many shall wax coals we can't stop iniquity abounding but we can stop it we can stop it affecting us right that our love does not wax coal but it gets greater amen remember this is not an age of survival this is an age of overcoming right we are not here just going to scrape in we are going to overcome and the power of god is always greater than the power of the devil the devil comes and by deception and lies right that's how he gets you by deception and lies and he uses circumstances you're in he just wants you to agree with his take on those circumstances and if he you agree with him then he's got you like for example people just get in their minds they're you know they'll never be happy and that's the devil telling them they'll you'll never be happy and then they agree i'll never be happy then what happens they're never happy you know or you'll never you'll never earn enough money what happens and then they agree with that then they nothing is good enough there's like negative things that come and i know it may be very kind of vague but you know who knows what i'm talking about or you'll never have peace or you'll never overcome this that's what the devil says but his deception is you're stuck with it and if you agree with that then you're stuck with it but the lord is here to say you don't have to be stuck with nothing the only thing you should be stuck with is joy love peace faith long suffering temperance joy in the holy ghost power to overcome that's the only thing you should be stuck with if i can say it in such a crude way so we shouldn't listen to the devil's lies and deception what's another lie brings in we'll look at all the problems and everyone else [Music] what happens and then our focus is on them and not on the lord and then we become in harmony with everyone else as problems and not in harmony with the holy ghost i want to stay in harmony with the holy ghost oh but that's just turning a blind eye no it's not it's by it's sticking to the one who can solve the problem just like david when his men wanted to stone him because ziglag was burned and all their families were taken away he he encouraged himself in the lord his god he went back to a source of strength god gave him the answer and he got everything back amen he his whole his family was restored their families were restored they lost nothing in a time of transition i mean from one kingship to another we're in a time of transition too from the church ages to a millennium there's a rapture in between but there's a time of trouble in between amen so so you've got to go back to your source of strength our source of strength should never be the lies of the devil saying there's no way out of this no god can make a way peter was in the inner prison going to get killed the next day god made a way there are all these guards just chained to many guards they went you know the angels came in and the chains came off how did he do it i don't know but he did it even knocked him on the side said get up put your robe on put your shoes on we're going for a walk hallelujah and it's all because people were praying because the people the believers did not accept that peter should die they interceded amen and that's what we should do we should go to our source of strength say oh and then what does that do that brings out the best in god you want to see him as a healer amen go to him in prayer you want to see him as a mighty god of deliverance amen go to a prayer intercede you'll see him as a mighty god of deliverance hallelujah but it takes love to do it he says in a hidden life in christ i wish i could explain it but let me tell you something brother you'll never come in contact with a greater force in this life than love yes sir i do not try to conquer demons by kicking them i love god see love is what god is god is love god love moves god god so love the world it's love love loves what conquers so he says he doesn't conquer demons by kicking them he says i love god that's how he causes the devils to move he loved the lord so it's not even about what the devil's doing it's about the love of god in his heart right is it so it's not about that you know how many people came through the prayer line people would be demon-possessed and straight jackets slithering it like snakes and different things and totally full of the devil he didn't he didn't kick the devil you know but you know he didn't print out yo tell him to get out and all this anger yo the prophet prayed such calm prayers yes when it came to dealing with spirits now not everyone is made that way we all express ourselves differently like people preach different way people sing different way but this but he is such a calm wasn't all theatrical this is how god made him but the reason but the thing is the devil had to move why because he says i love god that maybe i trust that's not too simple it just goes over our heads amen but he loved the lord so much that caused the demons to move he said in blind bartimaeus how many loves them with real divine love now how do you know that here's one witness because you love one and you have love one for the other that's right we know we have past and death under life and we love our brethren amen you want to see real love you say i love the lord but you can't put up with one another that love is just imaginary but if you really love one another you would give the off your back you'd do anything for them you stand in the gap whatever real real love that that shows you love the lord jesus and real love overrides annoyance real love fake love does not we should be able to look past one another's mistakes you know easy jesus looked past my mistakes i would hate to this wall would need to be the be like 20 million imac screens and all my mistakes written on it that's how big you know but he looked past all of that hallelujah so if the lord could overlook me and save me can't we look beyond one another who wants to see a powerful church who wants to see god move in power that sin can't even walk in the door i mean that that sickness can't stay amen that unbelief can't stay that complexes can't stay that pain can't stay i mean it has to leave because the power of god is so strong in this place that's what i want to see i mean people just come in and give their lives hallelujah people really weep their way to calvary meet god that's what i want to see amen amen well how do you do it i love god amen now by this men will know you're my disciples when when you become a member of the church no no when you shout no no when you speak with tongues no no when you have a healing service preach the gospel no no when you love you have love one for the other friends he says here friends i'm not no little boy no more i've seen many a test but i've never seen nothing yet could override love it takes everything out of the way love conquers wild animal love conquers it's the most conquering force there is because it's god i'm talking about real love it's unwavering love not a human love that goes up and down hallelujah hallelujah now he says this here i'll just i just finished with this quote i alluded to it but i want to read it he said and you when you're filled with the when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs i know because someone's asking about the evidence of the holy ghost you're so in love with christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth see that's the evidence that you have the holy spirit and your life's full of joy and oh my everything's different see than what it used to be that's the holy spirit now these gifts are in the holy spirit now if this congregation this morning it's just a snug nice snug church he says he says full you know the overflow rooms are filled up of course but not announcing we're going to answer these questions but these people have just come and noticed if every person here was in perfect harmony with the holy spirit every one of you was filled with the holy spirit and in harmony with the holy ghost these signs would just be multiplying among you all the time see it'll just be constantly going but where there's confusion where there's difference and where we set up the holy spirit can't move itself see it can't operate through the people so let's this morning i'm going to finish with this statement this this morning take away all the confusion how do we do that god's word's right god's word is always right above opinion above video blogs above what people pay paste on the internet whatever above all people's opinions god's word remains true and it meets the conditions of 2021 it will meet the conditions of 2022 and however long we're upon the earth the entire message meets end-time conditions the scripture meets in time conditions right amen so let's just take the confusion if if what you're feeding on look you got to look now who watched the this is years ago there was a documentary called supersize me whoever watched that the guy lived on mcdonald's for a month and he had certain effects in his body because he was just living on mcdonald's he put on weight was very lethargic couldn't concentrate so much it was you know it was bad for him every meal was mcdonald's now so the effect of the mcdonald's the effect of what he was eating caused him to be put on weight lethargic couldn't focus so you've got to look at what you're eating spiritually and look at the effects of it and and when you see the effects of it you actually say is this good or not so does it make you lethargic towards the lord does it fill your heart with fear and double-mindedness does it put doubt in the word the things you feed on think about and this could be the news this could be anything right movies music news whatever does it make you does it take the joy of the lord from your life if it does change your diet amen oh all things in moderation no no when it comes to the devil's stuff nah that's not in moderation i need to relax you just actually you really meet god you know i was telling the the sunday school i was i was telling them about how when my sister hannah was a nurse in saudi arabia they had on the screens in the hospital people walking around the you know the black rock thing there in mecca and that was on just all the time and people just sat there and watched it and she said that's so crazy and and i just thought to myself i should have responded it's like no it's the spirit on them is feeding on that and it's producing that right that's why they love it because the spirit in them is feeding on that and they can sit there and watch people do that for hours and you know and but the thing is it's the spirit in you will feed on certain things so if you've got the spirit of the world in you you're not going to love the spirit of god you won't but if you have the spirit of god in you you will get joint satisfaction from his word and from his songs from his music and you'll love it right so what spirit is in you and what's it feeding on i would change your diet if it if if what your if what's being produced in your life is fear worry stress double mindedness you know no stability in your christian walk i would change your diet because you see you know we have we have testimony of people who have decided to follow jesus living right here and they have and they were once like the super size me guy when it comes to things of the world but yet their diet was radically changed and they just begin to feed on the word and you can see the effects in their life sin is gone sure their life's there's still trouble in life because we're not exempt but there's overcoming joy there's joy there's a peace there's a stability amen that that wasn't there when they used to be chasing everything that was trending in the world and up and down and this is happening and oh dear this is happening and oh dear this is going on and you know that's all gone because the diet changed because we can say yes it's going on but praise the lord the word says when you see these things lift up your head you know your redemption is drawing nigh harlow you can see all these things going on you know you can just rejoice because we know we're actually we're in the end time amen where there's difference sorry i'm still here so get rid of the confusion see what is what you're feeding on what is it producing i pray that you're feeding on the right thing and it's producing the joy of the lord and a strength that when you're when your heart is overwhelmed you go to the rock you go to him that's higher than you amen now where there's difference difference is because of humanity we're all built differently now i'd you may be very disappointed in this next statement i will still be me in eternity so you know just just get yeah sure they'll be the negative side of me won't be there but my personality i'll still be me okay yeah well i wasn't expecting a big hallelujah right there but you know we've gotta just we'll still be us right so don't get caught up on differences of personality and things that causes that causes the lord not to move yes that's difference and where we set up what's the way we set up you get all systemized in your religion and your approach to god well this is how we do things because this no no hold on is god moving amen is god moving that's what we want is god moving is god changing lives is god making us more like him that's the setup we want amen so i'm just going to finish there but i pray like jacob when he fell in love with rachel those seven years about for
