lord jesus we thank you lord you're preparing us to leave this world lord just stand up mountains bright and fear in that new happy land oh lord we're so homesick for heaven let us look past the curtain of time this morning oh god may we see ourselves over there we love you lord we commit our lives lord the reading of your word this whole service into your and your hands father in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah amen thank you brother isaac thank you musicians hallelujah amen amen our god reigns hallelujah well god bless you this morning praise the lord amen let's go to uh luke 22 hallelujah amen i believe anything could happen just now anything could happen hallelujah hallelujah amen luke 22 and verse 14 and then we'll go to second samuel and i trust us all ties together i believe it will eventually luke 22 and 14 and when the hour was come and he sat down and the 12 apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god. and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and there is the last verse i'd like to read here and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest maybe we'll just leave it there may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning i'd like to um i'd like to speak about the main thing father donny reagan preached the message uh i can't remember what it was called it evening like tabernacle and he opened with this quote he said i want to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten you the promise of god for this age see something not something that somebody else was in some other day but something and when them things are all right we all refer to those things but i thought i would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures i got written here that would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can now he said that you know you should go and study the phrase the main thing so i'm not here to repeat his sermon but i so i went away and studied where brother says the main thing and he and he refers to that that he says the main thing all the way through his message so we want to see what the main thing is you know it's very interesting where if we could just go back there to the to the time of the passover whether there's the you know jesus you know if we could just be transported back two thousand years ago would be gathered around the supper table there you know i doubt very much that jesus would have had a very light-hearted look on his face maybe jovial kind of counters he would have been very serious because he knew what he was about to face he knew that he was going to carry the sin of the world upon his shoulders he was going to redeem mankind and you know he knew this was going to be the last passover and you know he you know he would even say to the say to the um i'll just drop this in now it's very easy to miss the main thing by things of life going on humanity and trouble and you know so we don't want to miss the main thing so here jesus was he says in luke 15 he says with desire desire to eat this passover with you before i suffer so he's telling the disciples i'm about to suffer and then he and then he goes down he says my body will be given and all those things but then uh then he says about the man who is is going to betray me is with you he's one of you then they begin to acquire about who that would be but then there was also strife among them about who would be counted the greatest now can we can we just put ourselves in those shoes to me this blows my mind here is the here is the lamb of god he's about to be offered for the sins of the world and not just not just for the sins of the world but for those disciples sins who are sitting with them and not just for them but for you and i and and and he's beginning to tell them i'm gonna suffer we're gonna have this meal and then basically after this point my life is going to be suffering till it's going to be finished and you know even says that you know one of you is going to betray me and maybe they begin you know they begin to inquire among themselves i doubt anyone would have put their hand up for that job do you think it's you judas no i don't think it's me do you know you know they begin to acquire but then there was a strife among themselves who would be the greatest so here they are caught up in their humanity and who's going to be the greatest and because this thing's going to grow it's not going to stay just you know us 4 no more or the m12 and no more it was going to expand and the problem is when people get caught up in the humanity of the situation they miss completely what god is doing they miss the main thing now you know that there is a group of people naturally in a group of people people naturally begin to think about who's going to be the greatest then they begin to rank themselves upon personality charisma stature and then they begin to think about their roles in the group because they would have seen how jesus conducted his meetings here brother brown he dramatizes when simon the pharisee he sends his courier to jesus to invite him to the feast and you know that courier gets finally gets to where the crowd is then he gets to the outer circle of the disciples maybe andrew or bartholomew or one of them and then you know you know he gets to them and then he gets to the inner circle of peter james and john then finally he gets to the master so so they would have been watching how jesus conducts meetings and then maybe you know one of the disciples would be sitting there saying well you know surely peter peter will be the he'll be the usher or he'll be the deacon because he's a big burly fisherman he's rugged and you know he's really got a commanding kind of presence he'll keep the people back and you know maybe maybe you know matthew you know he was a tax collector but you know he's really changed you know he's really honest now and you know you know this thing's going to grow and you know judas is going to need more help with the with the finances i'm going with something with this you know so yeah but we got to put ourselves in you know you know so judas is going to need help with the finances so you know but you know god can use things from your previous life and bring it into now and you know yeah but what's happening is people are putting people in orders and different jobs and you know and you know the sons of thunder the sons of zebedee why they really live up to their name they're going to be the evangelist they're going to go shake the world you know they're going to go out and do that maybe andrew well he's a quiet kind of guy he'll just be the prayer warrior and you know you know you know and you know thaddeus and thomas and bartholomew you know they seem to be kind of clicky in their own thing so i don't seem to fit in with them so well so they're probably going to go off and start at work somewhere else and because they're a different part of the church they just get along together and what's happening is it's carnal you know placing gifts and and i and i can guarantee you one thing if we sat there at the table and guessed who would be what would be all wrong hallelujah would be all wrong and that's what happens is man thinks well this is what this person should be doing if brother so-and-so did this and sister so-and-so and they're all wrong god just takes people and it seems like they're just the wrong people for the job but you find out they're the right people for the job and god uses those people for his kingdom hallelujah but the thing is all of that running through their minds they were missing the main thing the greatest week they were living in the midst of the greatest week in history the prophet says the death bear resurrection of our lord jesus christ here was a great redeemer that was prophesied from from from from the from the garden all the way down he was in flesh he's about to fulfill his life's role amen fulfilling the scripture and they were missing it because they weren't caught up in the main thing we got to be sure that we're caught up in the main thing you know our main thing can be the wrong thing it cannot be the main thing brother ram says in the philadelphian church age what was judas's main thing it was money the biggest pull of a lot of these things today is money he had the wrong main thing money was part of it but it wasn't the main thing so we want to be very sure that we stick with the main thing now brother brown he makes a lot of different statements when he when he uses the phrase the main thing or main thing you should go away and look at it is everyone happy today everyone's here we're in the greatest season you know it says after you read genesis 5 you know it speaks about adam's lineage and it says then man began to call upon the name of the lord because adam and eve they would be sitting around maybe the fire fire at night with their children look up the stars of heaven then they would be preaching from you know all the way through the zodiac because god's first bible is written in the heavens we know we don't read that one no more this is our bible right so they would be under actually use the use what was in the heaven because that's god's word first right and they would begin to preach their children what's going to happen the plan of redemption and they would testify no doubt amen of of the lord's promise to them when he wrapped them in lamb skins that that that the seed of the woman's going to come and undo i mean what the devil's done it says then man began to call upon the name of the lord so from then till now the real believers been calling on god when is sin going to be done away with when is eternity going to roll on when's time going to be no more when are these things going to happen when is heaven and earth going to come back together again hallelujah and we happen to be living in that time this is a great time to be alive and hallelujah so we don't want to be caught up in carnality of people or what's going on in the world and miss the main thing i mean there's a lot of things brother brown called the main thing here's a list of some of them and this is not in any order of importance but getting soul saved is the main thing getting the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul it's the main thing keeping love among the brethren the main thing i mean having the lord present in the meetings it's the main thing i mean staying humble the main thing not being caught up with the things of the world that's the main thing saying with the word the main thing receiving christ the main thing being ready for the rapture the main thing living a sermon rather than preaching a sermon the main thing having the blood tag the main thing getting ready to meet him the main thing some of these may repeat but hey this is just how i've written them down doing the will of god the main thing having the spirit of the lord in the church the main thing not being scared of sickness when it strikes the main thing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the main thing loving god and humbling yourself the main thing live what you're talking about the main thing there's a lot of main things you say well how can there be multiple main things because to me it comes down to one thing amen the person of jesus christ living in you amen to me his life manifesting his word through you and i that's the main thing because all of those things boil down to that amen because if he's in you you've got a burden for the loss of getting soul saved amen having love among the brethren god is love and that's not some wishy-washy instagram post that's a reality amen divine love is christ himself that's the main thing staying humble well if you've got his character you will be humble the main thing hallelujah so there's a lot of main things and the main thing is that his life his word puts on flesh and you and i amen i love it where the apostle paul will say galatians 2 and 20 i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live not yet i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen the apostle paul met the main thing on the road to damascus and he began to realize the life he now lived in the flesh he wasn't living it by his own understanding his own revelation his own religious works but it was the revelation the faith of the son of god was manifesting himself through his life amen so the same one that said let there be sun moon and stars amen was now living in his life so his life he was the life he was living in the flesh he was living by the faith of the son of god so everything he did it was by that faith amen whether it was making tense it was by that faith preaching to someone by that faith being led by the spirit of god it was by the faith of the son of god hallelujah amen now naturally well for some reason man seems to put things in when you when you emphasize one thing you know i just say it like this speaking about god living in a people is not diminishing the opening of the word right come on this message came that god would make us powerhouses of his holy ghost i mean the dynamics of the work the the mechanics of the word the dynamics the holy ghost will come together live in you and shake the world amen because god is going to rapture people full of himself amen that's what he's looking for right he's not looking he's not looking for people who can just quote the word the devil can quote the word in every language under heaven even those languages that are now extinct but he's not going in a rapture amen the only ones going to rapture is that god tabernacled in you hallelujah so to say these things is not to diminish what what about the opening of the seals the seals reveals christ right if you just see four horse riders in a tribulation and different things you've got to look again there's christ in there it reveals christ the prophet said amen he also says in desperations that all so he's speaking about what he just preached in the morning which was the token message that you've got to have the token the holy ghost all these signs of the holy spirit leading up then come right back here to the capping off of all those messengers messages since the seven seals it's capped off in this one thing the token the cap is the top of it so it says all these things but it's capped off by you must have the literal life of jesus christ in you amen that we are all right see just check ourselves and see if we're in the faith amen now we've got to understand as well that when the spirit of truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth right personally you remember this is all truth but you've got to be led in god guided into it right it's going to become reality to you and i what by the spirit of revelation amen so that's why i can say it's the main thing you've got to be born again amen if you really have the spirit of god you'll be led and guided into all truth okay amen someone speaking to brother brown i think it was brother booth here i'm not sure who that was bc as well he says the reason said you don't know your bible he said that's all said if you can't speak greek you don't know the bible i said brother booth that might be wrong i might not know the book but i know the author real well i said i said that's it that's the main thing if you know the author he will take care of the book part of you and so that's the way we love him tonight and it brings it down to a simple person as i has a right to be saved it means if you know the author he'll take care of the book part hallelujah so we don't need to try and struggle and yeah he'll take care of it amen i'm so thankful that where the apostle paul would say in second corinthians 3 he says now this now the spirit the the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty and that liberty means actually liberated into sonship but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord it means this is the lord leading and guiding into all truth because when it becomes a revelation amen it actually forms more of the character of christ than you and i that is to me the outworking i've got a revelation as you become more like him amen so if we change from glory to glory he's changing us from glory to glory as we behold him what the word is open amen now he's doing it by revelation upon revelation and he is his word he's changing our character into his i mean so from glory to glory revelation to revelation we're becoming more like him amen i trust that's your heart's desire it doesn't matter what you see yourself as lord i want to behold you in your word make me more like you amen hallelujah he would say in leadership this is the end of his ministry 1965 this is one of the last sermons he's ever going to preach before he is taken off the face of the earth he says because remember we're going to die someday or either be translated into heaven and if you die before it's coming you'll be raptured first you know that did you uh did you know that those who are dead if mama and papa dies before you do and jesus doesn't come in our generation do you know these mama papa um will come forth first glorified before you see the trumpet of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first and when we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them we'll be changed like that we've got to remember it's the main thing in life you understand now that's the main thing in life we've got to do is get ready to meet god that's the main thing hallelujah he would preach in the message oncoming storm he says the people today are so comfortable in sin because we own a new car because we eat three meals a day sleep in a clean bed oh that's wonderful but what what would be good but we forget god when prosperity comes like that i think we've been so we preachers and we christians have been so interested in the program building of our churches and getting a better church or something like a bigger church better pews or you know what i mean we've left off the main thing judgment righteousness the power of the holy ghost resurrection eternal judgment hallelujah those are the main things amen i'm glad we can preach the main thing i'm glad the main thing can be the main thrust of our life hallelujah amen he says that a thinking man's filter now if you want to go listen to a message that really kind of checks you up that's a good one to listen to i'm talking about myself as well because i'm human everyone should say amen wow okay anyway we'll leave that one alone no a thinking man's filter he says now let us all tonight check our desires remember judas's desire was towards money so it became his main thing right the disciples wanted their them to be the greatest and their position in the body was more important than the main thing christ fulfilling his word in their day right so we've got to check our desires what you really want in life check what you're fighting for there's a lot of people fighting for a lot of things in this day and i'll say they're lost causes because the word says we're going into a millennium this world's gonna burn right so politics they can have it amen the environment they can have it whatever they can have it just take the whole world give me jesus you can have it all just just go for it let me have jesus check what you're fighting for check what you're you're here for check what you go to church for amen it's good to go to church but don't just go to church only that won't save you see just check for a few minutes is my objective what kind of a filter am i i'm drawing through anyhow and if you won't cope with the word of god and your soul don't do it then there's something wrong for it shows up your taste what kind of life is in you if it's wholly discreet and honorable it'll come out that way if it isn't you've got another taste in you you're drawing from that's exactly right and if the taste is the word of god and the will of god then you know what's in you what's drawing the taste shows that you're a part of the word the word is in you drawing from the word what what's a drawing it's drawing through the word because you're part of the body of christ of this age and if that word is in you it can only draw through the word the spirit that quickens that word that's in you just the word alone won't live that's the reason all the father has given me will come to me and if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto me see the father the part of the body of christ that's in the world predestinated put into the heart any man that's a real christian born again today knows since he was a little kid or a little girl either there's been something in you hungering for god and you've tried joining churches and everything else it wouldn't work what was it it was that word you were hunting for a filter and one day it flashed before you seen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that satisfied the taste see hallelujah see what a what a chick what are we fighting for what do we really want in life now when he says about your drawing through the filter he doesn't say how successful that you're viewing your christian life it's what's your desire what's in your heart what do you really want i want to see jesus live i want to become more like him i want him to be glorified i mean i want to go on a rapture i want my family to be saved i want them to go on a rapture oh and all i want this building to be empty when the rapture goes because there's no one can come here because we're all gone that's what i want to see amen that's what my desire is that's what we're fighting for that's what we're we're contending for the main thing i mean the word of god will be manifested in our lives irrespective of our failures our traits our quirks whatever trouble we may be facing that's irrelevant my desire is i want to see jesus christ and him glorified in his people amen this message put on flesh and you and i that's what i want i mean the quotes become flesh that's what i want to see hallelujah where he says that she'd be an invincible army i want to see an invincible army we know an army is not invincible unless it's been tested on the battlefield i mean it's got to go through wars it's got to go through campaigns amen there may be a lot of maybe some defeats along the way but we'll come out victorious hallelujah amen she will be an invincible army i believe i'm looking at part of that body right here amen the main thing is that we have the chief captain that's the main thing the main thing is not us trying to fight our own battles we'll fail miserably but the main thing is if he's fighting your battles amen now simon i mean you could go through all the way through the scripture you can see those that missed the main thing but those that got the main thing that's really what emphasizes those that really got the main thing in their day now simon the pharisee he missed the main thing when he invited jesus his main thing is he wanted just to make fun of him and have a different kind of entertainment for his guest something that was kind of unique to kind of boost his prestige that was his main thing but i'm so thankful there was a woman who wasn't even invited but she saw the main thing i mean she got the main thing she saw that jesus was was sure he was invited but he wasn't made welcome he was in the corner with unwashed feet not anointed not made welcome he was sitting there with stinking feet amen and she saw that is not the main thing to leave him uninvited but she she purpose in her heart i want to make the lord of glory i want to make this prophet of galilee feel welcome hallelujah and so she saw the main thing is that jesus had a need he had to be made welcome in this feast i pray that every day we make jesus feel welcome i mean we don't have a bad attitude we don't fuss we don't fight we don't argue don't resent anything because that just drives him away but we want to have a sweet humble atmosphere around us a loving heart we want him to draw close you know we can't allow our walk with god just to become a working relationship a working relationship just takes things for granted you know it's just oh well i'm the bride he's the bridegroom praise the lord i'm going that has just become a working relationship that grieves the lord he doesn't want us to be some working you know here's my jo what's my job description sign two copies you keep one lord i keep the other one and this is my contractual obligations and 40 hours a week and this is how much i get paid you know this is not how it works i mean but people can allow the message to become like that well i've heard it before and this is this and oh yeah these people like this and you know no it shouldn't be that way it should thrill our souls i mean the lord of glory i'm glad i'm married to him i don't take him for granted we should never take jesus for granted we should never get to a place say well well i'm predicting that i mean i'm the word made flesh no we can't just it can't become a working relationship should be full of joy hallelujah why wait for the winning supper to start the honeymoon in the millennium why don't you start it now have that kind of atmosphere around you isn't he wonderful isn't he good hallelujah so we should always make him feel welcome in our lives irrespective of what we're facing the battles in our mind the troubles going on remember we don't worship god because all the trouble's over no we are told in the scripture he sets a table before me in the presence of my enemies that's where he feeds his people right in front of the devil's face i mean in satan's eden he says look here's a seven-course banquet feast amen that's been reserved for you in this end time hallelujah i mean this mountain of bread to eat hallelujah this word that's come open and where does he set it he doesn't set it by the by the sea or some beautiful panoramic place he sets it right in front of where the devil is he says bride you just sit here and you eat i mean don't worry about all this and his fussing and fighting and trouble and don't worry about those things you just sit here and feast on the word hallelujah and then what happens is you get anointed hallelujah amen your cup wrath over for joy hallelujah because it's not you're not rejoicing because the enemy's there or what's or or he's not there it's no because you're feasting at the banqueting table of the lord he's invited you to this place and when i point here i'm not talking to these four walls i'm talking to the word talk about the word hallelujah so it's not about the troubles the mind battles those things you know that does not gauge our success as a christian our the success of christianity is do we have we become one with our sacrifice right is his life in you and i amen are we sealed to the day of our redemption that's really the success of our christianity everything else is a bonus that's well that's my opinion i'm going to heaven i'm pretty happy with that hallelujah it doesn't matter how yeah how hard the journey may be the lord will lead me through i'm sealed hallelujah you simplify things too much no i don't think i do but there's a complicated age we live in no no it's all going to be no it's not even going to be a memory it's actually really quite a simple age i mean the messenger has come the word has come open and that word seals and elected people a way of that age and then once that's done the dead in christ are going to rise we're going to go on a rapture that's really the summation of this adrian what about the geopolitical you know socioeconomic troubles and the i don't know about that i'm not worried about it really are you just you just got blinkers on no no no i know the main thing the main thing i'm focused on the main thing hallelujah so the woman with the alabaster box i mean she saw the main thing is jesus needed his feet washed he needed to be made welcome so she was willing now to push through every obstacle to fulfill the main thing amy see brother bam says here and um what do we got here then uh this is in the message pride the thing it was uh was not how she was gonna get there was she gonna make an effort to get there i can see her elbowing her way through the crowd no matter what said or who said she was on her road to meet jesus do you know that would you elbow your way through the differences in the world today there's a lot of things to push through there's a lot of things on social media in the news and public opinion and the fair climate and all the are you going to elbow your way through coming through coming through man's opinion coming through trends of the world coming through hashtag whatever i don't care actually you know coming through all this other stuff coming through social media coming through covert or whatever i'm going through amen i'm going to elbow my way through because i see what the main thing is could you elbow your way over the vulgarity over the picture shows and the dancing and the carrying on that you do calling yourself a christian to get to jesus so can you deny what you're can you elbow through what you're caught up in to get to jesus i say amen amen could you lay down aside all your worldly social entertainment to come to the lord jesus to be entertained by him oh just think about that for a second he's a lot of glory hello hallelujah he gathers his bride i'm going to entertain her i'm going to show her a real big time i'm going to show her a real good time this is how we celebrate this is how we worship this is how we praise this is a satisfying thing that you don't wake up the next morning with a dull regret hallelujah i want to be entertained by jesus come entertain me hallelujah and that entertainment is not like the world just to excite people for a season that entertainment is him pouring his divine revelation into your soul make us more like him taking all our cares and our worries away that we can see well even if he doesn't take them away he's still the main thing amen hallelujah she elbowed right on through i said he said god have mercy she elbowed right on through she was going to get there regardless of how vile she was oh i know it was out of order oh sure that was totally out of order it wasn't on uh simon the pharisees list of things that would happen in that feast there was nowhere in the schedule would be woman with alabaster box enter stage left and just change the whole scene it was completely out of order but in god's economy it was the order amen if we could just get out of water brother graham says i oh i know it was out of order oh sure god help us get out of order once in a while she's saying may god help you may god help me get out of order lord enable me to get out of order once in a while the trouble of it is you've got too much order what's that the devil says sit there shut up you know oh you'll cause this trouble who cares about commotion if it's god doing it you know i marvel i just i love to watch god move you know and we are watching i come in what song we're watching with the girls eating like tabernacle and you know all the young young girls are dancing around the church which is scriptural the maidens will dance yes but somehow they don't crash into each other they just don't they somehow just do this and you know and it's not choreographed that's for sure i said well that's just the holy ghost doing it because if it was carnal they would bump into each other hallelujah but what happened is they got out of order he says now the trouble of it is you got too much order get out of order he says i hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved hallelujah amen he says i remember when jesus saved me oh my i'll never forget it this little old kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90 miles an hour i wept i cried i shouted i don't care who was standing around i wasn't paying attention to order i was in the presence of jesus i loved him she wasn't noticing how much order she was in or how much she was out of it the main thing was get to jesus see she knew the main thing i've got to get to that man hallelujah there he's hit with dirty feet he sit without being kissed he wasn't welcome and she wanted to make him welcome she didn't care about their old pharisaical orders about their old traditions and nominations she was pressing her way through to get to jesus god help us to have a revival like that where men and women will elbow their way through the crowds and denominations and the barriers till they get in the presence of jesus hallelujah that's what we want isn't it get through every barrier every ism every cold spell you know don't let no cold feeling devil get you down cold feeling come around no you're greater than that thing your god is greater than that thing oh it's some numb feeling in different faith that's just a spirit yes that thing's not going to rule my life hallelujah and now i'm not going by emotion but if you've got love you feel it i don't tell christine i love her every day because it's just something to say it's i feel it hallelujah it should be the same thing with us and the lord if we really love him we should feel that love hallelujah exactly amen now remember now here we are he says he says use every opportunity to get to jesus that's the main thing don't be hooked up with the affairs of the world we spend too much time on those things make your way to him and when you're there pour out your soul to him she says that's the main thing either i believe i'm looking at a group of people who know the main thing so i'm not telling you something you don't know or something that's i trust is not alien so amen this is just you know what we should do just the main thing make your every opportunity to get to jesus that's the main thing amen now he says and hear ye him now jesus is no respect of groups jesus met all kinds of groups all sizes all walks of life one time we have a record of a meeting with 500 some times with thousands one time we see him with twelve sometime once he was three and even to one no matter the size of group the main thing is jesus is there to meet with that group that's the main thing no matter how small your church is or how large it is how many how many you preach you the question is are you so committed to god that jesus meets in your company i want him to be here i want him more than more than great singing more than great worship more than preaching whatever you know intellectual speeches i the main thing is that jesus is there to meet with that group that's what we want isn't it amen it's part of the main thing hallelujah amen but you see now when people get into the prince of god it causes a reaction right there's a supernatural being that these bodies aren't aren't accustomed to being that kind of presence it causes a reaction it causes something to happen you see the the world is anointed by demon power and that causes things to happen now that's on the negative side what about the positive side remember this is the day when the form and the latter rain are running together i mean words whereas a teaching and the quickening anointing comes to anoint quicken that teaching to us right that the word becomes reality it goes from theory to reality i mean so both of those rains are falling together the teaching rain and the quicketing rain hallelujah so now if they are running together i'd say that our services should be more anointed our lives should be more anointed hallelujah remember there's no plateau in this walk and luther's age as far as they could live was the joshua lived by faith and they got to that plateau they couldn't go any higher i mean the methods come along john wesley second worker of grace sanctification a bit higher than being just justified that's as high as they could go and then the pentecostal move was just the restoration of the gifts i mean it was higher than just being justified or sanctified that's as high as they could go but now when malachi 4 has come and opened up the fullness of the word i mean there's no plateau there's no ceiling to this thing i mean it's just endless glory to glory from eternity to eternity i mean so we can't just plateau well how do you know you've arrived i'll tell you when your body's changed you've arrived i mean when your body has changed you have arrived but until then i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus than i ever had before that's what i want and he's got more to give amen you know god is not a reluctant giver amen he loves to pour himself out he loves to give impart revelation to his bride hallelujah amen but it causes it causes a reaction i'm going to come to that soon but he says here one of the main things he says and and that's what your prayer life does for the believer that's what they that's what daily keeps the world out of you is when you pitch yourself on your knees and say lord jesus and the blood comes down and it seals you all up so the devil can't get you see that's right and oh so many times the people go around and say it's awful but that don't make any difference it keeps you safe that's the main thing keep safe see your old fashioned that doesn't matter it keeps you safe i mean so when you daily commit your life to god in the morning when you get up say lord fill me amen cover me with your blood protect me i may no longer be me living but you living in me take my life and use this vessel of clay for your glory through the day what does it do it keeps you safe because you've you've committed your life to the lord so it doesn't matter if it's good or good or bad happen to you in the day that's a that's the law's prerogative right everything that happens to us is for our good we may not understand at that point in time how that was for your good but it works for your good lord amen so that keeps us safe that's the main thing who has to keep safe amen hallelujah from the devil in his amen that may be old-fashioned it doesn't matter it keeps you safe hallelujah he says in a second-handed robe that's the main thing in my life tonight is to know that i know him in the power of his resurrection that he lives and reigns and i know him by the forgiveness of sins by his spirit dealing by him moving and acting i know that it's him amen that's the main thing the main thing of it and no matter where or what time he comes be ready is the main thing hallelujah we want to be ready amen he says here it is the rising of the sun as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on thursday friday we should take the communion and all the doctrines they argue about whether it should be on this day or that day whether it should be the sabbath day or the first day of the week all these things are just merely tradition what good would any of it do whether you had lent or not lent if there is no life in you it's only a memorial which there's nothing against it but they've certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this the resurrection morning only one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this or are we been away or are we benefactors of his resurrection what does it mean to me what does it mean to you now we believe by faith that he's raised from the dead but what has it got to do with me that was two thousand years ago he says he says now to find this text now remember the main thing he's saying is they've left off the main thing and the main thing is his life and you and i right that we become beneficiaries of the resurrection but then he goes now to find this text and as i was tired my arm hurting me from the shots the nurse gave me for to leave overseas now as you know in a few days i must have these shots son and i for with cholera yellow fever and everything and i'm pretty weary making me sick which caesar requires to have these shots before you go on to another nation he said give caesar that's which is caesar's but then give god that which is god's so what's he saying there that's not the main thing but you've got to cater to these things give caesar's that which is seasoned but now we're going to see are we a beneficiary of the resurrection amen i'm just kind of going this way you probably don't know which way that is but we're going this way okay now he says in ephesians 1 and 11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who hath worketh all things after the council of his own will so we have obtained an inheritance right so the main thing would be what is in that inheritance all right and then he says in mark 10 17 and when he has gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeling to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and then revelations 21 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i'll be his god and he shall be my son hallelujah but we know that the inheritance did not come by the law i mean as it says in galatians 3 and 18 for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise amen so now we have an inheritance now an adherence we know is something that is left to you right it says brother brahm says in adoption for um in 1960 in whom we have obtained an inheritance oh and inheritance somebody has leave you something to inherit it is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did i have i didn't have any but god left me in inheritance when he put my name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world oh you say now wait a minute brother jesus did that when he died for you no he never jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me read the very next line in whom i also have obtained uh an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will so when jesus died he came that he would purchase our inheritance for us hallelujah says look having predestinated us unto this inheritance if i am if i'm a right to inherit something if god is knocking at my heart saying william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life now god took god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there was nothing i could do but in the fullness of time god sent in his own time jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance hallelujah i mean to be what one adherence to sonship to be a son of god so his blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance so now our inheritance is our sonship our position in christ i mean we're the devil's under our feet amen and we have dominion over him and all of his works however we have peace with god that we're made in his image amen so his blood was shared that we might go to that i mean so it doesn't matter where we start from that's irrelevant it's where we're going that matters i mean it's our final destination that matters amen so if he if he died on calvary because we think what's the main thing hallelujah the main thing is god is making a bride in his image in this hour and we're part of that number by his great grace hallelujah so his blood was shared that i and i trust you can put you in there might go to my inheritance i mean so that i may have started a slave but i but in my inheritance is sonship i mean i may have been in darkness and treat dead and sins and trespasses but in my inheritance is eternal life so that he shed his blood that i might go to that amen that where i was once alienated from god separated in my mind by the darkness of this world but he shed his blood that i might go to my inheritance i mean i've been reconciled to christ hallelujah amen now the difference between caleb and joshua and the others they were looking at the circumstances and caleb and joshua were looking at what god said god said it's yours he gave the promise god is obligated to keep his word now what do you look at if you're looking today to find god to keep his word he'll keep it but keep your eye on the word just move with the word don't leave it stay right with the word that's the main thing i mean so if we're looking who's looking for god to keep his word amen he'll do it if we're looking for him to fulfill this remember we can't bring one part of the scripture to pass right it's god that fulfills his word we can't fulfill his word i mean he has to come and fulfill his word in our lives but if we're looking see see the main thing is to be looking state with his word i mean looking that believing and looking for him to keep it and he will that's the main thing not looking at circumstances caleb and joshua saw the same giants the same cities the same problems the same obstacles but that wasn't the main thing in their mind the main thing is god has given us the land we're going to that land amen we're good on here at every part of it that's the main thing to them amen so they weren't worried about what the devil had set up in that place to stop them they said god is going to give it to us hallelujah says the same thing with you and i we have a lot of obstacles in this day we have a real devil that we're fighting right and he's a real slicker he's not some nothing he has power power of deception right and he's real good at it he's been spending thousands of years perfecting his craft of deception i remember we have to recognize that our enemy is a defeated enemy today i mean here's a defeated foe i mean outlawed that down calvary the main thing is that the devil was defeated that day he doesn't even have the keys keys to his house anymore so we have to recognize that when we come against the devil that he is defeated and he's just as defeated then as he is in 2021 and should there be a 2022 he's still defeated at 2023 he'll still be defeated i mean as long as he's in existence he still will be defeated doesn't matter how big he gets how whatever his threats are and things that don't matter we're facing a defeated foe amen hallelujah so we should be looking amen for god that he will keep his word hallelujah just stay with that word that's the main thing amen don't go with your opinion stay with the word now he says here in revelations chapter five part two now we have the earnest the holy spirit is the earnest of our inheritance well let's just back up a bit do you believe the blood was shared for you that you'd go to your inheritance you may it doesn't matter where you are in your walk there's still more of your inheritance to get so if you believe that his blood was shed for you that you would go into your inheritance amy you just keep that the main thing lord you purchased my inheritance and you're here now to ensure that i get my inheritance just got to keep your confidence in the lord amen that he will fulfill his word his blood that was shed amen he will that you will go to your inheritance so it doesn't matter what condition you find yourself in today you got to believe the blood was shed for you that you'll go to your inheritance hallelujah amen so we have the earnest the holy ghost is the earnest of our inheritance in other words it's the assurance the earnest is the assurance the down payment that we have been received into christ it is the blessed hope and insurance that we do have eternal life and our ears to everything that he purchased for us oh my can you see it oh when we have been sealed by the holy ghost i keep quoting it because i don't want you to miss it it's god's seal of approval that everything that christ died for belongs to us hallelujah so if you receive the holy ghost that's god's seal of approval i have received your faith amen remember it says in hebrews 11 by without faith it's impossible to please him but you can take the vice versa of that with faith it's impossible not to please him sure you may stumble and fall and trip and whatever but with faith it's impossible not to please him he gave you that faith amen that you would live a life pleasing to him hallelujah amen so with faith it's impossible not to please him you got to take that the other way see because oh do i believe well why are you here why are you here this morning i trust you have come because i believe i believe lord i believe your promises i believe you died on calvary for me i'm a believer hallelujah well don't you know these three classes of believers who cares about that i'm a real believer what category do you want to fall in i'm going to be a real believer hallelujah not a make-believer not an unbeliever i'm a real believer i know you know about so-and-so and so on so i don't care about so-and-so pray for them if you've got to worry about instead of shooting it through the church pray for them that's the thing that's going to help i mean gossip just kills people prayer helps prayer works prayer changes things hallelujah it's god's seal of approval see many times we wrestle with as god please with me well if he's given you the holy ghost that's a seal of approval i mean it's like my children my children are my children i love them anyhow they may do all kinds of things oh boy i do all kinds of things but they're still my children they're part of me hallelujah you know some people get upset they call us you know that we that we're just an elitist group there's the bride and there's not the bride people have got it round the wrong way see my children are my children other children i've never seen them upset because i'm their daddy it's just it is what it is right they are my children they're part of me so and they can proclaim it all day i'm a glory and i'm a glory and i'm a gloom you know that's just how it is right it's the same thing with the bride of jesus christ we say i'm the bride i'm the bride on the bright well oh you're just being elite no no he chose me i can't help that i wasn't looking for him he found me he was hunting me and he found me in the depths of sin and darkness he found me i wasn't looking for him he found me so if he found me he allowed me to respond back to his call i'm just happy he found me hallelujah i'm not putting anyone out that's that's their business because remember the individual puts themselves out of heaven it's not god putting people out of heaven it's actually because remember we have choice and god does not override our free choice right he presents which one do you want to do and brother brown even says in a place that people actually people fight their way to hell they actively fight to go there i'd rather just give up and say lord jesus yeah i'll go to heaven thank you hallelujah amen so people get wha yo oh you're elitist no no i'm just i've just been called he found me i'm happy about that just meet the same god i know have the same experience i've had i don't see the word the same way fall in love with the same jesus walk with him the same you know love him the same and you'll come out the same just like peter said on the day of pentecost repent be baptized everyone in the name of jesus christ for remiss your sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the promises of you your children those are far off as many as the lord our god shall call and we should come the same way you'll get the same result hallelujah exactly amen it's a good result too it took the apostles to heaven it took the believers to heaven amen it's going to take me to heaven hallelujah so i just i just believe the same word we've been restored back to the original faith of the fathers and it still works hallelujah amen amen no so it's everything that see it's a seal of god's approval that everything that christ died for belongs to us it's god saying i've received you now and i'm going to give you the seal that you're just waiting for that time to our full redemption that which we have been partially already redeemed now the fullness our of our redemption is the adoption to with the redemption of our body that's the fullness of of it and we're looking for that day we're not in the millennium no this is very if this is the millennium i want another one i'm very disappointed yeah but some people think we're there but no we're not there we're here we're looking to go there hallelujah now let's go to now i feel like i've okay we're gonna go to now the main thing we're to go to samuel i was going to read this in the beginning i thought no we will i said i hope this works but then i didn't even read it so you're probably wondering what works now so in 2nd samuel chapter 6 now i love the life of david because david knew the main thing david knew the main thing amen he met the main thing when he was anointed by samuel the main thing is the lord the lord jesus right amen he knew the main thing and he could live such a life where the main thing was in charge of his life so because he knew the main thing he knew at god's appointed time he'll become king so he didn't try and kill saul though he had two opportunities amen he he committed his life to the lord because he knew the main thing even though he was king he wasn't really caught up in politics because he knew the main thing now david was an unusual character because he had such a hunger for god he saw god do many mighty things but he just he's like as the heart panic for the water broke so my soul longs after thee he said he you know he was an un you know unusual kind of character but he had such a burden he said he just wanted more of the lord now i love david because he can he can worship in such a way that it doesn't actually matter what's going on around him now this is second samuel 6 and 16. now we're just going to read this down to verse 22 and then we're just going to go into this a bit and sorry if it feels like i'm going to another thing but remember david knew the main thing and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michael saul's daughter looked through the window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart see it's amazing that two people can be in the same meeting they can hear the same music they can hear the same preaching they can see the same word carried by the same priests i mean they can actually be in the same church and they can see all this going on and they can have two very different outcomes because one is there rejoicing and one's despising i want to be in the rejoicing bracket don't you [Music] amen and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and as soon as david had made an end of of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts and he dwelt among and he dealt among all the people even the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to everyone a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed everyone to his house then david returned to bless his household and michael the daughter of saul came out to meet david and he said how glorious was the king of israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth himself it's amazing were they in the same meeting they are in the same meeting now we're just going to stop there you know brother ram says that in the end time where the book of revelation he says exposes the works of the antichrist spirit or showing it rather that would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works which are the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and uh and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army hallelujah he says now if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thought to today as when christ will stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true rival with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we cannot but we will prevail over them so i'm sure we can agree that one of the main things in this end time is stopping the antichrist spirit defiling the church remember whenever i read this i don't put it out oh that's ladies here i bring it in here i bring it in here so one of the main things in this time would be withstanding the antichrist spirit that it cannot come in and defile us making us lukewarm formal and powerless right what do we agree that's one of the main things now webster would say about formal formal means having the appearance without the substance characterized by punctualist respect for form or methodical so it becomes a methodical thing we sing this long we preach this long we pray this long we say god bless you this long we go home this long it becomes i'm not trying to make it a joke but this but it becomes methodical so it's not just oh the devil takes the word out of the church no you can have the word without the spirit and things could just become formal i'm just getting into the heart of michael right here because he david was out of order he wasn't conducting himself like a king that's not what kings do saul never did that none of the other nations kings i've you know read about you know they did that kind of dancing no and and he's meant to be our great savior here he's dancing around exposing himself this is a shame but you see she had that formal spirit on her remember she was israelite she was in the rural household you say raised up in church right she was right there but the problem is she was looking down looking up looking down in a condescending way but if she just got down to where david's level was hallelujah and saw what he saw i'm gonna get into that hey man then she would have been dancing too so it's following or according with established form custom or rule you know we're watching a um the girls love to watch weddings um message weddings from around the world and we watched well a part of one wedding is from trinidad and it took them 45 minutes at least just to get into the church now i've been at weddings i've conducted weddings nothing against them love them all but it's the kiwi way short sharp done you know i would have done like two or three weddings in that space where they're just coming in the church but it's because it's cut well you say well they take too long i could say this they make the most of the occasion because it's a big thing two people are getting married and it's not just anyone getting married as part of the bride getting married it's actually god expressing his plan of union and redemption and two people that's a big thing right so i mean to me now sure that's a long time but hey they make an occasion of it hallelujah but we just short sharp done so but you say well to them that's their custom and to us we have our custom but which one's right you know so but we don't want to be caught into a mold which is actually taking away from what god can do hallelujah amen now short wedding long wedding i'm not preaching a certain you got to be you know but what i'm saying is that we have a custom which is boom boom boom done and they have a custom which is you know let's make the most of the day let's celebrate this this is great you know but our short sharp doesn't mean that we don't celebrate it but you know they kind of express it a bit more anyway relating to or involving the outward form structure relationships or arrangements of elements rather than content what has that got to do with church well what is the content of a meeting god's the content jesus is the content hallelujah where it's not just the form and the structure you say well this church order yeah if the holy ghost is doing anything it'll be in order it won't be out of order you know and and and the thing of it is you say well there's a lot of carnality that you know that goes on when people shout and jump that may be so but there's the genuine in there too and if you clamp down on the whole thing you don't just squish the car or you squish the genuine right so i would rather some wildfire than no fire i'd rather people get out of order long enough to get saved and they haven't they have a moment in the presence of god that changed their life forever then then they can't break out of that because of a oh this is not what we do around here i don't want to limit god in any way john when he saw the book come open didn't sit there and say now that's a good thought that's right everything in heaven under the heavens everything heard him scream hallelujah said glory blessing honor be to the lamb now you may be quiet that's fine but as long as there's a revelation burning in your heart amen that you're part of the bride and jesus christ has redeemed you then let it burn on hallelujah but you know michael are here on foot now and david as well see see there's an idea that people become less emotional when they become more mature because we're matured now i just want you to know david david's in his life he's i just mr google told me that david was 30 years old when he danced before the ark now so he's not a little boy so physically he's come to his maturity but then also spiritually he's not just anointed and still a shepherd he's not anointed king but on the run he's not anointed and there's a civil war going on no the whole of israel has come together anointed him king so now he's come to his position in the body he's an adopted son of god in his position now that sounds like maturity to me hallelujah no he didn't become all formal because he matured no he he was dancing because god was doing something and he was rejoicing i mean because god was doing something in his day hallelujah so he was someone who was mature he was adopted into the body amen and he did not become cold formal and indifferent see see if the devil can't see if the devil can't make us lukewarm he'll make us formal right and if he can't do that he'll make us powerless all those things do tie together but you know we don't want to get so formal we become powerless we want we want to have it in such a way that god you know i just thinking camp can be every service no matter what's being preached you know there is such an expectation at camp on a sunday night that it could be possibly the worst sermon that's ever preached and god would still move in power it was tremendous by the way to me that was that was stellar that was awesome but you know what i'm saying is there's such an atmosphere and a hunger it's sunday night god's gonna do something lord i want to touch the hem of your gum and this is my time holy we're going to have that time all the time hello where god could minister something it may be manifest in a different way but he could touch your heart change your life those are the moments i want however it is displayed praise god but as long as he comes and touches my heart amen changes me in a bit hallelujah that's what i want amen so see the thing is a lot of people actually they've just allowed the devil to rob them of their joy so michael was in that kind of she was in that kind of a a a state she was in the same meeting as david she saw the same arc being carried in as david she heard the same music as david she's she heard the same preaching as david she was in the same church as david but yet she was despising him in her heart now but david see the devil always try and knock you after god's done something for you he will always try and knock you down because he tries to make you doubt what happened right but the thing is david david was a man after god's own heart see we're going to face opposition was that really real did that really happen was that really for you well and you go look back at the recording and the recording's not the same as being there that's just how it is you know but it really did happen it really was there and you yeah god really did something but then david would say can can we just go up to the go up to second samuel 6 and 21. hallelujah so so here's michael she said you know you made a shame in all these things but now notice david and david said unto michael it was before the lord so you're all of us dancing it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord so he was dancing because god chose him i mean god had elected him god had anointed him to be king it wasn't him choosing and him deciding now he began to dance because god chose me i'm accepted in the beloved i've been redeemed i've been washing the blood of the lamb amen this is my moment this is my hour amen i had a desire for god and god gave me the desire of my heart because the ark is coming into the setting the word is being restored back into my life hallelujah because god chose me that's why i can rejoice i didn't choose me he chose me i mean if he chose me that's all that matters hallelujah and this is that's why i worship god i mean that's why i dance before the lord because he has chosen me hallelujah it should be the same way with you and i why do we worship why are we believers because he has chosen me before the foundation of the world before there's anything he thought of me in the back part of his mind so i'm going to have them in 2021. they're the apple of mine eye i'm going to make a way before that devil ever comes into existence the lamb's blood is going to be slain before the foundation of the world i'm going to make a way for them to be redeemed they meant to be made whole only to conquer every effort that he has over them hallelujah amen he chose me harley why do you get happy he chose me god is sovereign he no one can bend his mind it's not a democracy in heaven he said i've just chose to buy for knowledge he looked through the strands of time he saw me in the condition i asked him that i'd accept him he's not going to predestinate that one i'm going to put a c gene a predestination in their soul doesn't matter what concrete's poured over them whatever troubles they face in life whatever things they go through i mean they're gonna come out as gold in the end and because i have chosen them before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah god has chosen me to be part of the bride be part of his word that's why i dance before the lord amen he's chosen me to take a rapture i mean that's why i danced before the lord and he's chosen me that this body is going to be changed oh that's why i dance before the lord amen hallelujah hallelujah amen he's chosen me to overcome that's why i worship hallelujah he has chosen me amen that i will not taste death but i'm going to go in a body change amen when he said to him that overcometh they will sit down on my throne as i've sat down my father's throne amen he chose me to be that overcomer you know we have a position amen that he has ordained for you and i to sit in and that is not to be the devil's whipping boy but there's a sit as an overcomer on the throne of god hallelujah that's why david said i i do did this before the lord he wasn't looking to be a he didn't care what others thought hallelujah he worshipped god because god was god and that's how we should be in every situation though trouble may surround us though the world is falling apart though there's everyone's desire divided every which way and opinions and social media and everyone says this and that god's word stands true amen and god is here he's risen in this day yeah the mighty angel has descended christ himself to anoint to dwell in a people amen that he will prepare us to leave this world hallelujah that's the main thing that's the main thing hallelujah that's the main thing he has here he has turned up in my life to prepare me that i will leave this world that's the main thing i mean and not just me but it's for my family it's for my children it's for my loved ones whoever you believe for that's why i just say lord just take control of my faith take your faith live in me and just take control may i not limit you to what i think and hear and what i see just lord may i take you by your word oh god and may you live through me like never before take that faith your place of my heart and just loose it oh god to take over my life hallelujah he has chosen me hallelujah lord god amen we're here to take a body change that's the main thing amen he's given us eternal amazing he redeemed you and i that's the main thing he doesn't look at your sin and your mistakes that's the main thing it's nothing that we've earned that's the main thing that's what he has to create is the main thing hallelujah hallelujah and david said if you don't like that i'm going to do it worse tomorrow hallelujah no one's going to stop my praise no one's going to stop my joy no one's going to stop my love i can't remember who said about what can separate us from the love of god nothing can many things will try but nothing can oh they will peril it cannot we'll trouble will opinion or sickness will anything separate from the love of god no nothing can hallelujah why he chose me david had a lot of things going on in life remember he wasn't dancing because everything was fine he had a big family he had children he had domestic issues remember he lived life things were going on but that didn't stop him hallelujah we realized the anointing that came upon him that wasn't just an emotional workout oh that was god putting a seal of approval this is my king he's gonna come to the throne hallelujah he's part of me i've chosen him for this hallelujah and here we are we are his bride he has anointed us we've been called hallelujah i can't vouch for everyone else but i've been called and i just said i'm coming lord because your blood was shed to lead me into my inheritance holy and i'm possessing it more and more every day hallelujah hallelujah lord jesus hallelujah i've got one more to read i imagine no brother man speaking about david i believe i imagine the same thing it's like it is today they say shouting and praising god and crying and this here so-called holy roller life and things it's all emotional work up it don't it don't meet their scientific approval but it meets god's bible that's the main thing amen hallelujah amen praise our god

they'll say something like you know what you've been longing for it's on you've been in a rapture cycle but now here's the end of the rapture cycle and the quickening power of god's been moving through the church all morning hallelujah and it's not just for a one-time thing he's with us when we go home on our jobs wherever we are but he's preparing us to leave so i'm going to worship god it
