the master and we are not we are the clay and you are the pter we commit ourselves and the rest of the service tonight into your hands Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen God bless you so um I'll just open the presentation from my phone um I'm not sure if I was I was supposed to use yours Mario or not yes please if otherwise the phone is just going to be going to read from the book of Revelation chapter 3 while we standing we'll read from the book of Revelation chapter 3 thank you musicians appreciate the songs and U the commitment um I made a statement one day when I was standing here I said if it was possible for me to to press a reset and and reset all your minds I don't know how many can remember if I can reset you you know when you you put foil that that the pump shows other numbers of the previous person who P Fuel and then the moment you put your the nozzle on the on the on the fuel cap it goes 0 it resets and then which means you're starting on a clean slate so I pray that I wish I could reset you tonight so that everything that happened like 1 minute ago up to the up to the morning it can be flashed out and then you we can focus on the Lord amen how many are under expectation I am under expectation tonight and I know that God is not a man he uses a man but he's not a man Hallelujah let's read um Revelations 3 then we can sit down and unto the angel of the church of the ludian aians write these things say sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God H Allelujah these things speaketh the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Heavenly Father we ask you once more to bless your word Lord we only unqualified insignificant human beings but I know Lord that if you inspire the hearts and you inspire the lips Lord you can bring forth what you pre-ordained to be spoken tonight won you just take me aside Lord and speak to your people I've got no capacity I've got no ability but I depend on you Lord we've got no law but the Bible we've got no creit Lord we've got no other Spirit no other um ability but we just depend on your Holy Spirit tonight we ask that you bless these people tonight as we commit this the service and the word into your hands in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the church says amen please enjoy the Comforts of your seat how many are happy to be alive how many are happy to have the life of Jesus Christ in them I am I am so thankful I'm not taking it for granted I'm thankful to be alive I'm thankful to be facing the enemy in this season Hallelujah so tonight as we have read there uh many many many months ago we spoke about H the power of your amen or what your amen means to you that was after Co sometime I can't remember where but while we are there let's just read another scripture Numbers Chapter 23: 19 to 21 the Bible says God is not a man God is not a man he doesn't eat KFC he does not participate in human activities as we do God does not forget so God therefore is not a um I'd like to to participate with you God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of men that he should repent which means everything that God says goes which means everything that God says it cannot come back and we say let's try again so everything that God says sorry about that it goes um put this one on apologies now that scripture says that he should repent had he had he said and shall not do it if God says something there's no way in which it cannot happen his Word is Alive H Allelujah he is or had he spoken and shall not not make it good behold I have received Commandments to bless and he had blessed and cannot reverse it so this was the this this portion I'm reading it was it's about the story of the Prophet called balam balam balam bam Josh bam you know when he was talking to the king uh the king of the enemy I think it was his name is balak when he was talking to him and that man there had a deal that he should cast Israel so this is what came out of the lips when he said God is not a man that he should lie let's go to verse 20 behold I have received a commandment balam says I have received a commandment to bless Hallelujah not to Cur and this cannot be reversed this is the prophet who intended deliberately and agreed with the Enemy to ciss the people of God but out of his lips he says I bless he ha not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither had he seen per has he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord is good is with him the the Lord is the Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them one more scripture I just want to see if we can re make these scriptures relate or build build sort of a a context in what we want to talk about Jeremiah 29 um you we heard that he's not a man but let's hear now for I know God says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you this is very deep for I know the thought that I the thoughts that I think towards you sayth the Lord the thought of Peace not of evil to good to give you an expected end so this is if you just pause and think about this What God Says you'll realize that many a times human beings Humanity as it is we behave as if God did not think or God does not have a plan about us this is just for real many times including Christians we conduct ourselves or behave in such a way that it suggests that God could be still investigating how he's he planned about us you know it's like we've got a plan for ourselves am I wrong or right now tonight we just want to quickly speak about just before we pray I say here becoming the amen we know what the word amen means right but I want to to really give the emphasis or the context to that statement at the bottom the power of your confession and declarations by faith you see there is power in what you confess there is Authority there is as long as you are a son and you are a daughter of God there is power he said in Revelations 3 these things at the end in the Book of Revelation these things speaketh the amen so am I in the position right now sister naom to be the amen that he is because we we know that amen means so be it right does it mean in other explanations it means true truly so be it which means that is as is as you hear it amen so be it so the Bible says so speaketh the amen the true the true the true witness the beginning of the creation of God Jesus Christ himself so he wants you to be his word he wants you to be him to be like him to for him to be you that is why I wrote that word becoming the amen so whose amen should me and you be he him because he is the amen I hope you'll get me as we go along but I just want to focus on the power of your confession when I sit there on the floor or on the chairs there or I'm sitting somewhere working maybe I'm brother Armand cleaning the carpet maybe I'm sitting I'm driving maybe I'm doing some work in the office or whatever you're doing what is it that you are conf confessing huh what is it that I am confessing what what what am I confessing because he said everything that I said about you about me it shall not come God is not a man everything that he said he will do he will do is if he said I will heal you he will heal you but what am I confessing you see H God cannot hold you on Ransom he cannot hold you on to he cannot force you to to be like him but if he chose you that you are his you are going to come reflecting him the reflection and the image that you are going to be at the end is what he said despite all the challenges despite what whatever way you may want to go or I may want to go lack of Revelation lack of anything but if he said I will make you mine and you are mine you will be his at some point so that is not the point of discussion the point of discussion is am I part of that happening am I am I confessing on a daily basis because I like to be practical I'm not this person who preaches this H uh Big M mystery and hidden teaching there's people who are gifted to do that I want to I'm very practical to say on a daily basis I'm not well maybe I'm hurt maybe I'm injured maybe I'm not well in body but what am I confessing because he said I am the Lord your God who Health your diseases sometimes you will even hear a Christian saying or my my my sugar diabetes you know my my uh identifying with something that is not his saying my you know uh my my my poor estate you know like my so identifying and owning up to something that is not actually yours so my question is that if a Christian talks like that a Believer speaks in that way sister Vanessa saying ah you know my my blood pressure or my identifying you know my this is not your problem if it's not the devils and you a daughter of God then leave it in God's hands it's not for you so let's not own let's not confess because look the question is that if you speak like that I just want to us to unpack this if you identify yourself with those kind of things and and many times we do it consciously because of the way we are used to talk without listening to ourselves without even consciously or even actively hearing what I'm saying I'm talking to this man here we the enemy because he knows that you are a child of God and you are powerful and what you say goes just like God put because you are an unnature God did you hear the pastor some few weeks ago saying you are an amature God you the moment I know who I am it means everything that I speak or profess or Express even if you're joking even when you're joking it goes to that level a Son of God when you say something it happens now if you say my my cancer or my or my one my one the doctors are the it's not yours my problem is this there's two two or three possibilities when you talk like that it's either is either you don't know who you are yet or it's not you speaking because the enemy is able to use your mind to use your your lips the enemy so maybe we we need to deal with that enemy that makes you or me talk like that that's right because you cannot own something that's not yours you cannot be allow yourself to own no no confess right I must confess right I must confess love healing peace regardless of what is around me am I right correct me if I'm wrong but a Christian cannot own those things I'm just giving example of diseases but a Christian cannot own H who someone always say say we always happy we are always it's not like we don't have challenges Esther it's not like we don't have problems we do but we live beyond because remember we are not controlled by the situations of this world actually this flesh this flesh we are we are supposed to live beyond it there is a body that is living in us that operates not from here the same body that made Peter do you think Peter if you think of phys physics and really science do you think Peter could walk on water do you think it was Peter it was Peter in a different form you know we operate in three bodies we operate in in three levels there a a flesh there's a a a a a glorified body there's a theophan you know we operate within those bodies and my theop and your theop is not far he's right here walking beside you but the question is is you and me where do we operate from where are you operating from when you said I yeah I'm stuck with this problem it's mine who's talking there is that your theophany or is this guy this guy can be Infested by a lot of demons infested and the only pesticide to deal with that is the holy spirit is the correct confession amen I wrote here that you are saved by your confession not only your confession but your confession is of what he said about you in his word because when you confess you don't just confess more your own ways isn't it you confess his way his thoughts about you you confess what he said about you because my word your word cannot stand but his word which I believe and I confess that that is what actually makes the difference and that's what I'm talking about tonight that is what saves you if you believe you'll see as we go along what I'm talking about believe what he said confess what he said then it shall come to pass Hallelujah H confession comes in many different ways I wrote here you know uh it can come by means of you asking for forgiveness from someone you confess your mistakes and say brother Isaac forgive me my brother um you know yesterday when I passed the pizza shop you didn't see me but when I left at the door there at the piz I took one can there I stole it so please forgive me you see you're confessing your sin you're asking for forgiveness you're confessing and in there there's a blessing if you do that if you are a son of God it won't sit well with you so you confess so there's confession by means of asking for forgiveness or there's a confession of love for God so loved the world you know we have recently witness a beautiful beautiful beautiful event when a young man and a young woman confess love to one another you saw that that's a confession of love you can confess by means of your actions sister Analise you say I want to be baptized today and I want to make a public Det ation and confession by everybody if it could be possible to come and witness My Confession you know you're acting you're getting baptized right so there's many ways in which confession can be expressed by faith believing that you will receive what you are asking for what I mean by this is that we don't just confess here Loosely what we confess we are very much aware and are alert of what we are talking about because it is God's word we believe it you know um my wife always tells me of because she's the baby at home she her sister will maybe do something and she'll rush to Mommy to report and Mommy will say oh I'm going to I'm going to EIT her you know that confession excuse me to show that that confession is not actually a real one when she goes back to to the sister of the brother saying mommy said she's going to hit you you know what the brother says says okay she'll always tell tell you that the brother already knew that momy's confession doesn't it's from here if mommy wanted to to eat him or her she will come with a stick and show what did he do come come here come here and give him a back slab immediately or there and there because he meant the confession right our confession should really be coming from here when you say amen amen and I'm not discouraging you from saying amen I'm actually encouraging you because if you confess as a son and a daughter of God that comes to pass and if you don't confess it how can can it come to pass how can it come to pass if you don't confess it Aiden how can it it can't my boy you need to confess it and say this year sorry my brother I'm getting A+ because I told him that I want A+ I'm getting A+ and I will get it in the name of the Lord because the Lord said whatever I ask I do my part the rest is history so you do your part and keep on confessing Keep On Believing remember the man who eyes got open when he confessed when he said praise God I can see did he see according to this flesh did he see in the spiritual realm did he see yes in the spiritual realm that man already was seeing he was already that is why when he said praise the brother says continue you are healed when did Brother bham see that how did he see that spiritually that man was no more blind it's only that the flesh was still stuck and the flesh the the more the more he confessed it it it took a moment when the bab was cutting his hair that his ey the flesh could not could not hold it any longer because he operated from a different realm he confessed it you and me must confess it regardless sister J am I right we need to confess it boys I want to encourage you tonight that whatever God has promised you despite all problems AB despite all the challenges at your level my friend you keep on confessing it I've got ministers here I'm under expectation that's why I call their names I've got ministers and I'm under real expectation I don't I'm not meing my weight if the L tell is amen so so the list that I wrote here is not exhaustive confession in my actions my thoughts my thoughts yeah your thoughts because he said he said was it to brother bam that tell them that even their thoughts in heaven they speak louder than their words our thoughts my thoughts that is why God's thoughts are so powerful your thoughts are so powerful until nobody says take volume up in heaven the Lord can hear them very clear and my thoughts too they speak and they confess something so let us confess the real word of God and believe it amen let's just hear what the man of God says here then then we will close who is God in 1950 August the 15th and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body to come into your confession your body your body will obey your confession your body will be compelled to change and agree to your confession that's right if you say you are a drunker you want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one if you say you are a Sinner and you want to sin you'll be you'll be right into it there's so much power in My Confession in your confession and the things that I confess if you say you are a Christian believe it all along God will bring your testimony will bring you right into it this is just to give you an idea of how and what things we can confess in our lives take take what the prophet says there and apply it to your life and to your needs to your desires there is nothing impossible for a daughter of God let not the devil intimidate or threaten you or anything keep confessing he will he will make it happen the Lord so my confession your confession very powerful let's just take a few examples in the Bible and then we we close let's take the first one I I I actually wrote here uh I wrote actually quite a few things faith and then I wrote uh confession then I wrote action then I wrote test you see where I'm going then I wrote patience those are the things that goes along with your confession right so I wrote them and then we will look at them and then we pray the purpose of me bringing this someone like this is really just to encourage you brothers and sisters to motivate you because you are not just human beings if you ever thought that are yes you are nothing when we say you are nothing you are nobody we mean you in this form but actually within your body your real you runs the blood of the Royal Family you have to believe it don't believe a lie of the devil saying oh who am I yes you're not you're nobody in this flesh in this physical form and the way you came and everything else you are nothing but because you've got a God in you who is a creator of the heavens and the Earth you can say I'm I'm something by his grace I'm a son and a daughter of God and not allow the devil to give you irrelevant things and you go along with it do you know how dangerous is a thought a thought is a very dangerous thing because sometimes a thought comes even so say so slick so subtle than even the way water or light can come through you know light is one of the finest thing that can go through here so many you know light can go um and air and water they you just not cannot control them easily and oil maybe liquids but a thought a thought that is why we are going to travel faster than the speed of a thought when we go home the real you not faster than light light is too slow light will be too slow for us actually already human beings have already trying to to go you know they've passed the speed of sound already sound you know when I say arand can can you just see how quickly it gets there does not take a millisecond what about light what about you know air so the speed of a thought is so is so fast there's a a quotation they say how many thoughts you you think in a day is scary so let's just look at this few five Concepts and then we go let's look at a man called Abraham when we confess our sins well sorry when not our sins when we confess our confession don't just take it negatively when you make a confession in your mind in your heart whichever way you make it for anything that I've already alluded to and many more when you make it believe our example here is Father Abraham this one is an AI generated Abraham confession without faith in what you are confessing is meaningless is baseless and is is is useless you have to believe apply faith in your confession believe it don't don't don't worry about left or the right just believe it right let's look at what Abraham did the Bible says in Romans 4 from verse 20 he St not you know what is to stagger he didn't W he didn't he was not wavering wavering around is that the right word to staggering and changing directions and and and and doubtful and not sure he didn't stugger he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief he never doubt it he believed but was strong in faith giving glor glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform that is why me I think we are challenged as Christians as a Church of the Living God to believe we should actually be concerned if things don't happen to us what we ask for when we ask God and and things don't happen then we should go back to our knees and we should fast and we should pray and we should collectively because there is a testimony of a also a collective confession when they say when when where there's a will there's a way but where there's a will of many people can you imagine what happened when everyone brings their leak of fire into this specific need and we say today brother we are going to to pray for you we are going to deny oursel a meal and pray for this situation and agree that thing moves God that thing makes God to move and respect our confession and our faith because it is according to his word so there is power in Faith Like Our Father Abraham did he did not just tell the people that I'm going to have a child no no he meant it he believed it this confession of just saying it Loosely because I want to please my friends or I want to I'm just saying it from shallow mindedness it's not going to work it's either you believe what you are saying or you don't don't waste time by saying things and you don't believe them believe them be a daughter and the Son of God and have faith in what you are saying I don't know how else I can emphasize it Hallelujah another example that I said here is about a confession I brought little pictures so that the little ones cannot sleep can can can can pay attention and so that they can be able to say amen and once you say amen mean it because you are going to be that amen you will be that amen if if the Bible says you're going to be healed and you're going to be delivered and you say Amen you will be just believe it you will receive the Holy Ghost don't care what the enemy says I don't care what the enemy is showing you what he is preaching don't actually resist listening to him let's hear the the three Hebrew boys you know what I'm trying to say with these Concepts should I call them Concepts is that confession alone you know there's things that it goes along with and the list could be very long there's things you have to believe your confession the three Hebrew boys made a statement they said Shadrach Mish this is now from The Book of Daniel 3:16 to18 Shadrach mishak and abeto answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter it is if it is if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from from the burning fairy finess and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King ah this is treason in other languages they say this is trison this guy is the king the king did not know what amount of frustration must he choose you're you're saying oh King you are praising me oh King but you say you can't obey me can you imagine the superpower of that day how Nebuchadnezzar would have failed but if not if God cannot deliver if not be it known unto thee Oh King that he will we will not serve thy Gods I want the young men of this church to speak like this to say no Nebuchadnezzar Let Me Be A mishak and A Shadrach and Abed I want the fathers and the mothers of this church to talk like that then you you check us our our our inspiration will will bless far and wide I I've got no doubt without what I'm saying that that can be the that can be the beginning of the end of this world of our Rapture to to come and go so young man said no you see the reason I'm addressing the young men and young women is that you don't realize that the enemy is attacking you you actually help the enemy to attack your your own self by confessing wrong things young people be careful I'm saying this because I was a young person I if I could sit down with you I'll tell you the mistakes that I did horrible and bad ones but I'm standing here right now as if I know anything and The Time Has Changed ched and evolved from the time I was a young man until now but all these men here sitting here and women they've passed your stage don't think you're at Labor my boy my girl I'm just giving you a warning with love you see I'm smiling because the devil is sh what Mom and Dad are saying help them to help yourself they've walked that road before I was so blessed on Sunday by the the service brother Colin when he was doing Sunday school he he he just blew me away because his testimony about his life and how he walked was just so wonderful I think I'm going to suggest brother Ben to ask you one time to come give us a testimony now let's quickly look to the issue of action you see you believe your confession by faith and you say it and then after that you act you act there was a man called Nehemiah Nehemiah was in slavery or in captivity and it came to pass that nemiah appeared before the king one day and the King asked him hey neiah why do you look so sad why is your countenance like that and nemiah explained to the king why go read the book of nemiah it's a powerful book it said they they read the the Scrolls from the morning until the evening they were reading crying praying and fasted and then where am I nemiah so Nehemiah came to a point where the king allowed and gave him all the material to go and rebuild the city so what I'm trying to bring to you here is about the rebuilding of the city what happened when they were rebuilding the city walls it was fight men as brother Isaac says you fight on the one hand and then on the one hand you are laying the brick you building the city this city of yourself so that the Lord can come and dwell in your life want to be over time so neiah acted nemiah did not just tell the king oh King we are here in slavery we were just wishing and praying King since we are here in the slavery land we we are your we are your servants we are your your subjects just give us good food and yeah we'll see how it goes can you see he's talking like he was he just one sympathy oh king king of King ah we can even worship your Gods we yeah Israel is doomed is dead can you see it's hopeless but nemiah said no okay my face is not just my countenance is not just down like that talk like a daughter of God and a son of God talk like you serve a God say yes I'm set I am set King but this is the reason I want unlimited permission of material and the us as we pass through the land to go and rebuild the city of God it was a big speech it was a powerful speech and the King did it and then Nehemiah they you know the story they build a city those were during the time of the great zerubabel I like talking about zerubabel they built a city and it was not easy but that followed their confession they confessed they believed then they're now acting and when they building the city there were there were enemies man who had that they were building a city and they came and attacked them but these guys it's just it's only that AI does not make it right I wanted a picture where they've got a Sal and they've got if someone can make it for me that would be nice you know to show that confession doesn't end up okay no there are times when you act for your confession all the time you act you live as if you have already received it h there is a sister who went to the supermarket she didn't have no scent and she went to the supermarket and she took a a big trolley and the children were hungry and starving and she pushed it she was collecting groceries she's got no she had no money nothing what is she doing she's acting upon her confession I can't remember the story very well but somebody at the te just was led by the Lord to say hey ma'am I I I just feel like paying for your for your groceries it was full if you knew the situation of that sister you were going to say shame you know as they say oh shame sister just leave this to please and just come to my house we'll give you some bread that we left yesterday we've got leftovers for you we'll see tomorrow come to our house because you don't know you don't believe in her confession you didn't confess her confession so you are coming across like the enemy but when the sister is acting there's a sister who said Lord there is drought I would like to have rain in my field there in Zimbabwe there's a sister who did that and it rained and it the rain fell on her her fi only can you believe that can happen the Lord is able to do those things the Lord today is able to do those things because he listened to your confession as a son as his son and his daughter and the Lord wants you to believe if you believe and then you are ready to receive it like shra like nemiah now also your confession if you believe it you are acting it and doing everything prarion it will also be tested oh yes it must be tested because God does not want things that did not pass his quality assurance program God has got a quality assurance process that the Holy Ghost allows for it to come because you are a genuine seat of God and the words that you are saying are genuine by genuine Faith genuine confession therefore you'll be tested there in Africa we buy things from China and we call them fun Kongs I don't know if you have them here where something is this mic Fong what do we mean by that is that brother Ben is that it can't do the quality of that mic cannot be like the original brand quality of producing or taking sound it's a Fong so a child and a daughter of God you who are sitting here listening tonight what you say is not a fun Kong is real genuine don't disbelieve what you say don't disbelieve what you hear from the word of the Lord from the Bible don't disbelieve just take it and be like you are not normal and just apply it regardless now it must be tested my example here is the man called job you know the story of Job he was tested to the limits to the extreme limits until his own wife said no Daddy Daddy I think you got it wrong just you know what just you see you about to go just ciss God just kiss him and die once can you hear a spirit of giving up and just that's how she spoke and job answered her and said you know you're speaking like a foolish a fool talking to fools the way you are speaking how can you be happy when God gives and you want to be like a weather and change when God takes don't you know that everything comes from God don't you know that you have got the ability to create those things to speak them into existence so you know the story of Job he was tested to the limits and this test was approved in heaven I can't read there but if you want to please go and read job 23 cuz job made statements there to to Really validate that I'm passing these tests and I'm passing this test with an A+ and God was under obligation to bless him even more than how he was before that's what will happen to you and to me when we believe God even during the most horrendous tests it's not your time to give up and then you need also to be patient as well Isaiah 40 says they I didn't have a picture for this one but but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength if you wait upon the Lord you will renew your strength because your strength is going to come when you receive when you get from the Lord and you start to see like job how do you think job I mean he was renewed that man when when when all the disease was gone and and children came back you know and all his riches came back double do you think job continued to be weak his strength got renewed they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not be tired to faint is to be tired to faint right so that's what happens when you are patient with what you believe knowing very well that there's many or clouds of Witnesses in the Bible for you and for me do you have you ever sat down and thought about why why what could be the reason why God H did not create you in the in the the Third Church age there in the 1800s or in 1720 have you ever thought about that why why did God make me to come and appear and live here now especially now in 2025 why have you ever thought about it because God have got a bigger purpose and God's purpose does not fail what God Said God said you going to Rapture you will Rapture he will make you Rapture are you ready are you ready to participate in the Rapture and believe it and have the rapturing faith of going home are you ready for that young young guys are you ready to to to from from 15 huh from 20 I mean from 15 from 16 from 123 Liam to become 21 are you ready my boy are you ready to change and be the same age as dead and run and not faint that's ultimately what we are here preparing for I can't wait to to see how how brother Kuban will be when he's 21 I can't wait and I'm sure he can't wait to see me you know maybe I'll be a little taller I'm happy with my my heart but what I mean is our bodies will be perfect I cannot wait to spend that time with you now boys don't be deceived my girls sister you are going to be the same age with your daddy Jimmy same age so in closing brothers and sisters I want to say to you having said all those things the ultimate reason the ultimate goal our ultimate end product huh is that we are going home and we are we are about to change is that is that your project goal is that what your goal is every day saying yes I'll go to this work yes I'll do this I'll do that I'll work it's all right but my ultimate goal I'm going home that's the ultimate we are going to change and we are actually in the process right now we are changing right now your body you're busy changing moving into your your body
