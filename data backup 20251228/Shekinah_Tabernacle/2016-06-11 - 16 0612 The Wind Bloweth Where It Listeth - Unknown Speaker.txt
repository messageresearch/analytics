Lord doesn't matter what week we're faced we still love you and you're still wonderful that doesn't change to us and we thank you in Jesus Christ name amen amen thank you musicians amen God bless you all hallelujah amen if you got your um Bibles handy um if You' like to turn with me to John chapter 3 amen it's wonderful to have all the visitors it's the weekend after Queen's birthday normally get all the visitors in but hey we got more this week so it's good amen God bless you all amen who appreciated the special this morning amen amen it was a real blessing amen praise the Lord amen so John chapter 3 and we're just going to read verses uh 1 down to verse 8 and I know this is very familiar but it says now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews amen we all there uh the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou Dost accept God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verely verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot canest not tell from whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen let's just go to Genesis 1 and verse 1 it says here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen you may be seated may the Lord bless his word now I want to I want to try and I know I've preached along these lines before but I want to uh speak about the you know the you know the wind you know the spirit moves through well will you know you cannot tell really where it comes from where it goes but after God blows into a place things are very different from when they first were amen and we can see this even in Genesis chapter 1 that you know it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep but then when when when when the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters he had an intention and that was that you know that that there would be an Eden you know there'd be Adam there would be Eve and that would have dominion over the Earth that was his attention when he began to brood over the face of the Earth and we know he separated the light and the Darkness and he brought the land forth and he you know the seeds came forth and he created the animal life and everything then he put man in the garden and you know this was his this was this was God's desire is that his children would be there because God you know and it's the same with with with every believer before they meet God they're not satisfied with whatever life they may find themselves in there's something in them that is just not really satisfied they might tray all kinds of things they may go from church to church or they might just be in the world in some place but they're never truly happy there's just something in them that is just looking for something more I trust you you're that's been your experience and it's because there is you know as brother baram he would he would preach a sermon called The Deep calleth unto the deep and he would take that from the Psalms the Deep calleth unto the deep and he would say a very simple thing but a very powerful thing that if there's a deep in here that means there's a deep to respond and before there's a deep in here there was a deep out there amen so he said if you know if there's a longing in here for more of God there's more of God to have and the very reason you can actually one of the eviden is people say how do you know Jesus is real well we could go spend many times speaking of his Supernatural hand but you could say because there's a longing in here for God that means there's a God out there someplace that is there to be met amen because the Deep calleth the I mean the Deep calleth to the Deep amen so now God when he brooded over the face of the Earth he there was a deep calling in him that he didn't just want to be by himself with his thoughts and his attributes but he wanted to express them he wanted to have a people upon the Earth that he could make himself known to that he could have relationship with that he could share his heart's desires with and he could share the very deepest part of himself he would have a real love relationship with them and that's why he brooded over the face of the Waters amen hallelujah now brother Bram says and I'm just going to I trust this all goes together so in the identified Christ of all ages he says this in just as opening comments he says so this is before he reads the scripture he says I was thinking on the subject of what we're here for amen and then and then he then he goes and reads John chapter 10 and then he says you know I want to read uh you know an old familiar text Hebrews 138 but I was you know this really jumped out at me you know he was thinking on the subject of what we're here for and and some people remember we read in John 3 that which is born of flesh is flesh it's natural but that which is born of the spirit of spirit it's very different kind of thing and then so now he was thinking along why are we here this he's thinking on this subject and he's about to preach a service the identified Christ of all ages and he's going to declare that same God that was back there as here right in the building I mean that same God that declared himself back there is here to declare himself to you and he's actually saying now the reason you're here is that there's a deep calling and he put it deep in you and then he came from eternities and revealed himself to you that he'd make himself known and you to enter into a relationship Hallelujah this message is not Doctrine only it's not just a form of religion or it's not a church it's God declaring himself through his word amen that he would make himself known he's a personal God amen I trust that you you know you know him you know if cuz if you know him that which is born of spirit is spirit amen if you've been born of God you're of God it's really that simple hallelujah hallelujah amen I I just trust you this if you know him oh you have all the frustrations of life and the ups and the downs and all these ins and outs but if you know him and mean remember he had an intention when he brw it over the Earth he didn't just do it because he because he thought I wonder what happens in his mind as I want my children there and I want to make myself known to them and then and then I'm going to jump down a few thousand years into this day where gross Darkness covers the people but he says that arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you but he said Gross Darkness covers the people and I'll say you were born in that Darkness amen you were living in that darkness and you thought this was just how life was but then light began to shine he said let there be light and there was light amen and he opened your eyes I trust he has he's declared himself and he did that because he wants to know you not that you just have someone else's testimony I trust you have your own testimony I'm not this is not pie in the sky or whatever you want to some thing you cannot obtain Jesus comes to where you are remember that you don't have to climb to where he is he comes to you and it doesn't matter what depths of Despair or wherever you may be he comes to people like that he doesn't come to the people that are doing real well and they are you know overcoming all the time and no he doesn't come to just those people he comes to those who are wounded he comes to those who are broken he comes to those who are struggling Hallelujah he finds those people he finds the Wayward amen he comes down Adam and Eve were sure Wayward he was they had dominion over the Earth the very intention of God was that they would have dominion over the Earth and God would come down and speak to them and then they sure went Wayward but he came to them you Lord am mean he made himself real to them he came down they didn't know him as Redeemer said I'm going to show you what I what's really in me Hallelujah I'm going to I'm going to give you a blood sacrifice I'm going to cover your sin amen I'm going to give you a promise the first promise amen I'm going to send the seed of the woman and and he's going to UND do everything the serpent just did it wasn't your fault Eve was deceived amen you're deceived you you were born this way you couldn't help it Hallelujah you just might as well come to the recognition I couldn't help being born how I was born but that's just your first first birth don't don't lean on your first birth lean on the second amen lean on the second of God has become real to you amen hallelujah lean on that birth that which is flesh is flesh but that which is spirit is Spirit hallelujah what does that mean if you have been born that which of spirit is spirit so if you have been born of God hello that means you're part of him thank you Lord hallelujah amen so don't lean on your first birth amen God comes to the waywood he says a he says a bruised re you know you know just just a re that's just not even smoking he won't quench the flame I mean a bruise really won't break and sometimes we come to places in in our walk where we think the fire's going down and we think how are we ever going to come out of this condition hallelujah thank you Lord but he says he won't he won't extinguish what's there am mean that life he puts in you he won't take away he won't kill it doesn't matter how much the devil tries to Snuff it out amen he'll he'll blow again amen he'll blow in the ambers and Flame will come again and he'll put a life on you to bring you standing right up remember it's not him that falls it's not him that comes under a strain amen him that gets back up again hallelujah amen we can live in Victory friends we have the victory ask not one day and maybe I'll get there you have it you possess what you need maybe sometimes you just need to lay aside your thinking and how you do things and try things a bit different Hallelujah isn't that true amen so he says I was thinking on the subject of why we're here now God has placed us upon the Earth he that he would know us personally amen hallelujah amen that's why we're here friends oh that you know that that the god from the the Eternal one will come down to your level that he would take you up to his level amen that's the very purpose of redemption is to raise up amen redeem that which was lost hallelujah amen and that's why we're here now God made man in his own image in Genesis chapter 1 as a spirit man man and woman and so in that in that Spirit man was a wood was a woman hidden in that man amen and then he put that then they put that Spirit man in a body and then he took then he took now the woman out of the man I know this is very Elementary but I just want to maybe uh just look at a bit different now Adam was by himself and Adam you know God saw Adam and he says it's not good that man should dwell alone and he was actually what he said about Adam he was actually speaking about himself it's not good that I'm alone I don't want to be alone amen oh then what do you mean how can God the Supreme Being that fills all time and space and made all things and you know how can he be alone he was alone but he didn't want to be alone he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a husband he wanted to be he wanted to someone that he could someone who was made in His image that he could actually know and they could know him amen hallelujah amen so now Adam Adam was there and then Eve was taken out of Adam now I just want I I just I pray the Lord help me just now if I put this in words just right but when now Adam yeah no this is just me but when Adam came back to him you know CU he put a deep sleep on Adam he took the rib out you know he took the feminist Spirit out of Adam made a body out of the rib and then put the you know feminist part of Adam into this into this body now when Adam woke up he would have felt pretty different to when God put him and it wasn't because he was missing a rib you know ribs are the only bones that can actually regrow amen that's why you know you count them and they say oh but men don't have one less rib well it's actually because ribs can regrow amen but then he would have felt different because the feminist part of himself wasn't in him anymore and he would have had now a deep calling and the only deep he could find was the woman amen because remember God has a deep longing for you amen that's why that's why he makes himself known is because there's something in him he says there's parts of me and I know where they are and I've been broing over them and then there comes a time when you begin to recognize I'm not from this place amen I Come From Another Place amen amen because there's a deep calling to the Deep amen So Adam because now remember you can take how God deals with us and you just bring it down to the husband and wife and there should be because there's a deep calling to the Deep amen yeah there's a deep in Adam and the only thing that could satisfy that deep was Eve because remember the Deep calling to the Deep it's actually that one thing just separated into two calling one to the other that's right hallelujah amen that's amen that's why that's why there's a longing for God in hiss because it's that part of you that came from the eternities that's calling back to the Eternal one so now there was there was the there was a deep calling to the deep and that's how God now and then that's why that's why when when when Adam came he named all the animals but he never said to any of the animals who came out of me he never said to any of them you know even like the chimpanze you know the chimpanzee he named the chimpanzee he named the he named The Serpent amen you know and even even the you know um where do I have it here this is from the Scientific American I'm just going to you know um I know I repeated the you I said this last last week but I was want to bring it out again so the chimpanzee they have 99% the same DNA as us yeah and the gorillas have 98% well and and they say well it's the 2% that is different that gives us the ability to walk you know on on just two Limbs and go to Mars no no no it's not that it's it's the soul that's in you cuz a chimpanzee you can go back you know you go back to Roman times the chimpanzees were doing the same things then as they do today but man is doing very different things today they were doing that then the Romans never went to the moon they didn't have nuclear weapons they didn't have they didn't have Facebook they didn't have all these things you know they didn't have Hallelujah I mean they didn't have all these all this technology they didn't have the ability for a man to stand in one place and His Image and his voice be beamed over the globe they didn't have those things but a chimpanzee was doing the same thing as he does today he was doing back then because there's a Sol in man amen there's there's a soul animals don't have a soul and God put that soul in you that there there' be a deep calling amen that's why we're different it's not because we got 2% different DNA it's because God put a soul in you hallelujah amen and that's the real you you know what you really are is it's not your body it's not your spirit it's your soul that's you that's the bit that's redeemed your spirit's not redeemed your your body's not redeemed yet it's your soul amen and he put a he put a calling in there and then now there's a deep calling to the Deep And So Adam now when he when he sees Eve he says now this is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she has taken out of man therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen so he never said this to the serpent who was close enough like a man to mix with the man but he never said your bone of my bone he only said this to the woman and it's the same thing remember it wasn't Eve saying to Adam your bone of my bone I mean I'm I'm bone of your bone it was it was Adam saying your bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh so it was actually Adam declaring this is your part of me yeah and then now God comes down I'm just jumping from here just to now amen then then God comes and meets you whenever he met you in your life's journey and he begins to reveal himself to you and what is he actually saying he's saying your bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life of my life amen you're part of me you came out of me that's why he becomes real to you because he's telling you you came out of me hallelujah amen if that just sunk in a little bit down here I think the whole world would change I mean if you could just recognize that that you're part of him that's why there's a deep calling to the Deep Hallelujah amen now the spirit blows where listeth now Adam God breathed into Adam's nostrils it says the breath of life and he became a living Soul so he started brooding over the Earth but then the end of his end of his creation as he he breathed God breathed into Adam and he became a living soul and then now that was the first I mean so that was the first Adam coming into into being and then now the second Adam who is God himself is there and in and in John chapter 20 he breathed on them his disciples after he rose he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and then so now the first creation finished with the Breath of God into his children and then now the beginning of the new creation amen because remember we are a new if if if you've been born if you've been birthed really birthed by the spirit of God you're a new creation all things pass away I mean old things pass away and All Things become new remember you're you're not a patched up person you're not someone with a big spiritual Band-Aid put on you you're been C you've been created again amen you have been birthed again you got to recognize this because the devil he brings up your past he brings up your old nature he brings up how you used to do things and you really got to look him in the face and say that's not me that guy's dead I can show you where he died Hallelujah here's his Tombstone that guy is dead I don't know who you're talking about he doesn't live here anymore there's a new person in this house thank you Lord you say that's a bit bold no it's not it is what it is if if the Apostle Paul could say such things I'm sure we can just Echo what he said because that was God writing through the Apostle Paul this is what I've done this is what I've done to you and then now God when he declares himself in this age this lady and church age that the world is in he says the author he says the beginning of the creation of God declaring his deity and that beginning is actually means the author of the new creation amen so he says here's and he's declaring himself he didn't declare himself like this in former ages but he says now in this age I'm declaring myself as the author of the new creation that's distinct from the past creation amen I trust this means a little bit to you amen and see so so here's here's God now coming into this evening hour and saying now I'm going to I'm going to make a new creation and where does he start that new creation he starts it in his people amen his creative power you know has has been spoken upon the Earth and that's why it's so it's so important this this message we've received you know it wasn't just God saying well I'm going to show what it's like for cre to happen or I'm going to show what it's like the you know he was showing now the words that came out of that Prophet messenger's mouth when he stood there and he's hunting and and and the anointing comes upon him and God ask him what do you need well I'm hunting squirrels and he's in a you know he's in a place and and there was a what Sycamore Thicket or something where squirrels never go and he says well how many do you want God asked him how many do you want I said well I want five or whatever it was and then and he says well let there be one on this branch and it just it was there and he shot it he and he's just like he can hardly believe what's going on he says well let the next one go down here up down here down here down here like this you know through through places scrs never go and there's a just there it then he shot it amen and then now his wife has got a Tuma the size of a grapefruit in her side and then he's praying she's going to have the operation she's being PR for surgery and that same Spirit comes upon him and basically says ask what you will and it shall be and he says he says before the surgeon touches her May that tumor disappear he was I don't know how big grapefruits like this just disappeared and then and then the surgeon was shocked what happened that was creative power amen and then when he spoke the storm out of existence in Colorado and you know gave the fish its life back and all you you the different cases had he write Sons receiving receiving eternal life it wasn't the prophet that that that actually activated that you just think about this for a second remember the same God oh that was back then the same God is here and the same power and the same ability and the same strength and the same Redemption you know we sung the song I'm just going on a tangent for a while we we've sung the song you know you know there's power in jesus' name and we have seen that power demonstrated cuz Jes Jesus means Jehovah savior Jehovah's salvation we' have seen real salvation we' have seen real Redemption we have seen the transforming power of God hallelujah we've seen wounds be healed not just physical but spiritual wounds amen we' have seen things the devil tries to destroy families and those families are still there hallelujah amen that is the power of jesus' name it's not just you know we've had you know I was just thinking sitting back there our first Camp you had you know sister Bethany Reed come along and in her heart was well if this is real God you better show yourself otherwise I'm just going to throw this message away amen she comes and she's never been the same cuz she's in the presence of almighty God hallelujah hallelujah and we have more like that come amen where the power of jesus' name has been demonstrated not just talked about demonstrated Hallelujah and he's the same today and then so brother brandham standing there telling the stories of the squirrels being created and here's a little woman brother Bram doesn't know it's going to happen but she something quickens in her heart that's true amen because she recognized what he said over the pulpit and God came and backed it up then it would be the same out of the pull pit and she recognized that's nothing but the truth brother brandham and that caused God to come down that caused God to give the salvation of the two boys who weren't even interested in God at the time amen she caused that to happen it wasn't brother bam it was her amen oh that's just a nice story no that's showing he's the same I'm contending this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever but the devil will come and say no he's not oh no he's not oh no you'll never have things like that happen to you how do you know right do you think this you think Satan wants you to believe he wants you to be discouraged he doesn't want you to be encouraged he doesn't want you to be rejoicing he doesn't want you to have be full of faith and feel like you can just go down to H yourself and kick him in the face he doesn't want you to feel like that amen that's why that's why he discourages you amen don't listen to shake off the discouragement amen amen how do you do that Paul says whatsoever things are good is his oh you're not a Christian today is that good no don't think about it whatsoever things are lovely oh you'll never get to make it to Heaven is that lovely no kick it out amen whatsoever things are pure any things he says are not pure amen I know this is you oh he comes along this is what he does amen amen don't think it's strange don't think it's strange when he comes to you and bombards you and says you're never going to make it and you think you're a Believer and you think you're going to you know Jesus G you know he came to Jesus in the desert if thou be in other words do you really think you're him he didn't clown he didn't form he just quoted the word amen and he did that to show that you can take the same scriptures because all those things Jesus said are in the Bible amen you know man shall not live by bread alone that's in Deuteronomy amen and you know all all those are scriptures that he quoted so he just he just took the Bible but he is being the word so he didn't need to do that and he just opened you you know he didn't need to say I think it says this and he read it and says here devil it says this here amen and he did to show you can take the same word and say the same things and you'll get the same results what is the result and the devil left him hallelujah amen so now these things the creative power was demonstrated to show now remember I'm speaking he's the beginning of the creation of God so it wasn't brother Bram it was God coming down into a prophet speaking words and those words have creative power now it doesn't matter what other people have made of the message I just take what he says and believe it for what it is and then you'll get the results for what it was intended to do amen amen hey the Catholics have made Jesus and Mary and Joseph and all kinds of things they've made they've made most of what we love and adore into into into all kinds of things it doesn't mean we throw away Jesus Mary Joseph and whatever that's right it doesn't mean we throw the communion out doesn't mean we throw you know having church out because of what they made it amen and then if you just bring it way closer to home just because people quote the message and they quote different things and they it doesn't mean you throw it out amen you just got to believe it for what it is you know don't worry about what they say God what did you say because you have to have confidence if you've got the holy ghost that spirit will lead you and just because someone else says it it doesn't necessarily make it's wrong but if it's not real to you just keep walking and say well Lord if it's if it's you I'll just keep walking and and then and then when you want to show me you'll show me amen is this all right don't but but but don't pull the other way cuz there's two ditches on the side of the road and both are just as bad that's right and you don't want to start you know because people they find themselves in a ditch but then they think they're doing real well and then they put in sandbags then they concrete out and they dig the ditch a little bit deeper they make a trench then they have their weapons and they put gun imp placements that's what people do us for no more amen it's true this is what it is are you sure amen keep walking with God whatever you do just because someone else says something you know how does now I was thinking about this how how do complexes form okay sometimes okay complexes they all start with someone or something doing something to you that is bad or impacts you badly and then that turns into resentment yeah you resent that and you don't forgive them and that forms a complex you can see in brother bram's life when he said after the opening of the seals um you know he got a complex that he lost his love for the people how did that begin because they were rejecting what was being said and he began to resent it amen and he resented it he didn't forgive them amen and then he formed that complex amen and it all happened because he didn't it's perfectly human to resent something you just subconsciously sometimes you just do it but then now what do you do after that see if you do not forgive remember if you forgive someone it actually releases whatever's holding you back amen you it says in Hebrews do not let a root of bitterness grow into you well how does a root of bitterness come there's a resentment then there's some unforgiveness amen and then it forms into a complex what what what's happening now our root is starting to grow amen and it doesn't 100% of the time it doesn't affect the other person it affects the person that's got the root amen and then they start living life according to that root of bitterness or whatever complex is there look brother braham's whole life was now changed because of a complex I want to go be up in the Northern British Columbia I want to be a hunter like I've always wanted to be you know and then when God gives me a word I'll stomp out like an Old Testament Prophet say thus sayith the Lord and go back why all because the people were resenting what he said amen and it formed a complex Hallelujah and that's why but what happened he didn't forgive them Jesus on the cross father forgive them they don't know what they do and I think I've said it before Oh I have they planned it they actually it says in the Bible they actually had meetings how can we destroy him that's right they planned it they knew what they were doing we know th are a teacher come from God but we're going to crucify you amen but Jesus recognized like the words of the Apostle Paul if they really knew that he was the Prince of Life they would never have crucified him amen but he could say father forgive them they don't know what they do amen you're fine 100% the time it'll be a resentment that forms into a complex and if you're not careful then that just grows into a root of bitterness and it sayso not let a root of bitterness come into you because many are defiled because of it it amen so you have to have the ability from your heart oh they but but but brother Ben they have never asked for forgiveness it doesn't matter right amen Jesus wasn't hang there saying do you want to um ask for forgiveness he just said father forgive them I know it sounds ridiculous but that's what that's that's how we we're on a cross and see many times we are made fun of and we're ridiculed unjustly he had no right to be there they should have they should have lifted him up amen here's the king of glory they had to do it because we had to come in you understand oh what manner of love is this amen amen but you see we we sometimes there on a cross and and we think this is wrong you know you should ask me to forgive you you've done me wrong oh I'm not going to forgive you because you never asked for it it doesn't matter doesn't matter if they never come and acknowledge they're wrong it's you and God Amen and you can't help someone if you have resentment towards them how does how does brotherly love love between the Brethren go away the Devil comes in shoot someone with something and how does it normally start a misunderstanding and then oh then the rose tinted glass go on and they always do something wrong amen hello amen and and it but it always starts with a misunderstanding and it can be the most smallest thing right amen or what if it's a massive thing what if it's a life-changing thing you still have to forgive them it doesn't mean they're in the right but you have to be able to actually because that how do you let go of pain forgiveness how do you let go of hurts you forgive because when you forgive it releases it you're not actually holding it because the devil you know puts it down your throat wrote he says look at what they've done and look at what it's caused you and look at all the pain that may be true I'm not you know the the one who does the damage I'm not saying they're all squeaky clean but I'm talking about you yeah amen because remember Jesus said don't try and take the toothpick or whatever out of your brother's eye say Lord take the beam out of my eye and then when the beams out then you can help your brother amen and it's the same remember if something's in my eye my vision is clouded I can't see like I should and it's the same thing now if I have a complex in me I can't see or walk like I should amen and then well then how do I get rid of it you have to forgive you have to you know you actually from your heart forgive that person they didn't know what they do amen amen and so if you do that because it says here let's go to let's go to um Psalms chapter 1 he says this here remember the wind blow blows in amen maybe we yeah maybe I'll just say this the spirit of God Moves In in particular seasons yep and there will be a Revival Believers will come in and then sometimes the wind stops blowing there's a season where God gathers his children and it doesn't just happen one time but there's just a big move of the spirit through a community and people come in and then there comes a season where it doesn't seem to be happening again and then the wind will blow again remember there's Seasons where God does things and then so now you'd say well you could actually say the wind has blown here amen I'm talking about a spiritual wind we know the natural wind always blows but there's a there's a supernatural wind blowing through this place amen and now we're here but then now we want to we want to walk in such a way that we continue in the faith amen because I believe the wind's going to blow again Hallelujah that's my heart's desire it's not us for no more it's us for and everyone else will come it's it's I want to you know I want to go on a Rapture who wants to go on a Rapture we're here until the last one comes in oh that's on some foreign soil someplace who says it's not next door because the mission field is definitely to New Zealand amen am mean not just on the plane but this this country needs a lot more missionaries than Africa does amen amen then you look at Australia it needs a lot more than we do amen now blessed is the man now we're in sorry Psalms 1 and one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful well how do you you how do you find yourself in that place you resent something amen I just want to keep going down this road because you got to understand why do I you may have an ill feeling against someone why do I have that ill feeling because something they did in their Humanity you resented amen and they may just continue and walk on like nothing ever happened amen but then you're still sitting with the baggage you're still sitting with the bomb amen and now you're the one pinned down by this thing why is that because he says blessed is the man that doesn't sit in the seat of the scornful yeah so you're blessed if you do not sit in remember we're human now I'm just going to talk about just misunderstandings there's been a lot worse things happen among Believers than just a misunder understanding but we're human and iron sharpens iron amen amen so our Humanity God makes us in such a way and he makes polar opposite uh what do you call it personalities and he brings them into a fellowship hallelujah amen because there's got to be a a sharpening hallelujah amen and whether you like it or not you should say thank God Amen and you should never you should never say well is that person bright or is this person what are they that's up to God don't waste these top two inches with thinking about as this person in or this person in don't worry about them worry about your own household worry about yourself first amen that is that is the most important thing amen and then worry about them but pray for them don't say well are they in or they out look at them I don't know just pray for them amen because they may be living under a facade amen they may appear one thing but be another thing deep down but deep down they want to be the real deal amen but by but by res you know but by saying are they in and out just say well I don't know it doesn't matter really amen Jesus even called Judas friend yeah he called Judas this was a son of predition Amen brother Braham speaks about there Adam and there was the serpent in the garden he said there are the two trees I mean sorry there was Christ and you know and and and the devil and then then then came down all the way down through the two grew all the way down through then there's Jesus who was God's Masterpiece the second Adam and then there was Judas which was the devil's Masterpiece amen you can see it all the way down you know all there's a True Vine false Vine all the way down through and Jesus knew that Judas was going to betray him he says he you know he called him friend Jesus didn't say one thing and think another thing amen he genuinely considered him a friend but he knew that he was going to betray him and he knew he was going to his going to go to his place and Jesus knew I came from God and I go back to God Amen and but Jesus treated because remember Jesus you know they're sitting there at the Last Supper that means they had suppers before that and then he says one of you is going to betray me and then they're all shocked who is it Lord they didn't know why is that okay I think part of it is because Jesus treated them all the same and apparently I think brother Billy Paul said this I might be wrong he said brother bradam treated his enemies and his friends the same way you couldn't tell who is his enemy and who is his friend by how he spoke about people hallelujah amen so if if if that was the second Adam if that was our example Jesus Christ calling judah's friend and then he took a redeemed son and that was how a redeemed son that came to his position treated everyone how much should we follow that example amen how much should we follow that example and so we should follow that example that it doesn't matter where those people end up we should treat them the same way with the same love and respect and concern amen because what if we resent that person then the next thing you know you begin to talk badly to other people about that person and this is what the devil wants to do it's just you know you you know the prophet says it comes in so easily amen and then you talk badly to these people and then they talk to that person then this person talks and the next thing you know everyone sitting in the same building singing the same songs listening to the same word but they don't trust each other yeah I mean they won't have nothing to do with the other person but there's meant to be a unity and love between the Brethren amen and this is important because if there's disunity then God can't have his way am amen and God can't do what he wants to do amen we want God to have his way Hallelujah that's why it says you know doesn't sit in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord which is his word we know and in his law doth he meditate day and night that's why Paul said whatsoever things are good pure lovely think on those things are true you know you and he shall be like a tree amen planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatever he doeth shall prosper so this is what a person's like who does not stand in the way of Sinners pardon me or sth in the seat of the scornful they'll be planted by the one River of many Waters speaking of the Waters of the spirit now amen and his Leaf won he'll bear his fruit in his season amen and the Lord shall prosper I mean his Le and what whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now we are living in a season where there's a people who are exactly like this amen because you see some people and you come in their presence and you spend time with them you feel so refreshed Fred why is that because you've come under their shade tree amen you've come under their shade and you're taking a rest Amen brother B speaks of the restoration of the Bride tree and he and he takes this scripture amen he says he says there's there's real Fellowship I mean you're not all worn out and stressed because you've been with them but you feel relaxed amen but then you can talk to the same I mean another person and they may believe exactly the the same thing they may say exactly the same thing and do the same kind of thing but you don't feel that refreshment why is that maybe the other one's a bit withered up amen and the other one's not so we don't want to come and but I say if you're all withered up you don't have to stay withered up amen you don't how do I get unwithered get off the seat of the scornful amen don't stand in the way of sin just if they don't accept it just let them go on Amen but but get off that seat and then you'll see then you'll see the leaves start to come back again amen hallelujah then the fruit will come in its season now what's time okay so now this is what we call and so when the spirit when the wind moves this is what it produces amen and brother Braham also says it's like a tree when when the wind comes in and really shakes the tree then the then the roots can get a bit deeper into the Earth and it can grip down into the soil deeper he the same thing with the believer when the Winds of persecution come and hardship comes and Trials come they blow in it may shake the tree but it just causes your roots to go down deeper onto the Rock of Ages hallelujah amen but the secret is when the hardship come you know it's always people you love the most hurt you the the most amen so it's people that you even may look up to yeah I'm you I'm just talking family hurts you the most but people in church that you respect and look up to the most they will hurt you the most amen and it's normally hardship hardship when hardship comes from that way that's when it shakes a tree the most yeah amen I just want you to think about these things because we don't want to sit in the seat of the scornful amen we don't want to be bowed down by hardship and all these things we don't want to hold bitterness against our you know against our fellow believer we don't want to hold resentment and we don't want to because normally if people justify their actions and they do things bad it's because there's a root of bitterness or something in them that they need to just actually forgive someone and just let it go because remember if it's in there it'll affect everyone badly not just the person who caused it to happen amen amen so now the wind blows and God God has come down in this evening hour in such a way that he wants us to be trees planted by the river of waters amen he said he's called he called it the restoration of the Bride tree and he speaks you know he speaks about how that tree that fruit tree that he planted there you know in the book of Acts was chewed down into a little stump you know and then and then after the Dark Ages you know it begins to grow again and he says now in this end time it's growing back into its fullness you should go listen to the sermon and then he speaks about ezekiel's dry bones and he says about how how how the you know the bones came back together there's like four stages of the restoration of that great Army and the last one is that when when when God says to Ezekiel son of man prophesy and he prophesied then the wind be to blow amen and life went into them and they stood up as a great Army and he says I wish I had time he says prophesy son of man and so he's actually his I trust there himself in that position amen when the last stage of the restoration is when the son of man prophesies and the wind blows and life goes into them and they stand up like a mighty Army Hallelujah and here we are you've come under the sound of that Ministry amen you've come under the sound of you know the the transforming creative power of God because there Creation in his word I trust this is not over your heads amen because you say well how's your creative power go back to your life before you heard it and then bring your life to where you are and you can see the things you used to do there's nothing in you that wants them and the thoughts you used to think you don't think them anymore and the nature you even had then you don't have now why you've been created over again Hallelujah all because you've heard a a voice amen and you haven't resisted The Voice you say yes Lord mold me and shape me I give my life to The Potter's hands amen and then so he says so now the wind blow this is so the wind is blowing amen and the and the purpose maybe I'll just kind of try and wind it up but the purpose of him speaking this word over the Earth is to bring you forth amen so the wind is blown you don't know where it came from exactly it came from heaven but then it then it blows through and then everyone who is born of the spirit is the same likewise amen where a Revival comes God has blown friends amen he has he has come amen not just I'm not just talking about here it's all over the earth I mean brother Tim DoD said when they had a Revival there in the universities and things they had 150 Souls come in from without and within they had a Revival but now he says it's over but but you know those things have happened before there in the past amen and then so God blows and then he cses people to come in and then he establishes them in the present truth I trust you can say that's been me amen and then the wind blows and then that happens and then now we're waiting that the wind is going to blow again amen and it's part of our expectation amen it's part of our expectation you know he says in this sermon that I quoted from in the very beginning um Christ identified in all ages he says this he says there's something in US reaches out for something that we know we come from somewhere amen so before you meet the Lord there's something in you just reaching out but then you meet him he becomes a living reality he's more real than me standing hereen amen he is a person and you must meet that person it's not mentally agreeing with some Doctrine you got to meet him exactly amen and he and he's present amen and there something something in us that just reaches out and I remember before I met God I I wasn't satisfied with the part culture I wasn't satisfied with University life I wasn't satisfied with with movies or music or sport there's just something in me that just wasn't satisfied cuz something was reaching out Hallelujah but then I heard this word hallelujah and then he became real I had to give myself to it but he became real and then when he became real something still reaches out amen but it's not for where are you it's Lord I want to I want more of you Hallelujah I trust that's your you know don't let the devil just think this is how life is and this is how church should be and now we're all got comfortable and that is not don't listen to that lie amen God is a god of Supernatural and he can do more than we can even imagine Hallelujah but what we need to do is just let ourselves go don't try and hold yourself back you know sometimes we well I need to be uh you know respectable and I need to behave and you know just let yourself go amen are with me amen because sometimes we actually you have to yield yourself and then whatever he wants to do just let him do it oh that can be out of order if God's doing it it's never out of order Hallelujah and so to me now there's something in me I'm not satisfied with the services we have and I trust you to say Amen hey they're wonderful but I'm not satisfied if IED with with with this amen and it's not that we need to find something greater we have the word we have the we have Jesus Christ he's found us he's gathered us but I want to see more than just words come out of her mouth and songs that are sung I want to see God live in a greater way I'm not saying he's not living we need to find him we he found us amen but but I want more I want the wind to blow again amen that we don't just you know I was so moved I you know I listen to the sermon restoration of the brid tree and then they have a I think they have a prayer line or there's discernment and God just comes down and then you just hear all the people screaming and shouting and rejoicing and I was so moved I I was crying I said Lord we've had times like that I said Lord that's what I I want to see I don't just want services and we sing three songs pray and go home I want to see you do what you want to do Hallelujah you know those people they just got next to themselves and just worshiped how they wanted to worship and it wasn't just a bunch of noise God did things and that's what I want to see Hallelujah the wind blo where list as friends I'm not going to be too long today but here we are amen this is where we are God's blown through amen but now we don't just want to be satisfied with this this is you know we are still growing into what we should be but we don't want to come and just cabbage down and become a little bit formal and say you know oh this is neat and just have some nice singing and some you know we don't just want that also oh I want to hear something new I mean we don't just want to have itching ears I want to hear some different kind of preaching but it should be God I want to see you live doesn't do that anymore that's a lie the Devil Comes long oh you don't have meetings like that anymore he's not the same you can't have church like that anymore and he says it's because someone else it's because brother Santo is there you can't have church like that that's a lie amen amen amen our God is tremendous our God is Awesome our God is alive hallelujah amen he is real he's risen from the dead amen and he wants to I'm not trying to excite you this is just my expectation amen that God would do oh we need to have Camp again for God to move no no we don't we have church we have Camp Hallelujah every service is Camp it's just a you know we just need to get out of this mindset we need to go somewhere else to have a wonderful kind of time hallelujah amen doesn't you know it doesn't matter what church we go to the Living God is still present amen you don't have to go to a special there's no special Church you know that's in one location God's special churches all over the Earth people know the same God and they're under expectation to see him move I'm not afraid people say well we shouldn't go after people shouting and jumping oh that's just emotion no it's not just all emotion amen emotion comes with it but as the spirit of God comes down causes the emotion that's right amen oh I need to hold it all together the scripture says then that come with your Brokenness and weeping then they come they then they bring forth precious sheaths and and rejoicing amen hallelujah amen that's what it says in the scriptures it's not just well yes who would like to accept the Lord you put up your hand now you're a Believer we shake your hand everything's fine and then okay now now recite the message Creed I believe brother Bram is Malachi 4 and I believe the word is restored and I believe that we have the truth of the Bible and the seals are open amen that's what people have turned this message into amen that is not our portion no way amen amen that's what people have turned it into friends I'm not criticizing on but that's what the devil wants to come in and say just agree no no no you don't just mentally agree you meet God Amen and he transforms your life amen or what should I what should I do just open yourself amen you just got to open yourself and yield because he doesn't Force anything upon you he doesn't try and force you through a pipe and bring you out as a Believer you have to say yes Lord amen and don't let you I sing your facades you know you look at you look at Hollywood it's a facade abolutely amen it's absolute facade you see a movie they just have a camera shot and they want you to see a particular thing you don't see the rest of the stage and the rest of everything else it's like Hollywood Boulevard that's a dump but they just have a camera shot oh isn't this so neat they get their star or whatever they do you know in the concrete isn't this wonderful it's just a a dump of a street but it's a facade and you see people you see you know this whole world you know through the music through the movies they they project this is what life really is but then when you come to then you say well what is the reality of those actors and musicians Lives why do they die young why do they die of drug overdoses why do they go from one broken relationship to another broken relationship because that is the reality of what is being produced by the spirit that's upon them amen oh you say this has happened in the message I can't you know that doesn't mean this message doesn't produce real families am it doesn't produce real peace Joy love longsuffering goodness gentleness Faith amen but you look at the facade of Hollywood amen it's a facade amen amen there's nothing real there but people are so captivated by what the devil wants you to see amen and then he just brings that into the church and says now look at this person look at what they do wrong oh this is really how church should be and then most of the time it's just a facade cuz he doesn't he knows if you really step into the presence of God and really make contact with him then he's defeated remember the lifeline the lifeline is not just knowing quotes the lifeline is knowing him and the lifeline is where your strength comes from is the Lifeline where that is a stepping into the presence of God Amen brother Braham said about uh David's Mighty Men you know the story you know The Well of Bethlehem it's all garrisoned by Philistines and then David's there he says I just wish I could drink that cool water from The Well of Bethlehem they did when he was young and his three Mighty Men they they they they they picked up a bucket they took their weapons it was just like this it was the smallest desire it wasn't even a commandment but they took it as a commandment from David because they loved them so and they cut their way through however many miles of Philistines to get the water and bring it back and he says oh Church of the Living God Amen let's draw our swords amen let's cut through what the enemy is trying to do to us am mean that we can give our our lord Jesus a real cold glass of drink of refreshing worship amen that you have to take your sword amen and cut through formalism cut through what everyone else is doing what people will think of you in the doubts of the devil cut through those things that you can give God real worship amen real Joy real love real appreciation for what he's done sir amen that's what we're called to do friends and the wind's blowing am mean what are you going to do this is our season this is our season don't just sit back you know the Devil comes along well you've never had it before you'll never have it now who says amen that's what he says oh you've never overcome you're never going to overcome now who says devil you got to doubt your doubts doubt yourself amen I said you you I said at the Youth Camp I didn't even get to it when I preached after the Youth Camp I said Jacob means supplanter brother Braham called him a Shyer but he denied himself he put on Esau's clothes and put on the skins and everything he denied who he really was and says I have the right to the birthright Hallelujah he denied himself I'm not Jacob I'm Esau amen so you may be a rascal amen you may be the wor Christian there ever has been you may have a terrible past deny yourself am amen cuz that'll just bog you down Jesus doesn't look at your past he looks at what he's done for you it's not conditional it's not based on what you've done or what you've thought or where you've been or what you've wanted to do in your flesh it's not based on those things you just have to deny yourself and say I have a right Hallelujah I have a right amen because I'm not that person I really was I am the firstborn Hallelujah and he got the birthright amen you have to do the same thing I have no right the other devil says you have no right and you may say sure me a person I have no right but I don't come in my own nobility I come in the blood of the Lamb I I come because Jesus paved the way for me to come and that's why I'm here hallelujah and we have a right friends don't let the devil hold you down amen amen he is God is here God is present amen he's the high priest of our profession and so you don't confess I'm down I'm out I'm never going to make it you say Lord I'm full of joy and Glory I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb you have opened the way for me to go your very presence of the holy of holies I'm without spot or wrinkle amen because he he remember he works he only works on your behalf when you confess his word cuz he's the high priest of our profession amen so if you say Lord help me I can't do it he doesn't work on that it's good if you're a broken but you should come in a broken and say Lord you redeem me I'm your child you have saved me I may have fallen but Lord I'm wrong pick me up and try me again one more time L and he'll do it amen hallelujah he will do it amen trust me he's done it hallelujah amen glory amen that's all you have to do Hallelujah the wind's blowing can we have some musicians amen God's here and it's not if someone if you want prayer that's wonderful but it's not if someone prays for you it's when you talk it over with God yourself amen it's when you get real and when you talk to God Amen that is that is the important thing the spirit blood were list why did he do it because he wanted to find you and now he's found you hallelujah amen our God is tremendous amen let's just sing um let's just sing you chose me amen why did why did he why has he come to you because he chose you before the foundation of the world and he wants you now to respond
