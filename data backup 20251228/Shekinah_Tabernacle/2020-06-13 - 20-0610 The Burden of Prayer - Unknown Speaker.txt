I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place amen verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil

this twelve how many loves this term listen to eat the steady and ye shall seek me ye shall seek me and find me Amen when I shall search for me with all your heart hallelujah blessed be his holy name a the Lord bless the reading of the wait we may have our seats amen amen hallelujah and thank you thank you for the band for giving me the opportunity to stand here I didn't ask the pasta to give me a podium to preach he asked me to preach so so I couldn't refuse because Who am I to say to God no how can I say to my lover my husband my Redeemer my Savior who speaks through the mouth of his seventh that you you go and preach you say oh no dear preacher go and preach Who am I to say no I'd rather pray and be dedicated to the Lord and the Lord take out only one weight that will save or help one person that is enough in the kingdom of God hallelujah and I want to tell you that I love all of you and I appreciate you and because the Lord Jesus loves you also amen I'm just trying to get my grounds and today I'm not going to - try not to you cannot really control yourself but I'm just going to try to talk you know just we talk easily and then thank you my sister for the Soul I loved her song and it's like she knew that I would love that song I loved it very much it it does something to me the reason I love you is not because what there isn't I love you now it's not because I can stand here and bridge or you gave me your things or you helped me or anything no it's simply because God loves you and I am part of that love of God you know God brought me among you to be with you to call you my brothers and sisters that's the reason I love you I love you because God brought me in this assembly and the preaching from this pulpit changed my life amen that's why I love you when you love people normally you kindly and explain why you love them you just loved you loved them I mean let's just start there tonight I want to speak about as we read I want to put more emphasis on that verse 12 and verse 18 when he says they shall then then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will Hyken unto you sorry sure I was just eating some mint just to make sure that my bread is right and you shall seek me and find me and when he shall search for me with all your heart I mean so tonight I want us to speak about the baton of prayer and the baton of Prayer I mean a friend of mine in South Africa send me a clip of where he was preaching a message he was he was said he was talking about prayer and I said to me they Lord put a thought in my heart along those lines about prayer so tonight I want us to speak about the burden of prayer Oh the burden of praying now the burden of Prayer seeking the Lord through prayer amen and maybe we can maybe we can take a context that says why there is no bad enough prayer why the reason why there's no burden of Prayer what is the reason we need to explore this that's all I want us just to talk and I'm talking to the young people also anyone who is below who is 99 and below amen praise the Lord hallelujah yes we read our scripture let's read Luke 16 as well I mean then we can just just get settled and just be relaxed let's look 16 16 16 let's read Luke 16:16 as well hallelujah you know sometimes you prepare and you sit there you say when I introduce I'm going to say this what are the James and I what I say this then you come here everything is where you can't remember what you wanted to say and I wanted to save some good ways but I can't remember what I wanted to say but that's why we pray that the Lord is the one who's guiding us that is why we must dedicate ourselves well standing on the podium on the pulpit on the altar to talk to the bride of God God and His angels present you don't just talk as you please you must be led by the Spirit of God amen so I thank God for for taking care otherwise many of us will be in trouble for fling before God you know so may God help us let it look 16 that's 16 amen the law and the prophets were until John since the time the kingdom of God is preached and every man perfect into it hallelujah this is about passing this is about pressing and you know we'll read later on some other scripture and Matthew but the two scriptures the Prophet read about them you know when he preached a message in desperation amen and we will look into it later on but just to put your context and look at this this system of burden of Prayer you know the Lord taught us the Lord's Prayer in the Bible right and the Lord taught us how to pray and when you menu of our sins we grew up you know we've been praying every night they taught us how to pray you know we know about training you know we do pray right am i right and then the problem is oh let me not say the problem not the problem the challenge is many times we pray and we pray amiss many times we pray and we don't really mean what we say many times we pray and there's nothing really that is bothering you or that is really a desire dedicated sincere to God you know have you ever say have you ever heard someone say like I love you alone no you can hear that this person don't mean what disease or many times you hear statement that says I don't mean what you say why because they can detect that you are saying it but you don't don't say from your heart there's nothing substantial that you are saying you're just seeing it so I want to talk about having the burden of prayer for God having a burden of prayer to serve God what is the importance of prayer the importance of prayer I want to quote from brother branham's message expectation he says and now I thank each one of you for a few moments ago when you were singing for I am for you I am praying that what does what I want you to do it is prayer I depend on now it is prayer I depend on that's the secret of all the ministries of God prayer that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that is the key that opens the door for every film of God is prayer that's what the prophets is not me sorry I need to make a PowerPoint today but anyone who 1k I can share with you then you can read or Garrido spoken with and enjoy but that's what he's saying he says is key play is what keeps me moving player is what what takes me in this situation question and answers 1954 Oh 103 I'll rather have a church has such a burden of only a heart for prayer then they just state at this altar and it will be here day and night and everything else and in their house was constant in prayer and humble and trying to get the people to God and make and making calls at hospitals and visiting and they seek and trying to get people to come to church to write I rather have then that's all the other put together I would rather have that than all the other put together that's what the Prophet says all those two ladies mentioning he says I rather have a dedicated church that has a bed and on their heart for prayer that's what the Prophet sees amen so we come to realize that prayer is so important that prayer changes things in our life we realize that prayer has an effect on your relationship with God it improves your relationship we were praying amen you you see the devil what he likes to do let me tell you about this guy but the best that I must kick him tonight we want to tell him that we are not afraid of him hey man by grace by the power of the Living God who must not be afraid of the devil that's what he wants to do you see it's a sneaker that's why I read that I love that message of in the greatest battle ever fought I can beat that message yeah through Pat one of general impact to until Pat well because you see that's where the whole thing started God allowed it let me not go there but the point I want to show you about the devil is that he brings things in our lives and when we accept them you see then and he puts a condition or he puts a complex in our lives to tell our thinking around so and then we blame ourselves huh that's what he does he turn around and then you blame yourself you blame your brother you don't see any nothing good in yourself meanwhile is actually him who started back that is the devil that's what he does he would make sure that he and you know one we need to be aware of how the devil operates Daniel and the only thing that can make us aware of the devil is the Word of God the only thing that can make us aware of the teeth of the devil is when we take time to be with Jesus is when we take time in prayer to be with Jesus sister Belinda - what is what is going to help us transpose him because we will understand how he works will he will be exposed because stand in the presence of a inspired prayer the devil amen now prayer changes death to life keeps the world out of you player player take the world away from you the things of the world of the devil player removes you remove them away from you it chops them you know when you chop I like chopping those carols you know peeling them off you know that's what player does to you remove the well the dead teenis the stars anything bad belongs to the devil player removes it brother man can I take this okay thank you so now I also wrote the other player it improves your relationship with God that's what prayer does how many believe that you can think about even though I'm I don't want to run ahead of myself you can think about improving this relationship think about a situation where you and your partner you and your wife or your or you or your spouse or you and your brother or you or your sister you and your teen brother for those who are teens you and your twin sister you and a person that you love so much the person who means a lot to you think about a situation whereby you love that person so much but actually you don't engage with that person you don't talk you don't express you don't you don't have a bonding what happens with that relationship what will happen to that relationship you know I always play with my daughter and I play with the boy's mother she's only don't I have so girls are playing wrestling she's get him to be more stronger than me know now but the key it's not just about pushing and showing here that I can push is the bonding you know is the talking is that is they're getting into one another you see that's what improves the relationship and that's what we need to do with our gods that is when we talk to him why don't we tell him how great he is when we turned him how wonderful when we thank him when we make him gods there's no reason why he became God he was not God before there is a reason because he wanted fellowship he wanted to cure he wanted to you he wanted to protect and those things he does them to us am i right so that is why it is so important for us to pray him himself the Lord Jesus the Bible says he was a prayerful man powerful men so now the Lord Jesus Christ him the creator of the heavens and earth in flesh he was praying so much I don't know any of you in here who has passed at ever for 40 days and 40 nights I don't know and I don't want to ask that question what I'm saying is he will do such things and a pray God who said why need to be relationship but they need to be the bonding they need to be a finding of one another through prayer am i right sooner we find that brother branham himself as a powerful man a man who was born a prophet we found that John Wesley the Bible says was praying how many times a day how many times or was it his mother may I'm talking about his mother she was playing so much and yet he had 17 children you can imagine the washing you can imagine the cooking daily you and there's no washing machine that time there was no dryer there was nothing of technology but she was praying more than me in you today why why is the bedroom of prayer deteriorating what is the reason why our prayer life is going away obviously we know is the cause of the devil was supposed to do and is not supposed to be is supposed to be the other way around because he is the defeated man even from the beginning is defeated Amon we are the ones to fulfill that was the lord of safe but greater things shall you do amen now I quoted from this program right here hey that was once delivered to us 1955 amen and that's why he wants to get you alone to himself your prayers not so much as well you are or may be coming you know for instance be well out in the public when you are praying like in church or around the altar well not that but get alone you'll pray a different prayer when you are by yourself then you do when you are in public slip alone all of you go out and just have a real secret meeting place where you and the Lord meet several times a day and pray this is powerful brother isaacman he says pray in public pray in church praying here with the Orioles which is wonderful I like it reading there when we get a praying in the family as we gather around is good assume it's necessary it's needed right where you pray alone ah you you create different players whether you get in it and don't tell no one he says the Prophet is this someone he says you need to get your secret place where you and God alone where you pour your hearts that is the key somebody must be asking you but I pray and I do that but I get to a point way and I don't know what to say you see you see that is exactly the point why you must be alone because it's not like there is nothing to say there is something to say but the Lord must pray through you you and the Lord must be in the fellowship I'm a man the Spirit of God will come down and you talk to God you and God and talking and you are listening to even and you find yourself crying and touching God things that you never planned why because that's the necessity for prayer that is the whole idea why praying alone in your secret place is so important amen okay I've read that for you but I wrote that there are things there for brothers and sisters that goes together with prayer there are things but when you think of prayer you can't help but you think of them amen Bethan one of them is better amen I'm trying to think of a meaningful prayer when you are alone and you work ie and you are talking to God but yet there's nothing in your heart can you think of that I cannot think of a situation you have a Bedan in your heart to express it to God but some sometimes we say to the Lord I've got such a bed in Lord but you know God knows whether you have a bed in or not God knows you cannot me and you can tell God what we have in what you don't have but yet we need to pray and confess things to him because our ways are powerful our ways come to pass amen but the key is this when I say a lot of what Abedin and I don't have it he says all my child which one are you talking about ah the Baron is him Koopas it day so me and you if we feelin a bit better and to pray we must pray the Lord for the better so that the Lord can give us a ballon for pray so that we can pray him within a Bedan does anybody get me I felt like I intended myself there but we need to pray in such because the Bible says we must ask anything in his name and believe anything he'll give you to us so what does anything mean sister sister she no sorry a lot like maybe I'm gonna be a teacher one day but I like interacting you know I like it I like what what is what is what do you I want to say um if you can ask anything thank you he says if you ask anything in my name I'll give it to you so what is anything sometimes the devil shows that you know he covers that up so that you must not unpack this anything to think of anything as maybe the money or the clothes or anything you must open up your hearts so that God can come in and express those things brother end us please and I said the devil likes to hide things in our hearts or somewhere in our lives because he knows that God is so powerful that if anything comes to his light it cannot stand so he hide things only him can know he used them when that rare item comes for him because he's an opportunist you see so when the right time comes he pulls that cut and say hey you know that you stole yeah you now you say you're a believer he's our accuser so ordinarily he wouldn't when you are in a good state you wouldn't remind you because you know that you say my brother please forgive me I I kicked you out your car when I passed the I'm so sorry you won't remind you that if you are in a good state you undermined you because you know you'll expose it confess it your brother forgives you then you move on in victory knows that but he keeps things to use them in the future he works with your files when is the right time he pulls them so you must not allow the devil you must even actually ask God to bring those things to remembrance and pray for God to bring them I like the Prophet you know one day they gave up and they wanted to expose him they won't have to prove him to be a false prophets Allah Allah he said no praise the Lord I love to be exposed I want them to spose me if those guys to do anything that I've done wrong before go to expose me praised be the name of the Lord that's what I want amen but you see it wasn't a prophet of what he knew there's nothing that they're going to expose they were only going to expose themselves amen I don't want to deviate better than is what I was talking about me and you must have a bed if we don't have a bed and then you must escort for a bed think about doing without your substance think about doing something without them without a heaviness of heart will you really be persistent will you be will you be will you follow that up you'll probably even forget the next day or the next month that you ask hurt and when God gives you the Lord is so wonderful but you were praying for that right God needs to put a Bedan in our hearts so that when we pray we pray with a meaningful with a really inspired heart with a crying heart that is bedand you'll hear the Prophet now another thing is sincerity these things you that you cannot cut them away from prayer to be sincere just like a you saw to be sincere when you pray you you ask God how can I explain sincerity those who are born English must help me you know when when he was in Syria it means that you are so you're so open yes so many what you're saying you are so dedicated so real when you say lord please I'm asking for genuine right in requesting the Lord that sincerity to put all your heart in what you you mean what you see before the Lord one day I meant what I say before the Lord and it might not be a nice example but one day I found myself meaning what I meant before when I meant it I really meant it reminds me of when the Prophet said when he was in that vision and and and that boy shot him and then he went to hell you know he was going down it reminds me when the Prophet said O Lord if you save me here I'm going to be a good boy he meant because it was between life and death the prayer that I'm talking about tonight is the prayer of life and death you will hear just now Amen my own little testimony one day I was swimming in a swimming pool us with my wife and we are singing Lenny how to see Amy Amy Amy Amy and you know what it was along woman maybe from there to the end and we're swimming and then I made to be I wanted to be a pro and I you know you would see me in there and rest on door swim back and rest swim there and rest so I went I went I never rested I went and I went without RISD when I was in the middle of the pool man I got tired suddenly I was just losing energy I and the pool was was deep it was it was deeper than than my height and I realized that now in the middle of the pool the devil come in aha you can't seem you know that day and I look on the side of the pool is fine it was a big I look on the left is far I check where I was going is far I checked behind me is far I think my wife can assume also that time I'm going I'm going down that time and I try every other thing that I read about see me you know I went under the water I said they say if you go under the water you do this when you come out you then I did that everything happens so fast when I bring my head I found that hours on the same sport the water that time is coming in my mouth I'm panicking now when I said to my wife help she thinks I'm talking and she was the tell you listen I used to joke and say help meanwhile she's just floating somehow I thought I'm playing the same chick she didn't help she that time then the heart starts to beat I knew that if no one can help me here I'm date because I already following daughter and I'm trying so hard so what is he lies that I'm not playing remember she can see myself so hot mosquito we will drown both of us so I was in the water at that moment at that moment the Lord gave me a thought to speak to you you see God is gracious and I said to the Lord Lord I promise you I promise the Lord things you will promise the more things when is about your life when you are about to die there's more life you will tell the Lord things that you are sincere you will tell the Lord that Lord yes that date was me who did them you you'll promise the Lord that you're going to do things you attend and what you are going to tell the Lord you're not going to be joking you will be meaning for real in otherwise you'll be sincere and I promise the Lord as soon as I've finished for missing the Lord my wife gorgeous a long brush you know these brushes that we used to clean the pool with along it was there all the time she just took it and came oh sorry she threw me that little chip like this chair you know and she threw it to me then that ship came an adjusted here where I can reach it that time you call the name of the Lord sincerely the point I'm trying to show you brother and sister is that there is times when we pray and we are not sincere we don't mean what we are really saying to the Lord amen and that can happen but when you get to a time where you are alone when you make that time when you are sincerely in your private place when you talk to God pray to show that you're praying you are between life as if you are between life and death that's the kind of attitude in prayer another way oh by the way I eventually grab that that chip I put it here on my neck and I was floating and I was so thankful I so much appreciated oxygen very much with all my heart I appreciated to breathe I to breathe to breathe fresh air that day amen so that's what happened so we don't want to get in dust inside situations in order for us the Prophet says many times we get disparate and I'm just jumping ahead of myself we get disparate because of the Emergencies around us because of the situations in our lives and we get disparate but in essence it's not supposed to be like that we are not supposed to be push them to a point where now we are desperate we are supposed to be desperate every time we come to God I'm alive I supposed to show that hey we are at war we are here fighting between death life yes yes given us the victory yes is guaranteed but the war it's not over it's not when they tell you that you are the winner you want don't worry you won does that mean that you're not supposed to run anymore no you are still going to run many times who used to know sorry to give this bad example but many times we used to know that our Brazil will win the soccer yeah soccer welcome we used to know that I mean it was hopeless some of us - why cause you know Brazil is going to beat everyone even them like they noon although it was not a foregone conclusion but they had to play and play with dedication because if they can't even they are the champions 10 for 10 15 times champions they can lose after sports people they will tell you Josh and them will tell you today even if you are the champion you must've practiced be dedicated day and night because in this case of sports your winning is not guaranteed but with us is guaranteed but the devil must be kicked so that the word can be fulfilled them but he was defeated otherwise you will be defeated persistent is another way to persistent a prayer without persistent you can think of a hips and hips a sister Shannon let's do it hips you know you can think of heaps of examples in the Bible about people who were persistent people who were persistent with God Jacob among them they were persistent with God they did not let it go that is not they were persistent and that is what goes with the meaningful sincere committed prayer another word is I'm just telling you the things that I believe are very important and you cannot think of prayer without them crying you know the kind I'm talking about mothers and sisters it's not the crying of just mama ring it's not the crime of complaining system.i it's not the complaining MooMoo of say army Lord me wonder Buster brother Benoit see on Sunday spoiled your singing hanging you know that's not the type of crying God does not want a mom arena that's why he said to Moses why cry because what cry for Moses was not the one that he was supposed to cry it was supposed to be a war cry it was supposed to be a car that says the sea open and he's crying the Stephen open was supposed to be the crime not the people and a being under pressure no no no no that's not the cry that I'm talking about the credit I'm not talking about is the one of cry it won't cry when the angels are crying in heaven day and night the Bible says they say holy holy holy unto the Lord crying before God because they know he's victorious I'm not talking about the cry where you says our Lord why me Lord why me no no that's not the crime I'm talking about why you who must be if not who you who who must be because they are not has got confidence in you that you will overcome that message brother so much and and by the way this someone you know couldn't come at a better time because in the past Wednesdays and Sundays men man I was enjoying myself it's like the rollers just preparing me with those someone's you know brother nd spoke about laughs and he's not finished and you'll hear now what the Lord was it and brother as I suppose about that one of the DNA you know that that just shake me you will I love exploring the science of God I love exploring how God was and I'll add I like taking these physical things and showing them on the spiritual things you know so so that crying to a point where you move God crying to a point where by not not complaining you know that there's two types of crying crying owner this many times okay there's many yes many times as many ways to cry but the two key ones that I'm talking about is this crying where you your cry will on my god well not my god with your cry let it be a cry of inspiration let it be a cry of calling with Qi well it does not seem that there is lifting let it be a cry but since I am here alone my brother is back yes Lord up let it be a crime that says Lord you said I must ask you for anything so I'm asking you for my sister for my brother for my cousin for my knees for my wife to overcome this and I know Lord it doesn't matter what the devil does this you shall do that must be the cry reminding god of what he said that's the kind of cried god ones so when you pray you pray along those lines crying confessing what God has promised to do that's the type of prayer that I'm talking about that's the kind of a cry that says Lord did it not is it not you open the Red Sea law but it's not you who has this Shadrach Meshach and Abednego because you my father my god it was you who was with Daniel it was you Lord and now you who you said in the book of Hebrews you are the same God the same yesterday today and forever and I believe that you are here today doesn't matter what the devil say to you it doesn't matter what the circumstances are those three improvise and my data shoot they said listen listen even if God cannot save us from this fire right you see they are prepared to die because this is about life and death they are prepared to die okay I didn't hear many Amy's let me read for you let me let me read for you I'll come back here the process says well what are you going what are you going to amount to if we gain the whole world hmm what are we what what are we living for same spoken rate of desperation 1963 Oh 901 same what are we living for what do you work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for and he says the prophet too although things are due to leave right so what are you leaving for them he says to die to leave so that when you leave you finish living you die but the progress changes around and say and the you are not fit to leave until you are fit to die you see you need to be prepared to die so that you can leave and that's what started Michigan a bit vehicle we're prepared they were not joking they meant let us die if possible if need be but we know that our God is able to save us from the fire but we can bow to to the idol we cannot let's rather die and then they die so why does not allow you to die no he allow you in the situations until the very edge sometimes too much on the edge and you think Lord I will fall I'm dead this you want I'm here but it was he knows that even if you fall he can catch you he knows that that's the Lord that we save amen he knows he can leave you to go because what did the devil say to the Lord that even the Angels the devil he knows so if the devil knows we are supposed to repeat that to him Emily I'm back to where I was so there's such a long list of the things that are associated with prayer faith is among them amen think of a relationship of a man and a woman if you are a married man Oh another example if for someone that you love your mom your dad think about that that kind of a relationship amen amen think about it and you find that if you're not constantly thinking about a talking to her about your laugh about your things about what she means to you how would that relationship goes and our relationship with God is supposed to be like that we're supposed to to be talking to him let's conduct our scriptures that we read you know what I forgot that thing at the back they ruin that you call it of a slob that draws first off let's come across scripture that we read in Luke chapter what did we read thank you my boy look we read Luke chapter 16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses on to eat amen meaning that pray he's not going to be a piece of cake it's not going to be you know what they say it cannot just the devil won't just give you to your knees silver platter and say here pray in my language you conduct diabolo you call him Thiago in my language the dinner he cannot let everything come easy because God made him that way to fight me and you to fight us he was he knows he will put his spirit inside us so that we can be able to fight back and overpower the devil he knows that so he cannot let the devil be easy because that will that will will will will have what is the weight that will will disprove what God wants to do what God was who is the devil to be as arrived according to the terms and conditions that he gave to be alive to be heart to be whatever he was to be to be cool to us so that it can be proven what God wants to do through me and you and one of those things is through prayer you will see now I'm gonna read codes for you amen going back to the scripture the Bible says now not just simply walks in to eat easily but it's got to be pressed into it has to be pressed on your hearts it has to be a Bedan it has to be something that when you go to God you mean eat because the kingdom of God cannot be taken just by walking like they know me I'm a winner I'm a champion know enough to play I won no I must practice even more than those who has to take the cup away from me amen listen to Jeremiah did you read Jeremiah whether you seek me with all your Hut then you'll find me when you seek me with all your heart there's no way in which I'm going to play a meaningful heart if you don't pray to God with all your heart with all your heart and then you shall seek me and they find me whether you shall assess for me with all your heart not all your mind with all your heart you are going to find me what does he say a vest prior to that better you shall come upon me and then you shall go and pray unto me this is a deep prayer man this is not this is not Lord bless this food we are going to eat ah isn't that one you have to mean it you have to be sincere right those are the ones that I'm talking about in public when you play for the foods you know depending on their own they on the taste of foods yes your prayer is according to that you know when it's so it's not supposed to be that way you know so children let's doing it they let you know that excited about the type of a meal we are visiting brother India bravado is so happy thank you you know you can hear my brother the suspense hippy right but our player is supposed to be so sincere but even when we thank the Lord for the food we mean they we mean what we are saying the Lord loves a sincere heart hallelujah amen let's just proceed there again in the spoken out of testimony amen 1950 Oh 8:14 testimony right I'm not saying that to scare you I'm saying it just ascending saintly person and I know how to stand here in this platform and say but my heart's been stirred for a time and I know that we are ready for something now coming and you Christians don't stay in that leucon condition anymore lay aside everything does get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him it's not prayer and his prayer talking to God let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time can you see now that can be a problem for some to stay with him at all time but it's not a problem if you look at it differently you can ask God to give you that that mind of thinking about him all the time when you walk when you do your washing ah when you when you do your dishes well you anything you can ask God to help you that 90% of the time if not hundred and ten you're thinking about you my dad was telling me that you know the world is such a sneaker he created this he not he created he made and set up this world in such a way that it will take that thoughts of God away from us to be so busy do not do that brother nd singer to be so busy think that well that we don't plan with what we plan our life is already planned out in as far as the world is concerned take everything technology everything man when you when you go to sleep oh you've got one hour one hour you must be up the devil set it up that way he's gonna set it up in your dream it comes your doom and then you stage of dreaming about God you dream about oh if I can get that deal that would be lovely will be happy he set up everything so we need to be able to counter that by pray by meditating about God we need to be able to repel that kind the system of the devil that he made for us to repel it in and still survive in this earth because remember God knows everything of your needs he knows you don't have to stay you don't have to stress and to think about what will happen tomorrow what you'll eat tomorrow of course you must still have but what I'm trying to say is that nothing must occupy your heart toward you yes if you are not a daughter or a son of God no no no no no that leaves it to the Lord what you need to be thinking about is how wonderful he is how Lord as he is is how good he and tell him ah and Olivia desperations again now I believe that we are living in the days that we are all otherwise the day that we are living in should cause the chance to go completely into desperation you see the reason why is the lord I thank him so much because I was struggling and the Lord just brought this broken with that talks too much or so much about what I want to speak about and he says you see we need to be desperate they'll jump something there and we need to be so desperate I believe that the church in a complete desperation I believe it ought to throw his entire congregation into desperation that we we have placed L we have played alone enough we have played long enough we have went to church long enough we've got to do something we are going to change too long we have played for too long we need to come to their point of sincerity we need to come ask and our children us and everyone around us amen and continuing with that spoken with signs of his coming should throw every member of Christ into desperation now the science of the Lord's coming what do we see now Korona we are see what nations are raising against nations we are see what earthquakes in divers manners we are seeing every other sign around us that the coming of the Lord is here but is supposed to throw us into desperation we have to be making every day sure but if I am okay if I feel unsettled I'm okay it's my wife right he's my dog takes my brother he says brother branham in the prayer don't even be praying for yourself pray for someone else huh but when you pray for someone else when you're been in their bed in that's when God blesses you the more you pray for someone for the bed and entering into someone's problem filling as it is yours that's when God was God he knows he knows your need he knows what is worrying you you know she I diseases that you don't even know in your body he knows them and I still allowed this animal to still bring them to you this devil must not respect the devil brother been said we must we must kick him here we must kick him unashamedly and don't stay a shoe and you kick him kick him amen you must come and when you are desperate then God is going to listen to you when you are desperate but if you are just slothful you know it is to be a slothful to be lazy to be lethargic in English DC to be to be too you know but when you ask lawful you don't care whether he does it or not well that's a different you say you do but it takes desperation to do it it takes desperation you see not the panicking no desperation that Lord this I cannot let you go until you give it to me isn't it brother Marion amen and then can I say the reason we can't have a bad end of prayer is because we are not desperate enough this is not the Prophet this is me now I'm asking you a question can we say that but the reason we don't have a pair for life the reason we don't come to God the way the Prophet is saying here is because we are not desperate enough can I say that I don't know if I can say that but it looks like it from all probabilities it looks like it it looks like we lack desperation it looks like what what what then we'll cross the desperation what should cause desperation then I should cause the desperation if ever God will hear us when we are desperate when we mean when we are sincere when we mean it well when we are persistent when we are resilient in prayer huh when we mean all those things and we don't get desperate what is the cause of it well as the problem let's look into that subject Ilya Ilya own I mean a little bit and that will take us more into what brother industries I loved it I loved that subject of love you see because it's so powerful and the Prophet just brought it to my face man I said brother nd must have read this because the Prophet the Lord just brought you to me and I I didn't want to make noise for my wife she was sleeping I wanted to just to jump and because I had the Lord speaking to me in that message and you know it is I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because is a lack of love God the love of God cannot be true we lack the love of God us that's why you don't get disparate why are we getting why are we not getting disparate dinner I think that the love of God causes desperation the Prophet says I think that the love of God causes desperation that's paragraph 67 if God is in you the Trojan is inside you you see this is after preaching the message token and I wanted to really I just did not have time I want because you pushed it after a morning then the evening you press this one so the Prophet at the beginning was just going on about token token token and I almost got confused which way to go what does the Prophet was no no no I must not be confused the Word of God is the mountain of breaks it's a big mountain you can go and eat anywhere that is why you can be any sane man the proper thing that I'm talking about this mess no no no yeah you are digging from the mountain of breads ah if the mountain of bread is not short for us to eat it no it's everywhere you can jump on top and dig from is the mountain of bread that's why I tried the proper to store the food for us even if God is sending you the totally inside of you and you see the conditions of time and the people while waiting what does that word mean waiting w ad ing waiting in sin the way they are it will throw you into desperation I believe it will I believe it will amen amen now now the word plane States if you want to put this down Colossians five and six faith worketh by love here the properties time to bring the fed but we are talking about rather sorry but sorry me and him fellowship be a lot around you subject and I've got excited I said brothers talking about what I want to talk about but from a different angle you see faith cannot have faith without love faith worketh by love faith waken by love and the only way that you can have faith is have lab tests because after all faith is loves incentive is an incentive of love fake but on the on the pyramid we see face these all the virtues love must be there you can see stay at the bottom there laughs on top love at the bottom faces is though when you get faith is one God incentivize you love first love first how can you you you have faith in someone that you don't love you have to put them I've got confidence in this guy mean no they mean that they like him they like the attitude they like everything is doing they even idolize him everything he says even if it's wrong why don't you stand on TV or on the TV to speak oh they just love that person they'll they've got so much confidence therefore why they are especially at the beginning they started to love that person and then love developed to a point where by they've got confidence every advice he says until you are on the screen or on huge wherever they take because they love you huh the husband and the wife have confidence in one another so much because that is an incentive of love can you see you cannot love so someone so much and do things for them give them your life but they can look after you javelina brother still is the one when they don't love you no no his love has been faithful then everything then everything and everything gets added and to eat that is why I made you turn this 22 verse 37 and you see there brother - I met you 22 verse 20 verse 37 when they attempted the Lord Matthew Matthew 22 they asked the Lord they ask you a question are we there these are said unto Him okay that's a verse before peacefully master which is the Great Commandment in the law jesus said unto them thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind it's leaving nothing there I'm seeing body spirit and soul with everything you must love him with every thing from the inside outside from the outside inside everything must love the Lord he said that is the best that is the biggest commandment this is the first and Great Commandment he says and the second the second one is it's like entreat thou shalt love thy neighbor as yourself just pause and think of only a kernel-level testimony only kernel-level brother Mario is it possible to love someone like yourself in the world this come on be reasonable no no there's no reasonable that's what the Bible means you must love your your neighbor it does not even say your brother but neighbor induce your brother also huh your neighbor the wildness taking drugs that one who is the prostitute but what I must love him so much is the lady next door to us we were praying for him she says she's sick but we have seen these certain things that are not right that is the one that the Lord says you must because love will redeem him love knows that the one that Jesus Christ came to this earth to die for the Bible says for God so loved the world not this planet with the mountains and everything and the rivers know the world people that are in the world God loved those ones but he came to die for them so me because I've got Christ in me me and class I won I am supposed to love that one to love him to a point where I cannot help it correctly when I'm at school but to say my friend you know Jesus Christ see Jesus Christ he said have you ever heard of Jesus Christ I can hear you're telling me about this disease but I don't watch TV but I want to tell you about Jesus have you ever heard about him this is me now Karen at school talking Leuven say hey my friend that's wonderful you are telling me about that man I love that be we must go play together but just one did you ever hear about the man called Jesus this is what they teach them how to criticize and to dispel the message but our children need to get to a point where they tell the world about God until those children hate them or accept the way so that if that is too hard but no one will prevent a discussion between you and your friend we are not standing in front of the whole school and wanting to convert the whole school you are talking to your friend your school your friend must know very clear that when I play with Joshua when I won't play with Jaden and mo when I wouldn't play with Becca they must know ah that one is going to tell me about Jesus they must know they need to know so that when they come to you that's made up their mind to hear you or they don't come to you that's very simple and remember you don't have to be if you must love them and be friendly with all of them but I don't have to be their friends but you have to be friendly you have to have that love nothing kept that brings them to you love them so much until this I even if she even if she turn about Christ let me just go she's so lovely as how our children must be they must them we must do the same at work until they call me Moo roots at work root it means pasta until they call me am rooty everywhere I go rooty rooty and I say yeah bring it on I'm rude come let's have a prayer meeting apostate everyone then my boss fight and he fight and he fight and we said no no he just want 80 minutes we'll cut it from our lunch time but money 8 o clock we have a perimeter and they come we read we pray we read we pray we pray one day and lesbian I mean a gay man come and I tell you my friend you know I love you hey he was taken aback I said I love you with the love of God my friend and God loves you that man was shocked when I told him Lesley I love you my friend ah what do you mean you love me I said I mean that I love you because Jesus Christ loves you Jesus Christ one she says oh you know you know how does to prove with her how he's a man but he's talking like that like ladies how's that God loves you come let's go for prayer meeting and he came for prayer meeting because I showed him the love even though he knows I don't agree with his ways with his doing things but he came for prayer and the world a lot planted is seat there if he does not repent or accept the Lord one day you will meet him in judgment that's all we need to do the big unbelievers don't have to accept what you say it's cool I'm talking to the young ones now they don't have to accept it all you need to do is to tell them about Jesus tell them about the love of Jesus tell them what God has done for you during the lockdown that you got baptized and the one blessed you with the Holy Spirit that's all you need to do and they say I know no no only persons okay but I've told you then you pass on that's all you need to do my dear isn't it on a list I mean yes we read Matthew 22 this is it's just about the law of love the law of love the law of love the products is not I'm not talking about a couple I'm not talking about feeling sorry I'm not talking about video if you love your spouse you express it and you laugh go to express but you love God you express it if you look for you I want you to see if you love your spouse you express it right the same way if you love God you must express it otherwise you don't love it I'm sorry the Lord if you can express it I mean how can you have faith with your wife if you don't love her that is figlio this what I'm talking about takes place even at pillow level where we've got confidence you know a Brahmin knows that our ending my man if he's got that he's you know did she knows she's got confidence in him my wife's got confidence in me but I know if you do that he's determined to do it she's got confidence in me but if he says let's pray it's time to pray she's got that confidence so if that happens it can a level how much more power confidence to the Lord huh how much more let's let's just follow this little bit this love this love love this love love love makes him believe it because love dominates all love is the center of everything that you are talking about here love is the one that will bring us to desperation love is the one that will make us have trust and faith in God love is the one that will make us to pray love is the one that will make us realize that the end is here love everything the love of God because the purpose is God Himself is love God is love the Prophet sees love dominates all course God is love we do to God that's what that's the way we do to God we when we love him we tell him about we sat down and we adore him and we worship Him and see love drives us to depth it is love that drives us to do that it's not ourselves right so it brings us to a state of worship prayerful life better and some heartfelt type of a lives if we love Lord Jesus amen are we together I must finish key point remember the summers at key learning point key point same message of desperation I want to bring that this link between prayer in desperation right I want to bring this the joining between prayer and to be an being desperate the effectual fervent just desperation right effectual fervent just desperation in actual faith and prayer of a righteous man availeth March when a righteous man a good man gasps in travail our soul southern travail either one I think that is best is a better wait travail or travel in the one which one you want to call it but when when is so when a soul not the outside when the soul gets in desperation and travailing an effectual fervent prayer of the man that can show the token it does something when you get revealed that's another word you cannot think of a meaningful producing prayer without being travailed you cannot how can you do that otherwise you're just you're telling God just your general feelings which is wonderful it's time for that to do that that's time for that yes no but he's what I'm talking about the prayer in secret in private where you and God are talking to one another I'm almost done if you look at the different examples of people but you know that played he's kind of play that we are talking about you think of Aaliyah's of Damascus who knows the layers of Damascus he was in a situation where he has to go find a wife and they trust me a good wife the Prophet says in the hour of his desperation when he arrived at the city he prayed and said Lord that is the thing when you get to the desperation you go to praying the Lord not God let me let the first mate that comes forth and what does the came in and it gives me the drink be that he prayed in the hour of his desperation that's what Eliezer did Hanna the mother of some will same spoken week and she fasted and she prayed until even the peace in the tunnel thought she was drunk this all she was drunk the priest because she was in a state of desperation take up the Prince he was in a serious desperation was he you that if you call that Brooke he's a dead man Esau was waiting for him and men of war and men of hunting he was waiting for him come he was telling him and Jacob was under desperation he you know I never thought that a man can be so desperate that he just allow everything his wife and children to go fast but there's not one to die huh he was desperate well when you get baptized and you receive the Holy Spirit you are at Pentecost am i right tentacles they received the Holy Ghost MRI they received the Holy Spirit and and and they spoke in tongues they did all sorts of things because of Pentecost it was Pentecost H you have not arrived my mind you have not alive that is just your birthright you receive the Holy Ghost you have not arrived in fact you have just at it that's what the Prophet caesium just like Jacob when he received the best right after cheating his planner he thought he was over it was not over it was only the start it was only the start he thought I'm gone when I was looking for he thought he got it honey when he got the soup and he ate and he left he thought oh I'm the man I've got I'm bigger than my brother now that was only the beginning for Jacob that was not the end and that's me and you when we get baptized and we get the holy spirit and we jump in the story and we are so excited mmm that's only the beginning my brother my sister that is needed that is one tip that is that is what we want that is the beginning right sister Debbie am i right my girl that is only the beginning the Prophet says just like Jacob here is in his birthright after a day a deal Nate no sorry this is me not the Prophet just like Joe Kopp received a bet right after the deal made with his brother yes he received it but that is just a beginning very often we make a mistake thinking that we have arrived when we received the Holy Spirit we have just started the Prophet says amen it takes desperation to bring God to the sin it takes desperation amen let me read for you in closing the following quotations about prayer for the Prophet says believe in God 19:52 Oh 2:24 Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer that's the most powerful air do we believe that expectation 90-61 there is no atomic bomb and no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer do you know an atomic bomb no one the hiroshima one is that was an atomic you know what that bomb up to this day I believe there's still people who were affected by that Jesus your prayer your sincere prayer the one that you dedicate and you get to pair with God he your secret place that is not a hummock bomb or hydrogen bomb that is more powerful than that player and it's not saying what I say a prayer for the child or a prayer for a sick man or a prayer for a madman this is a sincere prayer but it's why that men on the cross what he said I believe it was a prayer from his heart is that you Lord remember me that was a pea from deep inside and they're not connected with it quickly he said you will be with me answers when you can't desperately you know that man just just just made it because he was at the end of the end and by the grace of God because if you are a city of God there's no way you can make you will make it but appreciate what you are going through and what the Lord wants you to go through am i right and I got spoken with let us see Jesus 1959 don't pray for yourself pray for somebody else God he has prayer he knows what you are what you are praying about so you need to pray for somebody be desperate for somebody and you will see in that process God is going to give you that you need it so under four it's not easy not easy but it's so it's so it's so fulfilling to get into somebody's bedroom you know what it does you make it you're one you own it as if it's your problem mr. Sisco used to ask us a question every time we discussed and we talk about somebody is pure they are just a cheap a problem poor does tell me just imagine if it was in the top you know she brings it home now imagine just imagine if it was sister Nadine Brooke what will you do what will you do if it was brother James okay his problem for his brother that one but if it was to a hobby what was going to be worried if it was my wife Sita said what was going to be my action you see so when I pray along those lines when I pray as if my brother's problem is mine when I own it I feel the pain I'm fulfilling what the Lord is doing you got the Lord is touched by the feeling he would not come here if he didn't know did you know how old Phil and he said ah let me go and even feel it myself and he came a man God projecting Islam in closing if ever I had a time of success of praying for anyone is when I could enter into the fellowship with them that's what I've just said Phil the Eternity affinities fill their conditions that's what the Prophet says it's not me my brother's this one I'm about to read now is for us preachers anyone who's a minister this one says brother Ben I remember the James Randi Isaac this one is for us he says how a minister ought to always get alone to himself even before PPG's before he prays before he does anything he should get alone with God in that quiet place heat away with God and talk to God amen before you come to the secret place amen 1963 1226 do your praying secrets stay out of place and and go into your rooms hide out somewhere and just kneel down just stay before God and stay there that's what the Prophet says 1963 transics again the main thing now your prayer is to be in secret everything is that I'm reading is about prayer your main long prayer they all pray all enter into the secret closet close the door thus there is where you want to play all day all night or two hours pray day that's when you want to pray that's when you want to communicate hallelujah any time the devil wants to gobble you up he's got you under his control when he calls your prayer life when the devil comes your prayer life brother you're gone you're gone so it's so important for us to understand that we cannot just wish you Ashley pray it's important for us to understand that when we pray to God we need to pray with the purpose we need to pray with the meaning we need to pray with a cry we need to Kerr to pray and worship Him in prayer tell him how great he is tell him how life how much we love him I mean may God bless you God gave us authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever had is prayer let us take that burden of prayer with us let us inculcate it into our families let us build it to a point where the devil because that's powerful than the atomic bomb powerful than any weapon that prayer that burden of Prayer it moves resting on our feet amen may God bless you all I trust and I believe that with these unorganized weights the Lord has blessed you and that the Lord has spoken to your hearts if I spoken anything that he didn't he ate very well probably because of this polarization or maybe I'm speaking so fast but the Lord the Holy Spirit whom you have invited him he will put it right in your heart in your life amen let's sing a beautiful song if the musicians can
