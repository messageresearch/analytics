that's really good at something as you go on and you're trying to do that same thing you realize more and more well these people as you get to different circumstances you realize well they've been

update you of that later um well tomorrow uh so let's go to uh the book of luke chapter two i'm gonna read from verse one um feels like i haven't been here in a while but yeah thank you for your prayers for last weekend the wedding went without a hitch the weather held off and yeah so it was yeah we had a good time um so yeah thank you for your prayers um luke two and one we're going to read down to verse 20. and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there is no room for them in the end and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from uh from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe laying in a manger and when they had seen it they were they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things uh and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things with that which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning gracious heavenly father we want to come before you with great thanksgiving in our hearts lord and great reverence lord to just we want to just appreciate and love and adore and worship you because you are the king of kings and the lord of lords and we thank you lord we could gather in this way i just pray father you just take every spirit under your control lord for your glory may you have preeminence in the service i pray you touch every life lord touch my life as well lord i want more of you lord jesus it is all god may come and just meet our needs lord and answer our questions lord lift burdens oh god raise faith in every heart lord may you do the supernatural lord jesus in our midst father save the lost heal the sick lord raise those who are dead in in sin lord may have become alive in you father may you grant it lord those who may be watching even now by streaming lord jesus will watch this i pray you touch them as well father be their portion dear god we thank you lord that you are our god and i pray you just anoint this speaker and hear it one more time lord we've opened the pages of your holy word i ask that you would inspire it lord we need you lord jesus to make your word live in our hearts so may you grant it for your glory we thank you for this day lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning this may seem like a bit of an elementary kind of a service but i want to talk about the testimony of a believer now here we are you know this i love luke chapter 2 you know this is one of my favorite parts of the gospel here and when when jesus is taken into the temple and you know it's amazing where there can be great events going on in the world but god makes sure his elect know what's going on and that they're a part of what's going on not just we would see and no this is happening but you'd realize that we're part of it now if we could just be transported 2 000 years ago back into the hills of bethlehem we're sitting with the shepherds there you know no doubt you know it's always what's happening in the world is normally the topic of conversation you know this has been since time has began whatever is trending is trending and conversation too and so no doubt they would be talking about you know i don't know exactly how they had it but you know they're looking after their sheep on the hills and you know maybe they would count them you know every so often make sure they're all there and they're all sleeping and you know as they're sitting around the campfire they look up in the heavens and maybe they talk about their flocks and their family and and but but no doubt their conversation will gravitate towards what's going on because you know they didn't have to travel somewhere because of this law of of of the caesar you know they were from bethlehem they had probably maybe already given their money and you know but they would have been talking about how the city was was full and maybe they talked about this taxation how there was now a great economic pressure on the people and you know you know this is a parallel of today you know you know we are we are living this out you know this is there's really nothing new under the heavens you know there's been end times before there's an end time in the days of noah there's an end time you could say for uh israel being stuck in egypt you know there's an end time you know these shepherds were living in the end time of of the old laws you know of the blood of bulls and ghosts there was an end to that and now a new era was coming in so there was an end time there you know and now we're living in the end time of end times hallelujah all those ones are pointing there was an end time for sodom and gomorrah they had their end time right and all those things are pointing to right now so where these shepherds are sitting is really where we're sitting you know we yeah i trust when we read the scripture we can see hey we're living this out this seems very familiar this seems eerily familiar that what i'm reading in the news these people are living and because it's pointing to today now so there was a great economic pressure uh in that day of this taxation and you know we know we're under a pressure of economics today you know inflation's gone up you know there's taxes coming different things trouble and can't seem to make ends meet and house prices have gone up and you know so here we are we're living in the same kind of an era and but yeah i said it a few weeks ago but i just want to kind of repeat it again this morning you know we can look in through natural eyes and what's going on in the world and we can become upset but that's just looking through natural eyes all we can look through spiritual eyes and praise the lord because really if they if you know before the angel came to them maybe they were quite upset we got taxed i can barely afford to feed my family my flock hasn't increased much this year and you know there's more pressure you have the pharisees and scribes they want more for offerings and you know the houses are getting smaller the population's increasing and there's nowhere to build and the council wants to do this and this and you know i've got trouble here and you know but that was before the angels came you know they could complain all they wanted before the angel came i mean but after the angel came to them i mean they had a different kind of a message i mean they had a different kind of what was trending was totally different hallelujah so you know but but all that was you even take you know that that's easy you say how dare he make this rule that people got to travel for taxation and you know but all of that i'd say god inspired him to make that decree that was god's inspiration yeah we can get upset but you know how do you know it's not god inspiring to make a people move i mean just like joseph and mary they had to move from nazareth they couldn't stay there for jesus to be born i mean there was there was a there was a time as soon as she conceived by the holy ghost there was a nine month timer was counting down and within that nine months she had to get to bethlehem and mary and joseph weren't going to travel there when she's pregnant so there had to be a law come into place to make them move from one place to another that the word can be fulfilled now i pray we can look in the message look in the scripture and realize that god is moving us we can complain all we want but you're looking through the wrong eyes we should say lift up your heads and know your redemption draweth nigh and because god is moving a people not necessarily from one part of the earth to the other i mean but from one spiritual condition to another into a body change hallelujah so everything we see around us is the fulfillment of scripture but the carnal mind will complain the spiritual will rejoice in the trial hallelujah so they could talk about the injustice of the taxation they can talk about the all those kind of things but it was the word being fulfilled but they had to have a visitation of an angel for them to their eyes come open now we know that really what we're living has been prophesied of right now jesus would say can you put up luke 21 25 for me please we'll get to the shepherds but i just want to you know this is better than today's news this is not an analysis or opinion piece or whatever no this is news there's no slant on this oh there's no filter there's no agenda or is this left is this left wing or right-wing conservative or liberal no it's god's truth it's god's word hallelujah so there shall be signs in the sun so no no jesus is speaking of today there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the earth the stress of nations now distress is extreme anxiety sorrow or pain is there distress in the world are they you know you look at the news and people say there's going to be war with china it's not even a maybe it's going to happen so there's now distress oh you say but we're on this you know we're on this island nation we won't escape this we won't escape this one whether you like it or not oh no we'll just be kind and whatever no no it's not going to work this whole world's under judgment so there's distress extreme anxiety sorrow or pain of nations and perplexity uh with perplexity now perplexity is an inability to deal with or understand something it's just too big of a problem oh the climate is too big of a problem oh easy to cut down ceo yeah co2 gases it's not that simple you know on paper it may be very easy but it's it's you know someone said to me this is years ago they asked the question to me well why doesn't the oil and gas industry just go green i say well if you have invested tens of hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure do you think you're just gonna write that off and do something else but the greed of man holds it in this way you know man fallen man brings judgment upon himself and the destruction of the planet will be actually man bringing judgment upon themselves but the problem is actually too big whether you like it or not it's too big so what is that perplexity inability to deal with or understand something why is there such a mental health crisis i just throw more money at it it's not going to fix it because the fabric of society is broken family structure is broken amen the whole world projects a fake life upon us movies are fake why would you want to be like an actor they're pretending to be someone else i mean but when they take off the mask and they go home they just have broken lives broken marriages a bunch of drugs up their veins to try and find peace and they end up dying or whatever just broken i don't want to be like that kind of person i don't want to be i want to be something real the world's looking for something real but the world is giving the world fake so be like this guy be like this instagram filter you can't take a photo of something and live in that photo that's what some people try and you know the world projects us your life can be like this and it's a still frame shot of somewhere that's been filtered to the nth degree and stage completely and they project it to you and say this is how life should be and that's why there's so much mental illness because people try and live in a fantasy world but you got to live in the real world and you can people bury themselves in all kinds of cosplay and different kind of things and they want to be like this whatever and you know but there's a mental health problem it's too big to fix humanly okay god can fix it like this hey if your mental stability come to the law if you want peace that passes all understanding come to the lord i mean if you want to be actually happy come to the lord that you can be content in whatever place you're in you may just be living week to week if you've got him you'll be content amen hallelujah you know what i love about yeah this is the next chapter we won't read it but i love sir simon in the temple picks up picks up the christ hallelujah he's an old man he was promised you're gonna see the messiah before you die he picks them up and says now lord you can let thy servant depart in peace because mine eyes have seen thou salvation maybe he had a bad back maybe he had bad trouble in his body whatever but it didn't matter after that moment because he saw the messiah he held the messiah hallelujah life changes when you see him life changes when you see him amen the prophet told us there'd be a mental health crisis go read the ladies in church age chapter in the church age book he talks about it so we shouldn't be surprised it's here we were told oh this is what's happening in the world we've already been told about this amen no perplexity between you know with perplexity how do we fix the planet how do we bring peace between the east and the west can't do it there can only be one major power upon the earth at one time there can't be two one goes down one goes up and when the big one goes down there's always blood shed there's always destruction it's not always a peaceful oh here you go you can be in control of the world now here's some advice you know good luck to you we'll work with you no that it's not how it works go through history there's bloodshed there's kindness there's turmoil so you can't there's there there ain't gonna be peace the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear that's mental health problems on the rise again and for and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth the climate is ruined the planet is ruined you know there are micro plastics in everything pretty much in the sea in what you eat the water you drink it's been proven that this kind of water has microplastics in it because of the bottle that is stuffing up our ecosystem not just you but the whole ecosystem good luck trying to fix that problem oh we'll just we'll just stop making these no but you've got a whole residue of these bottles and this plastic in the whole world you say well this isn't very pleasant no we have to realize these things are here god told us they would be here we shouldn't be surprised they'd be here but if you're surprised you will be perplexed with the world and living in fear amen there's a great climate affair in the world even in this country but where but the angel when he came to the shepherds he said fear not amen so that's the first thing every time pretty much that i could find in the scripture when an angel comes to a believer the first thing they say is fear not i mean so that's why we have received an angelic visitation in this day and it's got to be personal amen and the angels telling you of the lord saying fear not do not be afraid of this current don't be afraid of 2021 don't worry about 2022. it'll take care of itself you're the apple of his eye you're engraved in the palm of his hands i mean before you were anything before there was any material of the existence of the universe you're in his mind i mean you came from god you go back to god amen you're you're his beloved amen here he ransom you with his blood he's not going to let one of his children perish they cannot perish they are his amen the devil may try and destroy us but we will not be destroyed amen he shall be destroyed he will burn and he shall be no more and then we will continue on hallelujah so fair not amen you can have a lot of mind battles fair nuts i mean they will come to an end i've got a lot of trouble i don't know the direction of my life don't fear fear not hallelujah god will give you purpose god's here to give us purpose don't fare amen hallelujah fear not amen he would say this matthew 24 and 6 and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars oh that's the news see that you be not troubled let the rumors let the rumor mill just go in overdrive don't be troubled see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom front page news and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and diverse places i said a while ago maybe i just said it to christine i said well we've had the famines we've had the earthquakes and divers places now here's the pestilence right it had we shouldn't be surprised oh global pandemic yeah this blindsided us if we're reading the real news we'd say yeah it's right on schedule it's right on schedule it's always under budget with god it never blows out amen you know so it's we shouldn't be surprised by these things so don't be troubled amen now brother braham says in a man running from the presence of the lord 1965 he says we believe that we're living in the hour that when god is doing something we believe that we're living among them now i believe tonight i'm preaching to that congregation now i'll say this morning that's laying and waiting out there just to get ripe i really believe that with all my heart i would say it's the same now as it's always been now we believe that the hour has come that saint john 14 12 must be fulfilled we rodney we believe that malachi 4 must be fulfilled we believe that luke 17 30 must be fulfilled we believe that all these prophecies that he said will come to pass in this day we believe they must be fulfilled and we believe we're seeing them fulfilled right now exactly right because remember malachi 4 is not just an elijah ministry the ministry of brother brahm coming to the earth says behold i god send you who's you me elijah the prophet to do what to turn my heart back to the original faith of the fathers i mean so there's you in that scripture too that's not a one-man scripture that's that's the prophet amen with the ministry to turn the heart of the bride back the original faith of the fathers hallelujah so that's why we can say that is still being fulfilled i wasn't here in 1965 i wasn't here in 63 and the seals are open but i'm here and god knew that i would be here in this time and any new that boy's heart's got to get turned because i want him to walk with me i want him to be back to the original faith not the faith of a church or denomination man's opinion but back to the apostolic faith of the fathers hallelujah amen and also luke 17 30 the son of man is now being revealed through a multi-membered body jesus christ he says stop running don't get out of his presence just keep moving up into his presence amen that's what so stop running but move up into his presence now in order to how do you get out of his presence well you can be out of his presence sitting here by thinking about something else you can be preoccupied you can let the devil take you on some garden path and think about other things and you know that's that's getting out of his presence you want to get into his presence you want to say hey man you want to engage let's lock in i mean let's not be distracted by books and things and you know different you know let's be engaged let's we're going to heaven hey lilia we're going to heaven hallelujah amen amen i'll do it brother and paul call some names are we here good morning hallelujah hey we're going to have church amen hallelujah i mean we want to get up into his presence so the you say well you know and one way to get out of his presence is the devil to make you think it may be for someone else but not for you oh sure he can save anyone but not me no that's a lie he can say when i met the lord i just became so convinced if he can save this guy he can save anyone there's no too hard basket for god hallelujah the devil may think it's too hard but he's never been saved he's never been redeemed he's never known what it's like to be forgiven holy so he tries to put his experience on you and i amen so so the devil tries to make us think we're not worthy that forgiveness by the blood of jesus christ is not for us and also another way am i doing that okay anyway the simplest way also so so the devil gets us into a thought pattern that there is never a way of escape out of his condemnation that's how you know the devil's talking to you that he never gives a way of escape he just says you've done wrong you've done wrong and you did that wrong i'm going to remind you you've done wrong you thought this you went and did this and yeah god sees everything the devil knows that too and he reminds you as well but he never but the difference between the devil condemning someone and god convicting someone as god always gives a way of escape and he gives you he actually convicts you of sin because he doesn't want you to be stuck in that sin he doesn't want you to be branded with the devil's working but he wants to fill you with his presence he wants you to walk with him i mean so god always gives a way out and that way out is a heartfelt repentance amen so we don't want to and and really we have to categorize anything the devil tries to use to condemn us as lying vanities that's the that's the that's the filing system lying vanities it doesn't matter how real it may seem how alive it may be how much it makes your senses go your imagination or you know you got to put it into one basket lying vanity you take the prophet jonah the prophet jonah was surrounded by his problem it was pressing against him he was breathing it in he couldn't you know it was his problem surrounded him so much there was no light in that place now that place i'm talking about is a whale's belly you know there's you know you know they dramatize it there's light in the belly there's no light in that belly you know jonah didn't have some torch or some smartphone turn it on you know scroll and now i've got oh i've got five percent battery help me god you know no no no there was no light in that belly i was pressing against him right and we know the lord supernaturally allowed him to have three days of oxygen but his his lying vanities and remember he ended up there because of his choice no one pressured him to go to tarshish you know no one pressured him he he just pressured himself i don't want to go there i'm going to go here and so his own choice caused him to be surrounded by whale's belly his own choices made him to be in this place and no doubt the devil would say you're stuck have you ever seen a guy get out of a whale's belly no and you're in there you're gonna be fit you are fish food god's god's judged you because of your choice you chose wrong jonah you should have obeyed the word of god but now you've done you went and did your own thing and look where your own things brought you but the thing is jonah began to realize that his the whale's belly that surrounds him is just lying vanities and he would begin to pray to god and he'd say they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy now to observe something means to study to to to comprehend it to really focus upon it and you know so if you focus on your lying vanities well i did this sin and this and i did this in secret i feel so condemned by that if you focus on those things you forsake your own mercy so jonah realized that it was god telling him there's a way out of this it may seem it's humanly impossible you are actually being digested by in a whale's belly humanly it's impossible but with god nothing's impossible god can get you out of the deepest darkest pit amen but you've got to call upon him and say i don't want this pit no more you can get very used to being in the muck of sin but i pray to god god would you shake each one of us that we get out of this little world that we're built in amen we can look to calvary and be free hallelujah now brother brown would say uh in the message without money or without price now he's talking about a he's paralleling a car being crashing into a ditch getting pulling it out speaking of a person in sin he says now yet how much greater ditch has sin throwed you in who could never get you out of the ditch of sin who could ever get you out of the ditch of sin but god takes you out of the ditch of sin without money without price when there is no one could take you out if you don't pay if you don't pay daily for your wrecker pulling you'll stay in the ditches saying you know in those days you had to pay for a wrecker to come pull your car out of the ditch you'll pay you know you'll pay for it if you don't do that your car stays in the ditch you've got to have the money or you stay in the ditch but the worst ditch you ever gotten is what the devil throwed you in the ditch of sin and unbelief god willingly will pull you out without money without cost and yet you lay in the ditch just sloshing in sin and don't even call upon him so that's the one thing to get you out is you've got to call lord i want out i don't want to slush anymore jonah did a lot of sloshing but he had to call amen and god got him out of that whale's belly so we just got a call lord jesus i don't want to slush the world is sloshing i don't want to slosh hallelujah and you call upon him he'll pull you out if you really want to be out some people they just want to stay they actually enjoy it we don't want to enjoy god has way more for us you think the devil the devil just perverts what god has why would you want the perversion when you can have the real and that real is not just life life more abundantly and there's heaven too it doesn't come to an end hallelujah amen so the so the shepherds were there on the judean hills complaining about taxation and people moving and what the government's doing and this is wrong and you know blah blah and um but then the angel came to him said fear not amen and we know this world is gripped and fear but we're told not to fear you've got to choose not to fear the lord is my shield the lord is my buckler he's my high tower he's my rock he's my fortress he's my refuge he's a great captain in this battle he fights my battles i mean he's here to protect me he's going to see me through he's my deliverer amen he's my shield he's my portion amen he's my inheritance all that i am is in him hallelujah amen fear not why should we fear fear has helped nobody no time faith delivers brother brown was us you know well he says fear hasn't helped anyone and then and then he asked the question well what why he's asked the question well what can faith do he said faith might deliver me hallelujah and i'd rather die believing than die in fear because even the scripture says that the fearful actually end up in the lake of fire so fear not don't let that spirit come upon you and you up your life no we're not here i love that song that the boy sung but we're not just survivors we're overcomers we're not going to survive lady osea and just somehow i'm so glad we no we're here to overcome amen through our god we will overcome this age the lukewarmness will not get us it may try and sweep in but there's something in us that pushes it back out hallelujah amen we will overcome the sage because he the great overcomer is in you and i if you have the baptism of the holy ghost he who has overcome hell death and the grave is already in you and you've got to realize brother ham said i mean to overcome you must realize that the god in you has already overcome all things he already overcomes sickness temptation he's overcome lies pressure whatever it may be sickness death hell itself he's already overcome it and he's in you hallelujah amen you've got to realize if you've got trouble in your life god's already overcome your jesus has already overcome it and if he's in you then this thing will be overcome as well i mean because our god is a creature of habit hallelujah hey there's bad habits to have but there's good habits to have hallelujah it is a good habit to read your bible pray every day it's a good habit to think on god it's a good habit not to lean on the arm of flesh but to lean on the arms of the lord it's a good habit to commit all that waste to lord and he'll direct my path those are good habits to have and it's good habits always to testify of good things never to have it never have a negative testimony in spite of what you're seeing what you're facing you know i was so down in the dumps yesterday and then christine sends me through a whatsapp of a quote oh let's just wait i'll read it where are we here we are you must never you must never say no she says i love this quote i love this quote too you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart i mean so our testimony should be positive irrespective of what we see what we may be facing our testimony should always be positive our god's in control he's working in this problem i mean god loves a crisis because he steps into that crisis he proves himself alive and real i mean he manifests his power and then after the end of the crisis we say how did we ever doubt him so we must have that same kind of attitude not just after the crisis but in the crisis how we're going to get through this god's here how are we going to survive god's going to make us survive how are we going to overcome this devil god's here the one who's overcome all things is right here he's not just with us he's in us do you believe that brother and said how long you saved your long as you believe it if you start confessing you're a useless christian this is what i was gonna say i'll just say it publicly you know this is my heart i said man i'm a useless believer i'm terrible dad how are you all the negative negative do i get that quote i said no i'm not that hallelujah and then things go through your mind you say well how about hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever how about i can do all things through him that love me how about i'm more than a conqueror through jesus christ my lord hallelujah he's given us the victory how about all those things take those scriptures and start pouring it in your mind pouring it into your spirit bring those things because those promises are for you and i it's not just for someone else it's for all of us hallelujah and i went from down in the dumps because the devil wants to keep you down this is just how it is and because of you and uh this is your makeup and this is just you you know oh boy i'm born in july i'm a crab by my first birth but by my new birth i don't have to stay in a shell i don't have to cram up i don't have to get get my princes out start chopping and going sideways all the time no buy my new birth i'm not a crab but the devil wants you to wants me to think well you're just a crap this happens this is how you respond this and it's just like uh you're so predictable but by our new birth but if i confess well this is just how i was is how my parents are my great great great great grandfather was this way no well this is just how it is no who said but the devil wants you because the devil has a has poured things into our forebears and into us we didn't you know you didn't ask before you're born or can i have that temper you know can i can i hold grudges too i do oh granddaddy i just want to be just like you can i have that fiery temper and hold those grudges and just no i just can't for i want those things and always tell lie oh yeah that's a good one no we never ask for these things but somehow we just find ourselves with them and as life goes on you say well where did that come from well it it entered in the family tree somewhere and you just happen to be on that family tree and the devil says well this is just how you have to be who said the devil's not my god he is not my creator he didn't make me amen and when god saw me he didn't see me with these failures of my character he saw me made in his image i mean so i'd rather start confessing i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god hallelujah i'm a child of god i mean if i'm a child of god if the only begotten son overcame amen and his life is in me i'm going to overcome that's what we should confess amen he cast out the devil because he knew who he was hallelujah amen if we realize who we are amen the devil wants to say we're a bluff we're in a bluff he's a bluff we ain't a bluff you ain't a bluff i mean you've got authority to tell the devil where to go you do he says no you've got no power over me he said no no hold on jesus conquered you where's your keys gone boy and he said and if he was honest he'd say i don't know but he'd try and lie and say well i've got a spare set no he don't got no spare set one key one key he don't have a spare one hallelujah say well where are those keys my lord has those keys and he placed the authority amen of those keys into you and i that we can tell the devil to go anyplace anytime anywhere just tell them to get you don't have to wait to come into church oh they've got no no the same atmosphere that's here sure the atmosphere gets great as we gather we bring our licks of fire i mean you know brother baby says that god the fullness of god here bodily is upon the earth in a multi-member bride that's why the body's got to come together hallelujah and then the bonfire gets bigger and bigger the atmosphere gets greater and greater but you've got to realize that same atmosphere is in you amen you shouldn't need your favorite preacher be screaming at you or your favorite song to be playing to feel that you can overcome hallelujah but that same overcomer should be in you if there's no preacher screaming no song playing no tape playing nothing you can stand on the word of god and overcome hallelujah that's how we're built amen now notice now the angel told them and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger so the angel told them exactly where they'd find messiah because remember he's he's messiah right he's messiah so this is so that so the so the believers the shepherds in those days they received an angelic visitation to point them exactly to where messiah was now i want you to notice there was one angel announcing it to a group of shepherds it was a personal message to all those shepherds it wasn't just for some of them it was to all of them and it's got to be the same way with you and i because remember we've received an angelic visitation in this day not just the seventh angel but the revelations 10 1 the mighty angel christ himself has come down with an open book brother brahm says that the that he says in the breach message he says that the seventh angel is on earth at the time of revelations 10 1 this coming right so but that which is christ himself has didn't leave when the prophet left right he is here now that mighty angel is here fixing things for the bride to leave that's why he's allowing the world to fall apart you know it's not the devil just just blowing up stuff and making stuff fail no no he thinks he's in control but god is in control remember the devil has to ask god specifically can i do this can i do this can i do that he went up before god about job god began to testify about his servant on the earth he's a perfect man have you considered job and maybe if yo satan was ever honest he'd say no i didn't consider him i just walked past you know because he looked like anyone else but in his heart was a burning faith amen that you're in jehovah god because of the blood of the lamb hallelujah and there's a god begins to have a testimony service about job you know because god will testify about you he's not ashamed of you god ain't ashamed of you he loves to show off his bride hallelujah satan have you considered these have you considered the apple of mine eye hallelujah have you considered her she's lovely i'm proud of her hallelujah and then the devil says well it's just because you protect and do it tries to make excuses you know and then god says fine you can you can do whatever you want just don't touch him and so what the devil do obeyed what god said he did exactly what god yo god made him boundaries he may try to push against the boundaries but he couldn't go past the boundaries you know and then and then the devil's defeated and all that because god says well god gives lord gives lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord and then now and then the devil comes up before god and god says i told you and see the thing is god knew what would happen because he knows the future his brother isaac preached jesus already been in our future and then so here he comes back and yeah the devil makes more excuses well it's just because his health hasn't been harmed and then so god gives him more boundaries just don't take his life so the devil has to ask permission before a trial ever strikes you before hardship ever comes trouble in the family whatever it may be before it ever comes the devil goes to our god and gets permission from our god can i do this you can only do this he only does that can i do that no you can only do this so before trouble ever strikes god has to give the devil permission and we think the devil's just on a rampage it may appear that way but no he's following strict instructions amen and the prophet tells us when trouble strikes it actually shows that you have shown god you have found favor with god that's what he said you found favor with god and that's why the trouble strikes holy i'm going through a terrible time that's just a actually a proof you found favor with god i mean god loves you hallelujah hey job found favor with god and he went through a test hallelujah so we can rejoice amen amen now so the message of the angel was personally to all those shepherds and so it wasn't just some of the shepherds receiving the message and then they told the other shippers and they all went because you know imagine someone's just received an imagine being on the hill and you're no this is not how the scripture was but imagine only one shepherd received the angel's message and they come all excited messiah's on earth hallelujah an angel just came and you feel the presence around them and you know and you know but that could just be some shepherds coming under the atmosphere of or of of that person and you don't want to come under the atmosphere of a church under the atmosphere of a preacher right because it's just that humans enthusiasm that you begin to follow this is not what this is about this is you and god right you know we don't want to try and put people under our enthusiasm because when our enthusiasm may be wayne or something then what happens is their confidence gets knocked because of what we do and that person's just following us this is not why we want to see people come to the lord you know if some people are honest they say i want to see people come to me i want to make disciples of me no that's man-made denominationalism we are not here to do that we hear that people would meet jesus christ brother braham said at the end of the church book the one thing i want to see established is a true spiritual relationship between god and man that's what he wanted and that's what we want amen so now the message came personally to them and then they went then they went they didn't just sit there on the hill and talk about it they went to see where the angels said they would find messiah hallelujah no they went there they found the manger they saw the messiah hallelujah so now notice when they went into the manger they did not just find a better way to live they did not just find some nice people in the manger hey joseph and mary would be nice people right the shepherds did not find a bunch of arguments in a manger right the shepherds did not just find correct doctrine in the manger we know the message has restored correct bible doctrine right but they did not find those things in the manger they found messiah in the manger right they found the living emmanuel god with us the word made flesh they found that in the manger now the reason i made that list is because what you see is what you'll tell others right so if you find just a good argument in the manger you'll give a good argument to people if you just fight all these people are really nice in the manger you'll tell them oh these people are really nice right oh oh we have correct bible doctrine the bible truth has been restored all these things are true but if you just see that that's what you tell others but if you see messiah if you look beyond the veil i mean if you hear the voice behind the voice and the message you don't just hear brother brown's voice but you hear the voice of the mighty angel himself speaking amen then you'll see messiah amen because the word is messiah in every age hallelujah it's not just enough to to recognize the historical event of his birth death and resurrection though we believe in that do we not but you must receive it's not to receive messiah in history only you must receive him today now he is the word he is the true and living word hallelujah no we're going to come back to that thought but paul when he met the lord on the road to damascus did not meet an argument he did not meet correct doctrine only he didn't he didn't just meet a book i'll just read the quote brother says in an absolute paul didn't always have that thai post he used to be tied to the group of the pharisees and he had to be trained and educated so that they would accept them and let him tie himself to their post but one day he was on the road to damascus and he met jesus face to face and from there he cut loose of his pharisaic thai post and retired himself again that jesus who he knowed was crucified died and rose again paul knew it because he met the person that changed him right there he never was the same from then on he never met he never just met a book okay so i could say he never just met a message book though the truth is in the message there's messiah in the word right but he didn't just meet a book now don't get me wrong that you think well we shouldn't give out message books give it out the word will find the word the word will find the bride right this message has a life of its own right you can give it to someone to be passed down down and fall to the hand of the elected you know there's a church over in australia it was it was founded by an aboriginal brother and he found the message books and the rubbish and the dub he picked up started reading he got converted i think his brother roshan in india that i seen the reports through i think he yo he received a message book in english and he kind of he taught himself english to read the book it'll get to the elect it'll get god knows where his children are god knows where you are this morning so he never came he never just made a book he never just met a creed he met the person jesus christ who are you lord he said i am jesus hallelujah so that's how when the shepherds went into the manger they didn't just meet a book they met messiah amen and because they met messiah they could go forth from there and tell everyone concerning it says and they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child so they went forth saying the angel lord met us in the fields they left the sheep there they ran into bethlehem i mean they could say the angel of the lord told us messiah is here on the earth right now and told us where we could find him and we've seen him and if you go to the same place you'll see the same messiah hallelujah it's not the same thing if you believe the same word you receive this message you will see messiah amen you will see him alive and you hallelujah that's what god wants to do he wants to fulfill his word in you hallelujah amen and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen and it was told unto them now the big the big thing though if i jump to this is the shepherds couldn't take the messiah with them they didn't you know it wasn't a baby stealing they couldn't literally take the messiah and take him with them and go through the street saying look i've got messiah that may sound ridiculous but of course they couldn't they left him in the manger so now where messiah was and they were became two different places and they could just point to where he was now it's not the same with you and i right if you only see a bunch of books and tapes and a prophet's ministry in the manger then that's what you will do you'll say go see this but if you've really seen the babe i really see the messiah because we know he's not a babe in a manger anymore he's a resurrected lord jesus christ he uses his word right but if you've really seen him i mean then you will take him with you hallelujah that because why because he becomes incarnate in you hallelujah that now where you go and you begin to testify that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the tomb is empty not because he's not a body in it but because jesus christ is alive today i mean i've met him i where the angel told me i would see him in his word i mean i've met that resurrected messiah and now he's living in me and now i can be a true testimony hallelujah and then now the life you live is a vindication of what you're saying is the truth hallelujah i mean so we're not so so the shepherds couldn't take the messiah with them but now in the end time we are we do amen can i have scripture for that please okay second corinthians 6 and 15 and what concord hath christ with belail or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them that's what he wants to do this is why you're here i want to i want to walk in them where they walk i'm going to walk where they go i'm going to go hallelujah hallelujah you wake up in the morning he's walking amen you go to school he's there you go to your job site he's there amen hallelujah and i'll be their god and they shall be my people you want identity politics people want an identity in this end time amen we have an identity in the word hallelujah amen they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them be separate saith the lord touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the almighty amen after the lord gave the instructions of mark 16 which is the general orders of the church amen these signs shall follow them that believe and after he listed that all off he says in verse 20 he says and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen so where they went the messiah went too because the messiah was in them hallelujah and that's to be the same thing with you and i you know this world is anointed the whole world is anointed amen and we know that you know the prophecies but the rain falls on the scriptures the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain is for the just so it doesn't matter what the church world does with the anointing i'm not interested in that they can do what they do i try to i pray they give their lives to the word not to a church crete and they rarely give themselves over to him but the rain is for the believer to bring us to maturity amen to bring us into the full manifestation of the sons of god so you'll be anointed with something in the end time either with this world religious spirit antichrist spirit or the spirit of god i want to be anointed with the spirit of god amen amen now brother brahm says this in the trial 1964 this is the 19th of the 4th 1964. and you know how the court trial um sermons work right that you know you know people have to stand mr skeptic unbeliever mr impatient and then believers come along and then brother brown moyes takes the stand and and and what is on trial is the word of god and he comes down to the end and he's referring to that at the promise of this day is malachi 4 being fulfilled luke 17 30 being fulfilled which is the son of man being revealed again which is jesus christ and also john 14 12 being fulfilled he says i'm a stranger and i'm only being record of what the bible says to be truth if you notice the angel of the lord that came down in the form of a man had his back turned to the tent and he told abraham what sarah was thinking jesus said it would repeat now if i've told you the truth let god confirm that to be the truth let him reveal it then it's no secret you know then i'll leave this court this afternoon with this verdict to make in your own mind let the god that made the promise not back in them days they were vindicated like the god that made the promise vindicated today say this um say the same some of you think in your heart pray to god for your sickness or your affliction and see if god will do a thing like that if i wasn't standing exactly on what the scripture says i want this court to see that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he keeps his promise and he promised that jesus christ will be revealed in the last days as the son of man this is a man sitting here suffering with hemorrhoids i've never seen you in in my life if that's right raise up your hand you believe me to give witness of the word of god

trouble complication you are mr and mrs sickles if that's right wave your hand up and down like this if i'm a total stranger do you stand up on your feet stand up if i'm a stranger to you and don't know you what is it the fulfilling of the word of god in the last days prosecutor i want you to know that the word of god is true god told me that 33 years ago i've waited all this time but it's fulfilled right here this afternoon god keeps his word he's the same yesterday today and forever god bless you go and get your desire now so what he is declaring is the promises of malachi 4 luke 17 30. i mean john john 14 12 and others are fulfilled right here this afternoon hallelujah now if we could really see because what the angel said there to the shepherds is you will see the fulfillment of god's word this is where you'll find it and they went there they saw messiah then they broadcast it everywhere they went their lives were changed because of that angelic visitation and and the prophet is saying here back in 1964 that these scriptures that have been laying in the word maybe up to a thousands of years have been fulfilled right now and so now and so he's telling you that because god wants you to see this is more than healing this is more than discernment this is me the son of man jesus christ being revealed again this is messiah being declared this is not a church system this is not a movement this is god himself being made known hallelujah and the true shepherds that receive the angelic message amen go to where they're going to that word and they see messiah hallelujah now as i said before the shepherds could not take the messiah with them but we take him with us now if you look at the nature of the messiah he has the nature of a lamb behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world i mean so now if you take the messiah with you you'll become like the messiah because two of you can't live in the same house brother brahm says i cannot be alive and god alive in me at the same time i mean just like if beethoven lived in me i would write great music it can't be me and beethoven in the same place right so the apostle paul said you're gonna reckon yourself dead christ is alive and you the life i now live it's not i that liveth yet i'm alive right but it's christ that liveth in me i mean so now the nature of the messiah if you're really if you're really a shepherd who's a shepherd who's a shepherd on the hill of bethlehem amen if you really if you really have looked into the message and seen messiah then you become one with him remember the scripture says many as received him gave you power to become the sons of god so if you really receive messiah are you following me i trust this is not mental gymnastics you become one with your sacrifice just like brother brown would say who died for you on calvary did a church die for you did a denomination die if you no the word died for you jesus christ the word but but whatever your sacrifice is that's what you become one with so if this church became if this church is your sacrifice i pray it's not even you know this is this should not be your absolute this is our absolute right so if the church is your sacrifice what you believe god gave you to have peace with him then you'll be a most miserable person at the end but you'll become like the church right or a system of creeds or dogmas whatever it may be but if you've really received messiah amen you'll become if he's really your sacrifice you'll become like him why because his life comes into you by the baptism of the holy ghost i mean to his nature now is your nature his ways become your ways it's not our ways anymore we can't live we can't be lord of our own lives and he be our lord too and then so and then how is it how is he our lord he makes our choices right if you make your own choices you're still in charge i've got a right to ball that person out hold on i've got a right to hold this this person wronged me here hold on hold on what did jesus do we want to be like jesus oh but i'm justified in doing this he was real justified he could have been real justified and just wiping the whole place out but his nature comes into us hallelujah and that's how you know see now this is actually a trial you've got to examine your own life by the holy ghost have you really met messiah have you really met him or have you just met a culture how i was born this is how i was raised as my mode of living a bunch of arguments a bunch of doctrines have you just met a prophet that's the biggest indebtedness you could do to his message be caught up in brother brown brother brown did this and brother and he did this and this miracle happened here that's all very good but is he living in you see the biggest problem with denomination is god lived in the founder you read about john wesley martin luther different ones supernatural was living in the founder but then the next generation comes along and they can just point back god lived in the founder we are not called there's that cycle that's a cycle of revival and death and that cycle is meant to be destroyed in this day and it's a bunch of individuals amen that will break that cycle god they'll allow god to live in them hallelujah you think about the shepherds on the field i mean when they met messiah their lives are different totally transformed you couldn't go back and be having the same kind of conversations the same kind of life i mean after after having that happen to you hallelujah you'd be a different person and that's just seeing him in a manger how much more of those that god lives in by the blood of jesus christ how much more those have been transformed by the power of the blood that is holy ghost now we see in our own lives his word expressing how can that become common to us hallelujah but what have you seen in the manger your life dictate actually proves you can say well i've seen this and you can rattle off you know this message is not a creed you know the lots of churches have the apostles creed and we say what donson said is but people make this message of creed i believe brother i believe brother brahma is the prophet of god for the ladies and church age i believe all the seven seals are open i believe all the mysteries of the god you know i believe god is one manifested different ways and they can you can rattle off till the cows come home that doesn't help it's the life of god and i'll tell you the life of god is expressed when we put under pressure it's not when everything's going well it's when pressure comes down when you squeeze a lemon you prove what's in the lemon it can look all fine on the outside who's ever seen fruit where something's basically just hollowed the thing out and you crush it and there's just powder there's nothing in it who's ever seen that kind of thing when no pressure is applied it can look like a perfect apple or whatever but when pressure comes in then what's the life that's in it is squeezed out what life is being squeezed out of you and i is it carnality wrapped up in some religious terms see we've got to take off the religious mask we do we can't wear it we can't be impersonators you know we've got to be genuine if we're struggling we're struggling call out for help if you're doing well praise the lord don't look at our inward you know jonah looked he could have sat there until he was digested and looked at his own problem he could have sat there but he made a choice i'm going to look by faith towards your holy temple now can you can you someone explain because remember solomon prayed lord if anyone looks towards this holy temple you'll hear them can you explain to me he's in the bottom of the sea i don't know he's probably struggling to find whatever way is up how could he possibly say oh jerusalem's that way you know how could he do it but he by faith said i'm gonna look i'm not gonna look at this is lying vanity he's pressing in me on every hand but i'm gonna look beyond my circumstance that's why i'm gonna look beyond i have this you know all the troubles and things we face you know the devil loves to make us feel alone he wants us to think that god doesn't care that god's not interested and we just got stuck in this way and these people aren't really that you know they don't care about me and this is my problem there's all these things and god has allowed trouble to come in because god wants to reveal himself in that trouble but if we just keep observing lying vanities we'll just keep being digested by it it'll lead us up not here to be fish food i'm not here to be fish food for my whatever's going on in my life i don't have it all together you know where maybe i i should what's the time i just finished with this you know sheep are always sheep they can be we were driving up to the wedding we saw a whole bunch of lambs some were a few i don't know how old but they are little things but there was mama she's a sheep mama all the she or the lamb they need a shepherd they can be the oldest biggest mature one in the herd still sheep god has never made us to think now we have it all together and everything's fine and we don't need him he is our shepherd we always need a shepherd i've been in the message 10 billion years you still need a shepherd i can trace my natural lineage back to adam you still need to ship it i've never done a single thing wrong in my life you still need a shepherd amen and really we're born in sin anyway but see we'll always have time in life where we need him someone who knows all the answers has it all together there's actually something wrong with that person because now they are i am self-existing i don't need god because i have it all i know the quotes i know everything to do i know everything how it should be and no no that is we're not built to be that way we're built to always need him amen and that's why you could say the shepherds had that same nature because they were shepherds they could see find the chief shepherd and they weren't too proud to to lower themselves to where he was born because that was a natural place for a shepherd to be see zacchaeus went up a tree and he was looking judgmentally down on jesus but when jesus came to him and saw him hiding in that tree he said no no you're looking at me the wrong way because zach jesus knew where zacchaeus was he didn't see a foot sticking out of a branch and say odd zacchaeus no he knew he was there maybe he just walked along and just cried out zacchaeus didn't even look up at first but then zacchaeus was looking the wrong way at the word i don't agree with this this doesn't fit my belief system this is not right this is not according to social standing this is contrary to we've progressed what's that being up in a sycamore tree looking down at the word but you can never receive messiah if it it's not compatible with your belief system our belief system when we're born is wrong because we're born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies we're full of unbelief that's just putting a few scriptures together right so our belief system is wrong we are not called to make the message be compatible with our belief system we're here to die to ourselves and let and and receive the mind of christ that he becomes our belief system not by well i'll take this i won't take this i like this bit i don't like that no that's what zacchaeus was he was looking condescendingly down upon the word but because jesus knew that salvation was going to come to his house says zacchaeus but zacchaeus you can't look at me up there you can't look down you've got to come down here and zacchaeus was the shortest man in the lowest city and when he came down and he looked up at the word in a place of humility then he began to realize i can't where i was was wrong and they're just coming into the prince of the lord he says lord i'm going to make these things right what happened he saw messiah and he and the messiah came into his house and changed his whole life and that's how you know i'm just going to finish with this that's how you know you've really seen him he comes into your house he's in this house death hath to flee now there is life amen where darkness used to be hallelujah when you've really seen him like the shepherds we've seen messiah on this day no one told you god told you you'll find him here the angel will lead you here to the word hallelujah it changes your whole life but if you just see a prophet's ministry if you just see healing if you just see a group of nice people or a good argument you're missing the eternal life part you can look the part but it's the life as brother paul saying on wednesday what life are we living every day how we treat each other how we treat our children how we treat our spouse how we treat people on the work side how we treat our boss how we you know because christianity is every day not just tend tintel whatever on here on a wednesday and whenever no every day amen so let's finish there we have the musicians please this morning amen let's down to our feet shall we i mean this bow heads in a word of prayer if anyone want to be remembered and pray say brother ben i don't know if i've seen him got to be remembered in prayer your last side they saw messiah i wish i could convey it in words we see messiah on this day in the word of god in this message and those who have truly seen him in the word they become that word they become the living bible lord oh lord jesus father you see all the hands that are raised i pray father you touch each one lord you see where we lack lord jesus you see what we have need of father i pray dear god that you would touch each life here lord that we could look back on our lives and we could truly say i heard a voice from heaven maybe through a tape and maybe through a preacher and maybe just reading the bible maybe through a song but i heard a voice from heaven and and that voice told me where i'd meet you and lord jesus we came to you lord through your word we found you in your word and you look we gave our lives unreservedly every speck over into your hands and lord you transformed us oh god that now it's not us trying to find you somewhere but now lord you come and live in us oh god that we are new creatures we're not the same people but we're not even just religious people we're not even just church goers that's not it lord we're not even message people we put it that way but lord we are we are anointed by your spirit lord we are true christians because you dwell in us lord and our lives we live according to your word every part of it oh god father i pray for each one here lord i pray dear god that our experience wasn't we saw a bunch of arguments or we saw just good doctrine or we saw just good people in the manger but father we saw the we saw messiah we saw you oh god we embraced you to our bosoms oh god lord you embraced us lord you received us lord and you changed us you transformed us you made us knew oh god lord i want to thank you my god father i pray that be everyone's testimony here lord they'll be like paul on the roads of damascus oh god you transform them lord just a moment in your presence oh god our lives can be changed forever father those shepherds were changed forever oh god father they could testify what the angel said was true and lord we can testify what the seventh angel told us is true lord this word has made us new creatures in you lord the devil's being cast out oh god lord we do have peace that passes understanding lord jesus we do have perfect love lord jesus we don't have perfect peace we don't have overcoming power lord we do lord jesus we look into your word lord we see by your grace we see we're becoming your word more and more every day lord we can see our natures have been changed lord jesus father we're new creatures in you lord we can testify what the angel told us is true lord because we're living evidence of the lord that what he said is true because we are lord we have been transformed by your spirit we thank you dear god fathers want to commit the service into your hands lord commit each soul into your hands in the name of jesus christ lord i pray father if anyone has just looked at and seen anything but messiah in the word lord i pray you just lift up the veil lord i pray you'd open their eyes lord jesus lord the father i pray they just wouldn't see what oh that's something that mum and dad do or what brother or sister do but may they see you as you are lord may they see you face to face oh god like zacchaeus did lord father lord may they give their lives completely over to you father may they stop lord may they ignore the devil's lies oh god father we know that this salvation is for anyone who shall receive it but the devil says not for you or i but he's a liar and satan you're a defeated being you're nothing but a bluff i command you by the blood of jesus christ to take your hands off everyone here in the name of jesus christ father me lord we may have way with loved ones somewhere father i pray you go get a hold of them oh god because this is the hour of deliverance lord this is the hour of salvation oh lord may your angel go to them even now lord may you speak to their hearts oh god turn them around father like you did the prodigal son lord this is what we believe for our god this is what we thank you for lord jesus lord you're still touching lives you're still changing us oh god you're still bringing in the lust of god you're still speaking the hearts in the name of jesus christ thank you that the door of mercy is still open in this late hour we're so
