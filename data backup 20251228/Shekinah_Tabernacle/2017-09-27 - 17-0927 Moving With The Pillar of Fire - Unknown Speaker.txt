outside this building we're going to lay them away father so that we can focus on you that we can turn our eyes our spiritual eyes upon you tonight Lord and that our ears would hear what the Spirit is safe unto the church this evening that you would speak father and let myself get out of the way so that you can speak Lord and anoint thine unprofitable servant tonight father I will just humble myself now under your mighty hand and I pray father that your anointing will just come to this vessel and speak the words of God hallelujah under your inspiration tonight father that Lord you would just show us the vision and continue to unfold it to us Lord that we may walk in it that we may be encouraged in it there father we may look a be avid followers and avid partakers of the vision hallelujah that you have opened to us here and what your opening over this nation and how the your headship is opening such a vision over this earth allelujah to raise your bride out of humanistic

of our iniquities sanctify us to your service wash us in the blood or have sweet the flow makes us white as snow oh nothing but the blood of Jesus and father we hear Lord and we've read about how your blood is speaking and it is crying freedom to the captives restoration to the blind hallelujah and I pray Lord Jesus that your blood would speak to us tonight that there's the life and the blood would speak freedom or God to us tonight and that we would hear and hearken and not just listen but tonight Lord every person in this room would be touched by rapturing faith will be touched by your grace Oh God - no Lord father no Shuman can do it with only you we call on the Lamb of God to step forth and open the book to us for any man can open the pages of a Bible and read and even have a good time but takes the lab step forth and open that we may know further a walk in the light as you're in the light to my father I just yield myself to you all and I depend on you now and ask father that this congregation and all that here father would just give and er divided attention to the Word of God and recognize the magnitude and the importance or God of what is taking place right now I pray that your quicker net to us tonight father quicken that reality tonight to us father all cards that we may give our all to you and know and understand what is happening Jesus aim god bless you amen I want to thank brother Ben for allowing us to minister tonight and we do certainly pray for him amen because he's in a place that has got a lot of challenges physically and spiritually amen but if the Word of God is more powerful Amen Alleluia and we pray that the word go forth and accomplish that which God has purposed amen thank you musicians Lord amen without further ado let's turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter 9 verses 61 to 62 and we are going to speak tonight on moving with the pillar of fire moving with the vision of the pillar of fire amen hallelujah it is so important Amen that we move with the pillar of fire and if you don't know what I'm talking about we'll get into that and we'll explain it a bit later but I'll listen let me tell you it is life or death there's life or death whether you're moving with the pillar of fire or whether you're just coming to church or whether you're not coming to church whatever it may be whatever condition yeren now when I preach tonight don't think okay he's preaching at me because remember each one of us is a measure of of accountability to this thought amen and so it says here and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto Him no men having put his hand to the plow and looking back as fit for the kingdom of God Lord had your blessing to the reading of your word father and you maybe have your seats Amen in the presence of the Lord tonight this is quite a an alarming scripture and I've always thought about it and I thought well you know for me personally when I first read this I thought well okay you know my legalistic side of me starts rising up thinking okay well I've been a you know the moment I start looking at the things of the world again I'm out but it's not quite like that this is more of an attitude of your life this is more what is your life saying where are you looking what is important to you what is most important to you and what is most important to you as your God and what is most important to you your life not what you say but your life will testify of what is most important to you and there's two things there and we're not going to this this is just where you boil everything down that's either your will or God's will and if you're going to worship your own will then your will will be more important to you than God's will and let me tell you this right at the for gun God's will for you is to be part of the vision God's will for you is to be part of the vision that he's opened in this area amen this might not look like much amen it'd been might be only 32 or something not some 60 year old known all around the world sort of international evangelist or a minister or pasta but you see God has opened a vision God has opened a fountain in the house of David a man is so we don't want to despise the days of small things even though I don't think it is a small thing I think it's a big thing a man I believe it's a big thing now God's will for us us to be 100% part of this vision 100% effort Lee all of our energy everything that we can give which is practical to this vision a man I thought I'll lay that down right at the start a man because we go through some examples in the scriptures of just how important it is to to know what the vision is you know some people are in a place where there isn't that much of a vision the visions being clouded over because it's not no one's exempt from having a vision be clouded over no churches exempt from coming under that attack and actually falling to their attack and losing their vision and becoming clouded over yet there eagle-eye getting filmed over and we'll go into exactly what happens with one case and the scripture later on I want to just look at now Nehemiah Nehemiah there's such a powerful thing and I a powerful story in the scriptures and it was just wonderful listening to the ministry on Sunday regarding Nehemiah and the attack of Sanballat and we remember the attack of Sanballat and you don't know you probably remember when I did the subconscious series one of the last sermons was also on that and I went it's a great detail about how the rebuilding of those stones the rebuilding of that wall and I also want to go back a little bit further now and we want I want to talk about with a vision opened for Nehemiah with a vision opened for this country to have their walls restored to have their safety restored to have their their protection restored so that they can resist the enemy so that they can discern the enemy so that they can rise up and that temple can take its place and Dominion in that city and this can all happen inside your own life if you're willing in the face of the enemy in the face of all your secret faults and every other voice if you're willing to let your whole life die so that God can live so that you can worship Him and you can worship his will that you you can give your ever teacher and your energy to put them first and your life will show it your life well sure not your revelation and the word but I tell you if your revelation and the word is from God your life will will show a positive a positive wholesome ever dedication to the vision that is open and become a functioning fully functioning part of that vision in the face of all the enemy in a face of all of Hollywood in the face of all of babylons image that has been pushed down over this people pushed down over this earth and is pressing down trying to pressure the church to Train helped to take a from putting their hand to the plow and then looking back and wondering about this oh I better go worry about my family first all my children come first I've got to what for the safety of my children we won't partake in this it means in the church for the sake of this I've got to go see my parents so we'll work go to that convention what's more important what I tell you I asked you what in your whole life family anything that you can possibly think of is more important than partaking of the vision of the Lord I can tell you this that if you will I believe the bride will get the revelation of this she will see it in this life or death that unless you are a hundred percent partaking of that vision how can you expect to have Retro in faith if you're just sitting there detached and when you come to church because she hadn't been a part of the vision you haven't been there all the time you don't you haven't seen the pillar of fire move when he moves and you've got to catch up when you're at the service so so your services when you're at church you're catching up on what's happened and you've missed this and that and this and that because other things are more important to you than the vision of the law and I might not be preaching to people in here but this is just going out you know so let the chips fall where they may God reveal to you and each one of us the importance of this because we don't want to just come to service to catch up on what's being preached and catch up you know we want to be part of this it's so important because in this is the very innocent they sound deeper you know I'm just like that the DNA of God the DNA of God the very building blocks of his personality the building blocks of his revelation of the identity of the very God that is within you and your own identity it's coming forth little by little little by little little by little and every service you miss you're missing out on that identity you're missing out on it streaming is not the same and you may watch the services later and you'll get a little bit in a little bit but it's there's an atmosphere amen and it's not just about you receiving it it's about you being part of it it's about you pulling on us about your faith involved a man because there's demon powers and principalities that are against this vision coming forth they're pushing it down discouraging the leadership discouraging and trying to to to fight it directly and so the more of the licks of fire the more because you see we've got a little piece of the pillar of fire in our own life amen and so when they come all together there's a stronger amen unity amen and such a unity that the devil can not even do anything against him such a power and unity amen and we've experienced there we've had great services where we've come into one mind and one accord and there's no other thoughts present and then he comes amen and lives change amen that's what it's all about it's about seeing people's lives changed it's about seeing people connect to God being part of it every one of us has got a part to play a Mainer so I'm not just preaching about you being here to receive your retirin faith but about you being here about you not just being attending a service either it's about being part of the vision it's a bigger picture this is not some sermon about how bad you are because you don't come to every service don't get me wrong let's look at the bigger picture here is a vision that the eternal God has opened up at the end time just before the rapture and all of that DNA of God they're very building blocks of his I divine nature as being ministered week after week in the prayer meetings and all of those things what's more important I ask you that there's your job more important are you just allowing your job tool to take you away from the services what's more important nothing I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ nothing's more important than being part of the vision amen hallelujah the rapture could happen any day are you ready hallelujah are you speaking things into existence if you're not speaking things into existence then you need to be here hallelujah amen praise the Lord I don't normally preach like this bit hallelujah does the Lord just inspires that so let's just accept that and embody it hallelujah amen hallelujah you see now the vision open nehemiah and here in the tight near mire is the king's cup bearer and i was looking at us and i was getting a bit happy about that i was thinking you know what that's a good place to be the king's cup bearer hallelujah fill my cup law amen I lift it up amen come and fill this thirsty heart of mine or however it goes you become the Kings cup bearer and the king is pouring his wine and to you the revelation of the evening time and to you hallelujah - to a need to inebriates you hallelujah for the grapes give a good smell there any the revelation is really hallelujah the grapes give a good smell that means you know in the Song of Solomon it sees the grapes give a good smell arise my love my feelin come away take this wine drink this wine become a vessel for the wine hallelujah I don't believe you're a vessel tonight that is correct and as dry and as past restoration hallelujah amen as long as this a desire for God as long as there's a desire God can restore your wine skin so that you can handle the new wine so that you can handle that revelation so that you can handle that identity amen when the guard pulls that new one cuz you're the king's cup bearer when the guard pulls the new wine into you you're not gonna crack and wine and whinge a man you just get a bubble up amen it's gonna change the way you sink you know when someone in the world drinks a bottle of red wine they start talking different things start coming out that they wouldn't usually say I mean they start seeing things different they start perceiving things different they start if they drink enough of it they'll start hearing voices amen hallelujah and I tell you tonight that if you start drinking that wine that God has given you you become the king's cup Bearer tonight amen you start drinking that wine you're going to start hearing voices they made you drink enough of it you're going to start saying things that you didn't usually say you're going to start lifting your hands and the service when you never used to do it hallelujah because you're getting excited about that revelation amen and you will start rising up my love fear one might come away a me rise above this humanistic thinking but you've got to take that line and when you start taking that whine what happens the vision because now you're the king's cup Bearer and the vision starts opening amen hallelujah and you see what is God doing he's taking this man and he's taking him back to Jerusalem because he wants his walls to be built amen and he knows that there's going to be a lot of enemies is going to be a Sanballat that comes to challenge him hallelujah but you see God had prepared a people God have prepared people that were ever to the vision but you know what in the face of death in the face of danger in the face of all aridity land mocking and everything they're not worried about that they've got a vision and they've got a purpose they want to rebuild their city amen and we have a captain today hey man that is ruinous wanting to rebuild our Jerusalem was wanting to rebuild our walls too so that we can be free so that we can rise in that complete dominion amen hallelujah I should take this off praise the Lord a people that are loyal a people that are loyal to the vision regardless now working amen there's no time to go and focus on other things no time to go back to Babylon and focus on what it was going on over there the politics and in these things than the old business and jobs they had a vision amen now I just want to put a balance here just don't think ok now let's just throw all our businesses away let's go do it let's just stay in church and have service seven days a week no there's a balance what is your desire what do you want and I want to put this in here just as a perspective if your desire is right now now this might not be practical and it probably won't actually happen well it may do it may happen just before the rapture happens you know but if your desire is right and your spirit is in the right gear and your you've got the right perspective of this vision and you can see how important it is for your well-being in the well-being of the people and the outreach in the whole vision together you would want to be in service Wednesday no matter how far you got to travel no matter how tired your kids are going to be you'll want to be a super swings day Friday Saturday Sunday probably Monday and have some other meeting on Tuesday then I had to be all super that's what you would want that's what you would desire because you realize how important this is now that might not be practical because we've been twined ourselves with so many things and we're so busy and we've got so much stuff to do because Babylon has got ahold of our schedule and it might not be or anything bad it's just Babylon has got ahold of our share - do you recognize that you realize that that has happened amen and now don't get me wrong this is I don't not saying let's do this I'm saying if your desire was right you would want them I know I would I actually want there but I know it's not going to happen and I can't actually do it because I've got so much stuff I got to do I'm so busy but you see this is what I'm what I'm trying to say is if you desire if you realize the importance of what we have and the bigger picture the vision we are Kings cup beers we have drunken the wireless stimulation we've hit revelation has made us see things and hear voices and become a little crazy to the world come on balls kami hallelujah we've been drinking this but you see what is it done you know see drunk people we make it them I sit on something or I'm gonna do it and they're going out of control a little bit hallelujah what about the King's wine amen when you drink that Kings wine you get so focused you get so desirous and so zealous for the vision a man that you don't want to think of these other things you just like let's partake of this when we come here let's make it the greatest service for our God amen let's cut let's pray for it whoa because what's happening what is going on and Stokes Valley of New Zealand what visitation has happened you read in the Bible of all these great visitations through the scriptures and this was no less or no more it's the same this is the same it may not end it's probably you know all you read these things in the scripture you think of this big grand thing and you see Rome and what they've done to it you go visit these places and these big cathedrals and they look so good and that that's just man's thinking of it but when it really happened it was just the simple thing and yet an eternal power hallelujah the Prophet talks about the unrolling of things that will never end we are in the midst of an event hallelujah of the unrolling of things that will never end eternity is unrolling before us we are partaking of the Tree of Life and that tree of life we're going to live forever hallelujah do you know what you're eating do you know what you're feeding on that's raising an identity in you hallelujah they mean Laurita God I'm drinking the wine right now I'm standing here voices I starting to see things that I didn't see before because I'm drinking the wine hey me hallelujah I'm to talk different than I normally talk Amen hallelujah because I'm drinking the wine it's making me Evan towards the vision as I'm speaking these things it's it's a it's heightening my perspective hallelujah because you don't throughout the day and this is the whole design of society is that the day would just make us so naturally thinking carnally minded worried about these things and got to fight this fight and that thing that depends on what sort of life you have and what job you've got but for a lot of us there's so many responsibilities and you know in a it's just like lay it all down it's lay it down because you see now you recognize the importance of this vision you recognize how ported us to be here so that we can partake at this so that we can add her like a fire amen and regardless of what sanballat you know what Sam Bellamy Sanballat means the enemy in secret he's the enemy and your secret and your secret faults he's that enemy they're boys that comes in to try and tell you this is wrong and that and this would make you critical and whatever it made them and mop you and make you fear and all those things Sam Bell it come in there to try and place fear on to try and cast out try and make you doubt the things that God is doing don't doubt don't fear as I just posted the sir I miss it's a little quote that I thought was so good pray for big things that's big don't just try it okay now let's just make this a bit small because go on mind if I ask too big he might say no you're being greedy a man God says ask abundantly that your Joy's may befall he wants you to have a prosperous life he wants to you to live in a spiritual prosperity but he also wants you to physically prosper he wants you to be a king amen now your attitude towards all these things will determine how much he gives you because if it's going to make you fall and it's going to make you proud if it's going to make you arrogant then you won't get much probably because he knows how to administer to you what you need based on your character based on what you can handle but you find yourself in such a situation that's big don't ask small at least you want something smaller force you just ask what you need but you see when it comes to the vision of the Lord when it comes to something you see as so impossible amen let me just read this before I go any further near him I have four one two six let's get this drink some wine who's ready who's ready to drink some wine amen but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth which means angry and took great indignation and mopped the Jews and spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews well they fortify themselves well they actually build themselves up that's what Satan's asking you will you can you do it will you access your inheritance and he's gonna do everything he can to try and push you down to try and make you sick Carolee agreeing with all that all the voices that's going on inside here same Belet inside a secret enemy enemy in and your secret faults o God purge thou me from my secret vaults that's what David prayed you know he hid revelation he knew some things he knew that there was stuff going on inside his mind and in a spirit there he couldn't get rid of he didn't even know they were there but they were holding him back there were things that was holding him back he said Lord cleanse me and that's what you'd be praying every day Oh God Oh Lord your mercy cleanse me Oh what the I don't want the voice of Sanballat to rule my life because he's a mocker and he's going to he's going to talk he's gonna torment you if he can and he's going to hold you back if he came because gonna question everything that God's promised you will you fortify yourself he says can you God says yes you can you are it's what you're doing here you're being fortified embody the word embody the word become one with it hallelujah yield to the spirit that are speaking behind that word elahh lujah will they sacrifice a me will your life your lips be a sweet sacrifice unto the Lord will you be able I ask me now not same bellick now well can you can you can you lay your life down as a living sacrifice upon the altar Alleluia can you have your own Gethsemane experience hallelujah where your world becomes none null and void and whose will becomes king Amen so that he can rebuild your Jerusalem because until you make David King there's no Jerusalem being built it's gonna lay in ruins that's the real part of you it's the stuff that really needs to be dealt with that's the that's your identity so that you can recognize your queenship so that you can recognize who you truly are your eternal being your eternal identity you will never see it until you are real willing to lay your life on that altar really not just say it not just religiously thing it really and everything everything will they make an end of the day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which a bird amen hallelujah you are living stones amen but you see in this particular context and it can be probably preached in other way but you see in this kintu versus the stones of your confession this is the stones of your revelation and what your confession becomes and what you speak in what you say you become to believe what you sing out in your life hallelujah so he's given you a new song will that be revived hallelujah would they be a group that has swollen from a vision sambel a task will they revive that in a mocking way he wasn't asking it sincerely he didn't believe it could happen he didn't believe that all these stones that have been later ruined hallelujah he didn't believe that they could be rebuilt because they were all laying under the dirt of Babylon and you see sometimes the enemy can come into a place come into a fellowship coming to your own life as an individual come into a nation and turn that nation into a bunch of stones that instead of becoming a real temple becoming a wall they just a layer a rubble in the rubbish and their confession has become a fight it's become a politics has become a complaint hallelujah it's exactly what happens and what can hit them and what has hit them but I tell you whoa he revived the stones yes the stones are being revived hallelujah it is the Loews doing it is marvelous in our eyes it is not our doing God is reviving those stones God has made a vision God has given us a vision hallelujah and now by Everett Lee following their vision and giving our all to this vision and praying into this vision and speaking into this vision through the stones of your confession you're speaking the vision you're speaking this vision you're the revival of your confession has been raised up from a Babylonian rule from a judgment of where it was all taken away can it be restored yes I say it can be restored hallelujah you're looking at one we're a part of one restoration for this this place Wellington was exactly what Sanballat was looking at Sanballat had got the better of this region and it was a it was a known thing that Wellington was gone most people that walked in this message near before anything could happen it won't never even considered it Sanballat was asking the question this question was looming and it was it was looming over the valley of Wellington will these stones be revived and there was there was a potential there there was a life hallelujah and even though that life had been concreted over by Babylonia concrete and man and ruin and all sorts of other things and species all of hallelujah a voice started sounding in this nation in this region Amen God God had what hit him a hit a man come here became a Kings capira a man started drinking the wine amen hallelujah amen you know one of the very revelations that this church was found at all was that we needed a wine skin that was supple you they could they could hold the wine hallelujah Amen so now we're talking about a congregation here not just an individual but a people they had a vision there was they were free to receive the wine it was supple that had a wine skin that could handle the new wine that was being poured out at the evening time hallelujah because that Jesus amen he saved the best wine to last amen and you see these stones amen that were lying the ruin Alleluia and we were all part of those times prophesy son of man prophesy the voice of God's testimony the testimony of Jesus the spirit of prophecy starts to resound over these hills and the blood of Jesus Christ that's to flow down to the lowest Valley hallelujah amen to see some stones a confession alive a profession be restored to come to live again that these stones would rise up again hallelujah in form the walls of Jerusalem again hallelujah and we are all beneficiaries what's more important is there anything in your life that you have in your schedule any family member anything now let's be practical here I'm just asking the question is there anything more important amen no there isn't there is nothing more important hallelujah you know we look back to 1965 and we see the sunset mountain sword landing in the prophets hand and we see how that was the the first time that the word the eternal word creative power it'll hand it in the hands of a mortal man marking a great a momentous moment and history this had never happened before we look at that and say let's amaze and you and it gives you this celestial feeling and inebriates you think about well because there's one now don't make that any more important than what is happening tonight I'm telling you know maybe that might be a big statement and what does not just happening tonight but what is happening in a most who is here what is being placed in your hands why are you going through trials why why is all of those things in your life being exposed because God is gonna get rid of them so that he can put that sword in your hand as well booyah he's put it in your heart that you just don't have the access to it and fullness you because you don't have the character if brother Brandon finally is the son of the the son of men revealing the son of men a son of man revealing B son of man a son of man standing there finally after all those hardships all those trials all of that stuff that he had to go through to make him ready to receive that there's a great time in history it's a great moment for Humanity it shows that the grace of God could redeem a man that God could entrust creative power - that was so surrendered to his will that was so did to his own ambitions had gone through some extreme trials extreme hardship to bring a word to you that's cleansing and sanctifying you and we want to miss service and we want to stay home we want to make our children more comfortable what's more important hallelujah making your children comfortable or part of the vision some people probably don't even watch these wings day night services shame on them shame on you hallelujah it's a shame they're probably watching some other things some other Minister following the envision now there's nothing wrong with following other ministries don't get me wrong but what's more important your local vision we're God's feeding you or some ministry some other place where God's feeding that church we're blessed to have the Ministry of all of these different things and people to have such a balance and here the fivefold ministry but if God is pouring out his wine locally now some people don't have this some people don't have the wine pouring out locally and you know it's very hard but I asked the AIA who if they listening to this I asked the same question who those stones that are laying in that condition be revived and I say yes I say God is doing the rounds of this nation I say God is doing the rounds of this nation hallelujah look open your eyes and see the events that are taking place amen for modern events are made clear by prophecy and what are we doing tonight Nehemiah we're looking at prophecy that's making the modern events of today clear because every story in the Bible was a prophecy as well hallelujah we're looking at a vision in the word my goodness I'm probably going to regret saying all these things later when when this inspiration kind of when the wine wears off a little bit but praise the Lord anyway hallelujah amen you know sometimes the truth hurts there's nothing more important Alleluia I mean just continue will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which a bhoot yes they will if they are stay with the vision yes they will as they don't get distracted yes they will if they stop looking at other things all the time and put this vision first over here Alleluia put God first in your local area get that into perspective Haim it might not seem like much might not look like much when you compare it to the glorious giant misses churches all over the world with pastors that have been preaching for 50 years and have such wonderful ministries watch them but this was first for you because this is the same God that's speaking through them as speaking here and this revelation here is specifically for the people the stones that are part of this part of the wall it's true this part of the wall amen is a watchtower in different it regions and he's a watchtower here for us amen we're just part of the wall you know we're not the whole wall we're just one of the peoples on the beach I'm just NSB and says you know we don't think we're the only people on the beach but we're very happy to be on the beach amen we're happy to be part of something that's real amen so let's you know and it's focus our attention because if we don't there's a problem you can have you can actually start to have trouble and there are people in the Bible with car was doing amazing things and there was a vision moving and there was activity spiritual activity in God dealing directly in moving the people and those that kind of looked and weren't fully evident watching and focused putting their worship and energy into God that's moving locally in their own vision they start to think about other things they start to form little kemp's I start to get a bit sidetracked by Cora we'll go a little bit later now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up shall even break the arm a stone wall he wants to make you feel like this is that much is not really able people here that are part of an avid vision that can see it they have a perspective that has been tuned and they're tuned in so that when that pillar of fire comes up and wants the moon watch that's focused they are they're receiving the DNA of God they're receiving that revelation as its unfolding it's kept moving because the pillar of fire is moving this is all spiritually speaking now we're not in the wilderness and moving like this and there but we still will live by a pillar of fire and the pillar of fire is moving us he's turning a corner and he's building up to the pinnacle of the of the great temple of God right now now we want to be part of this we want to we don't want to be like I said earlier coming to church and catching up okay I'll that's what he was preaching on I tell you I better watch that now and you go back you know you want to be part of it live you know and maybe it's not practical real time but we've got a live stream there's a live stream there shame on those that aren't part of the live stream that are part of this church that are going on watching something else or at the rugby or something like that because that's more important than God I know that sounds hard but that's exactly what their life was saying that's what lives are say if rugby comes before church that the people will go to rugby or they'll have a rag me mind when churches on or there's a plan okay we won't go to church because these are ugly this thing nothing is more important and part of this vision you see we're streaming now that's there so that we can all partake live with part of this vision because someone's is not practical to drive so long and you know sometimes you just can't there's sicknesses and everything but we can buy the technology that's available it's a tree of good and evil so let's just use some of that good and it's now always be partaking of this manner always be partly see is more than mana now that's actually patched corn we're in the and we're feasting on the on the body word of the Son of Man we're feasting on the grain the golden green hero our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their head now this is now near my praying and give them for a pray in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked me to anger before the builders and here's the key now and this is what really when being read this on Sunday this is really what really struck me and you know when I didn't know what I was preaching on until last night and I prayed and asked Lord and that's what he brought this to me so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together and to the half thereof for the people head of mind to work hallelujah and I pray that God gives you a mind to work gives you a mind you know that weird mind as it's a heart that your heart is part of this vision not now because mind and the Old Testament is meaning the heart but let me just say what mine to us you know then to lecture you might have an intellectual mind to work you might think oh yes this is all this is a good idea and no no no but your heart's not really in it your hearts and the rugby your hearts and the cultural fabrics of your own nature that's got to die those things have got to die your will has to die because it's not more important than God there is a powerful vision forming and it's not getting any less it's becoming more and more and more the wine is becoming stronger and stronger and stronger the vintage is becoming sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and it's going to have a greater and greater and greater effect as the vintage becomes mature because those grapes just become more mature as they bottle and you are that bottle and inside you is the wine that is becoming stronger and stronger and stronger hallelujah amen to be raised up into that vision to give you a mind to work and intellectual mind not just a heart that your heart is in this and if it's not ask the Lord Celie even tonight and whoever's watching if you're watching it now or live or later pray now Claud give me a heart for this vision let me see it's reality let me see its importance because this is not just another thing that was happening and you know we just make this church and it's nice and we're going to get numbers and whatnot this is the gathering of the bride this is the gathering of an eternal people that have been stuck in bed alone they're been all these stones down into walls and they've been covered over by dirt this is the revival of the stones this is a revival of a testimony Amen hallelujah baby we can go for every type in the Bible and show you exactly what I'm talking about and I'm sure that you recognize these things but maybe it's just in your mind let this now who you pray Lord make it might let my heart be involved in this more I don't just want to give my mind or my body to this I want to give my heart my whole being to this to the vision of the Lord to be excited about it to see the celestial value of this vision because it's not this is not some agenda of man or some light thing this is this is a great thing and this is being done in trouble sometimes there is a restoration and trouble sometimes this is a troublesome time the devil's trained all of hell on you Sam Bela is mocking you and he's querying everything that you see to do and here's the very nail of this whole thing if your whole heart is not involved in this you will be swayed by sin you will be swayed and you will remain an uneffective stone yes people will enjoy it when you come and they'll say hello and good you're here and they stayed with me hey Maya they stayed with the vision they stay there even though they had to walk they were working and they were fighting and they had the sword in the shovel in their hands and they were working they had a mind to work I'll just replace mine with heart because that's what the artist was they had a heart to the vision the heart they loved it they had enough a gapper loved for it and a figlio love for it amen amen hallelujah I pray before my heart that this will bless the vision amen I mean I have only passed the first stage but that's alright whatever the Lord wants we just just just you just let him speak let's go to as I 51 verse 19 awake awake put on strength of the Lord hello I'm of the Lord hello branch Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches who was Jesus he's the tree of life what are you you are the branch of the Tree of Life why because you are avidly heartfelt idli part of this vision and to be part of the Tree of Life unit you you are and grafted into the vision of God not just in your minds people can put themselves in the vision in their mind but until they have a gift cemani and so they lay it down and go you you know you give everything to know where nothing becomes more important than you being part of this you know really really everyone should be here really this was and sometimes it's not practical but if people only realize how important it is you know and and geography there's it's got nothing to do with it and I know it sound this probably sounds very sweet because I any love five minutes away but if I love two hours away I would be here every service and that's just me and there's nothing more important to me than being in the service and not just for my own benefit because I'm blessed every night by God I have a good prayer life and all of those things but it's about given that's about partaking it's about moving how many swords are being held hallelujah how many shuttles are being held who's put their hand to the plow amen and who's still looking back you know what it's he says you're not fit to be my disciple it word fitters not appropriate not meet meet for the Masters use this is gonna sound really bad but see me useless to the Lord because he wants people that rely on reliable people wholesome always not casual about it not taking advantage of the Liberty cuz you know you can do what if you like and this is not the type of church that's gonna condemn anybody or you know have a deacon meeting with people because they don't attend this and that it's all in your own well but you know sometimes the Lord wants has and I prayed this with all my heart and and I felt that this is I said Lord let your heart be revealed tonight and so I'm just I'm only this is nothing that a lot of us stuff is not in my notes especially that heavy stuff it's not in my notes I'm just you know the Lord the thought comes you don't just turn the Lord down you speak what he says and so I speak it and then the next Lord's waiting and then I speak it and it's following the bane of this thought but the Lord's actually doing the speaking and I know it's probably doesn't make sense to everybody but if you're a minister you understand when you're under the inspiration that's how it works I guess for most of the path so here we're reading in Isaiah chapter 51 the importance now of our this hammer the Lord this tree of life you're the branch what happens on the branches is the fruit that's where the fruit is born now the fruit that they you see brother Branham says that if there's not enough water going in those leaves get turned into prickles and you become a cactus you don't want to be a cactus for the Lord will be under that order of God moist the leaves are wrong and they photosynthesize what the line of the Son of Man the light of the Son of Man that is shining a man in this last end date that mighty angel that's come down with a face shining like the Sun personal revelation to you amen now when you're part of the vision and your effort Lee in your hearts in it you're you are immersed in the vision you're immersed in the water that is being poured out a fountain that's opened in the house of David right here for you so this is Alves this is ours you know this is an amazing glorious revelation this is our fountain that's been opened here what's more important so that your leaves can open from prickles just leaves because the leaf of it turns into a sticker it can't photosynthesize sorry if you haven't done that in your science yet young fellows but you probably have I can't remember when you we learn I think we're about twelve or thirteen but your leaves they photosynthesize they turn the energy of light into food into life the plants do and now spiritually speaking because we're the branch of the Tree of Life because we've been grafted in to the vision and we partake of it you know we become fit disciples not looking back there's nothing else more important you just resigned in your mind you've made a bona fide decision you know nothing's more important and if anything tries to become it it's out you just make that decision make it fun no prize givings no practices no recitals no concerts no nothing no funerals it's probably here B maybe that's only for some of us but but no not even death is more important than being in the house of God at your post of Judy it's your first and foremost with your family so that your leaves can turn your stickers can turn into leaves photosynthesizing the light of that son of man is face shining and you're seeing his face you'll have fellowship so that you can bring forth what fruit and why here we read now awake awake put on strength I'm of the Lord strength is virtue hallelujah how can you get virtue if you're only if you'll put your hand to the plow but looking back how how can you get virtue of all of your desire as being divided into a hybrid condition your your your desire your what is it conscience your affections mister would your affections has been hybridized you want your affections to become evident wholeheartedly part of God's vision part of the fountain that's open in the house of David so you can click connect right onto your portion of that fountain maybe opening up your leaves so that you can photosynthesize of God's life awake as in the ancient days and the generations of old aren't you not it there's cut Rahab and wounded the dragon ah you not it which has dried the sea the waters of the great day that has made the depths of the sea away for the ransom to pass over what is he talking about here he was talking about Israel when they got together and those people were had a mind to work they had a vision of the Lord amen they had a prophet come to them to take them out of Egypt and you see they became this arm of the law to rescue people that's the purpose you know you become part of this because you see you the more that's that we that we are part of this and all of our hearts part of this praying together working together with a sword in one hand and a shovel in the other completely part of this with all your heart it's for the purpose of these rehabs that are stuck heymy ray heads that are stuck behind walls of prostitution and it might not be physical prostitution but spiritual prostitution there's stuck in Babylonians grasp they're stuck in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird these people are stuck and there's principalities and powers and demons over them to hold them in those lives and it's going and Jesus said there are some cases that you just can't approach you need a fast and pray there's there's enough isn't and it's a way to win them there's a way to to get those ones so where does that come Holy bit Christian ear where does that come in those are those people still stuck but aren't you not it put on strength arm of the Lord put on strength awakened o branch of Jesus Christ awakened become Everitt leave the partaking of the vision don't just sit there and be blessed all the time please you're part of the blessing as well amen you're like a fire hallelujah amen do you know that you cannot build your house life on the rock unless you dig deep you know that if you look at Luke actually he you know we build the life on the rock we always think okay the rock at them and the children's books have the man finding the rock and building his life on it but Jesus didn't say that Jesus actually said that you to find the rock you've got to dig through the sand the sands there first you've got to dig through it and find the rock you know he says I like in a wise man who dig deep hallelujah you got to dig down through all of those the muck right dig down through all the sand and find the stones because they're going to revive hallelujah so that your feet did through all of the sand and all of the mud and muck of your old nature and your old desires in your old plans and what was used to be important to you and there are things are now us that we are still holding over and pulled more importance because when they come up we're not a church when they come up we can't be there or I've got to do this little assignment or I've got this project on nothing's more important nothing shame on those that put anything in front of the vision of the Lord Jamie because they needed deeper so that their life can be it's completely founded on the rock you've got to dig down through all the sand and pot but your house be built on that rock that cannot be swayed by any storm you know it will wither everything that decision that you make hallelujah that death that happens to yourself and all those things hallelujah so that you can be pilot vision that risk is right here that part cease to see people saved amen to see people's lives change because you see God will change nations to find his bride God will change governments he will do all sorts of things he will completely move things what and we will it happen through you through those that are evidently part of the vision you're an unstoppable force when you're part of the vision in that way and then if you're not in that way when I say you us as a people together in unity that have a heart for this vision that a part of it that are here all the time that are faithful but a loyal that have a revelation of the importance of this eternal unfolding right now that is happening here this fountain open we're unstoppable and invincible army hallelujah because there are a lot of hard cases out there then they've got their name written on the Lamb's Book of Life and they've been bound down by Babylon and he's saying to you into I and to those that are still got that those that have got their hand on the plow and are looking back they might not say it but it's shown in the life and this is just all of us have a measure of accountability here I'm not just preaching to individuals certain individuals it's all of us we all have to don't pitchfork this this is for all of us for me too and we search our lives have I got my hand to the plow and am I looking back cuz this is this is an awakening time awaken and put on strength and virtue to your faith because you see if there's no virtue in there when someone comes to you for help or for deliverance it says insufficient funds because you're receiving the DNA every week every service you're here you'll pray it up you've prayed for it you know I'm preaching you topic condition I'm not preaching that this is going to be every time everywhere where there's perfect people it doesn't happen that way but your desires you've you're geared towards that and you're making moves in your life to cater for that and eventually it will become that because you see we're moving into that and we're drinking the wine that is changing our thinking that's making us see visions it's making us speak that's allowing the operation of God to operate in our midst because there's a harmony there's a unity there's a place there's an atmosphere where God feels welcome hallelujah there's a Liberty but don't take advantage of the Liberty Amen Alleluia very much further get out the musicians season as Exodus 40s and here aired up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate so Moses finished the work then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle of Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the children of Israel went onwards and all their journeys but if the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day and the fire was on it by night hello children of the evening time hello louia what are we being led by the pillar of fire are you focused on that can you see when it's moving and you churned into it or are you looking back hallelujah because if you're looking back you're not tuned in to that pillar fire and he's moving and he's got a little plane over here and he wants to do this and he wants to deliver that but we're playing catch-up playing catch-up because we you know and there's nothing wrong like I said was looking at all the other ministries but have you first and foremost as your heart completely part of this vision have you fed from the local resource the local resource of the fountain that is being poured out that's first then going to your heart's content and thus this I believe is not just me saying this you need to have that right perspective it must be there because this isn't these aren't yes they are sermons and and all that but there's more to it than that it's we're too far along in the day I don't know if I've preached on this before and it's kind of in the same context but you see now the age is matured it's gone from it's moved up from the Eagle Age where where the Prophet could see and raise us up and we would fly up with them and see for miles it's moved into the full mind crossed the age brother branham called it the age of the intelligence what is that fullness of Christ in the body that is not a sermon anymore for your new to enjoy just there has become flesh that and whereas it manifested it has manifested in the talents that every single one of us have and each one of us have a calling in our life each one of us have talents now if that talent is completely yielded to the vision that you're connected to it will embody their intelligence please just think and really absorb this it's then there for the very fullness of Christ operating through the ministry it's then there for the very fullness of Christ operating in the gift of mother and the gift of father and the gift of deacon and the gift of song leader and the gift of all the gifts part of the body if we can just completely give ourselves today and yield and take our own ambitions because we can diagnose situations and admit it could be very well thought of that I'm diagnosing the situation of our congregation and that's the hardest part about preaching in your own church you know what's going on but you have to get yourself out of the way we have to receive these things and believe that all those years that people preached about the intelligence and how will the mind of Christ and the people one day just one day it has to happen and it's happening now the the the pastoral gifts have come to a higher level of postural maturity and love because why they're all their ambition and all of their there's all God and it's Christ now and that gift operating in the fullness and that's why it's so important that we yield our talents to this vision because this is the vision that Christ has opened and then we will move and we will see the pillar of fire will be tuned in what's a good song we could sing it's kind of along these lines we need to stick with you know the Israelites needed to stick with Moses they needed to stick with Joshua they needed to stick with the captain of the hosts they needed to stick with these people just play something I'm just gonna read this quote this is the story of Gabe who knows the story of Gabe and the message that's when I read it here there was an old down there in the south and his pastor I knew him a nice old fellow we called him Gabe his name was Gabriel but we just called him Gabe he always passed her and I we we went hunting a whole lot and he was an old colored brother and we went out hunting and so old Gabe like to hunt better than anybody I ever knew but he was a poor shock so one day has passed her and him went hunting and we could never get old Gabe to line up to church he just wouldn't do it he wouldn't come to church he said our eyes don't go down there where those hypocrites is I said but Gabe as long as you stay out there bigger than you you're hiding behind them see I said you are hiding behind him you're smaller than they are they don't they do go down and make an effort see and so he said I thinks a lot of you mr. bill but I know all John's girls down there he ain't nothing he shoots craps and all that I said that's all right Gabe see that's all right but remember Jones has to answer for that you don't have to you see if you just go I said you've got a good pasta Oh pastor Jones is one of the finest men's there is in the country I said let him be your example if you can't look further than that let him be your example so one day brother Jones said took old Gabe hunting and said we got more rabbits and birds that day that we could hardly pack and said come and the evening come in the evening said Oh Gabe was coming behind all loaded down you know like that and his wife was a real loyal Christian and she had a place right there a Holy Ghost filled woman scene and this is there's a key there that even though her husband was not in that condition she was their loyal e her heart was part of the vision she was supporting that ministry her hand was to the plow and the sword was in the other hand fighting for her husband's well-being for a husband salvation for the people in her community she had a burden she was connected to the burden for the Spirit of God because the Spirit of God you see in something we always we've got to remember the Spirit of God knows every name that's in the Lamb's Book of Life he knows if your neighbor is an elected seed or even a person that can be saved in the second resurrection if you're in a ambivalent state or in a two minded state I should say sorry but good but if you're in that state you're not much effect with the book it can hardly use you very well but if your whole heart and become part of this vision your affections and everything have focused me and just you become used of God and a far greater way and you'll be able to feel burden of the spirit that is fear to reach out and find those rehab stuff find those people in Egypt that you need to spread the sea for them so that they can comfort why how your prayer your intercession speak now we knew become like this is just coming when you become like those that were building the wall of Nehemiah you're going to go through the trials that David you're gonna face the same balance if you decide that you know what I'm not I might go and visit them and I'll go and be part of their service and then I'm going back to Babylon well then I'm going back I'm gonna go sit in my home what are the people in the wilderness when the pillar of fire moved when the pillar of fire was up and going but those guys were tired you know honeys time stay home children we're staying home tonight and they stay in their tent and that pillar of fire goes and that leaves them behind and then they've got to wake up and they wake up out of their stupor and they come out of the tent and there's nobody there because they decided to stay home and now they're going to play catch up and they're going to go find them and they're walking through the wilderness dangerous because you see all the bandits and all the demon powers are all out there and the congregation's go on the pillar fires gone and those people become susceptible and you know what when they finally get back to the camp this this favorite thing they like so bewildered and they start thinking you know what the whole idea of Korah becomes a bit more cause look cause their minds the vision they didn't have the right mentality towards what was happening and the things of Korah and the ideas of Korah started seeming a bit more plausible that's how the devil works he works on people that haven't have two mindedness or their affections are in both camps or they're got the hand to the plow and they're looking back that person is in a double-minded state but there is a vision a fountain open in the house of David that's in this place and if we're if we've resolved in our minds to mmm come resolute in our decision that we're giving our whole hearts to this it will be fruit and your life your life will become just keep reading I just thought I'll just lay that in there and even though his wife her husband was not like that she was that imposed a duty all the time which wasn't swayed by any other hero she was a loyal Christian she had a place right there a Holy Ghost field woman and she always had a post of duty so he was old Gabe was coming behind you know and Pastor Jones said he looked around he could see old Gabe kept looking over his shoulder like that the sunsetting said get real low getting cool said after a while said he was walking along and said old Gabe come up and he had a shotgun barrel hanging full of rabbits and birds and things and he said he tapped the pastor on the shoulder and said pastor he said he turned around said yes gate what's the matter so he looked at great big tears running off his black cheeks where his bed was turning gray says pasta I've been walking along this Bank here for about half an hour said I've been watching the Sun go down said you know these great whiskers of mine my hair turning said you know my son is sitting to pasture said that's right Gabe he said just stopped and turned around and said what's the matter with you he said my son is sitting - said you know what said I got to thinking see it as I was walking along back there he said you know he said the Lord must love me he said sure he does Gabe said you know I'm a poor shot said you I couldn't hit nothing but see we we really needed this meat at home and said just look at the big fine bunch a game that he gives me these birds and these rabbits he said I got enough to keep us all next week said he must have loved me cuz I ain't can't hurt nothing you know said I couldn't hit it but just look what he give me then he said he must love me or he wouldn't have give me this that's right and he said well I had a strange little knock at my door down then he told me to turn around he gave your son is sitting - your son is sitting - said pastor you know what I done pastor is it I made him a promise and this is a good decision here this is a resolution he said Gabe I want to ask you something said what sermon did I preach that made you feel that way see pastor I'll see it now wait a minute see what what what choir saying he said oh I sure do love that singing down at church past he said I love every message you preach because it comes right from that good book but I know it's right but said it wasn't that he just knocked and looked around and I looked around here and seeing how good he was to me what he give me he said Sunday morning here it is I is going to walk right up and front there where you're standing he said I'm going to give you my right hand see because I don't give my heart to the Lord right down the hill there he said I was going to be baptized and take my place right beside my wife and I'm going to stay there until the Lord calls me higher see he just happened to look around and see how good god had been to him and that is an important thing for us tonight look around see how good god has been [Music] let's be on that for prehension just think on it and make that decision nothing is more important I'm gonna be there every every time I can and nothing's gonna get done between me and them and the solution as we're part of us and these Rahab's out there the nearest it's just bow our heads for Jesus father the mail has been delivered father and I just asked Lord that you would just give me grace in their hearts of my beloved eternal family that I've been speaking to and father it's never it's not easy for me or Jesus to speak that way it's not in my nature but Lord how can I resist the
