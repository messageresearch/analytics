he came looking for you Amen to fulfill that isn't that wonderful and he made you to do it amen so praise God so let's um let's just turn into the scripture I have um just a bit of a just a bit of a thought here we um it's prayer meeting night tonight I want to go to I want to go to job uh chapter 1 and we're just going to read a couple of scriptures so I don't have a um I don't have a PowerPoint uh tonight so we're going to do it old school job 56 you'll have different page numbers to me amen so Job chapter 1 and vers 13 and 14 1 and 14 yep here we are now and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house no sorry that's not the right one it's what happens when you drop things down on your phone now we're going up to verse sorry verse six now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and esth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do job fear God for not Hast not Thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou H has blessed the work of of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats uh tonight I want to talk about you know you see here uh in this in the scripture we see the devil's attitude and we see God's attitude and then we'll come into job's attitude now we understand from historians they say that the Book of Job is the oldest uh book It Was Written even before Moses was inspired to write the first five books of the Bible and people say that uh job lived at the same time as uh Abraham did so around that time and there's many different uh uh takes on it but but to me it's the oldest book in the Bible and to me it's very interesting how it is the oldest book because uh it is showing the devil's attitude towards the believer it's showing God's attitude towards the believer and it's showing the believer's attitude in the trial amen and and and we know uh the Devil is a creature of habit so how he starts is how he's going to finish so if he thought about Believers like that then he's going to think about Believers like that now amen so we can see his attitude was is uh that we read is that you know the devil's attitude was you know the only reason that job served God is because God blessed him and how how how uh how how that is the same thing today where where you can even hear some people's attitudes you know where people say well if God is really God and if God is really a good God then why why does he allow suffering and hardship and if he's really the God of all glory the most powerful one why does he allow suffering to come into the Earth and you know there's always this question that that that lingers around and you know even even the uh disciples or rather when Jesus was on the cross you know the Pharisees and said said if you're really the son of God come off the cross and we'll believe you you know trying to trying to get God to fulfill his word how they wanted him to fulfill it but you see now um but God God God is uh greater than our understanding in one sense because we got to realize the reason that the world is in chaos is because of the accuser has made it that way so the one who's saying if God is really such a good God and why does he allow these things is the one who actually engineered this whole thing now we understand that God knowing the end from the beginning knew the fall would take place right he wasn't surprised when Adam and Eve fell he but he he allowed it to happen because God wanted to manifest the fullness of his character and nature to his children because we understand God does not want robots through eternity saying holy holy holy sure the S seraphim they they you they Praise Him day and night but God wants more than just a robotic learned behavior he wants a sincere relationship a Thanksgiving amen because remember when when when we're GED gathered around the throne who are really going to be the worshippers not the Angels like brother Braham says that when the Great redeemed of all ages go out March up into glory and we begin to sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound the angels will bow their heads and they won't be able to join us because they don't know the meaning of that song they never receed the revelation of that because they were never lost they were never redeemed am mean God never shed his blood upon the Earth to redeem them but he redeemed you and I amen so we can sing such songs like that and amazing love how great it be that my God would die for me and you know Swing Low Sweet Chariot coming forward to carry me home and you know uh we can sing many you know I'm going to walk right up into a body change amen the Angels can't sing that but we can sing that amen there's many songs they cannot sing because they never had the experience so God wants people to worship him out of experience out of Revelation amen that's why God allowed this you know the fall to take place is because there's a lot of attributes of God that Adam and Eve could never know in a perfect world Amen it took see see all the devil did was release God in his fullness upon the Earth everything the devil does backfires amen we got to understand that everything he does backfires on himself amen you even look at you even Jesus dying on Calvary if if the devil really knew this is going to be my worst day in my existence is this day worse than being cast out of Heaven worse than being defeated on every Hand by the prophets this is going to be my worst day I'm going to regret this day major if he really knew that he would never have touched him he would never have laid one stripe upon Jesus's back he would never allowed one nail he would never have let one Pharisee rip any beard out spit it him mock none of that would have happened you see so everything the devil does backfires upon Him amen and it's the same thing today friends he's made this this Eden that we live in but it's actually going to backfire on him and it is backfiring on him because God has a people upon the Earth presently that I'm looking to I mean that God has created to walk in this chaos of a confusion of a world but yet walk with God hallelujah but yet walk with God so you see so Satan always thinks well the only reason that that um now we know rather go uh backtracking you know God put man on free moral agency so when he put Adam and Eve having dominion over the Earth he put them on free moral agency that whatever they did was up to them and they because of the the deceitfulness of the devil they actually gave him dominion over the Earth the Dominion they had they lost it became slaves that the Fallen Angel would become the king and that's the reason why we have sickness disease sorrow pain pain death destruction you know typhoons hurricanes tsunami Cyclones all these things is because the prince of the power of the air so he causes it then he comes you and says if God's really God why does he why does he allow these things why does he do this if he's if he really loves you he asks you that question does he not why are you in the stat you and why why is he allowed you see and the thing is we don't understand like brother B says God's love is far greater than what we think love really is amen like brother Arman preached a couple of Wednesdays ago his love is far more Supreme because we think that that love is like a parental care right you see your children they're about to fall off a precipice or hurt themselves whatever you'll scoop them up you won't let them get injured none okay most of the parents are like that yeah you don't want to see your kids get hurt cut themselves whatever more and scrape and make mistakes and all these things but brother Bram says God's love is not like that God's love is elective love I mean even when in the Book of Malachi where where Israel would say how do we know God loves us you know and and then and then Malachi would speak about these things that God's love is elective the reason he he's proven his love is because he has chosen you he has chosen you and he says he loves you that's his love he'll let you go all through kind all through he'll let you go through all kinds of things but that doesn't mean he doesn't love you that doesn't mean he's not proud of you that doesn't mean that you're you're not his child or he displeased with any way no God is allowing you to go through these things because God wants to reveal something to you in that trial that you never would have received amen amen just like job here now so that's the question God you the devil always says the only reason people worship you God is because everything's going fine for them and and and the devil said look just just put just just touch him touch all he hath and he'll curse you to your face and God basically said I don't believe you he doesn't believe Satan right and God and God showed Satan that he was wrong okay now job did not understand that this conversation had taken place but God had confidence in job right but not in his mental ability not in his ability as a human to serve God but God put conf had confidence in the soul of job the inside of the inside which is greater than because remember job would have had a lot of Mind battles you read the book of Job his friends came along to him you think the ones who would give him Comfort the ones that would open the word and actually give him consolation and stability and his trial and they were doing the opposite it' be hard because they were his closest friends they weren't his enemies they weren't the ones that actually hated job were jealous of job they were job's friends right so so all of this would have been playing in his mind where one by one they accused him basically job let's just summarize this real quick job you're a secret Sinner and you deserved everything you've received and they came with all different kind of angles you know right but then but something in job said no I don't understand this I don't know what's going on but I know I'm righteous I and the reason the reason that he could stand there that way is because he had complete confidence in the blood of the Lamb that he offered he didn't have confidence in himself he had confidence in his lamb amen and that's and that's how he could stand the way he could stand now job would come let's go to uh job 13 and I'm going to read verses um 14 and 15 I hope I got this this time if not well we'll find it we'll start reading job 13 and verses 14 and 15 now this is this is the believer's attitude we come to a place we come to this place job 1314 and 15 he says wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand though he slay me yet will I trust in him but I will maintain my own ways before him so he came to a place as though he slay me I'm still going to trust him anyway so whatever's going on in my life I'm going to trust him he's going to see me through am I going to come out the other side I don't know but I'm going to trust him that's the main thing amen amen that's the main thing that was job's attitude and we know that through through job's great trials he could stand there and said now I know my redeemer liveth right now I and I will stand I said in my flesh I see God I'll stand with him on the latter part of the you know in the last days he'll stand upon the Earth with him these Revelations struck him because he stood there in the trial see it's amazing how God will use hardship for us to be drawn closer to him cuz God wants to reveal himself in all the trouble now we're going to realize now I'm going to do a massive segue to to Lake Michigan right now and then we're going to then we're going to wrap up now well actually we'll go here first brother Braham said that God wanted to show Abraham who Abraham was he makes that statement he wanted to show Abra AB who Abraham really was now when you read through the life of Abraham there's a lot of spots that if Abraham could have stood next to Moses when Moses is writing down the account of his life he would have taken the quill out of Moses's hand and said don't write that here's the father of the faith okay I don't know I I was thinking about this the other day here is this man he goes he backslides out of the promised land not once but twice he uses his own wife as a shield tell you're my sister and then and then he actually unless God intervene not the you know if God did not intervene on both those times she would have ended up marrying the king of that land can you imagine the emotion the feeling of after the first time and then after the second time and then Moses writes that down as he's inspired to write about your life see and then there was a time when God came to and said you're going to be the father of Nations and and Abraham rolls on the floor in the presence of God laughing at God who just gave the promise all of those things was not God showing Abraham who Abraham was right are you following me many times we just remember those kind of moments that the moments we're really not proud of the moments that we wish we could just just rewind the tape and do a whole different kind of you know you learn what not to do after you've done it right but that's that that was not God allowed Abraham to go through those things but he wanted Abraham to realize that's not really you Abraham that may be the human part of you but that's not the part I have confidence in the confidence I have Abraham I've got the the confidence I have in you Abraham is that seed I've placed inside you amen that when God actually gave him the promise he said and Abraham beli God and it was accounted to him for righteousness right so there was a lot of there was a lot of other things that were covering Abraham but it wasn't who Abraham was now if you've ever I sorry I didn't get any photos but you go Google a a lake or a river or something that's that's that's just full of trash and and you know logs floating and you know who's ever seen that kind of a you know storm comes down and you know the lake and there's there's rubbish and there's logs and there's all the stuff floating around none of that is the lake none of that is the lake but many times people look at a lake and they see all the debris and the rubbish and they think that's the lake just like the bad parts like Abraham you know when he laughed at God he you know hid behind his wife that's like the that's like the sticks and the logs and the rubbish in the lake but that but that wasn't Abraham right that's like you and I we've got a lot of things like that that's not us right and the devil wants those things to pile into us like fear and worry and regret and and um you know feeling like guilt and things he wants those things to cover up our Lake right but then God sends a Revival he sends a wind blowing amen and then you see things that were submerged in the lake you see it blowing up on the on the beach on the shore and then you can see man I can't believe that was in the lake there's a shopping trolley you know there's a car you know there's this big log that looked like nothing but when it comes out you really see it for what it was but remember none of that is the lake it may be in the lake for a certain season but then the wind begins to blow because God doesn't want the lake to stay all filled with trash and rubbish it's like us we're like the lake I mean we're like the lake brother Ram says you know when he saw Lake Michigan all the waves are jumping the wind is blowing and you know he asked a question what's happening with that Lake and he says that lake is having a Revival I mean the same amount of water before the wind blows and after blows is in the lake but what happens is the wind comes down blows over that Lake and all the trash and all the stuff that's submerged in there that shouldn't be in there that's not part of the the lake is blown up over onto the onto the seashore onto the onto the beach of the lake Hallelujah so so what does God want to do he wants the his wind to blow because many times we see this big log floating in us some something has happened in our life you know I imagine uh Abraham and Sarah when they leave I can't remember where they went through Egypt or the Philistines I can't remember which account was the first but I imagine when they rode out of that country after God has Paul actually intervened and said this man uh this this woman that you're going to marry is actually Abraham's wife you know and then and then the king gets mad at Abraham and all these things but yet God says he's my prophet he he'll pray for you who's read the accounts I imagine when they are riding out of that country I don't think they were having a nice Ticky tour and enjoying the scenery it would have been a real tense real maybe it would have been a a long silence and then the second time it probably would have been a little bit longer cuz she would have been thinking I can't believe he did it again you see but that wasn't who Abraham really was amen I'm I believe you're getting my point there's a lot of things like log that that would have been a big log that would have been not just little twig floating around on Abraham's leg that was a massive thing right but God brought his Holy Spirit and blew that out of Abraham amen blew that fear of man and that worry and all those things God wanted Abraham to see no I've made you father of Nations amen he allowed lot to be caught up in a war going on and Abraham to arm his servants because God wanted Abraham to see who Abraham really was he wasn't a coward amen he was a mighty conqueror because God made him thus right so I believe at the moment God is really wanting us to see who we really are not your Humanity not Abraham's Humanity I mean that's why Paul would write Abraham's um let's go to it shall we I think it's Romans 4 or5 let's go sword drill four oh my there's a master swordswoman right there amen oh you often tell Christine her reactions are faster than mine I'm like I'm glad we don't have a shootout I'd be dead that's true anyway Romans the Swiss you got to watch them Romans 4 let's go down to verse I believe it is um let's read from verse 17 actually let's read from verse 13 let's read a bit shall we am see because remember Moses would read would would write the commentaries of a of a lot of saints lives through the blood of bulls and goats where the blood of bulls and goats just covered up sin right it didn't take away sin so all the humanity of the Believers are very much written in the Old Testament which to me they're they're an example so I'm glad they're there but but when when but when the Apostle Paul would write about the same Believers lives you don't see those things written why because the blood of Jesus Christ has cleared that debt amen amen completely not just covered it annihilated it taken away that the true them can be written down remember the true of them was already there but it was I will follow me okay I trust I'm making sense to me I'm well I'm happy okay so anyway um Romans 4:13 for the promise that he should be the ear of the world was not to Abraham or to a SE through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be ears faith is made void and the promises of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who Quicken the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according pardon me to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giv glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able uh able also to perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification so that's that's Paul and SP remember Paul knew Abraham's life in the Book of Genesis but when God inspired him to write it he didn't write about what came into his Lake he wrote about Abraham who he really was right and God is God is I believe through the messages come to show us there'll be a lot of dead branches coming to you coming to your Lake that's not who you are that doesn't don't let it Define you hallelujah amen you say well I've got a lot of debris floating around just let the Holy Ghost blow it out amen let him take the guilt and the shame and the anxiety and the whatever's happened in the past then say Lord blow it out of me it's not part of me it's it's causing me trouble but it's not me amen amen and then let and then because remember the lake is the same before the storm and after the storm instead of in Terms of contents of water what's happened the trashes are blowing up on the on the beach then what can you do say praise God I can't believe it was that bad but it's not in me anymore and that's the main thing amen I think I'm just going to leave it there tonight I trust that would help somebody amen but you see now may God show us who we really are hallah not not this guy this guy amen job went through incredible trials but God wanted to show job who he really was amen and we go through incredible things why so God because he wants to show himself in those trials to show who you really are you're made of Greater stuff than you realize amen praise the Lord let's um can we have the musicians tonight and uh I want to sing brother Colin was um we were well he was
