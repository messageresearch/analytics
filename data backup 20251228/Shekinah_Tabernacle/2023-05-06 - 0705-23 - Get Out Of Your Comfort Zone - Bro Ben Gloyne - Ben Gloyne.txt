Under Your Divine control Lord we need you to take over so we surrender ourselves Lord and may you anoint speaker and hear him may you anoint our faith oh God lord to receive and believe your word and to act upon it dear God may he change our Lives May you may you do what we think is impossible Lord may you come and do the impossible because you're the god of the impossible Lord so Lord we want to commit Our Lives into your hands may be with those who couldn't be here today Lord May bless all of us oh God in Heavenly places in you in Jesus Christ's name we commit the service and the day into your hands amen amen God bless you friends uh you may have your seats this morning I want to speak about getting out of your comfort zone getting out of the safety place because a safe place is not actually the only safe place is Christ right but people get into a you know oh it's safe to stay where I am in the Lord that's not safety that's actually death so we want to keep we we want to keep walking with God you know our walk is not a standing still we're walking we're moving you know there's movement there's change going on as we read there you know we've got to go with you know you know the Apostle Paul as he's he's written to the Hebrews here and and you know he comes down to the last chapter he says now let us go therefore uh unto him without the camp so he's telling them you've got to move from where you are you know because he contrasts in the book of Hebrews he contrasts the blood of bulls and goats with the blood of Jesus Christ and you know how Aaron was the high priest and they had a natural lineage of high priest but then Christ is our high priest forevermore and so he's contrasting these things he's now he's telling them listen you've got to go beyond your Camp amen you've got to go without of your Camp you gotta you gotta leave the place that you're dwelling in spiritually and go without the camp I mean because a camp here if you look at the definition it means an encampment it's a it's a camp of Israel in the desert amen it's a city it's a it's a um assembly you know a a uh sacred congregation it's a Barracks of Roman soldiers or it's an Army in the line of battle now if you'll look at all those things they're all things that are set up and you've got to keep the status quo of where where you are so an Army in the line of battle you've got to keep formation but you know the Lord is saying go beyond the formation of your life and the formation of what people do and the formation of your past you've got to go beyond those things you know you've got to go beyond the encampment of your comfort zone you know this is this is a faith Walk we're walking in you know this is not a standing still you know the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord but in order for your footsteps to be ordered you've got to be making footsteps you've got to move moving in a direction and we know that we're not guessing in the direction we're going because we have the revealed word of God in this day I mean so we're not guessing which way how to please God what we should do no we know the way we should go right amen so we're not guessing but we're not called to stand still you know we're not just called to be raised in the message be part of a church you know and that's it you've got to go beyond the camp of well I've been raised in the message you've got to go well beyond that I mean you're going to go with beyond that to a supernatural experience where you know you've met God you know our God doesn't leave us in a guessing game of am I going to heaven am I going to Rapture and am I not no he wants you to be double sure that you know amen because when he died on Calvary he said it is finished right so the sin question in his mind is done but is it settled in your mind that he did it for you amen he wants to answer that question amen so we're not called just to come to church and be part of a church we'll miss everything if we just do that but we must go beyond the camp of being part of a church and being part of a church culture and go unto him amen and have a real experience with him you know some people come in and they say you know you know and all they want to know is what do I need to do just tell me how to dress tell me what's expected of me you know tell me a do's and don'ts list and then that's it that's not walking with God that's just conforming to a set of rules God doesn't want us to conform to a set of human rules he wants us to walk according to his word and love him I mean so we can't just cabbage down on a on some past idea of a comfort zone we're going to go beyond the camp even even if we've already had a supernatural touch from God he's changed our lives we're to keep walking with him don't stand still don't just keep looking back remember Christianity is not a rear view mirror kind of a drive right if you look in your rearview mirror and you're driving you're going to hit something you're going to crash into something that if you're looking forward you would have seen it but if you're looking back you're going to hit it amen so we're not looking back we're looking for him I mean God has so many promises in his word that are lying right now that you've got to be looking forward for them to be fulfilled so he must go beyond the camp of our comfort zone we must go beyond God is calling us to go beyond that to him amen he wants to walk with us in a supernatural walk in a far greater way than we've experienced thus far amen because this is not a plateau we're not walking on a level piece of ground we're marching to Zion we're marching onwards and upwards amen sure there may be valleys and hard places to go through but as long as your trajectory is this way as long as the graph is trending upwards that's a good walk with God Amen so we must always be looking forward you know Enoch Enoch walked with God the Bible said he did not just stand still amen amen he did not just stand this you know but he kept walking with God amen amen so you know because we're not saved by a checklist like I said some people they just want to know the do's and don'ts and therefore I'm in no we're not saved by a checklist you know we are not saved by a measuring stick as the prophet would say we are saved by the grace of God Amen to us not by a measuring stick we're going to take a Rapture it's by God's grace calling us and leading us and US surrendering to his grace he's going to take us all the way through amen so we're not safe by a measuring sticker or a list of do's and don'ts no it's a walk with God you know it's amazing you know you know you think about when you look at the Believers all the way down Through the Ages God always called them to step out of their safety zone as uh as as Brother Andy was um preaching on Wednesday you know about how you know you know how I think as Ezekiel Saw The Vision how how he walked into the river it was ankle deep and went deeper and deeper and deeper you know but there's a walk out into when we're now swimming Waters yeah we're not just called to stand the shallow things of God but to go deeper into the fullness of him amen amen but now every believer as has has been called really to step out and walk into impossible situations you know like Peter on the boat there with the disciples there's a storm they're afraid Jesus comes walking on the water and you know Jesus calls him to come walk with him it's impossible to walk on water physics will tell you it won't work I mean who's who's ever sunk to a bottom of a swimming pool or a spa you're just struggling to swim all right yep you know but he walked on water he didn't drown at first amen because he kept looking at the Lord but so God will always cause us to walk into the impossible but if faith is anchored in the heart you can walk in that place amen like like it says in Hebrews 11 verse 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place where he should after receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went isn't that incredible God doesn't see many of us expect God's going to give us a timeline he's going to give us details he's going to show us exactly where when how why what all those things right but God doesn't give us those things right we walk in faith and then he shows us as we're walking but you've got to obey the call of the Walk amen he wants to walk with you this morning amen we sing a song Walk With Me Jesus walk with me but rarely he wants you to walk with her more than you want to walk with him amen so you know can you imagine if we go back to Abraham's house you know after God said leave this land I'll show you a place you're going to go maybe you're Abraham's neighbor you've known him for years you're known as parents for years but but one morning you wake up early to the sound of a people packing up and unloading and you know you're unpacking the house there's a moving truck turns up and you know you get up you look over the fence you see Abraham's carrying boxes and loading his camels and you know and you think Abraham what's going on you know what are you doing and and and he'd say God spoke to me last night all right well what did God say God says I have to leave so I'm leaving he put his faith into action all right and then and then you know maybe you'd say well where are you going yeah and Abraham would say actually I don't know I don't know where I'm going but God called me to leave so I'm leaving um uh what kind of Are You Gonna pack you know you're going to go into mountainous country is going to be snowy is going to be hot you know what kind of clothes you're packing I don't know I actually don't know where I'm going I have no idea and then and then you think Abraham what kind of God called you all right you know he sure he doesn't have a real hot kind of a curry and a rich dessert you had some crazy dream in the night and you know he said no no yo what kind of God called you your imagination no no who the creator of heavens and earth called me see the thing is it looked ridiculous to the neighbor but the neighbor didn't have the Revelation see Abraham had the Revelation and therefore he could walk in that Revelation and he knew if Jehovah God who made all things called him that same God can look after him every step of the journey and it should be the same thing with you and I friends that we should have such a confidence in God that God can lead us in every situation you may not know how you may not know when there may not be a time scale but with God that's irrelevant he wants you to walk in faith see many people want it all laid out before them but that's not Faith that's not a faith walk that's walking by a facts that's a carnal Man how he walks but we're spiritual people this morning amen hallelujah amen he will take care of us every step of the way he has not called us to leave us he will not abandon us on the side of the road amen but we're walking all the way up into glory and he's going to ensure that we get there Hallelujah amen now it says it says in Hebrews 6 and 1 the Apostle Paul is uh speaking about how we've got to leave a certain place and go to a deeper part of God now it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms of the laying on of hands of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this and this will we do of God permits now all of those things basically encapsulate all of the Christian faith there's repentance you know repentance from dead works and Faith towards God what does that repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost doctrine of baptisms water baptism right laying out of hands that's Divine Healing resurrection of the dead that's talking about you know the you know and you know end of Eternal judgment but he says we're going to go beyond this we can't just have this Foundation it can become a comfort zone you know many people come into the message they think all it is is God send a profit long hair long skirts long faces one God baptism in Jesus Christ's name that's not what it is at all as Jesus Christ revealed today he wants to live in you he wants to take this printed word and manifest it in your lives that's what the message is the message is declaring Christ is here to fulfill his word amen so weak so we're going to just go beyond just those things and go into the fullness of Christ see Paul is calling him let's not lay a foundation again the foundation's been laid but we're not neglecting a foundation because any decent Builder doesn't build a foundation when he's building a house leave that foundation and build the house somewhere else he builds the house exactly where he's laid the foundation right so you don't you don't abandon the foundation you build on that Foundation amen and we are a holy habitation unto the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen so when I say these things some people think well you're just neglecting the basics though actually with God there's no Basics it's all deep even basic things of baptism it's deep yeah right laying on of hands that's deep amen resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment those things are deep things but it depends how much you let God show you the depth of it yeah amen like I remember during our first lockdown before the first lockdown there was uh when I was at work there was a people were uh just had all these old books that they were just giving away and I picked up a book there that I read in my uh when I was about 10. I read about eight times the whole series and I thought I'm going to read this again and I read it and it was exactly the same as I remembered it nothing was added nothing was greater nothing it was just the same book but then when I pick up and and to me that showed me one thing this is not a normal book this is this is the word of God because you read it once you get something you read it again you get something else you read it again you get something more you read it again you get something more I could do that until the Rapture I could say that same phrase because it's true right because this is God's infallible word it is God and print form it's more than a novel more than a nice idea it is God in print form amen so you know it so so any like as I say there's nothing really basic with God you just let God reveal more of the depth of it and and he'll build the house Hallelujah so we need to go beyond the camp and go unto Perfection we need to go beyond the camp of where we are and go on and that Perfection we know is not a sinless Perfection because by one offering he has perfected them forever that has Sanctified the Bible says so that by that Perfection means a maturity it means growing up into a full full adult in the faith right amen he was also saying Hebrews if you know down that same chapter in verse 12 being be ye not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promises and that word followers means to be in uh you gotta um me and my dyslexia I can't read it but you gotta um I can't read it I've read it anyway you've got to basically copy what they do yeah there we go that's exactly what I just eat anyway you got to copy what they do but we're not actors right but if the same life that was in them comes into you you are copying what they do because the same life that was there will manifest in the same way in you it'll be a faith walk as as Paul would say in Romans 4 and 12 and the father of circumcision speaking of Abraham to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so there's so those who also walk in the steps of that faith that our Father Abraham had remember if he is the father of the faith then we'll walk in the same way if we're the children of that Faith Hallelujah so now God wants us to walk he doesn't want us just to stand still amen so there's a faith walk that we must walk we know we're not just here to you know I will I want to talk this morning on about zeroing in on the Promises of God uniting with them because we've got to unite with something you're right if we just Unite with where we are right now we'll stay there but if we Unite with every promise of God Amen God can manifest himself and we'll see those promises be fulfilled amen so we've got to stay see Abraham Abraham came to a spot where he only believed God he didn't consider his body dead he didn't consider the state of his wife it was impossible for Isaac but he United himself with that promise where God was more than able to give them the promised son Amen to that that was the walk that he walked right he had battles along the way he had troubles and strife and you know we're not immune from any of those things but those things really don't matter right those things actually don't matter amen we're looking at the promise Joe will have trouble but God will take you through the trouble sure will be you know we won't have any money in our bank accounts whatever may happen but God will take us through those things I mean but see God allows those things for us to actually seek him more and have a closer walk with him amen but to unite with a promise it means that you come to a place where you only believe that promise see see the on the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost there were 120 in the upper room yeah and they and Jesus told them to stay there until you're in Jew with power from on high until the Prophecies of Joel where God said he'll pour a spirit out upon All Flesh will be manifested amen so so remember in that time there were actually Pentecostal people outside because it was the Feast of Pentecost see somewhere in Jerusalem just because of a tradition well it's the Feast of Pentecost I should go up to Jerusalem this is what we do our parents did this so it became a tradition but to the 120 in the upper room it wasn't a tradition they had come to see the Fulfillment of the word but the thing is they had to they had to get rid of their own ideas and what they thought about everything and only take God in his word and then God came down when the day of Pentecost had fully come and he fulfilled that promise in their lives see some of them maybe they would have stood up maybe Andrew after about eight days or six days said well Brothers surely we've received it by faith because everything is received by faith and we believe that Jesus city of sin the promise of the comforter and here we are but you see no doubt Peter stood up and said Andrew that sounds all very very good I believe as well I know you're a Believer too but I need something to change me I need something to change me that when pressure comes against me I'll not fall and fail and deny the Lord like I did a few days ago see it's good to see the failure in your walk because if you see the failure in your walk you know that God can change you and take that failure out and give you Victory amen that's exactly what Peter he said he said yes I believe it but I need God to change me Hallelujah so that's why when the day of Pentecost fully came what'd they do they got rid of their reasoning they got rid of their ideas they got rid of their well I think it's going to happen this way until they sat there under expectation and then God came down and confirmed the promise in the emits Hallelujah but you see now we must always be willing to go beyond the camp Hallelujah see they got into a places on the day of Pentecost where it fully came it says they were of one they were all with one Accord in one place I mean many times you say they are one heart one mind and one Accord in one place so they had to get to a place where they were one Accord remember a lot of trouble had happened before that Judas had killed himself Peter was sitting there with his condemnation even though the Lord told him do you love me and all those things you know lots of trouble had happened but they had to lay aside all those things until they became in one Accord and that word won Accord it means to be unanimous amen it means to have it means to have one mind to be one Accord with one passion oh amen they they came into a position where they were of one mind what is that we're going to see God's word fulfilled right here in this church service we're going to see the prophecy become reality Amen in this church service we're going to see what's being laying on pages for hundreds of years or what's been in the message is gonna be put on flesh in you and I and that became their passion amen when you when you focus on the word of God everything else takes second place I mean when you really focus on it Lord you're more than able to fulfill this promise I mean everything else lays aside hallelujah amen like Brother Andy was saying you know we have a certain amount of affection but if you spread it everywhere they'll only be this much on the word of God but if you can take your affection from a whole bunch of nonsense in the world and place it on the word then what will that do your infection for the word will affection will increase then your expectation will increase what happening God will meet that expectation and fulfill it in your life who's with the who's with me this morning Hallelujah sometimes I feel like I'm going 100 miles an hour but hey this this is here I am we're running yes we're humming and we're running praise the Lord so see we've got to get to a place now see how see see it's the when we're gather right what are we here to do it's more than just have church I know you know all these things I'm preaching to the choir hello choir how are you today you know but we're here to see the Fulfillment of the word right every service we're here to see the Fulfillment of the word for God to come down and change your life for God to come down and minister to you and I and I say you and I because when I stand here I say Lord preach to me change my life Lord I don't want to leave those doors the same you know I had a real battle this week that was tough in here I'd wake up I was just feeling so angry and tense and you know and then you know I was talking with Christine about it and then we're talking about things that are going on not here but in other places and we're praying against spirits and things are happening and I and she said you know the devil really hates you I thought praise God it just took the anger out I just I just became happy I thought praise the Lord the reason that I feel this way is because that's how the devil feels towards me I thought praise the Lord the prophet said I hate him he hates me so you're allowed to hate someone that's the devil not your brother and sister not the person on the street not the person that's hurt you whatever more that's the devil you can hate Hallelujah so hey just Channel all of your hatred towards them and you know the best way to do that love the Lord worship God praise the Lord that's the best way amen hell doesn't mean you get all twisted and bitter in your spirit no you just love the Lord all them all Hallelujah Glory praise the Lord so you know if I've had that kind of week we're going to have this kind of a service Hallelujah because your devil may be fighting you all week praise the Lord but we're coming to church amen God's going to come on the scene Hallelujah if you think I'm crazy well I did lose my mind I got a new one the mind of Christ Hallelujah and I've been happy with that mind ever since praise the Lord amen if we can get everyone to believe it's unlimited what Jesus will do it is unlimited he is Unlimited in his ability he's Unlimited in his power amen there is nothing too hard for him amen he is the god of the impossible I mean we think there is no way he is the way I mean when the three Hebrew children were thrown into that fire they already made up their mind if we burn we burn but we're still not going to Bow amen and God said I can identify myself with those kind of Believers and the impossible stepped into the fire and they had a wonderful time of worship I doubt very much they just stood there like this all right there would have been a worship of Praise His Adonai El Shaddai has stepped into our furnace and then he stepped into my trial Amen in the very last minute he stepped in Hallelujah I think that's something to praise God about and then we've seen God Time After Time step into trouble amen and he stealed the water amen he's calm the sea he's taken us through many battles amen I think if we can just unite ourselves with that kind of a God Amen it's unlimited what Jesus Christ will do you know the prophet tells us that we must think of God as being unchangeable he said we must make God real unchangeable we know he's unchangeable right in our mind but in our hearts we must realize he is the great unchanging Jehovah God who became Jesus Christ so our lord Jesus is unchangeable in his ways he's unchangeable in his nature I mean he's unchangeable in his ability amen because he's the all-powerful one so there's many times we see him and we can Rejoice what he's done for us in the past but in the present trial that we're in we're saying Lord how's this ever going to happen but if we realize he's unchanging amen and the same faith that he gave you back there and he's actually increased it from the time you got here there to here amen that same God can step upon the scene and manifest himself in your battle you're in right now remember Abraham the more he walked with God the greater challenges he faced all right yeah I remember he had the Armor's servants and go get locked they had all kinds of troubles goes on and you know but the thing is the more the more he walked with God the greater the battle became but the more he walked with God the more faith he he actually accumulated as he walked with God so remember God never comes to a battle and he's going to be defeated he never ever comes to a battle and says this is too big this is too hard I cannot do it no God raises the faith that your faith is more than able to overcome amen and we know faith is a revelation right amen faith is a it's revealed to you it's not a human understanding her idea it's it's a revelation yes yes Hallelujah just like just like David he was a Shepherd there and he killed the lion and then killed the greater enemy a bear and so what happens is Faith was increasing because he could look back at what God had done and he realized God was unchangeable to the same God There Was the Same God that was with him in the valley to fight Goliath and he had a revelation I can destroy this enemy why because I am a circumcised Son of God I'm standing in my inheritance and this enemy has to move amen he United himself with a promise where God told them one will chase a thousand two or chase ten thousand because he told he told Goliath and the armies of the Philistines he said I'm going to feed all your carcasses to the birds all right and I believe he could have done it one man could have killed one one teenage boy who's 15 here who's 16. anyone can you stand yeah stand up see his brother Kidder here we go that's kind of an age God bless you both this kind of an age walked into the army and his older brother say you're just naughty you're just here to you know you just want to see a battle and all these things these kind of an age stepped in and got mad at the Devil why is no one accepting this challenge why is no one doing this think you may have your seats you God bless you know teenage young person walks in and rallies the old generation rallies the whole church and says God gave me victories in the past I have a covenant with my God this uncircumcised Philistine has no promise with my God and he's going down Hallelujah praise a lot he's the same yesterday today and forever I remember the thing is we're gonna we're gonna come to a place where we unite ourselves with every promise now brother Brown says and works as Faith expressed he says no longer no matter how long it takes it's gonna happen he's speaking about when Isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive did you know it was 800 years before that happened God for knew the woman who who should be what her name was and and where that seed would fall into do you believe that sure he did and from a little literal womb will come forth this great miracle God knew about it he just revealed it to his Prophet who is faithful and spoke the word even uh without even thinking about uh what it was he just said it he never tried to reason it out if you try to reason it out what if this man this woman or this man here or somebody else try to reason now I've been crippled all these years the doctor says there's not a possible chance well there might not be as far as he knows that's true but if something can tear away them weeds so if something can tear away that which is choking faith if God by his grace not the preacher not anyone else but God can place into your heart of Revelation that I'm going to be well there isn't nothing going to keep you sitting there there's nothing can hold you there you're going to be well but until that does happen you're going to sit right there where the doctor says that you're going to sit until that happens it has to be revealed it's the grace of God that reveals it amen so if something can tear away them weed see a lot of promises in the Bible just stay up at our head it can be done he's our healer he's our provider he's our savior he will save my children all these things can be up in him but there's weeds of reasoning and doubt that that can choke the promise of God but he says if something can tear away them weeds then the Revelation can anchor into the heart and then God can begin to move who wants a revelation there's many promises I mean we could sit here unless all the promises of God and and all the promises of God are for you amen not just some of them all every promise in the word is for you for this age amen so but many times you say yes that's a nice thing amen but it's mental Faith it's got to become a revelation so now how do we how do we get rid of the weed see because see if there's a promise you read and you have need of don't just read it and say well it's a nice promise seek the Lord with all your heart till it becomes a revelation see ask seek knock you shall receive that's what the Lord said Heaven that seeketh find him that asketh not just ask asketh it shall be opened right so and we know faith is a revelation it's not in here it anchors down in your heart anchors down your soul and we know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so if we want to unite ourselves with every promise we need all the weeds pulled out right so in order for the weeds to be pulled out then faith has to take a hold amen so so you've got to give God something to work with amen see you've got to feed your experience until it becomes a revelation who's following me this morning amen because because remember we want to unite ourselves not with reasoning not with doubt not with what our five senses declare but I want to unite ourselves with the promise of God Amen so in order to do that we're going to take out something's got to take out all of them weeds so now if you're sick for example a great way for God to tear them weeds of reasoning and doubt away is to find every healing testimony you can find right and what does it do it begins to build faith I mean you take every every promise of healing in the Bible and just begin to meditate upon those things amen it'll go from in your head down into your heart amen if you you know if you have need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you take God at his word and you find every instance in the Bible where they receive the Holy Ghost then you look into what the blood of Jesus Christ has already done for you and take every testimony you can find of people really meeting the Lord and it will build your faith right because whatever you focus on that's what you'll become amen so if you focus on those things amen focus on the good then God can step in and manifest it Hallelujah see it's whatever you're going through I'll guarantee there's a testimony on the Earth that someone has walked the steps you're you're walking maybe not exact details but there's but there will be someone that's already walked away that you've walked before and what will that do that will build that will build Faith so if it's a disease someone's already fought it remember Jesus has conquered it right if it's a financial need someone's already gone through it if it's salvation of your family someone's already gone through it I'm in marriage trouble trouble at work whatever it may be fine testimonies amen that that applied to your stories in the Bible and what it'll do it'll pull the weeds of reasoning and doubt away and and revelation will drop it who wants to have that kind of a walk I mean we're so focused Lord this is the battle I'm facing but Lord I know you have the answer you are the answer to this trouble and Lord I'm going to seek you with all my heart until the Anchor's not in my mind because if it's in your mind then reasoning can come in worry and doubts and troubles can come in and Cloud it up but if it anchors down in your heart it doesn't matter what you're facing doesn't matter what the symptoms if God said so it's going to happen then you can rest in that amen and go rejoicing that God is going to answer Hallelujah amen like you take like George mule I was thinking about you know providing financial needs you know I just I just Wikipedia to him he was the he was one of the founders of the um uh Brethren and different things but you know he he felt led to open an orphanage this is in England and um he cared for during his lifetime 10 000 and 24 orphans and he and he provided education opportunities for the orphans to the point where he he was even Accused by some of raising the poor above their natural station and British life is that how the devil works yeah you're living beyond your station that's what the devil says about you about the bride of Christ she's living beyond her station she has no right to be joint heirs with our lord Jesus I mean but God wants you to be joining us with him I mean I said George Mueller see he opened 117 schools that offer Christian education to more than 120 000 students and it was all by faith many times there'd be nothing on the table but he'd have the table set and and you know they'll be praying thanking God for the food that wasn't even there and when he said amen there was a knock on the door someone said I've outlined to give you this that means there's many times of prayer but it was in his heart I want to do this for the people so God can supply any need it can look impossible but you think about ten thousand twenty four orphans 117 schools 120 000 students that's incredible and if he you know if he can do that by faith back in the day he lived how much more you and I living in this age amen you say well I'd like a um I want something from the Bible to prove about listening to testimonials will raise your faith okay the woman with the blood issue had never had a single person before of a testimony of someone touching the hymn of Jesus garment being healed but something anchored into her heart if I can just get to that man and I can just touch the hymn of his government I don't even need to ask him permission I don't even need to have a conversation tell him I need all I needed to do is touch the hymn of His Garment and then I'll be made well Hallelujah so and we know what happened the blood as you stopped now that's in that's in Matthew 9. now in Matthew 14 when Jesus goes across the sea it says that the men when they were and when the men that of that place had knowledge of him they sent out all into that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only Touch the Hem of His Garment and as many as touched were perfectly made whole so what happened the testimony of the woman with the blood issue spread and then when Jesus turned up they said hey if the law can do it for her they can do it for us amen so what happened that testimony ignited faith and the people got the same results as the woman before them Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I when you look at a testimony that's why it's very important go through this go through the discernment lines there'll be needs there that you're facing that God answered there and if you realize that he is unchangeable in his ways and in his nature and it's the same Faith they had you receive you can get the same thing amen because remember we have the same faith are we Believers this morning I mean do we have a do we believe in the finished work of calvary I mean brother Brown said that is the key that unlocks every Divine promise faith in the finished work doesn't matter what you're facing faith in that finished work will bring it to pass amen but let God anchor it into your heart Unite with the promise don't Unite with your history with your past with your doubts with your troubles even what you're going through right now don't meditate upon those things meditate on the Promises of God because remember he is a god of the present he's The Great I Am he's not the I was or the will be he's The Great I Am he is present here Amen to meet every need I believe that this morning Hallelujah but you see now we've got to go beyond beyond our camp we go beyond our camp of just going through the motions yeah yeah amen we need to be willing be be willing to lay aside things from the past yeah yeah you know I'm um so when David was anointed king over Israel remember they just had Civil War they had civil war between between you know Judah and Benjamin and then the rest of Israel right because there was still Saul's house there and there was David right there's after Saul died but they had to lay aside those differences they had to go beyond the camp of what just happened and remember Israel was eye for an eye tooth for a tooth so no doubt when their brother was killed in battle and this happened they said I'm going to settle that score and that's what happened to Abner remember joab killed her murdered him in a time of Peace why because he wanted to settle the score but they had to lay aside all those things in order to anoint David King they had to go beyond the camp see it's it's so see shamgar had to come to a place where he realized he was a circumcised son of Abraham that he had to go beyond the camp of just being of of just letting the devil come and the Philistines come in and take his Harvest so he had to go beyond the camp of world this is just a season look we've harvested all these crops now now next on the agenda is it's going to be taken from us he had to go beyond the camp of the blessing being stolen it should be the same thing with you and I many times we get a blessing in church and the devil wants to try and take it from us we're going to put an end to that amen with the atmosphere that we Kevin Church of rejoicing loving God that atmosphere should go home with us I mean that should continue church should be every day doesn't mean you stand and preach you'll sing by just your life you live should be be a worship to God Amen says but the thing is you need the we need the right atmosphere to unite to the promise we didn't we don't need an atmosphere of moodiness amen we may be Moody's well we're human right I know I ask every question that every week and some of you say yes I'm still human others have gone to a Next Level right but right so there'll be times when we're grumpy there'll be times where we're Moody but we're gonna we're gonna go beyond those atmospheres see our feelings should not dictate to us our Victory amen right faith faith gives us Victory Faith gives us overcoming power it's not if we feel it it's not if we think it it's do we believe it see many people are lit remember this world has led by their feelings whatever feels good do it and there's no restrictions nowadays if I feel like a woman I'm a woman it feels good I'm excited or if I'm not I'm a man or whatever more you know but whatever I feel to do I can just do but we shouldn't be led by our feelings we should be led by the Lord by his word amen and you've got to realize if you're feeling Moody you're feeling grumpy it's a devil trying to ward off the blessings of God out of your life see because God wants us to be happy he wants us to be at peace he wants us to be happy in our hearts amen rejoicing in spite of the circumstances Hallelujah see that's why we've got to get rid of that and come into an atmosphere of Faith to unite with the promise of God well how do you get into that kind of atmosphere what you think upon will become the atmosphere so if you think about what brother sister blah blah did to you you know and hurt you and this person hurts you this person did this it's going to create an atmosphere around you you're not going to be happy and loving everyone you're going to be shelled up hurt and and and Bob sticking out right but then if you begin to think about how good the Lord is and what he's done for you and where he's called you from and every time he's answered prayer and your own testimony you'll go from grumpiness and moodness to you you'll be rejoicing Hallelujah all the weight of the world will fall off your shoulders because you realize if my God called me he's going to keep me amen of my God save me he can't lose me amen and if he saved me he's going to save my family because the Bible said so amen so we already have the victory Hallelujah amen and what that is what does that do create the atmosphere of atmosphere of Faith yeah yeah what does it do pull all the weeds out amen it gives us see it gives us an atmosphere of unity with the promise he says in wisdom versus faith says you've got to believe you've got to believe it then that falls into an atmosphere of faith and it's got to produce it it's just got to so if you have an atmosphere of Faith around you it's got to produce what you're believing for amen see the Lord produced I mean he he see we have to realize that if we're in an atmosphere maybe we're facing a depression or some mood and or something you know you just feel down all the time you know the there's a greater one that can stop you being bound into that I remember when I was in I think it's year 10 they call it these days fourth form as a boarding school and one of my friends told a lie on me that was my birthday and apparently on your birthday you get thrown into the swimming pool in your full uniform so he said it it's his birthday so four guys grab me picked me up took me to the school swimming pool threw me in we had to wear stuff like this for school it wasn't my birthday but you see I could not in My Own Strength break that light break the effect of that lie to be free you see but we have one greater because if the devil's telling you you're never going to make it it's not gonna happen this is just how life is you know that person's never yet saved you'll never have Victory you're never going to overcome this what is that that's a lie and if you believe that lie you get it you get Bound by it just like I was picked up by my school friends you see but if I had one greater than me there I could say no that's a lie it's not my birthday and those boys would have had to drop me and I would never be thrown into the pool amen so you've got to realize we've got one greater than ourselves or all the lives that the enemy tells us in our minds that can break us of those things Hallelujah isn't that wonderful thank you praise the Lord now people say things are safe we need to go beyond safety I'm just going to come back to the store that I'm going to that I'm going to finish now the danger of every age is when God moves in a powerful way then fear Creeps in it says how can we keep this brother bam says in the church age book he says a few moments ago I mentioned John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God in first John 5 3 he says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word one little deviation from that word was to step away from Christ people saying they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they are in that word living in it walking in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died some people say they love God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church something's happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so subtly that you don't see it they don't they haven't made a big move bigger move so you can see it out there in the open but it's undercover and they're bringing it by way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it get back to Pentecost before it's too late but as usual guy people don't heed God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit so blessed that a little Fair Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in a Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your Creed of what you believe put it in a church manual they do it they organize they add to the word they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life it's not what we say about the word that counts but it's what God Said So there's a fair creeps and how do we keep the fire burning on well let's basically put a full stop behind what we believe that's basically a church manual so so what happens it becomes a camp it becomes a full stop and people and people can't move on it's good intentions because we want to see God keep moving right I'm glad some of you love him Hallelujah I know the rest of you do too amen but you know you see but but we don't just want to put a full stop around where we are we want to keep walking with the word I mean just like you know Moses would plead with God lord if your presence may your presence always go with us amen don't leave us amen if we found Grace you know if I found Grace in thy sight show me show me how thy way I may Know Thee if I found Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation thy people and he said my presence will go with you and I'll give thee rest and he said If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence so basically God wherever you are I want to keep moving I don't just want to stand here and stay here in the desert here and then you keep going and then you know oh I don't just want to keep going on and you don't go with us amen so this is where this fear comes and how can we keep this protected and then people say this is how it should be and then that's it and they don't move with the revelation of the word see a very easy way to look at this is if you just take music for example some just say stay with the old songs and think that they are the only Godly songs to sing that they are safe they are safe and The Godly songs amen some of the old songs are inspired right Amen to some people say stay with those and they say well you know the newer songs they're all actually evil there's a spirit of rock and roll on them and then that spirit will come into the church and then some say well you know drums is an instrument of evil just playing a drum brings a demon spurred into the church but brother Bram never condemned the particular instrument yeah he never condemned a certain thing you know if we want to condemn an instrument actually rock and roll started on the piano yeah and then if you take the the very formal dead churches it's the organ I remember you know I was a boarding school in King's College they had a they had a literal pipe organ in their Chapel and that thing would really play had the massive pipes everything but you see it's all formal and dead and Powerless that's a dead religious spirit that's controlling that there sorry should we get rid of that should we get rid of the piano because that's where Rock and Roll start a boogie woogie didn't start on there it started here yeah yeah see but people who say it's safe say we should keep that and get rid of that and they don't understand it's actually the people playing it that actually makes it a certain way amen it's the it's the it's the person playing it brings the spirit yeah amen it's not the particular instrument at all because brother Ramsey I'd rather be beating the drum of the Salvation Army on the street corner and having God live that have a big fire and fancy church and everyone's fussing and fight against during see what does it produce see amen so you know but some people say well the older way is just safe and we shouldn't we shouldn't have these things but really you've got to look at now what fruit is the worship producing you know because we can have the finest Church the finest instruments the finest musicians the finest singers but if but but if everyone is separated everyone's in their clicks they won't talk to one another there's no forgiveness there's business and strife something's very wrong amen and then and then if we are that way we should go back to the street corner we should go back there to Sea View where we're worshiping in a building where there be buckets of water literally come through the come through the ceiling and you know it's freezing cold and you know amen if God was there we should stay where God is thankfully I believe God has come with us right or we have come with him Hallelujah you see it's by by a fridge now people say you know drums are wrong well actually the timbrel or the tambourine began as a as a drum a hand drum it says in the Jewish encyclopedia it says that the it's it's at the timbrel or the tambourine originally in Bible days was was more of a hand drum and it was in Jewish music of that era the timber was actually used for rhythm as opposed to the melody so it kept the Rhythm and the Assyrians and the Egyptians also used it so just because the Egyptians and syrians used it do you think we should throw it away right but it was actually used for rhythm all there than it was today the temporal is an instrument which is its whole character is inappropriate for more mournful occasions so we're not here to have a funeral March right so so if we want to have a dead church and it'll be a funeral March we should get rid of the timbrel the drums that's what it evolved into it started as a hand drum now it's on a stand yeah right so we should get rid of it if we're here for a mournful occasion but I'm not here for a mournful occasion I have eternal life I'm going to heaven I'm going in a Rapture he's redeeming by his blood that's not what I've done it's what he has already done for me that's what I rejoice in I rejoice in the god of my salvation amen I'm not here to be mournful and weep and cry because everything's falling apart no I Rejoice because God is greater than the problem I mean God is the solution to every problem see that's why it's inappropriate for a mournful occasion amen but in keeping only with cheerful songs and games such as accompanying weddings this is from the Jewish encyclopedia we should this is a wedding time you come to a wedding twice a week if you come twice a week hello what's a union between Christ and his bride I mean that's what churches meant to be it's for popular rejoicings so so for example the reception of a Victorious General lift up your hands all your Gates of the king of glory shall come in Hallelujah he's the Victorious Mighty conqueror that conquered hell death in the grave so he should play the timbrel why because our Kings come to town hallelujah amen it's for banquets hey man we're having a banquet of the word hallelujah hallelujah don't just look at the food eat the food don't just look at the drinks table become one with the drinks table Hallelujah you'll enjoy it real good I mean religious religious festivals of a joyful and a popular character Hallelujah see what happens though is people say no it's not safe because of what the world has done with it yeah I'm sure some of you have seen videos that very fundamental conservatives churches put out and they and they show the evils of this music and you know how we should just not have drums we should just have strings and different things like this but then my question was if that's really the case then why on Earth are they still in their denomination because Jesus said when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth now we know music brings an anointing right it's not entertainment if you listen to music for an entertainment you need to look beyond that because because music either brings God or the devil down or the devil up rather because the devil is not up he's down right so so that's what music in the Bible does is what music in this world does it brings an anointing and then whatever the anointing is on that music will be manifested in the people so so if if if there's a correct way to play and the correct music to have instruments to have and if they have it then why are they denominational because of the spirit of Truth which is the Holy Ghost comes down in their worship the wood would open they'd say let's get out of this dead Place let's embrace the full word but they're still stuck in that sea so it goes beyond just having what they call the right instruments yeah amen and then they also say well worldly Tunes doesn't matter if there's Christian words on it we'll actually bring a devil into a church as well and if you do that even if you're sincere you're being deceived well brother Bram loved the song down from his glory who loves that song down from his glory every living story do you know the tune where'd that tune come from it was an Italian love song is the tune so if they are right then then the prophet was wrong so you're going to look Beyond these things but you see it's safe to stay with the old now I'm not saying get rid of the old I love the old songs I love some of the new songs some of the new songs I don't care for yeah right but as brother Isaac said years ago well we'll do it as a special if God anoints it we'll keep singing it if it kind of I know what the word you use but if it didn't work we'd just throw it out and and I think that's a good way of looking at it if God amends the song Praise the Lord we want him to keep amening I mean but if he doesn't well praise God we can move on from there amen but you see the devil attacks worship because he knows if a people really get into worship into the spirit of worship not just singing songs but into the spirit of praise and worship and they forget about themselves and forget about their battles and their problems and they worship the law with all their heart then the Lord steps down because remember he inhabits the Praises of his people amen so when you begin to praise God sure you may have had the worst week of your life the worst year of your life the worst decade of your life but if you walk into the prince of God you begin to praise Him amen then God begins to inhabit that praise Hallelujah he begins to step in and say I'm going to worship with them and then the atmosphere begins to change Hallelujah and the devil knows if the people get into that kind of a condition anything can happen I mean because God is Unlimited in his ability amen he can do anything in that kind of an atmosphere anything can happen there's no telling what our Lord will do when the moment Jesus gets a hold of you Hallelujah so you've got to read that's why the devil attacks worship I mean because he knows that the people if we get into that kind of state then you know prayer goes up gifts begin to manifest answers come peace comes the Holy Ghost comes down you know Paul and Silas are in the inner prison they're beating their feet in stocks but then they begin to look but then they begin to unite with a promise I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee I'll be with thee to the End of the Age the world may seeth me no more but ye shall see me and then Paul would say yo Silas I saw him on the road to Damascus hey man I didn't see him before that but I saw him and he changed my life and so I'll say you know Paul I remember the day Jesus met me Hallelujah I'm so glad that he's alive and and there may be signs to say to Paul Paul what's your favorite song Oh My yeah down from his glory well I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I wasn't in the upper room but the same God in the upper room was the same God in the road to Damascus Hallelujah they begin to sing they begin to praise when the atmosphere beginner change in the prison they forgot they were in prison and God came down and shook the place amen and every prison door came open Hallelujah so everyone that was bound became free because two men began to praise God you say well that's just for natural prisons no no we don't need natural prison bars to come open this morning we need spiritual change to be broken we need spiritual bars to be broken in the name of Jesus Christ amen so if you you can create an atmosphere you know the Welsh Revival started by one young young person young sister go up and say I love the Lord with all my heart then God came down and started a Revival over a hundred thousand Souls came to the kingdom because one young sister stood up and said I love the Lord with all my heart and God came down in power Hallelujah he's the same one today we can have that kind of river we could have that kind of Revival why we can have it the devil says no you can't I say yeah we can I mean our God can do anything amen we can have a time where God can move in such power like never before Hallelujah why because he's the god of the impossible amen so what everything begins to manifest I mean when we begin to worship God holla you know I found the greatest joy in prayer recently was telling God how great he is and what he means to me I found the greatest blessing if you can't think of you may feel dead as a post you may feel like what's the use of praying you begin to tell God how great he is and what he means to you it'll change the atmosphere in your prayer I mean you'll begin to pray to begin to flow you begin to have such a wonderful time then maybe it starts to get a bit hard again you start to tell God how great he is again it comes down again Hallelujah and that's what Jesus told us to do Our Father which out in heaven Hallowed be thy name yes why because he gave the model for the model yeah he gave the model prayer right so it doesn't matter what you're going through just begin to tell God how great he is and you'll find him come on the scene like never before Hallelujah every Revival through history has had its own songs written that's why we can't just stay with the old songs we've got to keep let God bring forth manifest the Revival and song amen David would say this Praise You the Lord praise God in the sanctuary this is Psalms 150. Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty Acts he's done so much hasn't he friends he's done Mighty things Among Us Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the pulsory in the harp praise him with the Timberland the dance amen praise him with a string instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols hallelujah praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything at hath breath praise ye the Lord amen to he says make it you know we should play skillfully amen but he says yo make a loud noise basically praise the Lord amen give him glory amen he says I'll praise the Lord at all times Good Times bad times I'll praise the Lord what does that do it makes you Unite with the promise I mean when we begin to praise God we can Unite with every single promise amen if we come one mind one heart one Accord one passion brother Ram says it's unlimited what Jesus will do Hallelujah so I believe this morning we can have that kind of a time amen see the devil fights our worship but I say no devil if you don't like it we're going to do it again just like McCall you know you know we're watching David the other side and sound playing you know David's dancing before the ark and all these things and of course you know and you know it's just like in the Bible McCall there who is the daughter of Saul who's married to David looks out the window and disdains him here's the king of Israel and he's and he's dancing before God half naked before everyone rejoicing remember she was a king's daughter she knew what ceremony was like right she had seen it before but this just seemed out of order to her all right this just seemed out of this just seemed out of out of step with what her dad did but you see Saul was a previous generation now was a new dispensation I mean where God wasn't just there a little bit but they were going to take every Divine promise everything that Moses promised them or God promised through Moses then they were going to actually fulfill it when David became king so so maybe the ceremony looked similar but David just seemed a little bit out of but then God looked down and saw David said David you're a man after my own heart now look because what God saw in his mind was now manifested upon the Earth here's someone who really Praises me with all their heart they don't care what's going on around them they don't care that they should be dignified the king whatever or no the ark is coming into the city I mean God's presence is coming into the city Hallelujah God has given us a capital and we can praise His great name Hallelujah so don't despise it dance along and there's no telling what our God will do Hallelujah you ever need this morning Worship the Lord You've Got trouble Worship the Lord amen your unanswered questions worship the law you have a need or you don't you don't know the way forward Worship the Lord and see what he'll do see what he'll show you amen God is Unlimited in this place I believe hallelu let's have the musicians this morning amen we can praise God this morning can't we yes Hallelujah amen there's not there's no telling what our God will do Hallelujah see if we let go see it's safe to stay reserved it's a safe thing to stay reserved has this not been announced oh okay I wasn't here happy birthday Joshua God bless you I think God bless you amen Margaret and Claire God bless you welcome Hallelujah amen happy birthday say happy birthday praise the Lord but you see now there's no telling CeCe the devil makes people think it's safe to stay reserved people are afraid to actually surrender to the Holy Ghost they're actually afraid that's why people that's why people actually speak against the gifts because the gifts require a full surrender for God to come down and use that person you see they say well let's just keep Church order no church order is actually a full surrender to the Holy Ghost and let God begin to move and that's why he fights worship because if we can get beside ourselves forget about our problems and what else going on what people are doing around us and worship God then God can come down and manifest himself how he wants amen amen praise the Lord let's um let's stand who's who's ready to go beyond the camp amen say Lord I want to go beyond the camp of my comfort zone and what people say and this and that more I want to go unto you Lord I want to walk with you in the power of your Resurrection Lord Jesus amen amen let's um how about how about let's um sing that song
