last night i was really encouraged by it and as [Applause] [Music] and i was especially just pleased to see that i'm not the only one that cries behind the pulpit the one thing that really stood out to me was when he was talking about [Music] them gathered in the upper room and when pentecost and the fire fell down for some reason i've always known the scripture but i've always thought of it as a little group probably because i thought of the 12 disciples but i've always known it was 120 people that just struck me because when we were preparing for the meetings last week brother moses told us there was going to be 120 and it's morning time it's the same time that they were gathered so we'll invite him to come and touch us this morning as he touched them back then [Applause] so how about we

morning meet the needs of your people we are hungry and we are thirsty so we look to thee lord thanking you this morning in jesus name amen god bless you can we just turn to the word of god we want to just turn to first corinthians chapter 2 it's good to be here this morning it's an honor amen i don't know brother moses why you want to use an old fold at me you've got all the young men here rather i i don't feel at home i feel a bit out of place here all these young men i was i was sitting out there and i was watching this pulpit and i was wondering and i saw these young men jumping up and jumping down and i was wondering how am i going to make that next time you put a little block here brother i'm not 86 i'm 87. uh kidding kidding only kidding i'm i'm still very young amen amen it's just life has been treating me badly that's why i look like this so i just want to read a scripture as found in the book of first corinthians chapter six now i don't know i don't know really what god wants me this morning but i just felt that i was going to speak on a thought but i felt that we can't have a resurrection morning service without speaking of what has transpired 2000 years ago this particular day so i just want to read the scripture in verse six i think it is yeah ii corinthians first corinthians chapter two verse 6 how be it we speak wisdom amongst them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world know of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in the mystery even the hidden wisdom of god which which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they had known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory and the devil only knew if only the devil knew what he unleashed when he crucified christ he never would have done it amen never like brother ron spencer normally would say blue devil will god bless you you may be seated in the presence of god we have indeed been blessed by the ministry of the word the young men amen that came before and uh just encouraged us and spoke to our hearts and taz was speaking on friday about the holy spirit versus enticing spirits and uh he mentioned how brother branham spoke about it was a test of strength amen uh it was like a tug of war brother branham says it was uh one party on this side and one party on that side and and you remembered how we spoke about the how the indians you to make a fire in the middle and put the rope across it and then you pull from the side and amen and i was just so encouraged it was a contest between the believer and satan and that contest is still today taking place every day right now while you are sitting in church this morning you have a battle in your mind that enemy is fighting you telling you to block out what god wants to tell you and then it's again god telling you open your mind allow me to minister to you uh so it's a contest amen and and and and daz was speaking of this great strength of god in the church i tell you this morning let us not make god a small little god don't try and bring god into your little square my god is greater than that my god is greater much greater than that amen so don't let us put god in a square and try to get god to move according to you tell god dance to my tune you you tell god it's got to happen this away but let's allow my god allow my god amen hallelujah to just move in your situation and i thank god tells me he said you know that that uh brother by the grace of god and by the power and the strength of god that we will pull satan into his own fire hallelujah so you can help me this morning amen as we pull the enemy into that very fire that is made and designed for me and for you amen and then brother andy my word from disappointment to divine appointment praise the lord amen hallelujah my my you might have been disappointed all your life you might have had some bad deals you might have but i want to let you know this this weekend amen that all your disappointments aiming that in the past don't hold on to it let it go man let it go let god his appointment today amen meet with you change your life brother what's that word you use rapturing-ness or something oh my god can't even get my tongue around that rapturousness is that it praise the lord amen so we thank i learned the new word brother andy god bless you so we thank god maybe this morning amen we can turn away a man from the tomb that we've been looking at and we can turn and we can see rabboni hallelujah may that be this morning your experience amen look away from your disappointments look away from your human failures look away amen from the bad news boys amen and let us this morning look master mary might we hear this morning calling us by our names and my what how thankful we are this morning brother kubin amen we all have a story yes sir we we all have a story amen hallelujah if we should start talking about our stories then you will realize why we love him so much why and i want to say this morning to you young people don't go out there and try amen to have a testimony by going to the world and and get and and want to say right i've now come back with a testimony don't go there hallelujah don't go there amen just because you want to experience a minute i can stand also and talk about a testimony don't go there hallelujah stay on god's ground if you go on satan's ground you are going to lose that is guaranteed you are going to lose he is not obligated to you if you are not in the path of duty now we knew you were going to fail he knew you were going to make mistakes but brother make your mistakes and your failures in the path of duty but don't move off the part of duty is not obligated to you and to me but as long as we stay in the park of duty brother hallelujah he will always be there he said brother branham says he will nudge you he will push you when you offline when you're out of line he will push you he will nudge you he will pull you to get you back in line but if you are not on the path in the path of duty and you stray he is not obligated his grace will reach out but is not obligated because you are not in the path of duty so this morning we want to for a few minutes we just want to i want to see if i can get to my little thought if not so brother moses you'll have to invite me to come and minister my little thought hallelujah so this morning we realized what a what a season we are at uh amen the bride of jesus christ we we hear so many you know especially now with russia invading ukraine you you so here so many stories so many posts and quotes and prophecies and all coming forth but you know i was just thinking to myself man if all these things are happening and people are pointing to the rapture where ought we to be as a bride we ought we to be as the bride of jesus christ if all these things are happening and we see scriptures being fulfilled where must the bride be there should be no barriers there should be no funny feelings there should be no oughts how can there be any oughts if we're going in a rapture how can you have any odds if you are going to spend time with me hallelujah living in a dream my brother or my sister we need to come back to realities and realize if all these things are happening around us what kind of a people ought we to be in our walk in our talk in our behavior in our conduct realizing that we are talking about adoption of body change the rapture then what kind of a people ought we to be this morning hallelujah i don't know if they if you are there yet with brother branham where the bible says uh do good to them they do evil to you are you are you there amen do good to them that stab you in the back do you do good to them that criticize you are you there yet praise the lord so i'm talking i'm not talking to angels this morning then amen so if you are an angel this morning with your wings like that then drop your wings we we are human amen we are human so we just want to say this morning church we are living in the most exciting hour and time amen the rapture i said to the church the other day i challenged myself and the church and i said to the church in the condition that you are right now are you ready to meet god in the condition that you are right now are you ready to meet him and i had to face facts in my own life i had to look in the mirror of the word and i had to say god you got to help me that i might be ready hallelujah i can't i can't jump on the phone and try and get to you brother i can't i can't i've got to be living expecting he's coming my life in order my relationship with my wife my relationship with my children brother it's got to be according to the world and and none of us can can can do that it's got to be god coming in me and you and god living that life in me and in you we can do nothing fulfilling the word impossible but we can allow him when he steps in behind your flesh he will live the life he will forgive he will rather say god bless you you can't do it especially if somebody has done you dirt but we're so thankful so now we want to just talk a little bit about friday and up till today leading up to today and i don't have a watch brother you better give me a watch you you it's better if you give me a watch it's better if you give me a watch brother just show time out there brother and just show time but anybody there if you think i'm going beyond an hour just show time out amen and i'll walk off gracefully so yeah we we we're just so happy brother moses really to be here this weekend it's been such a tremendous blessing meeting all the friends and as you said brother moses you know we we uh you you you didn't want to invite because you knew the place amen but we are praying and trusting god amen that this what started this weekend the brother moses it will continue we will keep the channel of communication open that we can have these type of fellowships and have these times together because it's not the people that is keeping the people apart if it's not the people then who is it if it's not no no don't tell me it's the devil who is in keeping the people apart praise the lord oh oh dazzle [Laughter] and as a fact brother god's people want fellowship god's people want fellowship god's people want fellowship but brother [Applause] it's the pastors thank god i'm not one of them i want fellowship brother hello i want to that's why many times you get little misses on your phone just saying hello to you say hello to a pastor god bless you this morning as you minister we try to keep the brother the channel of communication open and god will bless you because brother the bible says islam i think 133 he says there god had commanded the blessing when brethren to dwell together in unity hallelujah and god only god can bring that unity when we come under one headshot under one brother with the hedge of the word christ it only then not human togetherness because it's going to fall apart by and by but when i become the word and you become the word and we're all under one hatred it is then when we have divine fellowship one with the other so brother branham says in demonology so between friday and this morning i i just want to read what has transpired there and i trust god that you might be enthused and blessed and touched this morning amen bible the brother branham says in uh demonology he says watch him he says bear with me just a minute he says if you are like what brother brandon says here if you can stand some of this old-time sogum molasses and hickory smoked hem what a what what what a description of a ham he says sogam old time sodom molasses and hickory smoked ham he says look down he is now on the cross he is now saying father i commit my spirit into thine hands now he gives up the ghost brother branham says and the bible says and he went and he preached to the souls that were imprisoned he was still hanging brother he died he was still hanging but now the soul went down amen and preached to the souls that were imprisoned he says what is it this follows here and he speaks about the mrs piper uh a medium she she broke into this realm amen and and and now brother branham says he's this this realm that that mrs piper broke into the souls that were imprisoned that repented not in the long suffering of of god in the days of noah when the ark was prepared he says i can see him let's dramatize this i can see him coming down into this first dimension of lost souls and brother branham knocks at the door open up the door now listen to this that wailing mess of beautiful woman richard hags men all screaming and crying torment oh if i could only get out of here i said to the church the other day i said there are many many in that area that would want to exchange seats with you and i this morning give me one more chance give me one more opportunity can we exchange seats church may god help us don't let us get there and they were crying oh if we could only get out of here knocked at the door the door swung open and there stood the son of the living god in a celestial body and he said i am the son of god that enoch said would come with ten thousand of his saints i'm the one that noah spoke of i'm the woman seed from the garden of eden oh my when he saw what sun did to adam and eve and as he pronounced his judgment over them brother branham says i see i see how adam and eve even and he's got his arms slung around her and as adam's tears were dropping and running and intermingling with eve's tears as they walk out brother branham says god god god saw such love displayed between adam and eve that he said he called them he said stop i'm bringing you back i'm bringing you back you are coming back and yeah brother branham says brother he says brother he said the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent and here we see brother branham says i'm the one that noah spoke of i'm the woman seed from the garden of evens even the heavens had just the heavens with the shaking and the rolling and the thundering has just testified of me judas has just testified of me the roman soldier testified of me the father testified of me now you've got to know that i am here to fulfill the word of god hallelujah and every demon knew he was there oh one day when he was on earth they screamed and hollered they said we know who you are the holy one of god they knew him even if preachers didn't they demonic powers knew who he was can you this morning understand why the devil is after you he's got some some special demons that's designed for you brother for me designed that study me that study you that know our weaknesses that know our frailties and they are watching and they are dis analyzing you and brother branham says they will know you they know you they know you they know the one that's just fooling and they know the one who's really mean business hallelujah when you get out satan those demonic powers will tell god don't send me to that oh i've had some bad experiences there don't send me there not to that school not to that university [Music] not to that church [Applause] because i tell you this morning church the devil knows you and brother when you walk i often tell my wife i says man the day will come when we will be walking down the road and demons will scatter scatter because of the atmosphere because of who you are [Music] yes i'm not some downtrodden thing [Applause] neither are you [Applause] now if you if you want to be downtrodden then you can be downtrodden amen but not me i have come so out so deep that man i hate the devil with a passion [Applause] if god did not come my way i would have been on my way to the gallows each one of us has got a story that's why brother we when we come to church man we our hands are raised we do a bit of jumping i can't help it because he's done so much for me [Applause] hallelujah now amy if he didn't do much for you then of course i you don't know what it is to be thankful you don't know what it is to worship him hallelujah but once you realize and that's why i said when i when i see my boys when we were growing up and i saw my boys maybe going the wrong way but i remember where i come from i said god i used to really talk to them and really say god help my boys help my family i know where i was and that's why i hate the enemy listen we we have fights every day we have fights every day when i step into my study in the morning at six o'clock and i've made it out of bed i said to brother moses i made a vow to god now god didn't ask me to make the vow i made it i felt moved when i saw the young people they need help they are going through their their times of struggle i said god i'm gonna get up six o'clock in the morning and i'm gonna call for his name and i'm gonna call the names of our young men and young women in the church [Music] i may i made that vow nobody asks me but of course you know when you make a vow you will know there's a guy out there you know his name we don't want to mention his name in church scumbag so every morning when i step into my study and i've made it at six o'clock i raised my hands brother brother ben i raised my hands i said i've won i have won i have won hallelujah because i'm telling you when that alarm goes off you click it and then of course you you say i say to god god you know you know i so much wanted to get up to pray but you know this body but brother once i've made it into my study then brother then then there's a fight amen then there's a fight i remember talking we were we back in south africa we now we got uh can i just talk a little bit we we've got five kids right got two goals three girls two boys okay and uh brother when i came now i've been serving the lord since 1960 make some sums and you'll find out amen so uh you know you you've got this this desire for god for your children i don't know and i and one time we were i was preaching somewhere and i was just saying a little thought saying to somebody one time over the pulpit i says when when when you sleep when you sleep dorian and myself are on our faces before god when you sleep then we are in a wrestling match because of our children they need to serve god and i made mention of this over the pulpit one day and years later we went back to south africa and the sister called me one side she says do you remember brother freddie one day you were saying this and this and this she said we instituted that in a home and she said here's my children married all of them serving god because you told us when when when you are sleeping then dorian and myself are on our faces before god and i want to say this morning to parents yeah you it will draw dividends will draw dividends so i've got three daughters all three of them married one is married to a pastor one is married to a minister in london one is married to a church minister in our church i've got two boys both of my boys are ministers of this gospel i'm not bragging i'm only saying to you if you want your kids to serve god pay the price you want your children to serve god and it doesn't matter where they are right now doesn't matter you this morning as a parent you can say god i've done what i had to do now the risk is to you lord i don't know where my sons are i don't know where my daughters are but god i've done what i had to do train up the child in the way it ought to go and when that child grows older it will not depart they might go for a walk they might go for a little bit of a detour but brother the holy ghost will go after them you remember you remember brother branham talking about uh brother welsh how this car was stolen and how that brother branham came and and mr wells praying and brother branham says the angel of the lord went after the boy and he says and that boy was a backslider and the holy ghost found that boy where he was driving so if your son if your daughter's backslidden this morning you have rights you have the right this morning amen to send the holy ghost after your children and god will honor you because of your faithfulness so i i believe i'm still maybe you don't like my ministry maybe forever as brother onyas said yesterday i'm here to read songs and if you don't like it that's your problem that's your problem so i so so don't crucify the messenger i'm only the messenger i'm only the messenger don't don't crucify the messenger amen hallelujah so every demon knew he was there and that's how the devils are going to know and scatter when you come walking down the road you say me brother yes you yes you that's right devils will scatter and somebody will maybe say there this morning amongst you you talk like to that devil aren't you scared he's gonna get you i used to be i used to be so afraid to to bad mouth the enemy so afraid to bad-mouth the enemy but as i grew stronger and i saw what i am in the word like brother banham says he says even if you don't believe it say it say it say it until you believe it say it amen don't speak the devil's language and tell the and and tell i am weak yes yes they all i'm weak i i will i won't speak bad i don't bad mouth you brother let me tell you this morning man if god is for you who is a who who is there that can be against you oh so this morning church i was saying and then i have to fight in that study fight in that study brother and i used to tell him i've made it he said yeah you just made it because of this that in the other i says i've made it just the same i'm here in my prayer chamber and i'm calling the name of those young men in our church i'm calling the names of those young women in our church amen so it doesn't matter i made it maybe 10 minutes late but i've made it glory to god hallelujah and so brother blame says every devil knew he was there oh when he was on earth they screamed and hollered we know who you are the holy one of god they knew him even if preachers didn't they knew those demons knew who he was and then they screamed let us out and he said why didn't you repent and slam when the door down only went below below the demons down through that line of demonology they screamed and hollered and got and this was all happening between friday and sunday hallelujah my he says they know where they went he says when they when he cast them out of the the demons out of the man of god they went into the swine choke themselves they see in that presence of that holy one coming walking through here they hid like a bunch of roaches you you you hit like a bunch of roaches you devil hallelujah he says man when the light is turned out in the summertime when they are knowing on apple core he says put me in mind of some preachers no wonder brother branham says i rather fellowship with a bunch of witch doctors than with ministers he knew why he said that brotherhood says amen put me in mind of some preachers when you turn the gospel light on them they scatter don't go there to hear that put me in the mind of big old bunches of roaches in the summertime in the darkness they can nobody go but turn on the light one time my there is a oh my we have somebody here this morning that can turn on the light if some roaches are giving you a hard time turn on the light lord turn on the light and you'll see how they will scatter brother branches the next thing he did he come down through the other trinity on down into hell i can see him go up to the door and brother branham knocks at the door and satan walked to the door and said so you finally got here did you oh my and my master said yes i'm here i thought when i killed abel i thought i shot you when i got evil able i was sure i had you when i threw daniel into the lion's den when i beheaded john i thought i had you then when you were on the cross i thought i had you but finally you've arrived

there you know my life was clubbing and things like that i was nightclubbing and music and blah blah blah and i was like a fool of myself do the splits a fool of devil's fool adele the devil's fool do the splits roll on your shoulders make a fool of yourself eh and i said to god that they saved me in 1960. said don't take the seal away just just let us just channel it and i remember i remember brother walking into a message church with my guitar and my amp and i was gonna make music and the old fighters were sitting there look at me the old fighters and they used to tell me call me one side and they tell me are you saved yes he's over we can go by the old fight does he all fighters look at you and they call me one side young man are you saved yeah of course i'm saved i just know where god brought me out now that thing doesn't come in this church man and all they had was a banjo and yeah i'm trying to bring more life more life into the church and they call me one side and they tell me young man you're not saved don't bring that thing in here and it scared the loving daylight out of me and i stopped taking in the guitar and i started i wanted to be like them to fit in the mold you know that mold of the old christians when they had the message and not the life and they used to sit there all you must say amen can't raise your hands i can't stand your feet you can't do a bit of a jig because uh you you are angels these angels here until i discovered these are not angels in the mazes a bunch of devils man you quickly discover man when they say they are you think they are angels they are a bunch of devils you never thought because i thought man coming to the message you hear what brother branham says and the holy ghost and the mess you listen to the message and you and and you and i feel that this what brother branham says must be in the church the joy and the screaming and the hallelujah so when i went to that in ellis dale went to a message church and it's just but then i decided listen yeah if god has brought me out and i used to do all these rubbish things out in the world and i ain't going to help nobody stop me and i spoke to old brother opry oh brother in the church when i was a drunkard i used to come from the pub and he stand can i can i just talk a little bit please show me time out brother man show me time out remember go to the pubmed the beer garden went to the beer garden on a saturday and uh have my couple of shots with my buddies and come out of there and here was this old man brother hopefully standing and preaching the gospel and i didn't know nothing i wasn't saved it was nothing didn't know nothing about the gene seed of god didn't know anything about the germ of life within you nothing of that all i knew brother when i walked past that open air something arrested me something gripped me sawing sowing on my feet as the wind is blowing me sawing but there was something that grip inside and my buddies used to call me come on leave that for old people but brother every time i come past that spot and that old man is preaching there something gripped me never knew it was god never knew but rather the day that the lord met me let me tell you something no church nobody singing to me nobody telling me nobody leading me to the lord nobody opening scriptures to me me and me alone god met me in my room met me in my room and brother and sister i couldn't pray and i remember how the holy ghost was telling me tonight give me your life tonight i said no you give me your life tonight i said no we had a tug of war tug of war happening brother and i tell you and the more i'm fighting him saying no i've we're just on the verge of cutting some records we've got some contracts how can i give my life to anyone how can i give my life to the lord but that night brother god met me and of course then me and dorian were quoting we were in courtroom you know and that night when the lord met me and we were in court for about three years in the lord sorry dory i do it every time my wife told me don't talk about me don't talk about me there's lots of things to preach about don't you preach about me this morning but i'm not preaching about you dory i'm just testifying i'm just testifying dorian just testifying maybe it will help some of the young men some of the young men here and some of the young women so yeah i got saved and immediately immediately i knew i cannot continue this relationship because i'm light she's darkness she's a sinner and me i'm a saint and i went down to her home to tell her from today now church i just knew light and darkness can't can't god walk together and i went to a home and uh trying to catch an eye so many people in the home they're trying to catch up i want to chat to you i'm gonna talk to you so finally when we got together i said to a listen i've got to tell you something she says now before you start let me tell you something i says okay okay what you want to tell me she says today at work i gave my life to the lord and you know what she told me and she told me brother moses and i have decided that i and you we cannot go together anymore i says what and i just came to tell you the same thing i just came to tell you the same thing [Applause] and now if you want to talk about the match made in heaven then this is a match made in heaven because brother we were serious we were serious we were gonna each one choose a different path but god but god reaching mercy knew my life knows your life so i'm saying to the young men young women don't have an unbelieving young man or a youngster or a young woman don't if you do have go and tell them no more and god will honor you god will honor you god knew our hearts god knew our lives god knew that me and dorian were we were ordained to be together and and that is what happened in our life now i don't know if it's going to happen in your life but it happened in our lives and that's why we got a testimony concerning that and so brother when when they when i came to the message and i came to the lord and i said to the brothers no man i'm sorry i'm sorry man i've i've got this joy in me i served hell out there with my music and i want to bring my music into the church and they said then okay bring your music no amplifier so i had to go to get a guitar no amplifier but after a while the lord started changing and no drums they didn't no drums in the church brother that's voodoo but now we got drums in the church why and then they use the scripture psalm 150. allah him with the guitars psalm 150 some 150. with the drums with the instruments with the symbols that's what i just sang in afrikaans i think i think brother onyas you must come and teach them some afrikaans amen and so just carry on quickly time is going and my when jesus says amen but i've got the right satan said because adam sinned but my blood is still wet on that cross they paid that he said yes i come down to take over give me the keys of death and hell he he he done gave the keys of the kingdom to peter the church but he says now give me the keys of death and help brother that death and hell scared the living daylights out of me i am as drunk as a lord coming into my home before i go to sleep i pray in my drunken state now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i awake that death and hell scared me and i think it scared all of us until we realized how he conquered death health and the grave took the fear of death out now you can only have be fearless if you know your relationship with god if you have identified what he has done and you've accepted it and applied it by faith then fear of death and hell is all eradicated give me the keys of death and hell reach over and grab satan by oh god how i how i wish i was there to see that that made the nations to tremble this guy that made the earth to shake to see my god take him by the neck [Music] [Applause] take him by the neck brother and tip him on the ground and put his foot on him and take the keys away from him what i'm telling you brother and sister the joy of knowing you are free the joy of knowing that death and hell has got no more hold on you [Applause] i tell you that should make every baptist jump over the chairs knowing that he throwed him down and put his foot on him and reached over and grabbed them off said you have fooled people long enough may god help you this morning that you this morning might realize turn away from a tomb turn away and look at him and call him master and he will say my son my daughter i give you life don't be a death don't be a hell you are free you are free that is what this morning means this is what the resurrection means this is what we are celebrating this morning is alive he's alive he's alive my jesus is alive hallelujah oh my [Applause] [Music] can i have your watch this watch is not in the old timer because it says 2012 here so i'm

we are waiting on [Applause] this is what we are waiting on this is what we are fighting hallelujah oh it's 25 to 1 couple of minutes hallelujah hallelujah oh i can see caiaphas standing saying what

all the time all these years hallelujah i just wanna just drop something in quickly and i'm gonna finish you know when brother branham preached the rapture where brother branham preached the rapture he used psalm 27 as a backdrop now if you read psalm 27 you read it and you'll find out it's not a psalm where you can ride the raptures here so i can just relax and i can just ride easy going no if you read psalm 27 come on let's just quickly read it that you don't miss it if you don't miss it the lord is a light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid now why why would malachi 4 use this psalm for a for a backdrop to the rapture we we when we talk about the rapture then you know we talk about a joyous time victorious time everybody is just dancing waiting no brother branham uses psalm 27 and he says i'm using this as a backdrop hallelujah when the wicked talk about the wicked even mine enemies you got enemies in the time of the rapture this is what he says when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh this is the time of the rapture they stumbled and fell though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident in the time of the rapture i want to let you know this morning church this rapture before the dawning of the day remember it's always the darkest it's always the darkest so don't expect in this time of rapture that you can sit in your rocking chair brother you need to have your sword in your hand you need to be standing watching over your sacrifice you have to stand watching over your altar you need to have your children standing around that altar and you with your sword the drawn brother protect because the enemy is coming after you this is not a time of letting up this is not a time of easy going this is not a time a brother and sister sorry this is not a time for us to to let go and be easy and buds in the ears and just don't even see the traffic don't even see the pole in front of you get it out of your ears that you can hear a different sound hallelujah oh my so this is a time of fighting this is a time of contending this is a time brother where we have got our loins girded it's a time brother that brother brahm says lord when i cross over don't let me do it like a coward he says let me be enrapt with a robe of your righteousness so church this morning my encouragement to you is this morning don't give in don't give up don't stop worshiping and praising god don't stop

this time between now and this they are getting their lunch ready for us we will just uh sort of like uh give a vote of thanks just to so that was everyone is here with us amen we still have another meeting to go one more service amen praise the lord so we're so thankful to the lord for that amen so i would just like to probably just bring it how it all came to be what it uh how we came to be in this meeting meetings or just read from the book of isaiah praise the lord take my scripture from the book of isaiah isaiah chapter 66 verse 8 it's a very beautiful scripture it says who has heard such a thing we have seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth the children amen praise the lord the meetings are we can't i can't really say put a finger to really say everything anybody sort of like really made them happen but they can only give it to god which has really helped us amen it was good through and through it all started brother tears wanted to he was here with a wonderful meeting and then he says it's gonna come back we have a meeting and uh well he says well that's fine brother tears come we just have a simple just like we did before just us and you and that's it praise the lord and brother teresa he was over in oakland and then he says he excused himself that will be over here for easter and my dear brother fred says we're gonna be there and help brother moses amen and uh that's how the boss started rolling amen i was kind of a bit hesitant because it was still during covet and with those are restrictions in place so the numbers and everything or it makes you to scratch your head but the lord has just been opening the soul that's the way does it it's very strange at times it lets you until you're almost like hanging down the cliff you're almost dropping and then it comes and soaps you all so that's how it has been happening and the numbers just on wednesday they said you are free to gather as many as you want so we say that well let it be let them come and here we are and like i've said that some ministers we just didn't send word because the war is more and uh and also uh uh so we could not sort of like accommodate them and for the people i think we started saying we have got some meetings i think it's less than three weeks and i hear some people they say together people like this at times it takes months and months in preparation ahead so it's just a miracle that we are this man this are today and we just want to thank the lord for that and may the lord bless you this is no man's doing that was jehovah god himself praise the lord hallelujah [Applause] amen absolutely it's no means doing so if you have a request you've been
