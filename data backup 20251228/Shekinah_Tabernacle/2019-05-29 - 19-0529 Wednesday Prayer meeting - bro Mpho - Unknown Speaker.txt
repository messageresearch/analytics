[Music] [Music] it's great to be home great to see everyone here this weekend weekend super amen this Friday night everyone is Vandal we're going to go clean the place so it's already after dinner sometime say see you at 6:30 7 o'clock we will go clean you know anyone available they'll be wonderful and we need folding tables gonna hit the folding table but lots of chairs willing to fold tables and I would like to thank all the youth for the Youth Service amen Joshua did outstanding job that was excellent I couldn't be here for I already wanted to but next time I want to say really the youth service really was a was a testament of brother Isaac and sister Shannon's laid with [Applause] in this atmosphere shall we [Music] [Music] amen god bless you I'm very nervous I'm very nervous because I don't do this thing of standing before the people of God every day amen so I give you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I believe that you're all happy tonight and if you are not happy I want to ask you to be happy got no reason not to be happy amen amen so um I just want to put this property so that I must not take too much time and I know it's a midweek service and will come with great expectations and you know one was supposed to come and stand in the front here you wish only few people can come so as I see many people come in I said ma I get to change his brother Ben so but I think I believe that to come to the house of God is not to come to listen to a person if you go come from home you afraid up you speak to your God to come and stick to you because our God is able even to raise a stone to come and preach because he said he will build his own church he didn't say me and random poll me and brother Isaac will build my church is that I your hope I will build my church so all we need to do is ours to be available let's just read from the book of Ephesians chapter 6 a few years after 6:00 then maybe like I always like to do at home maybe someone can also open for us as Peter someone can also open as first Peter and we will also read amen first Peter chapter 5 that won't read it from this eighth buttless we are starting with Ephesians 6 from the stem 2 to 18 amen amen destined Ephesians chapter 5 October 6 I'm with my friend my good friend baby even the Bible says from this on this six they say that understand sorry finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and I think this is where where our little same one is going to be based on verse 12 but let's proceed just just underline hold that the vessel 12 misstating wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God a postal police repeating that wait Amma which is that invested and is repeating it is wherefore take unto you the whole nut part of the ummah and not a piece of the AMA the whole armour of God that he may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins get about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fairies fairy dust of the wicked verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit hmm and the sword of death spirit which is the word of God amen I like that I like that verse it specifies which is the Word of God last verse praying always praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints let us pray gracious eternal Heavenly Father lord I can't speak to these people Lord and you know further that I'm not a speaker I pray Lord that as the thought that you put in my mind Lord that you can just inspire it Lord and anointed father and just just remove my mind and my thoughts because I'm not able Lord Jesus I pray that you just give each and every one your portion because your children have left their homes father and they have come here and lord I cannot listen to me Father but they can only listen to you Lord Jesus just help me Lord God and just guide you commit the service into your hands tonight father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I mean so what I want to talk about is it's pretty much what he has been I don't know why the brothers from brother nd that understanding all of standing in the morning right he preached about possessing who remembers our brother in depreciable possessing the Eternal Word not proton in the brother nd the other Sunday when he came from Vietnam didn't he bridge oh you can see forget he pleased about possessing the eternal he pleased about possessing who she was more about what I want to talk about but tonight we want to speak about the message that the Prophet spoke about in 1963 I'm not mistaken the greatest battle ever fought he preached it in 62 March 11 Amen we won't finish that message but it's a wonderful it's always so nice when you read the Word of God don't rush it you just you know it's like when you've got nice dessert in the fridge you just take a little bit and just enjoy this little boy of mine likes to to just when you give you something nice adjust it can take the whole hour so that's what we need to do with the Word of God let it sink in let me teach us let it grow as then tomorrow you'll come and you just dine in the presence of God so that's what you'll do tonight wherever the Lord will lead us then we'll go there and then there's already six minutes so now now now what I want to talk about is that the greatest battle ever fought the Prophet teaches us that I forgot that we read but we'll read it as we go along first Peter already but I forget because I don't always tend to just remind me ABA Abraham poor first Peter chapter 5 now what what is a battle may be must start by asking yourself that question what is a better you know a battle is something that results from a conflict if they see a conflict whether between the nations the kingdom the governments or a battle is not between two people that is a fight or a war a fight but the battle is you know it can have wars inside now a battle is it can come from two sides they can be many particulars in their battle there can be many participants in a bedroom but the fact of the matter is in your battle usually there's always two sides there's always two sides in your battle you won't find you can find many participants you know you know like we know the nations will have their own allies and they'll have that one supporting them but ultimately there's two sides that is the battle that we are talking about tonight this battle the Prophet says he started in heaven it's not that in heaven and Lucifer lost that battle and then he was kicked down ta right I'm excited for that now now now I don't know I don't know what I must say the unfortunate part of it but in every battle the Prophet says there must be a battleground there must be a place you know according to the rules of war those that understand or battles that there must be an agreement in the orange eyes in the olden days that the Israelites and the Philistines just together you know Galia skies got there by that hill there and the Israelites decide that they said David Matt go Leah under very the Prophet says and then and then they must be like no man's land or a place which we agree that we are going to meet there the result one is the war of Iraq they have fought it in the hindered in the desert huh so now this one that we are talking about there was an agreement also that the battle is going to take place in the human mind huh that's interesting yeah is it not so good sister Melissa I don't know but this is the situation the agreement was that sorry I'd like to participate you know I like to sorry if I Kalyani alright I like to make sure that people follow me as we talk so that way it was agreed that is going to be in the human man I don't want to say here because many times we would want to think that when we talk of the mind is only the head isn't it the Bible says out of their heart the mouth speaketh so which means the hottest for some element of processing certain things in a human body so we know we must just not jump ahead of myself now now the human mind was was agreed that is going to be the battleground now what do you need now for the better what what what do you need for you to engage in a successful battle brother mount was trained I believe in the army you know in South Africa in the olden days it used to be compulsory when you reach a certain age you go to the army one year to be disciplined to be trained to understand and to know that we are not here to play right now in the Army you know a tactful sight will know that for for a battle to be successful there's certain things that you require right you require soldiers number one right you require ammunition you require them to be trained huh you require the captain you don't want the leader you need someone who will lead you the captain if you don't have the captain you become like what you wanted a strategy or never if you want you're under the direction all right so you need the captain but and you need strategy you need the tactics of all that is I'm telling you about the basic things of a natural war and I'd like you to think about the fist the spiritual war as we'll go into that now you need the soldiers and you need you know and nowadays they color they talk about air force you know ground force you know a navy there's all sorts of things right but in the world that we are talking about the role of the Lord the Lord has got his own ingredients he's got his own things that you knew me and you must have in order to fight this war because the Prophet says that war after it was brought here huh down here to earth and it was going to be fought and he staggered he started already the Prophet says we are in the middle of that war is fighting as we speak and I'll tell you what that fight or that war or that battle who is raging it we are on the last lap we are on the last lap so you can imagine for those who did Atlantic's you know that when we we run around then and then there's a baton that you must give me if I'm on your side that gives us that case that gives stop Bronwyn brother brother mutely then the last one is brother Isaac the last one who's on the last left who's going to win normally the coach will put the first person that's not the one who starts might be the first person you know that pulse that I've laid a foundation God needed to prepare a special vessel for for that first lip to land because that first lip and the last lip he'll squat has got a great impact of the outcome or the results am i right Donna the last leg is very important we are in the last lab today me and you you can imagine how how fury this battle is you can imagine that this that is not gonna be an easy one now in the soldiers must be properly trained and those soldiers the captain has got confidence in the soldiers the Lord is given enough ammunition enough training enough captain everything in this day for us to be able to to run the last leper amen Sona you also need experience what do you call them in the in the military brotherman and these groups of soldiers you know they say the the regiment's you know there's different regiments and some special forces there's some distant that and you don't just want the FS in elementary guys and you put them in the forefront you put each one you know you need experience right in this journey what do you need yeah Joshua what do you need you need experience in this battle right can you hear me Jonah you need experience in this battle you need to have experience if you are a soldier you are going to get experience now we are the soldiers we get experience in this battle and we fight it and we get experience based on what we do in the war or in the battle Emma right now if we procedure there I want to approach it like this that the enemy that we are fighting it's like this you also you need to be able to understand the type of the enemy that you are fighting because if you don't understand the enemy the enemy is like this each and every one of us the enemy has got some photo you know a database you know the enemy our squad has got a desk board like your screen it's got been here for yeah good good Joshua Jaden everyone you squat you database for each one and every one of us and he knows that kou been what aku been his weaknesses what lq been strengths he's not going to waste time and up an approach where the cuban on the side where he's strong he understands that as for Ben even when I go before the Lord to accuse him I must be careful on this site and I talked about this before the Lord you know and say no but law and it was all IQs I goes before God now he knows us and he understand where we are weak where we are strong now we better also do that even more than him we need to know our enemy and understand that hey the Bible says we are fighting against principalities powers on you know in high places now if you're fighting those kind of things you need to be able to know that that one is not my brother that's the enemy this one and how I want to approach it then you need to be able to know that this devil he can make you fight with your brother you can't let you look at this I can say ah this is the devil you you need to be able to know that the devil how does he fight for you and that would take the experience and experience cannot just come you need to hear the way but then believe it right faith comes by hearing here you want the way so it can't just come it's like it's a sequence if everything joins each other now you hear the word it grows up your faith you become strong then then you get experience then you get tested then you know that not the nature of the battle that we are fighting am i right now the purpose of the of the war is to win but through the prophecies but the devil the purpose is his engagement in door is to destroy he wants to destroy he's not a good fighter in fact according to him if I can just add according to the devil I'm sure he he shouldn't have even agreed with God we're to fight the bedroom according dream we were supposed ambush us you know what is to ambush to ambush I don't I don't tell you citizen tell that I'm coming you know you just just cut then you are surprised what what is happening why does this surprise is finished kill you finish is done that's the kind of an enemy that we are fighting he's a bad enemy so according to him yuria blab just to come in and push you and finish you while you are still you know because he wants to destroy you know he comes to steal and to kill one scripture says Amen turn out we win but God wants to win this battle in order for God to demonstrate who he is he the devil is not even of the revelation that God made you for the people's huh to demonstrate how great and mighty is so he thinks he's caught you call with God and he can fight God and he can prove God but God God Jason oh poor thing you know Turner so now we need to be able to see that now the Prophet says here that the reason why it was decided that the battle must be fought in the human mind is because the human mind makes decisions the human mind that's where decisions takes place that is why he made us free moral agency even though God knows that you are my son I protest in 88u I chose you but God because he's the same yesterday today and forever he he God always repeat himself he doesn't change in the future and say no no I did this today know what he did yesterday if he fought the battle in heaven and yannick you do it today yes so now he fought the battle and he won it and today you repeat it because he's the same yesterday today l forever I'm not gonna finish no no no no no no no the Prophet talks about those three circles you know them children the three circles the three rings the inner one where we find faith doubt and you've gotta spill it and then we've got the outer side right he says now the battle that's not stacked on the outside the petal does not start here with our outside five senses not even the inner senses of conscience your equations your your reasoning your you know I call them comic because it's your clenches is your affections is your reasoning imagination and memory am i right so now it does not even fight you you cannot fight the devil and win him day in as much as those things are important but you don't use them to approach or to fight this enemy before you start from the inside he says is the battle start from the inside out which means that there's some process of the mind process that takes place there inside there because he says here that let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus that's Philippians chapter 2 that means that there's a process in the inside day where there's either faith or doubt now from there that's where the battle starts when you when you believe God is fast if you doubt God is that then it goes outside you're either for God or against him you're either for the devil or against you've got no other choice no other two two two three three ways right then it starts from there it goes outside then only then then then your your your next second your next three questions your memory then they start to follow suit of what is happening inside there am i right then the outside also that is my Paul could be bitten by a snake there that night how you just shake it in the fire because the spirit was everywhere in his body he couldn't we must have the Spirit of God on every fiber of our body nothing everything you know even your eyes my annuity payment so so that's how we need to be amen I have to stop brother Ben because then we can one day we can we can finish up this message you see like I said at the beginning is a big one and it's a nice one now now now it has to start inside and then a certain certain tag yes the principal part he Tigers the the part that he knows that is important there inside that's where he goes it's Thursday and if we can just make you doubt God from there then he knows that the rest of the other little rings will follow suit ah and God also tackiest the big part the important part the inside where he puts faith and he knows that from there it will pop someone who's saying him personally grandma told me that he pops like like it like I said what like a popcorn you know it pops it pops from the inside they heat stuff from the inside popcorn popcorn doesn't pop from outside Khan come inside no no from inside out right so that's that's how it pops now they just your thoughts that do not your thoughts alone cannot you know God has to open the channel of your thoughts the way that your thoughts are my brother Cuban always pray when it says God just bring us through the channel you know an octave of the channel where God must bring you so that it can it carry can pierce through you know through to your heart so that every channel can be cleared there's nothing that so disgust me like something that is brought you know you know you know my will tell you I always don't like block drainages I don't like them back home we live in a plot I get annoyed because God open that channel of your thoughts and he he he goes deep inside was once there's that communication through the channels of your thought then everything now flows God does that clear communication right through your body amen we need I need to stop him that now we can some other time finish off or pray about it or just go hit it isn't it if you read that message not it it not in your eyes then you just read it and just post and make notes you'll find that is such an anointing it's such a powerful message because it teaches you how to fight this enemy many times we fight the enemy and we are not aware of the enemy when he comes because he uses their mind you know he's able I can sit right here brother Isaac and he can come into my mind and tell me about Isaac you know when I'm thinking about Isaac negatively then he just put me on a pause he goes to Isaac the same demo then he met Isaac to to look at me I got a conflicting ideas and we need to know those things that the devil can compete in a mother and a father and make them fight on something but he is concocting huh he just continued and callek at home a sister he's a scar between David and Jesse and he says you see David B tells Jays now where's Jesse he says then he says you see you see David what is doing he sexually demeaning you is thinking about Jesus you are nothing that's the data now if you don't know the enemy you are going to fall for that trip and I start to look at your brother in your wrong way then when he finishes with you he proposes he goes to David and say at this point it's disrespectful can you seem to you like that and I remember the dinner he knows what type of a battle he must bring to you if you are a I'm not standing in a strong and he knows that this one is thrown when I come to him I must bring strong demons I must bring babies when he come to boys he bring small small demons those ones of sleeping engines you are they're small when he comes to a balance and other than the Deacons well past us he smaller little demons when he can't bring he says hey guys you can't go to harm and just the two of you you must take that guy with extra special forces of the demons now the Lord do that also turn out the Lord has got so much confidence in me and you that we can be able to fight this battle because you know why that captain that might be part of the team is the Holy Spirit he's the captain brother Nasir on Sunday the captain who is the Holy Spirit who is taught by Joshua he's the one who lists us he's the one who did the forces that same one Joshua made and Joshua said who are you for us or against us and he drew the sword he's a lamb I'm the captain there is about in worshiping he worshiped that's why because you are the captain he's the Holy Spirit is the one who leads us if we learn how to listen to orders of the captain and have that experience then we shall be able to fight this battle we shall be able to know that for God so loved the world we shall be able to look at people out there as creatures that God wants to save not as this sin us oh these gangs oh these people oh that sister oh no no the Prophet says you don't look at your sister don't look at your brother why because you're a soldier you you're holding a gun can you imagine us all joined the battle holding a gun fighting and then but looking at another soldier like this huh if even you think that's not on the trigger he's looking at this ah that that Center is not ut-oh then they should do what fighting you are supposed to be only a post of duty it's not your job to be saying AHA system run man named brother Ben you know if I was the past I'll do better no no no that's not my job that's not our job that's the job of the Lord who gave him that calling your job is to support him to make sure that if he's shooting you are behind him brother ever a man was preaching then you shoot and you see the enemy coming towards him is not our you shoot the enemy amen but you cannot do that if you don't have those I'm amazed that you are talking about our we'll talk about them at that time well what what do you need now how do you fight this battle how do you fight it how do you go about fighting this battle for winning because the enemy is fighting every day now you might try to take your thoughts everyone visit Toki he can dress a brother okay I can't even hear him no no you can hear me you just have to listen the enemy the enemy the enemy just who do anything say very bad enemy if he fights haphazardly he he just you know I don't know how to explain it but he just makes things mixed up he was you know in the dust but the time the dust settles he finished with you so we need to know the time of an enemy and be ready for him so that we can be able to overcome him I'm gonna stop here I've taken already ten minutes more eight minutes more so may the Lord bless you and then we are going to to play together and then I'm so sorry please forgive me for going for the time I love this message so much one day appreciated okay thank you so much thank you so much because because the Prophet read those two scriptures if not more amen let's see it first first Peter father Peter I see here yeah first Peter 5:8 210 thank you for reminding me first Peter 5:8 then you'll hear what he says is this now this is part of how you need to fight this battle he says be sober sober you kind of fight it if you are not sober you need to be sober sober minded otherwise you are going to have your own thoughts and the enemy that's exactly where he wants you you know someone who's drunk by Luca is not sober he's not in his own right mind so be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is roaring work at about seeking whom he can devour who resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that in that well amen but the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after death he have suffered a while made you perfect establish strengthen thank you that's the captain now that's what the captain does so so he does not let us to be in this battle for us to lose he doesn't let us to be in this battle for us to give up or to lose hope no he brings us in this battle for a purpose and his good that day we must I remember the back head one day a minister he said we must appreciate God for the test and the trial we must appreciate God for that because if we don't get files and temptations and tests how else are we going to look like Jesus Christ how else we must have those things but for us is to fight patiently to know you know I always say is easy to say and to do so we must come to the point where we say no no it's easy to to than to say Amen so you must do more than saying it so may God help us amen and we are going to pray together and then but I love this beautiful song can you sing it brother Dave I've got this beautiful song that I like and then we can come and pray together the musicians you know it says is there anybody here who loves King Jesus anybody here who loves my lord I want to know I want to know do you love is there anybody anybody sit down and respond if you love my whoa I want to know I want to know [Music] [Applause] just won my heart I couldn't help it I'm going to - just to be reverent now and brothers were sitting so then we are going to pray together and then I'm not sure if there's some prayer requests but rather been the pastor said you can just lead the service into prayer and then if there's no request the Lord also knows what is on your heart because you feel to mention it you can just do that and then we are going to pray together amen [Music] we are whoo he is our [Music] bwah he is Rp whoo [Music] yes [Music] whoo [Music] [Laughter] [Music] my [Music] brothers and sisters this just to

makes you happy what knows what makes you say if we can just give the captain of the hosts the Holy Spirit to take charge even now the Prophet says someone will get healed right here he says the Prophet if we just open all our channels and the captain takes over someone will receive a victory tonight because the captain of the host will be here he is here tonight just believe God just
