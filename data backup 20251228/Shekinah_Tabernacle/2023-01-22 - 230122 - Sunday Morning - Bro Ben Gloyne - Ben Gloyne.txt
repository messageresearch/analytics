the gospel of peace you know and the good tidings that they bring and and to be able to see that those that call on the name of the lord shall be saved and i was so blessed with that because he's just referring to so many different scriptures and you know the book of job talks about it and then peter says in x is not this this is that which was spoken of the book of joel and here we are again you know the second time so praise the lord and and i just thought of the power of praises you know that even those that were locked up like paul and silas there they could just praise the lord and set the captives free so this is kind of like the inspiration and thank you to the band sorry i only just sent it yesterday [Music] holy spirit come and break help me to see your reality lord make a lie

elizabeth god bless you amen may this be the greatest year of your life in the lord jesus amen god bless you richly amen we have the sunday school picnic after this as well it's all on details or on the whatsapp yeah god bless you great to have the notes with us as well god bless you amen praise the lord hallelujah let's go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to ezekiel chapter 36 a familiar piece of uh scripture and then we're going to go to daniel 11 we just and in verse 32 we're just going to read that that verse but if we go to ezekiel 36 and um from verse 24 something that's been in my heart for a few weeks so i just want to get my get the burden out and you know um we're living in a tremendous hour we don't want to let this hour pass us by i feel like we're like blind bartimaeus jesus is walking past he's never going to walk past that way again that's his moment he took that moment he wasn't blind by the mouse no more after that moment just let us be the same this morning amen this is prophecy ezekiel speaking of our day he says for i'll take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land so i'll take you from methodist presbyterian baptist catholic agnostic atheist new age buddhist hindu whatever i'll bring you out of those nations amen and bring you into your own land what is the land that's the land of the word of god amen then i'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you amen and god doesn't leave a spot he cleanses 100 percent amen a new heart also all i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you and heart of flesh now notice the process here and i'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall be and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers what's that amen the book of acts pentecostal original apostolic fathers amen of the word of god and you shall be my people and i will be your god hallelujah then we're going to go to daniel 11 and verse 32 and this this has been on the on the board a few times here before service and i just love the i just love this verse this is so to me god's speaking about us here in daniel 11 32 the b part not the a apart that's the devil's role i'm not playing his role i haven't signed up to do his role i'm here to do the believer's role god called me to that role amen i trust that he's called you to that role not to what the devil's doing i'm not on his side i've got nothing to do with him he has no part of me i have no pardon him amen says and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flat flatteries by the people that know their god shall be strong and do exploits i mean so what is that after he has put his spirit within you and causes you to keep his statues and his judgment but the people that know their god shall be strong let the weak say i am strong amen if you know your god if you know the lord jesus you are strong you are not weak you are strong hallelujah amen so praise the lord let's be our heads in a word of prayer this morning gracious father i feel very moved today lord i want to thank you lord jesus for your presence thank you lord for the power of your blood thank you lord not just talking about a historical god but you're the great i am lord you're the present god lord you're the one who still delivers lord still heals still fills with your spirit oh god you still walk among your people father fulfilling your word oh god doing what you have purposed in your heart to do before the foundation of the world so father i pray your word we'll just have great power today may you speak to our hearts speak to my heart oh god do not pass me by lord i don't want to be passed by i don't just want to watch someone else be blessed bless me oh god touch me touch each one of us here father anyone streaming dead god get a hold of their lives too father in the name of jesus christ oh god we just want to commit our lives into your hands lord may you take the floor oh god take the meeting under your control lord may no flesh glory in your presence oh god we're not here to feed off a personality of a man or just be part of a church but we're here to feed off your word the body word of the son of man so may you feed us oh god and change us forever lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so i i'm not going to get into it today but you know we live in a very very amazing hour you know it's incredible i i pray we really pinch our spiritual conscience in this season you know the bible prophesies of three woes or three world wars this is the book of revelation we know that the first two have already passed and the third one's coming that third one's going to be in the great tribulation i don't want to be here for that third one brother brown was told in 1933 when he saw seven major visions and and and when he was speaking of what what would happen with russia the lord told them watch russia watch the king of the north didn't say watch the soviet union watch russia and we know russia is on on its move and to me it's incredible if you look at world events right now where they're they're poised to invade the ukraine and it's amazing because when you look at the uh history before world war ii you know you know started there you know the germans they they begin to retake parts of europe that were german speaking predominantly german speaking then they invaded poland then it really blew up but you know and and it's amazing with the russians here in ukraine now this is me but i see history repeating itself because the ukraine it's not just that it was part of the soviet union they want it back but culturally the ukraine is where russia was birthed so and then there's a lot of russian speaking people in that part of the world so they want it back because it was part of russia and culturally that's where russia is actually from and what we call the ukraine today so i things are poised you know the last major vision he had was was that america was smoke bombs and craters and you see everything that's happening in the news from when george floyd was brutally murdered there some years back in the riots and everything that's been going on in the and the storming of the cattle yeah you know washington all those different things that stepping stones for the destruction of america right and we're going to get it too so we don't want to be caught here when that happens the lord has given us a way of escape which is the rapture right so we don't but then the thing is we don't know how much of it will taste before we go right so i trust that when all is said and done your relationship is not with this church it's not with me it's your life is built upon the word of god that if there's no believers around you you're somewhere far i don't know where no church to go to no sermons to hear no songs to listen to your life is so built upon the word that you are a living bible amen that you don't even need this no more you don't need a message book because it's in you living this is the kind of thing i want to talk about spiritual prepping we ain't physical prepping because i'm not here to see a tribute i'm not anointed to go into a tribulation i'm anointed to take a rapture that's why this message came in this end time that we would be taken out amen before the great tribulation sets in but there will be pre-tribulation time and we're seeing it on the earth let's pinch our spiritual consciences right because the devil wants us to float by get caught up in the busyness of life just watch the world go by because he wants us to be dragged in there but the lord is determined we're not going to be dragged into that we're going to go up but it depends yes what you want your decision i'm predicting if you're predicting you'll push in with all your with everything within you like brother ahmad preached a masterpiece on wednesday he's just getting better all the time god bless you for that amen but caleb was pre-destined to take that mountain that was the burden of his whole life give me my mountain i'm going to live here maybe might take me 44 years you know from from from kate spanier until i get here but i'm going to get here and he got there because he was determined i've tasted the land i've been on the land it's a good land it's my land amen so we should be the same kind of way this every divine promise is ours it's mine right now not it's not because we count ourselves worthy but because he gives it amen hallelujah now if we go to exodus we're just going to do a bit of a um uh sunday school reading here but as i said about this this this prophecy here in ezekiel he was talking about the believers i believe especially in this time but also in the new testament time right there's a prophecy this is what god is going to do to them amen so that they're not just going to say they're not just going to have a dry-out confession with no birth they're not just going to say i believe the message with no change they're not going to say i'm a believer without any power of god to manifest the word that they believe that's not what god's purpose is god's purpose is to fill you with his goodness filling with his being fill you with his word that he lives out of you and shakes the world amen this world needs a shaking it's right now if you want to call me a fanatic sure label me that way if that will reason away conviction but don't reason away conviction get in while you can so exodus chapter 12 verse 5 if you want to say hannah we're probably going to make you work today but she's awesome in the back because you don't realize what's going on because it just goes up there there's no sore necks turning around wondering what's going on unfortunately that's the only time you notice when you're in the you know when things don't go anyway exodus 12 and 5. now notice your lamb so this is the first exodus they had to prepare to leave even though the lord had come to take them out they had to pro they had to they had to apply the blood and your lamb shall be without blemish now we know we have the perfect lamb that's why i love when i fall i know i have a perfect lamb amen i have the perfect lamb the lord jesus christ and it's the lamb that matters it's not your condition it's his condition that mattered and because the lamb is accepted i'm accepted right because his sacrifice was accepted i'm accepted a male of the first year ye shall take from from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take the blood and strike it notice now on the door on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses ruined you shall eat it so it had to be applied in three places it wasn't just enough to apply it on the top lentil or one side post or both side posts and no lentil it had to be applied in three places so the blood has to be applied on your body your spirit and your soul right it's not just enough to cleanse you from bad habits not just enough to make you a good person amen not just enough to make you speak in tongues run around and shout be anointed but that the the blood must be applied the holy ghost must be applied on your spirit your soul and your body all three places now i trust when we're going through this you can just shout and rejoice saying god's done this to me already right irrespective of how you feel but i trust you know because my heart i was praying in the back there i said lord when the rapture goes may no one be here may this place be empty from the oldest to the youngest might just be totally empty because we all have gone may none of us be missing that day amen so we want to be ready right so the blood must be applied on three places now if we go to first john so he's going to go quickly through these but i wanted to get that point remember body spirit soul on all three the blood had to be applied amen for the death angel to pass over now in first john 5 it says here verse 5 and i'm sorry first john chapter 5 verse 6 and we're going to read down to 9. this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one notice these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one so in verse seven it says they are one but in verse eight the water the blood and the spirit these three a green one so you need all three of those components in the christian life to have a real new birth right so it's like a natural baby being born first the waters break and then there's blood the baby's birth but then the life has to come into the baby she's got to start crying or he's going to start crying the spirit's got to come in so it takes the water the blood and the spirit to and all those ingredients make the new birth now notice it's god that does all three but we don't want to stop with just being justified by faith i mean we're justified by faith by believing on the lord jesus christ we have to believe it right and then we can't just stop from being justified then going on to sanctification where the blood sanctifies us right and we're cleansed from all you know evil ways of you know you know talking and acting and things we do and you know you know filthy habits of the world we can't just stop there and be sanctified but we need him to come in and step into our lives and be the christian in us right so this is this is what we need so there's three ingredients to the new birth just like i was saying there in exodus the blood had to be applied in three places couldn't just stop in one place it had to go everywhere amen so now we can't just be justified or sanctified and not filled with the holy ghost but those three things are all definite works of grace amen so it's god so don't throw away what god has done you know it's like you know you're the israelites when they cross jordan they didn't despise what god did for them in egypt they didn't despise what god did for him at the red sea they despise what good got what god did for them in sinai right they rejoice in those things but they walk god had brought them further they didn't discount so if god was dealing in your life or in your when you're in the world you just thought i just got to find god or find a church somewhere and god brought you that's god working because god calls us to himself i remember then we need to send it to his call to his word and give ourselves to him amen now if we go back into the book of acts now because we live in a book of acts era don't we i mean so if we go to acts 19 and verse one i was going to read a couple of instances here where people were preaching that jesus was the christ amen but they hadn't received the holy ghost yet this is the biggest danger and you say this is this is out there no no this is here right now acts 19 and 1 and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed um having passing through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples and he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed this is a fundamental question that really we should ask one another because it's not when you believe you receive the holy ghost no since you believed have you received him right have you received and i love it how the apostle paul just just comes down to the crunch have you been born again have you met the god amen the resurrected lord jesus does he live in your life amen have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard will there be any holy ghost we don't know really what you're talking about it's a foreign concept to us i mean all we know is the baptism of john and different things but you know but god moves on because god fulfills his word amen and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto john's baptism now you think here's the man that baptized jesus he is the forerunner to the messiah i mean you think his baptism would hold up real good and in its hour it did i mean because jesus spoke of john and said he was a bright and shining light and you're willing for a season to walk in his light what was he he was the fulfillment of prophecy but then the word moved on god is not static and our walk shouldn't be static either i mean god keeps fulfilling his word he keeps revealing more and more to us right amen and we're going to keep walking as as it says in first john if we walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin and we have fellowship with him right first john 1 7 so what is that like as the word is revealed to you you got to walk in it amen if he calls you to put aside amen fussing and stewing and being a busy body and gossiping and all those things you got to put it aside keep walking with god if you're going to be baptized name the lord jesus christ you won't move any further until you obey what he's told you to do right so we've got to be obedient to god and walk with him amen hey if we stay surrendered we will amen amen because he's the lord he's he's in charge of us amen so but then then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon him the holy ghost came on them and they spake with new tongues and prophesied amen so they they had come to a place you know where they'd come and they were preaching that jesus was the christ but that's as far as they got i mean so they came to a place where they're preaching that the message of the hour was true because that was the message of the hour on that day i remember they hadn't received the dynamics to make it live amen and that's what we need today is the holy ghost to come in behind our lives and punctuate every word with an amen i mean to manifest every divine promise of god in our lives that's what we need and that's what he's here to do hallelujah i'm very passionate about this because that's what when i met god i thought everyone's going to meet jesus he's alive everyone's going to believe this and there's still a bit of that in me amen everyone's yeah he's real because he became real to me he stepped out of history and it was more than a story calvary was more than a story or a song i mean it was a reality it was an event it was experience for me hallelujah and i saw that god was not a god of history he's a god of the present i mean that we can meet the lord jesus christ i was so simple in my thinking i thought well if he's alive forevermore he's still alive today and i can meet him i can i can have fellowship with him and he can change me come live in my life and i come to find out that's exactly hallelujah because god does not put a promise in his bible without the faith to fulfill it right this this is not empty promises there is not a single empty promise in this book all the promises are here for you have got power amen god does not back up on any promise mean but he actually wants to put it that's why he sent amen the ministry of malachi 4 in this day you want to put it before our generation say this is what my blood does i mean that nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer amen demons had to fall at his feet amen people were healed people delivered i mean the word of god was preaching his purity people made new creatures in christ storms were made to made it disappear life was brought back amen that's because he was trying to show us this is what my blood does he took a man born in sin a prophet born and sinned who had to give his life and he was redeemed by the same blood we redeemed you and i and he wanted god want to show us this is what the cross achieves and he didn't do it just for us to talk about it he did it to show us actually you can know the same jesus amen amen that your life can be built upon the word of god and not emotion not anything else but upon the word of god amen so they had to come into they had to receive the holy ghost now if i could parallel that with i'm going to get into it later but you know their stony hearts were taken away and and and the stony heart was taken away god can deal with you right there you say they even received a new spirit but they hadn't received the holy ghost yet amen and then and then we go into the book of acts we find philip who's a deacon went down to the city of samaria and and he was preaching christ unto them now this is in acts 8 uh verses 5 to 17 if you want to put that up you know and and so philip went down there and the people were of one accord this is verse six now amen and gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did so here was he was a part of the body filled with the holy ghost went down to samara begin to preach with power and demonstration as as as the prophet said i mean teaching the gospel is not what jesus commissioners are he said to preach it and preaching is with pound demonstration of the holy ghost it doesn't matter how dynamic or not dynamic the minister is it's when god comes in behind it and manifests what he says that's preaching the gospel amen and we've been commissioned in this hour to go preach the gospel to every creature and that's just not someone who stands here that's now everyday life to everyone amen we live a life filled with the holy ghost i mean to phillips preaching and everyone's giving heed and rejoicing and then they even seen the miracles which he did verse seven it says for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed now notice in verse 8 there was great joy in the city so they were rejoicing in the message of the hour they were praising god god's come among us he's not a god of history no more he's alive amen he's here i mean he shed his blood upon calvary now we're believers hallelujah and so they were rejoicing hey there is great joy in the city when jesus steps in i trust this great joy in your city and your life when jesus stepped in hallelujah amen but there was a certain man called simon we're just going to keep reading verse 9 which before time in the same city use sorcery and but which the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave feed from the least of the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because of a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ are baptized both men and women so here they didn't just have some kind of confession you know just uh i believe jesus but they got repented and they were baptized amen so they're on their way but notice this now verse 13 then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wandered by holding the miracles and signs which were done so he became a message believer too i'm a believer praise the lord hallelujah but notice now but when the the apostles verse 14 now when the apostles which are at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent under them peter and john who when thou come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost so they received the word but they had not received the holy ghost that's why it's such a deception of the devil where people are told just receive the message and you have the holy ghost no no the holy ghost must come in you've got to receive the word but the holy ghost has got to come in and make that message live in your life amen so it's not just a mental or a baptist confession no change saying i believe god's seen a prophet that's not it that's not going to take you in a rapture you've got to meet the god of the bible if i say that for the rest of my life that's what we're going to do to nominate the power of his resurrection it's absolutely essential amen four verse 16 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus they had been baptized right they were they were they were rejoicing in the right thing the word of the hour that praising god they saw there was a holy ghost filled minister in their midst preaching miracles were done but they hadn't received the holy ghost yet it's absolutely fundamentally important you must be born again you know you must be born again see people say like brother ram says in the token message people say but brother brown we believe every word you say he says that's good but that's just being able to read you must receive the token the holy ghost so we can't stand upon man's opinion saying well i've received a message therefore i'm going no no you've got to be born again you've got to have a definite experience where the lord changes your life you can look back and now you see him living in you amen you must have that experience it's absolutely vital you can call me whatever you want to we don't deny the word here i believe the whole world is open i have no problem p people preaching about the thunders i don't care about the scarecrows you know or the seventh seal being open or the perugia i don't care about the scarecrows i just bypass it because i know there's food in there somewhere i mean so i'm not afraid of any of that stuff amen i don't care about scarecrows it doesn't scare me i'm not a crow right so there's none of the word that i say we shouldn't go there let's go everywhere like joshua's told the whole land go possess it every divine promise amen but they had to receive the holy ghost they received the word but you need the word and the spirit together amen because it's true i mean it's exactly unfortunately in the bible we we can taste of the good word of god but just tasting is not enough it's good i rejoice when god falls on people frankly i wish it happened a lot more amen we had a sunday night camp meaning every service praise the lord doesn't matter who preaches how how charismatic or not how deep or shallow people want to quantify it as long as god moves in the service touches my life touches our lives that's what we want we want who wants jesus i want you jesus come live in me that's how we should be every hour of every day i want to die daily lord you live in me i want you to live in me for your glory amen not that people would see me i'm not interested in that i want him to be glorified i want his word to be glorified hallelujah amen so says in hebrews 6 and 4 sorry we're still going on here for it is impossible for those who once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift and we're made partakers of the holy ghost these people have who have who have tasted yes not just heard but they've tasted they've experienced the power of god amen and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away and renew again and renew them again unto repentance saying they crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame now that's not someone who backslides and goes into the world that's someone who actually counts the word of god as some unholy thing it's a cult it's it's it's a man following group it's got you know it's just man-made thing it's it's it's antichrist all right now god's the judge remember don't you put anyone out amen god god god does that god brings people in he does what he wants so don't don't don't put people in that box that they're beyond redemption if there's life in the body they can be saved that's how i believe it amen if there's life there's still hope amen said don't don't ever throw someone away amen jesus didn't throw you away he didn't throw me away i mean we should have the mind of christ but what i'm trying to get here is people can just taste but you've got to go in the way because if you keep re if you go into ephesians says grieve you're not the holy ghost who by your seal into the day of your redemption so if you get to that place where you're sealed in you can't you can't be lost there's actually a satisfying revelation and anchor in your soul doesn't matter if you're having a good day bad day up and down how you feel you're sealed in you know in whom you have believed amen you base your experience on the word of god this is what we're gonna do you gotta take your experience back to the word amen that you can actually based on the word of god you say i am a believer amen i've i've repented i've fully surrendered my whole life i've been baptized named the lord jesus christ and i have received the holy ghost there's been a real definite change as as jeremiah would prophesy in jeremiah 31 and 33 he says but this now now this is speaking of this is speaking of the new testament era because under the blood of bulls and goats this could never be accomplished because the blood of bulls and goats only covered sin it never changed the sin nature of the person that brought the offering i mean so if i was living under the blood of bulls and goats and i did a sin and i had to had to you know give an offering to a time for my sin i know whatever the sin is i'd bring my lamb and if the lamb were yeah and then the lamb would be examined by the priest i was not examined the lamb was examined or the bullock or the goat whatever it is right and if it was found to be without blemish then it was offered on my behalf and i could walk away praising jehovah god because that lamb or that offering the wrath that i should have received was poured out upon it and i can walk away justified we have a perfect lamb today though we fall though we fail i mean we you know he was bruised for our iniquities if you want a good if you want a good memory verse to memorize memorize isaiah 53 he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of his peace i'm sorry my peace was upon him and by his stripes i'm healed i mean he was wounded from my iniquity you should you should read that memorize it because that's my lamb hallelujah amen but the thing is the new testament i mean in the old testament era after i did that the same desire that same fallen nature that caused me to sin in the first place i walk away with because the life in my sacrifice could never come upon me and change me but because that was under the blood of bulls goats but now under the blood of jesus christ our sin is not just covered right it is done away with in the blood of jesus christ and the life that was in that blood comes into me and changes my nature so so the sin nature that made me say i need a lamb i'm lost i'm a sinner i don't walk away with that nature amen as the blood is rarely applied amen amen he changes your nature hallelujah but you see so this could never be fulfilled in the old testament he says but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i'll put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and it shall be and and it will be their god so the word will be their god amen what is the word of god it's our god who is jesus he is the word right and they shall be my people hallelujah so the only way that could happen is the holy holy ghost comes in takes the word and writes it at our hearts changes our nature and that can only happen under the blood of jesus christ amen the apostle paul would pick this up in hebrews 10 and verse 14 and and he would say this here amen for by one offering not continually year by year he has perfected forever them that are sanctified i just read about you by the way by one offering a perfect offering there's no interest need to be paid off it was paid in full hallelujah whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us that after that he had said before this is the covenant that i'll make with them after those days saith the lord i'll put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more hallelujah so so the apostle paul is taking prophecy and god is saying it's no longer prophecy it's happening hallelujah amen who's had that kind of experience hallelujah that really you know it's the word of god on the inside so he's going to be the inside teacher it's not just us saying now stop doing this and wear this and do this and change this and no he's got to be there should be something on the inside when you go to reach for the wrong thing he should say i don't like that you have to yield to that though right because he doesn't make you a robot none of us are robots right this is not god putting you in a mold and just pushing you out like some factory no it's got to be a willing heart come live every day come do what you want to do every day do that which is pleasing in your sight in my life hallelujah amen now if we go to first corinthians 13 the apostle paul picks up how it's charity or divine love which must rule and we are living in the age of divine love hallelujah it's not coming it's here amen that capstone of divine love is upon the church holy and individuals you see divine love manifested they don't have to try and love people they just do hallelujah amen hallelujah now uh we're in verse one here he says though i speak now now i just want you to notice i'm going to cover this all in our you know ezekiel here but this is so fundamental what is your experience based upon what is your christian walk based upon is it is it based upon emotion is it based upon you know a lot of doctrine what is your christian walk based upon it must boil down to the word of god that you've come according to his word and you've met the author of the book right and your life is now a manifestation of the word right that you know because how how are we getting to heaven i'm not getting to heaven on the anointing that i've received i mean in terms of to preach and to shout and run around and rejoice no i'm getting to heaven because his blood the life in his blood has cleansed my soul right i came has provided way amen i repented was baptized name and lord jesus christ and i received the holy ghost right that is that is the way jesus says i am the door he is the word and that's the door right you gotta you gotta come god's provided way but don't just stop by repenting don't just stop keep going don't just repent and stop there or don't just get baptized and stop there see the problem is this may sound wrong but the problem is we raise a lot of good kids but they seem so close but where's the infilling of the holy ghost right or even we raise good adults and and the thing is things can become we can become creatures of habit it just becomes habit to come to church it becomes habit to dress the right way it becomes habit to pray or listen to the message or it just becomes a habit because we become creatures of habit and it can look so good and all those things we should do right but unless god comes down makes it live it's all in vain don't just stop get in you may think i'm angry i'm not angry i love you very much i want us all to make it jesus christ and we can't be numb to the condition of this world and oh we've got hundreds you know we've got 50 odd years we may just have today you know there's a lot of last days for a lot of people right now the lord comes for a lot of people right now so it's not just the coming of the lord but the lord could come for you today right we want to be we want to be ready now because we can't get ready there we get ready here so though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity divine love i become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift gift of prophecy and understand what's that word all mysteries so the apostle paul can say and uh because there's a problem people cabbage down if i can use that kind of term but i see the words open he says you can understand all mysteries you can know how the seals tied together with the church ages with the vials and the thunders and all the different things and you can have it exactly perfectly right but if you don't have charity divine love you ain't going right so we don't want to be stuck on well i have an understanding sure when the spirit of truth comes he will lead you and guide you into all truth but there's a very different thing between a revelation and head knowledge you can forget head knowledge but a revelation becomes part of you you cannot forget it right so don't call a revelation something you learn and you forget a revelation is something that anchors in your heart you cannot forget it because you become part of that revelation amen and all knowledge and i have all faith that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing so i could stand here and i could list off supernatural things after supernatural things and god did this and god moved this and god raised this person from the dead but if i don't have charity i'm nothing but in saying all that we don't throw away speaking in tongues now i'm back in verse 1. amen we do not throw away gifts of prophecy right we do not throw away all the mysteries and all knowledge amen we do not throw away faith to move mountains so you don't throw those things away i just need divine love no if you get divine love all those things will be added unto you right so we don't throw those things away amen and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing that's the words of well that's god's words so we don't just want to start and come halfway and think i'm there we must go all the way in all the way in now because people yeah and and i said it before but i've received the message brother ben i'm a believer there must be a power in that to transform you because jesus said well yeah i'll say jesus because when john wrote the gospel of john it wasn't john that was jesus writing through john remember every every word in this scripture is divinely inspired amen otherwise our god can't keep his own word whom he's going to judge the world by this word is inspired every word and i and i believe the cover's inspired also the holy bible hallelujah i believe that's inspired too amen from kevin to kiva and the kevin also amen you thought oh you've just gone off the deep end i found something i found the pearl of great price i found the greatest treasure you could ever find is the lord jesus more than church more than good singing more than doctrine but the person amen of the word i felt he found me rather hallelujah and i wouldn't trade it for nothing i wouldn't trade him for nothing so he says in first john 1 and 12 and 13. he says but as many as received him remember he is the word so as many as received the word to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so if you've really received the word then a power comes in to transform you into a son or daughter of god from what you really are from the beginning comes to life amen amen so now let's go back to ezekiel so there's an order here you start with a stone he calls you out of all the heathen out of all the religions all the different things he calls you to the word to himself but we start off with a stony heart now that stony heart can be religious the scribes and pharisees brother um said had a stony heart so so we can be we can we can be up to our eyeballs and the eyeballs also full of the message but with a stony heart just an intellectual understanding of that that can just be a stony heart and that's not in but yet it can look in right so now he says now now there's just a few quotes from the uh the impersonation of christianity 1957 to me this is incredible that's god's order not a big school with a degree but a living acting experience of the holy spirit not fanaticism but the real genuine holy spirit put in action may you see it as my prayer now notice the order of the scripture it's perfect god said first i'll take away the old stoning heart you can't receive nothing so you can have a not head full of knowledge but the word can't correct you right you can't receive nothing then he said i'll give you a new spirit now that ain't the holy spirit and he says in what thank you of christ i can hear him reach out over there and say come here east wind westward north and south i tell you everything's in the solar system and in the heavens obeys him and turns at his command but the heart of man who thinks they know more than god does he can't touch the stony heart of man so if you're sitting here today and you think more than what the word does right and you can be a believer you say i'm a fourth generation believer you can still be a have a stony heart right so if your reasoning if you place your reasoning above the word of god and you that's you saying i know more than the word does and he says and he can't touch that stony heart take it from us lord take it from us lord i put myself here too so we don't want to reason away the truth of the scripture and take man's opinion and their own reasoning that is still a stony heart no matter how good it may sound if it's contrary to the scripture you forget the reasoning and you stay with this word amen and then he says now so so but what happens when the stony heart is taken away you get a heart of flesh now you're flexible to the word you actually begin to see actually this is true right and the spirit speaking through this brother a few minutes ago said i'll take that stony heart out of you this is from leadership 1965 and give you a heart of flesh tender towards god so with the stony heart you can be full of religion but you can't be you can't be moved by god god can't work with that but then he takes that stony heart and gives you a heart of flesh that now you're tender towards god what does that mean you're willing to be shaped and molded by the word right because a heart of stone cannot be shaped it's just a rock and there it is but if it becomes tender and soft then it can be molded and shaped by the word that's what we want to have isn't it we don't want to be strong i don't want to have a stony heart and indifferent and you can't tell me nothing and don't tell me nothing and i know this and did but brother brahm said this here and this quote here and this scripture here you know no we don't want to be that way we want to have a tender heart that god can mold us and speak to us and correct us amen now this is a work of god right now look how it's become now just an intellectual emotion see not a tender heart full of love and sweetness towards christ so that's a that's a heart of flesh a heart full of love and sweetness towards christ that's a work of god so as we go through this don't despise the first part because it's got to start there and end here right so and praise the lord if he's done all three wherever you are get to the end where you're filled with his holy ghost and he lives out of you amen so to be tender towards god be able to be molded and shaped by his word this is this is when someone receives a heart of flesh and i say this that many of us you know even even even young children can be this way right but then if we sit here service after service time after time nothing changes i'd say lord take my stony heart away don't be deceived by the devil amen but say god change i come here to be changed i don't come here to well i stand here and preach but i don't stand here to preach you i said lord preach to me i mean when you know when i'm praying when i when i'm hearing the message change me and even when take this vocal cord speak something and change me with it amen that's how i feel i come to church i want to be more like jesus more like his word amen but so don't just stop with a tender heart full of love and sweetness towards christ we should have that we must have that amen how can we if we don't love him how can we serve him if we don't love him how can we have faith in him because faith and love are like husband and wife i mean they work together right so we must love him if you've become cold amen say lord take the coldness away if you become indifferent say lord take the indifference away amen he says here father now he's praying we want to be like moses we want to be led by your holy son jesus christ to eternal life give it to our hearts right lord tear out the old stony heart place into us a new heart the heart of flesh the heart that you can talk to and deal with and we will not be haunty or different what is being horny and different basically you can't tell me again i've heard this a million times well that doesn't mean nothing that's a stony heart we want to have a heart of flesh that god can actually we can be corrected i mean you know the zeal of this age just be zealous therefore and repent that is that's the zeal of the ladies and age so if you want to be a zealous believer and be quick to repent be quick to say i'm wrong oh god change me that's the zeal of this age because this age you can't tell no one nothing everyone has an answer and if they don't have it in here they have it here 0.246 of a second they have 5 000 million results and hits and there it is and they think they know what they're talking about god knows what he's talking about [Music] amen or they just have a message search program or a scripture program they just no no we don't want to be like that say lord heart of flesh that you can talk to and deal with that we will not be haunty and different amen may the holy spirit never leave me this is in leadership when the last message is the prophet preaches lord may i come and ordain this people speak to them tear up their stony wills and put the will of god save everyone father give us of thy love hallelujah so that's an incredible thing to happen but don't stop there don't stop there we want to we want to receive his spirit amen so now now we're coming to the new spirit this is very deceptive because many people think they have the holy ghost when they just have a new spirit and we don't want to be deceived because it's an incredible change even to go from a place where you don't care about god you've got a stony heart you know you never darken a church door never open a bible you know never listen to the message but then god changes that heart to a heart of flesh that's an incredible thing well you want to lord i want to meet you jesus you're alive where are you you know that's an incredible thing and then also the new spirit is an incredible thing but we don't want to be stuck just with a new spirit now the old spirit we can't even live with our siblings we can't live with our family you can't even live with yourself fussing fighting there's got to always be some kind of fight too there's got to be something to rally behind a grudge to pick up something to you know resent me to lift up some kind of fight well she did this and he did this and this person is wrong that's that's still you need a new spirit remember no matter how religious how many quotes how you dress you can you can you can be the epitome on the outside of a believer but if you've still got an old spirit there'll always be some kind of battle and normally someone like this is not much peace between the two i just fought this battle and now there's this and they always bring up the past of this and you said this and this and this she did this and this that's an old spirit there's always contention there's always trouble there's always fussing there's always something going wrong that they just can't be happy they just can't let it go they pick up something and say well this person did last year you did this to me and this birth and she did this and they just can't let it go that's an old that is not a new spirit yet so if there's always fussing and fighting around you there's a common denominator in all those walls oh yes you gotta jesus said don't go to your brother and say let me take the little basically the little twig out of their eye when you've got a beam in your own he says but first take the beam out of your own eye that you can help your brother how do you do that you actually go to the lord say lord search me oh lord and try me today search me oh lord be in prayer lord there's something in me that's displeasing but if there's always contention and strife around you you need a new spirit amen right there's always trouble remember if the holy ghost is within you even if you have a new spirit there should be peace blessed are the peacemakers for they shall see god i mean jesus said in the beatitudes so we don't want to he says no this isn't this isn't the impersonation of christianity again he says there is the mistake has been made a lot of people many people rather come to the altar to pray and they get down to praying and praying they get a feeling a little better they might get up and on and jump around a little while and after a while they find out they just bounce bounce bounce and back down this is a new spirit so they go from camp experience to camp experience right we need those camp experiences right we need that time away but we can't just go bounce bounce bounce and stay down right that's not what we're called to be we're not called to go from labor week into labor weekend right i i need another camp experience though yeah if you take the book of acts i'm just going to jump ahead those that receive the the study hall was taken away they got a heart of flesh they got a new spirit then the spirit of god came and dwelt in them how did they go the book of acts believers they were filled with the holy ghost they received the new spirit trouble came in they didn't fuss back they said we're just going to serve god so we please god or man and then the devil put pressure on them they just had a prayer meeting god came down and then they just kept walking on amen and to me that's how we should be you've got trouble in your life don't just spread to everyone on whatsapp amen no go to prayer first and foremost i mean don't be a busy body you know people it says in the bible women and you know busy bodies are going from house to house being everyone's business now you can be in everyone's business with this even if that spirit's on you you've got to get rid of it oh what's everyone doing no lord jesus what are you doing what are you doing today lord how's 2022 working out for you how do you feel about this how how do you feel about me i'm going to tell you how i feel about you and then you find yourself so lost and praising him amen oh i got no time to spread a whole bunch of poison amen but we need we need a new spirit right so and we don't want to have what the what the prophet said can't yo missed meal cramps like he said about the manner falling in the wilderness it would fall and then they would eat a bit then it would go old they had to get new manner all the time but that same manner and the holy of holies never went old it never got old it was there and the high priest went in they took a mouthful of manor and then the next high priesthood so the same manner on the outside went old and stale but the one in the holy of holies and the prince of god never went old that's the same thing with the believer we can have times when the manna falls and we just fill our spiritual bellies and we shout and rejoice i mean but if we are not living in the holy of holies where the lord jesus on the inside of us then that experience gets old the word gets old it gets stale right but if you're in the holy of holies that would don't get old it doesn't get stale it can't get moldy because you're living in the presence of the king oh there brother sister i'm not giving you pie in the sky this is reality you can live in the prison of god every day of your life i mean not because you're up some hills top in the wilderness somewhere you can be you'll be walking down amen middle of wellington hell can be around you literally you can be i'm so glad i can see i'm one of them hallelujah and you don't have some judgmental spirit against everyone you've got a heart full of love lord somehow touch that person touch that person lord speak to him speak to her lord bring them bring them to yourself may they fall in love with you somehow [Music] hallelujah amen amen so they jump down after a little while and they bounce bounce bounce back again they never receive the holy ghost no matter how much they bounce how much they screamed uh uh had oil run out of their hands and and they have bloody faces and how much they spoke in tongues how much they shouted what they did that has nothing at all to do with it that's only human emotions they got a new spirit and they rejoice with it now i'm all for shouting screaming acts 238 youngans that's the only kind the word can produce snot and crying howling not a dried confession not a mental ascent of i believe the mess no no you really meet him right but what happens after that happens right because many people they just get a new spirit what's happening they can start to live with their family they can live with their neighbor they're not fussing anymore they're not fighting i mean they're they're not in drugs and alcohol and you know things of the world that's taken from them but that's just a new spirit that's in a tremendous work but don't stay there don't stay just with a new spirit because that's the great mistake people make god does an incredible work but have they been sealed in right brother m says you know why with the spirit you had you couldn't even get along with yourself so how are you going to get along with god god has to do a renovation he's going to take the holy ghost his big bulldozer down your tin can alleys i mean just bust the whole thing out amen then god terraces it out puts a big mansion on there and then he lives on the inside of a new hallelujah i mean so yes so if we couldn't get along with ourselves that's why there's so many troubled people in the world that can't get along with themselves what do they need a new spirit but not just a new spirit they need god to come and dwell on the inside of that new spirit amen so god had to give you a new heart not a patched up one a new heart that's your intellects what you think with a new way of thinking what is that new way of thinking the word is true jesus is alive that's a new way of thinking but that's just your first step it's a great step but don't stay on the first step amen he says then i'll give you a new spirit what's that and you desire i want to do right i want to do right so we want to go beyond that because i'm sure i'm looking at a whole building of people they want to do right who wants to do wrong hey i had to do it sorry but everyone here wants to do rydee everyone everyone wants it lord i want to live a life pleasing to you but the thing is don't just stay there that's a work of god we don't despise that we all need it but don't just come that far because some people yo they get such a great a radical change they get such a new spirit they think oh i've got the holy ghost now not yet not yet now he says with that old spirit i just want to labor this because in that condition you can you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him i mean so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit in you amen this is so and then he says here and and what does it take to make a christian life he says and when the devil comes back what does he find he finds his old tin can hell is when the spirit is cast out of a person right but there's been no change on the inside that spirit will come back and find that same old tin can alley the same old desires the same old things you know the same old strongholds of all your i've got to have this i got to be like this person things are hollywood whatever more things of the world i may be speaking rather general but there's all those old things that haven't been taken away right god sent his big bulldozer down and cut the thing all to pieces and bulldoze it up and scraped it off and a hallelujah avenue is built there it ain't the same place there's a big modern home built with the holy spirit is brooded big beautiful flowers of salvation standing up you don't even have to try and impersonate anything this is when the holy ghost comes in right it's a new heart it's a new dwelling place it's a new spirit everything is new how can the devil walk back there and expect the old card table and the cigars and the old fussing fighting stewing everything that you had in you that's why i wanted to read this again right so that's all gone we shouldn't be a bunch of fusses we shouldn't be a bunch of stewers right that should be all gone amen amen why because blessed are the peacemakers amen amen the holy spirit turns over the old tin can alley dumps you upside down sweeps the devil stuff out of there creates a new heart and a new life not only that but he moves in to see that everything goes all right glory to god he has the caretakers the angels that prune the trees oh my he says i wish i was twice my size think about what he does brother sister amen buddy so he doesn't just give us a new spirit don't stop there but go in and receive the holy ghost that he becomes the wheel within the middle of the wheel i mean he comes in and takes over you can do a lot with that new spirit right but you cannot live the word you cannot live the word amen and it stand in time of trouble and test because when things are going well god bless you brother god bless you sister but then when trials come disagreement comes you'd say when the yeah it's like a cat's fur they love to be petted a certain way but if you if you scratch them the wrong way you know and it's like it's like anyone you can play the part but what happens when opposition comes what is really within you comes out like you can take the greatest mansion on the face of the earth and from the street side you could be uh you know isn't this a wonderful place and the people but then the inhabitants of that place because a beautiful nice big mansion is like a believer that looks the part they look like their holiness unto the lord on the outside but then if you open that front door and a bunch of crazy gangsters come out with guns and they want to do evil stuff and you know that's the inhabitants of the house and the only way you know who's in that house is when you actually kind of rattle the door when trouble comes or miss you know disagreements whatever comes it really shows what's within us amen is it revenge that comes out is it fussing is it grudges that come out is it unforgiveness is it stubbornness that comes out is it i'd no i'm just not going to listen to no i'm right no no you're a liar and blah blah you know someone just stands here like a mule they won't they want they're not flexible that's an old spirit still there the outside can look good but even you know we have to have a new spirit but it's more than that that the lord drives out all the gangsters and all the bad stuff he has to come in that when he comes in it's not just a facade of a believer but then divine love comes out meekness comes out gentleness comes out faith comes out understanding comes out intercession comes out love comes out hallelujah meekness comes out because who's dwelling in your house is it the old you or is it him i want it to be him it must be him hallelujah amen because you we can line up to the word outwardly and quote the quotes and say the right thing but yet not have the holy ghost we must be born again if your old nature rises up and you fasten whatever i'm just this is how i am there's a temper you can't you need a new spirit and you need him to come and take over it's that simple you say god's done great thanks me yeah he has but go all the way amen go all the way in the name of jesus christ amen when you say you receive the holy ghost goes right to the middle of your new disposition oh you say i quit drinking quit smoking i feel like a different person oops wait a minute see you've just got a new spirit but the holy ghost spirit comes into the middle of that spirit and then he makes your every your main motion every intellectual everything agreeing right into this middle of the wheel which is the word what god says it's true if the days of miracles of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the holy spirit would bear record with that and every intellectual move of yours will say the same thing so in your heart you'll say amen to every promise if the word says you've got to stop doing certain things you'll say amen hallelujah if you start if you're mistreating your family you'll say lord forgive me and change me because the wheel within the middle of the wheel will cause you to line up with the word it's not you trying to line up yourself with just a new spirit but his spirit comes in and begins to live his word out of you and i amen amen hallelujah amen now so i'm just trying to find where i am because i want to i want to i want this to sink real deep right now if the days of okay so and when you have these little temper fits and you fly out you tell lies and you proselyte you jump the fences and you're so selfish with your organization now i talk about that you're so narrow-minded that you wouldn't hear another minister just remember the holy spirit isn't ticking on the inside of you few i didn't know i was going to say that but that's right see so we can look all apart but if we fly off and temper fits you know you say i'm just having a bad day the holy ghost is greater than a bad day i'm having trouble in my home the holy ghost is greater than that trouble if he's in you he'll take control of it but he's going to take control of you first amen we don't have the holy ghost if we're all that way the holy spirit will make every movement like christ it'll make you christ like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the holy spirit controls our emotions our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that a shindig will bring it to you but the holy spirit brings you into operation or in control amen of god that you walk in peace and in love and enjoy with long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience you see it isn't something that you do it's something that the holy ghost does in you so it's not you saying i i should be long suffering here remember i'm going to be long stuff no you are long suffering with a new spirit you got to remind yourself i should be meek yes you know i should i should be gentle and you know i should be long suffering and this is what but when he comes in then he just lives it out of you amen remember there's no complex that can stop god so don't reason away saying i can never bear all the fruits of the spirit because x y and z my mother was like this my father's like this well this is what's going on in my home and this has got to be this way my childhood was like this no god is greater than all those things so don't ever reason away and say i can never have that because of my past i think god is greater than your past he's greater than my past he's greater than my present hallelujah so never ever reason these things away amen it's something the holy ghost does and you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the holy spirit oh i wish i could shout the praise of god around the world to that i mean it's a subconscious thing it's god working on the inside sorry i'm taking too much time but you know it's god working on the inside it's not you trying to do it it's a subconscious thing amy says church of the living god that's where our pentecostal move has failed i say i could even say this don't stone me this is where the message has failed people have just got a new spirit without receiving the holy ghost preachers deacons and all not just you know musicians song leaders whatever they come up to this father they never receive the holy ghost we have some man-made musical clap hands jump up and down a motion when if we go back out on the street and the holy spirit doesn't govern our lives to cooperate with that we do not have the holy spirit so we can't act one way in church or one way around believers in another way in the world we should be the same person we shouldn't have split personalities we're not schizophrenic well i'm this way at work because that's the conditions of working on this way in the mall because that's how the mall is on this way at the beach because there's other beaches and and i'm this way at home because this is how my home is no we do not change how we act based on the environment we're in jesus was the same amen in jericho that he was in jerusalem that he was in the wilderness that he was on galilee he was the same and the apostle paul was the same there in the holy land that he was in greece he was in macedonia wherever he went he was the same he's the same in the prison same in the ship i mean same with his head's about to be cut off he was the same apostle paul because the lord was living with him so we should be the same person i trust if you visit me at work who i am here is the same one there in my nature how i talk to people whatever i should be the same person amen who wants to be like that now i'm not tricking you here who wants to be like that amen he says that's not skim milk brother but that's what the church needs only life can come by the holy spirit amen now i'm just going to read this and then i am going to close okay when this takes place now this is from is your life worthy of the gospel very good message i listened to it this week but without he says but when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the whole that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will be believing and doing everything that god says in his word is for you to do and everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night till you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit some people have taken it i receiving the message is the evidence of the holy ghost what is the manifestation of receiving the word you will bear the fruit of the spirit your life will be an amen to the word amen amen you might say well i speak in tongues you might do that you might not will i shout you might do that you might not but there is one sure thing you'll do you'll bear the fruit of the spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace faith long suffering meekness gentleness patience your temple will not be oh just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you see i mean when you get to a place where you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong when you get to a place where the minister will read from the bible that if it's um that it's wrong to do a certain thing amen and you'll just remember there's no christian there uh christianity in there at all if you can't toe up with it that's now by their fruits you shall know them that's what jesus said see if it's the word and god said so that the spirit in you will cope with that word every time because genuine holy spirit will cope with the word because the word is life and spirit jesus said my my words are life and if you've got eternal life and here's the word how can the word deny the word see what kind of a person would you make god there's one thing to know that you're a christian when you fully agree upon every word of god amen and you find yourself in love with your enemies somebody says well he ain't nothing but a holy roller and you start to get all riled up be careful uh-huh be careful but when you really find yourself that you love him regardless of what they do you still love them see then you beginning to find and your patience gets from about that long so just don't have no end anybody just keeps saying things about you you say well i don't care what you say don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk to them again yeah yeah don't get in fusses don't like to get and fuss if you have to see somebody raise up in church say you know what i'll tell you so and so did so and so and so and so he sent our brother shame on you if you say isn't it so listen to scandal watch out the holy spirit is not a cesspool see no no no no no the heart is occupied by the holy spirit is full of holiness and purity thinketh no evil doth no evil believeth all things endureth long suffering see don't fuss when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them your mother said iron heaven you go up there that old church anymore well tell you all you think about it you're letting your hair grow out you're going to look like old grandma don't fuss with her say okay mother that's all right i love you just the same and i'll be praying for you as long as i live see now don't fuss see temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from it you'll be fussing back then the holy spirit takes his flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love who wants to breed love who wants love to breed love be full of love jesus said then all men will know you're my disciples when you have what you have loved one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit is love so i'm going to leave it there this morning where are you this morning do you have a stony heart the word can't affect you the word can't shape you just reason it away and get a new heart say lord make me flexible make me that i can be changed by your word that you can actually change my thinking change my heart and then now i do constantly fuss with one another you fuss with your family you know there's there's always war and bloodshed literally around you that's your old you can't even live with yourself you wake up and you're unhappy with yourself that's an old spirit get a new spirit say lord i want peace i want to have peace around me i don't want to be fussing and fighting and be unhappy with who i am god doesn't want us to be unhappy with who we are he wants us to be comfortable in our own skin if we're if we're this tall and this wide he wants us to be happy he wants us to be comfortable in who we are so if you wake up and you're unhappy with and you can't even live with yourself get a new spirit amen but then if he's given you he's given you a heart of flesh the word can deal with you and he's given you a new spirit you can live with yourself you can live with one another there's peace and he's taken drinking things of the world bob tears shorts evil things whatever it is he's taking it from you don't stay there let him come in and be the wheel within the middle of the wheel that is not you trying to be the believer he is the believer in you where you find yourself now you're long suffering now you're gentle amen now you have faith now you love even your bitterest enemy you love them now you have peace it passes all understanding all of those things are not based on external influence it's based on what's in here so don't just stay with a new spirit amen get the holy ghost i believe he's here today let's stand to our feet this morning let's bow hits i just want to ask the question you need him don't reason anything away don't reason it away you want to be remembered to pray you want to raise your hand i'm going to pray for you each one but if you want prayer don't just settle on my prayer you've got to talk it over with god yourself but i'm going to pray that the devil gets out of this place that we can receive the holy ghost and god can change our lives forever and i'll say the altar is open after that let's raise our hands shall we if you want to you're going to be remembered in prayer gracious heavenly father we can't hide nothing from you lord lord we can't not that we want to but lord in our humanity lord we try we try and hide by reasoning things away saying i'm fine i
