[Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord hello God bless you all this evening how are you good this is a bit of an Abrupt entrance for me this evening well I not not abrupt but uh because we I like to get to church maybe at the minimum about 15 minutes before no not not saying you have to be there 15 minutes before but you know there's an atmosphere there's always an atmosphere that that we are in and you know I think when we serve the Lord we we get even more sensitive to atmospheres you know and and the Lord has a mind he has a desire here there's a there's something the Lord's doing and and you know if you get to church a bit earlier you can kind of have a chance to sort of catch that atmosphere that's kind of why I like to go early not not to show that I'm here early but you know to catch the atmosphere of of sort of what the Lord's doing and you you you know you but when you sort of tune up just right on the spot you you kind of haven't had a chance to see get the get get get the feel of what the Lord's doing and and and we we serve a Supernatural God so this stuff is not just made up we serve a supernatural God that has a mind that has an idea that has a desire you know and and um yeah so that's just a little bit about [Laughter] me so um you might notice some Sometimes some preachers they sort of talk bit about this and that and you know it's it

in our heads Lord May come and Minister now to us and just take our hand and start showing the scriptures that would just remind us of where we are right now we ask that you would step forth the word and would Quicken the word to our hearts Lord for even speaker and hearer Lord anoint them for tonight for your glory and your kingdom we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen thank you so much musicians you can go and sit down or keep standing while we open the scripture um now this is the first time I'm going to preach off a slides show not the first time but the first time I'm dependent on a computer so guess what if the computer fails we just push the button and go okay amen so we don't worry about those things I think um I've prayed enough um brother ID you can put up the first service slide if you want I'll do that um I want you to not this is a little bit more of a teaching one it's not going to be so so much a preaching one so I've put a lot of slides together I want you to follow with me in the slides if you can keep your Bibles open it would be fantastic as well because we might do a little bit of jumping through the scriptures we might not we just ask what the Lord will do for us tonight but our open opening scripture is Romans 8 38 and 39 who knows this okay let's read it for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen amen amen let's just pray there Lord Jesus we have opened your word father but now we ask you as the author of the word Lord the word himself to step in right now and Lord may you just bless this evening Lord and May may it be just edifying for the body of Christ in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats like brother M says while I remain [Laughter] standing I don't think I'll wander around too much tonight I'll try to stay by the the this or else it's just going to blow out way too long um I just want to do something here before I go there okay that's why I got the clicker brother or else it's just too many devices to do I've got to F man I'm going to switch this off is it going to confuse me what's the time 8:00 so hopefully by 9:00 we're out of here latest he okay just pray with me stay with me a quicker we do this the better okay so my question was why did God save me when I was still you young people this is a little bit more for you tonight so if you can stay in here and not fall asleep I promise you you'll get a blessing out of this young people old people if you fall asleep I understand anybody over 40 I feel you okay but I don't think it will be too boring and we got a lot of slides if you feel you're wandering off come back just come back okay don't don't wander off just come back whatever you do stay in the service it is for for you I've already been corrected I thank you for this and I've been blessed now this one is for you so you pull okay am man cuz when you R these things the Lord Cuts both ways hey thinking oh Lord forgive me so let's start it this way um I asked the Lord I said Lord when I was lost and I was in the world completely out of the economy of God if I had to die in that state I would have gone straight to hell and I find myself a lot when I read the word of God saying Lord but why me but the one scripture and it is just something that a skid that Ed and I did way back in the day we we owe you guys a couple of skids well we did that and and one thing that realized is Brother Steve prison preached so nicely on it he said your origin you come from God hallelujah you go back to God God cannot lose a part of himself now I don't want to go on with this but I just want to realize this sets how you walk he said and it and it really impacted me if you think it's for knowledge and you just made the right choice then it was you making the choice but see don't miss this this is not you choosing God this is God choosing you it was never your choice it was just his time you think it's your time but it's his time so as long as we remember where you're coming from that's origin so you are just as much part of God than God is part of you you are you can't take this shirt and cut off the sleeve and throw it away and then when I bring the sleeve back it's still part of this jacket it was designed to be a part of it God chose you because you were bed out of him I'm not going to go too much with that but your origin you are a part of God and because you came from God you have to go back to God and then God said to me he says but you were lost yeah but were you really lost you just had Amnesia you were just busy with your stuff like teenagers man they can get busy with their stuff leave ow I got I got two boys growing up very fastly and re man it it's quick before you know it they're looking at you and you're talking to them and they're like 50 mil gone you're like where did the young boy go that was like yes daddy yes he's gone he's now a young man staring you back with his own opinion so that's what happened with us when we when we went into the world and we were burn birthed in sin there was like this Amnesia between us and God but see God said nothing can separate you from me yeah from the love of God huj so I want to follow you so John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him shall not perish and have everlasting life so God himself loved the world Amen so I want you to get the theme for tonight the the the sermon title is When Love is projected When Love is projected so not you get two types of love and we're going to quickly go through it don't don't lose me now stay with me I'm going to I'll call out names if you fall asleep trust me tonight I ain't scared you talk to your mom and dad after that I want you to realize is there's two types of love there's agapo love and there's filio love and brother Brandon brings this very nicely together he says now love is two different words two different meanings in the Greek one of them is called filio that is the love that you have for your wife now boy I do love my wife a lot and I think man I'll take a bullet for my wife I will do anything for my life I I'll die for my wife but he says that love is still just feel your love that is not the love of God and he goes on here and he says now the love that you have for your wife and the love that you have the love of God Is So contrary so just listen to this the love that you have for your wife if a man would insult her you would kill him on the spot it's a bit drastic might you would at least sock him one you know you would because now look you love your wife so I'm going to stand in the gap for my wife he says but it's different he says but that is that kind of love a filal love but with a gap of love you would pray for his lost soul so when we when we love someone that don't mean it's a true love look I love all of you but love sometimes is paper thin but see God wants us to move on from that love to his agapo love so that love and I won't leave it the notes now he says but one poet wrote it like this he says if every stalk on Earth was a quill and every man is scribed by trade to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry that's right we we sing the song we know the song man I was so praying you would sing that song you sing it so good says to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry or could the scroll contain the whole thought stretch from SC Sky to Sky the depth of God's love is so vast that we as humans cannot understand how much he loved us even when I was walking in sin in the world completely separated from sin not even believing in God I wasn't an atheist I just it was a story in the Bible all the Bible was a story there was no real Revelation or a relationship with God but yet you if you ask me do you love God I say I love God and even if you ask me now i' say I love God I'll say I love God because it's so easy to use the term love now we got some young couples here I'm going to knock on your door soon all of you young couples be careful when you say love because the when you stand in front of the The Altar and you say for better and For Worse you don't say for better and for better say for for richer and richer so better and worse richer and poor okay there there that love is going to go when you think you're at your lowest point then go a bit further that love Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about we'll just go on with this so brother brandham uses a little bit of there and this is why you please follow me on the slides he says there and now there's many times people misjudge one another and this is a bad thing to do you say why she's got short hair she's wearing her dress too short that that's not the Holy Ghost upon her how many people has done this or guilty of this cuz remember love is paper thin and love is also if it's in a f your realm it's very easy to lose it because it's F Your Love he says don't do that don't do that that's not right you know you don't know what's in that woman's heart you don't know nothing about it you don't know the Holy Spirit would make her conduct herself a little better now that may be true but I'll tell you you as you and I let's let God do the judging of that and let you and I just pray for that person that God will show them the light that's different love you know I'm not going to preach too much or off the subject but it's easy to look at someone else's child it's easy to look at someone else's wife brother sister anybody in church and quickly judge that ain't love brother brandom says please don't do that because when you start doing it it it it breaks that Godly love in the church it breaks that that Holy Spirit and and let's just go on I'll get there next one I want you to follow me this is this is really important here sometime ago a man called me out there aside and I had a Pianist there they had a little short little skirt it wasn't exactly I guess just right and the lady had short hair and she was just a babe in this way so I remember when sister Chantel and I came to the church and she showed up in the jeans you know and I showed up my B Shoes which was my jandals you know but we showed up and the one thing about a Healing Ministry which I believe we are under um is people never came to us and and gave us the legalistic side of the message I I had no one come to me and say shape up and start wearing our tie and start looking a certain way and dress was the prophet now we had none of that we had Divine love projected I want us to remember where we come from the the prophecy over the church was if we can stay humble God will add Souls that was finding him will'll add him to this church but we must stay humble but humble is not always you being low and somebody being high it's really loving them with the love of Christ Hallelujah and so we didn't maybe looked theart we were still babes we didn't know anything about the seals we didn't know about brother brandom we didn't understand the events that happened the word being open but we came as many of us still coming to church no matter if they grew up in the message or not and they might not look the same as you don't worry about them because you can't see what God's doing in their heart Hallelujah you can't it's not your job that's God's job you leave that alone you project love okay we'll go on with it he says and she was playing the piano so she was in a a Ministry she was in a gift she had a gift and God was using the gift but gifts and calling is without repentance so it's still a gift and God God's still using it like bam that was a prophet he was still a false prophet but God still prophesied true through him because God's word cannot fail he still had the gift of Prophecy so what he wanted to sell it out for that's between him and God and and what's the motive Behind The Pianist playing here and brother bram's church that motive is between her and God and the guy playing the drums and the guy playing the bass the the the the reason he's here that's between him and God don't you judge anything about that God will sort him out he's big he can do it he brings me in he can bring you in he can bring him in he can bring her in don't you worry about it don't run God's business you you make it all mixed up it makes it really hard there's gifts for that and offices for that he says and the man met me out there and he was tearing me to pieces and said and you're Pentecostal preacher now look how it happened happens brother Ben you you follow me as well cuz you're not here I would have wanted to look at your face when I said that why is it always the pastor's fault when the church is not in their place because he's not legalistic enough or because he has too much great why is it the pastor's fault why is it not your fault we're a multi-member body we're all in this together we raise the children together but it's it's easy to go it's the teacher's fault it's the pastor's fault is that one that's not what we're talking about here a family says we're responsible for that person absolutely so the the motive behind us is not to push anyone down or say it's whose fault because one thing I do hate and it happens with my boys they always snitch on the other one when they doing wrong so if I pull you into the argument okay then I'm I'm I'm good no you're still wrong pulling your brother into it it's not going to make you less getting a Les par SL you're still wrong correct you all your kids do that hey Mo it was Cara he bumped me first yeah but you socked him in the nose yeah you but you still socked him in the nose you're still going to get a p SL yeah but now I've got Cara in there as well that attitude should not happen in the church because remember it's not if I let someone else look like the sinning then I'm looking not as a sinner this is between you and God it's very personal it's a it's a one-on-one walk Collective body work but one onone yeah even if everybody judges you don't worry God is the final judge he knows what's in your heart correct amen so let's keep it clean so don't don't you refer to your pastor when stuff goes wrong the poor fellow has it already hard enough with all of us man I wish brother B was I was thinking of him when I read this I thought oh boy sorry Lord forgive me you know because we're quick to run to the pastor quick to overload the deacons you know sure they only have that much RAM you know so it this one of them down here is one kind up here so she had a skirt on where they they separated with a belt that's how I read this he says one of them down here and one of them kind of up here and the skirt that they wear and this is just a little bit of background so you understand where brother brandom comes from is real thin and it shows the underneath garment so it ladies sisters I'm a man it's not nice for us to look into your underneath garment okay it's not nice so if you can't do it please don't do it I don't say wear a h sock what is that what is that in English like a bag I don't say just wear a plastic bag over you okay qu suck is like a sheep bag or something like that I don't know what you call it I'm not saying do that but but before you climb out of your house I'm I'm I'm going to tell you now you already look 20 times in the mirror before you left your house so you kind of know which state you're in Ruben does it 15 times you definitely do it 20 times okay so I just want to let you know even as a Young Man checks himself before he goes sisters check yourself before you leave just to make sure that you're not a stumbling block for someone else because your motive coming to church is not to see how beautiful you can look which we all know you beautiful princesses it's you're coming for the Lord your first motive is I'm coming because I love the Lord so if you can do that boy the same with you it's it's your motive coming to church is going to give you the reward what you cast upon the bread you cast upon the water shall return to you so the motive and the way you come is the way you will go but if you come all wrong and like brother Isaac touched on tonight and you just make it and you just just pretty much get into church here on 99 and all those things I'm telling you you are not really expecting something God can still do a lot for you but you're just not in it and I promise you if you go on your first date you ain't just going to dress up all hey hey James hey dress up there in your pluies and your socks over your pants and get there to your first day and go hey how a chick she she won't be a girl for long no you dress up even smells nice when he walks out the door I'm like whoa James huh when he got married the day oh married when he got engaged sorry I married you off already when he got engaged man I looked at him I said bro she knows you're going to get engaged she goes I'm taking my best and he did he looked his best because there was an expectation that today there's going to be a meeting with my wife now God has that same expectation for you and if you have the same expectation for him then two forces will amen so see the don't worry about the preacher and the dress coats and all you worry about God God will sort out the rest but let us not look at them and go oh yeah no he just came in with his pluy so no he's not going to get anything out of the service God is dealing it takes time okay washing by the water of the word okay now he goes on to say there that I skip that why did I one of them down there one kind of disc there and it's real thin and it shows the on the garden and it I don't like that he says I don't like that okay there might be Spirit full f as anybody I don't know God knows but I would not condemn that woman and say that she was going to hell so look at the prophet he's saying I really don't like that that doesn't look for me like Godly but I can't judge you so I ain't going to judge I let God do that that's not our job okay he goes but let me tell you the flip side of this message believing Church okay he says the same person had his church a lady who had long hair and wore a long dress and had a temper enough to fight a buz saw now for you boys I Googled what's a buz saw cuz I thought it was a type of boxer okay there was a guy that was a Boxer that was was somebody buz ER like that swear but no this is a buz saw this looks like one of Ben's machines he would work with now that's the belt that runs it and that's the thing that do does damage so this sister as nice as she's dressed as pied as she looks she looks theart and everything inside her is enough to want to fight a thing like that but she looks the part amen he says and just as me mean as she could be now long hair and long skirts don't take you to heaven no sir it is the spirit that is in you that takes you to heaven so let not forget this Amen brother brandham says he says that when the Holy Spirit comes in it's like a little white dot and as you grow with the Lord and you feed upon the word this Holy Spirit grows and before you can see you don't listen to let zelin Nirvana ACDC Metallica all those type of things your taste changes but no matter how much when I walked into this church you told me that was wrong that was still my taste you could have always said yeah have you tried gospel music that's the love answer you'll go not yet but that's planting some nice seeds but you can't change my taste because it has to come from here it has to be pushed out from the Holy Spirit okay amen let's go on so sisters brothers that that think you're dressed well and you're right in the part and you're your ministry but you get quickly anger angry and want to fight with your brother and show him the right way don't fight The Buzz cuz I'll tell you the next thing that comes he says then you should remember that many times don't mention those things the pastors don't mention those things and they automatically just go on thinking that's all right so if your pastor doesn't preach it what happens we all get lazy but do you want your preacher and your pastor here every Sunday telling you the the law being legalistic getting the deacons to smack you through the door when you come in and you look a bit odd or send you away do you want that kind of Pastor so why do you dress that kind of way see because brother Ben has a Healing Ministry and when he preaches he preaches healing and he will preach these things if he feels he needs to preach it I'm saying why should he even preach it because if we as a body and look now what happens here he says you sisters that's in character it goes on he says and then the sisters of the church the sisters who are in character standing wearing the clothes neatly they should be example of sweetness and motherly and sister likee so he's not just taking and say it's the pastor's fault he says what about the sisters in the church now we're only talking about sisters tonight because the quote says sisters okay but what about the brothers no luckily for you we've got two deacons and they more than capable to sort you guys out but the sisters sometimes get left by the side amen boys are different than woman trust me women needs love they they need a tenderness and and when you talk to the woman you must come from a point where you know what you're talking about they they're not stupid and they very soft and so if you come as a brother and you just blast another sister because she looks different you'll hurt that one because men want to fix stuff but women don't want to fix stuff no ways okay remember that thing with about they don't want to fix stuff so we as brothers can't go to sisters and want to fix them right now because they don't look the part you will break them but sisters he says and I think that any woman that is motherly and godly and sisterly ought to go to such a person and with sweetness of the spirit just sit down and talk to the lady he says and if she is God if she is of God the holy spirit will understand those things see who is he talking to in the sister if she's of God the Holy Spirit within her will understand these things and what happens and she will correct herself it will just come in from here cuz it will resonate but what did it take it took love it took a motherly soft gentleness to go and speak about these things it doesn't take a pastor every Sunday to hit these things it's a multim member work amen we all still there everybody awake amen Liam's yawning is doing well but when you real quickly condemn her you will drive her away and you might harm harm that Young born baby so where did we come from do we forget so quickly I left my notes there a while ago let's see is that yeah that's a one now the person speaking with tongues now he's addressing another thing but it's just the very next line he says now I have to say something here he interrupts his thought and he says this might be a little strange and if you don't agree with me that's that's okay you see we misjudge these things so many times let's always try to think the very best of anyone who's trying to do what's right so what is our motive he's trying he's walking he might be crawling he might be dragging he might be leopard crawling but he's moving forward okay he says oh let's express our very best to them oh they are trying we don't know their heart unless they have discernment now discernment is a gift you get and some people can see right through other people and people like me I've employed many of people when I was with Downer and those type of things and boy man that I look I don't see like other managers see because they had very good discernment I'm just everyone's friend CU I love you okay I really love you unconditionally but feel your love has conditions okay and if they were wrong then if you got it the Bible said if a brother be overtaken in Fault now Brothers Here Comes it to you as well let them which your spirit shall go to the brother in the spirit of meekness he says considering your own self least you be tempted so what happens and I've seen it so many times and that is and it's times and times that this happen as a brother comes to you and he runs his mouth over someone else's either family or situation and everything and he's just going for it and he's unloading and he's unloading and you stand back and you go be careful you don't have the Revelation to do that now it sounds like oh we're very spiritual now no I'm an old monkey I fell out of a lot of trees it hurts so when I go to you and I say as a as a Elder of the church say maybe don't go there because when you fall out of this tree you're going to fall on your face it's not a brother being lifted up it's a brother with meekness coming to you and say don't do this this is not the right way to do it listen to them because when you do it out of season and out of the will of God it has repercussions for you so if you don't do it in meekness and you don't pray before you do it for that brother and for you then what happens is you get tempted too so before you know it you're sitting in his very same trial because what comes out of this mouth God will go oh really Let's test it how many times have you you young men and and and brothers that preach You Preach something over the pulpit and that very next week what happens you get tested a little bit harder than you think but you get tested on what you just said so God is not a respector of persons if you preaching the gospel and you bringing forth a word God's going to say sorry what did you say Aran amen you're going to get tested that's how he works because he wants you to know what you're talking about okay and then tell them to come back to God so we persuade him we reconcile him we we win a brother to Christ the the the attitude of the believer when we do that is love I need to win my brother to Christ but don't do it out of zeal don't do it out of frustration or or even out of determination don't do that wait for the Leaning of the holy spirit because then you will win a brother to Christ because then you're doing it under the anointing of God and God's working on both sides his side and your side and now if you go to him in meekness and you tell him that then all of a sudden healing takes place and he comes back amen he says when love is projected well well we're almost on time man that's good when love is projective with the right motive behind it divine grace steps in Hallelujah now now I was shouting because brother Bean he preached my Sunday sermon on Sunday so I had to get a new one this was this one thank you brother ban cuz what happened is I want wanted to talk about where were you when Jesus was on the cross where were you when he stood before Pilate where were you when Moses was before Pharaoh where were you when Daniel and the lion then where were you you were in all of them that's why you can find yourself in the scripture as you walk through the pages and this sunite woman now he's talking about that woman that that that um woman that was waiting at the gate for him and he says here when love is projected with the right motive behind it so remember the Holy Spirit led him down the road he was just saying Lord here we go just walking he didn't know what was going on he says Divine Grace has stepped in he says now not knowing I said while your boy is dying she said yes when I patted her on the back she was still wet from The Morning Dew so this lady was desperate she had love for a child not feo love she had Godly love for a child and only and I can find it so much in my but but it should be in us as brothers as well she was not going to take no for an answer she was speaking to God and God was going to answer her and she was standing there early morning she was waiting for the prophet to come down for her Elijah to come down so this is not this is not she's desperate but she's not that desperate that she's standing there wondering she knows her visitation is coming amen and he says and she had a man's skirt shirt tied around her your head and I thought oh God this must be it see and just led by the spirit of God all hopes was gone but love was still there love doesn't fear it waits on Grace So when When Love is projected for her son and she knew there's only one way Lord just see what I do I've done everything for my child you mothers with your children When Love is projected and you come before God you speak to him and say Lord I ain't going here until he comes because see Divine Love Goes further than feel your love feel your love is the the guys disappoint us and we kind of want to write them off but Divine Love Goes further than that says Lord I canot forget him I will not forget him I will pray on my knees until the blood comes out but I want his soul amen and she had no other way to go but her love pushed her for a child so far that she started reading her type in that Bible and she knew that she had to get a a visitation from Elijah and she wasn't going to settle for anything else because she was in that word that love was so strong that's Divine love that is a gapo love that is you boys can do whatever you want but your moms are praying for your love that is love that touches touches the hym of Jesus's Garment of the Lord's garment and it makes him stop and it makes him listen because because God wants you to pray that way not just for your loved ones but for all your loved ones amen he says now Prophet St the mouth of a righteous man is well is a well of life but violence coverthe mouth of the wicked hate hate stirreth up strives but love covers all sin so love doesn't turn a blind eye it covers it l is I know my brother is is wrong I'm going to pray for him I'm going to bring him before God it doesn't it doesn't sugarcoat Sin Sin is Sin that's why when you when a Brother's sing you is doing something wrong Brothers you get along you go to him you have a chat with him you you get in you you go and win a brother to Christ with all that you can pray before the time he says but it covers sin because you're not seeing the sin anymore you're now seeing The Sinner and you need to know that if the sin is gone you're dealing with the person you your your your more soft towards the person but if you still see the sin you deal with the sin you're going to hurt that person do you understand it you cannot you cannot go to a person out of a complex or out a frustration because then you're dealing with his sin you're not dealing with a sinner you can't win him back he says the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but the rod of the back that himm is void of understanding so it says there's a rod for your back if you being silly young men there's a rod for your back if your dad and mom is trying to help you and you willingly don't want to do it there's a rod for your back they don't say your dad's going to hit you I'll go on with it half nine phas book of Samuel Eli the priest you can go and do this homework go read uh 1 Samuel 22-17 and then go we'll we'll touch on 1 Samuel 25 to 22 to2 five the people come before Eli and they say hey your sons your sons are busy doing wrong the promise that God made you is that you will offer sacrifice in in my temple you'll be the priest but yes Eli you're you're in your position but your sons are doing wrong and Eli goes and he says to his sons name my sons for it's not a good report what I hear but I want you to listen this is not for me this is not for me a dad loving his children now you must follow me this is just God said to him the people come to him and murmur and he goes to his children and he goes you're doing wrong and I'll I'll I'll bring it all I'll tie it together hold on nay my sons no good report that ye make of the Lord's people to transgress if one man sins against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sins against the Lord who shall entreat for him not withstanding they hearken not un the voice of their father because the Lord would slay them so your mom and dad comes and corrects you your mom and dad comes and talks to you out of love seeing that you are walking off the word of God don't fall asleep on me this is this is this is your kids follow this is important I'm not I'm I I love you I I want you to understand this they unfortunately if you don't listen to your parents there's things that happen for that there's a consequence to it I don't want bad things to happen to anyone not any one of my boys not any one of you but if you don't listen you don't hearken into a voice there's a penalty it's not your dad sorting you out it's God going to sort you out this is real stuff man amen I've experienced in my life walking away from my dad's counsel and all that I got was heartache and pain I'm meaning it out of love for you young people you don't need to love your parents nowhere in the Bible says children love your parents not that I read of it says honor your parents honor means listen obey it doesn't mean love me you can love me as much as you like and you can still curse me to my face and you can still turn away and walk in in sin because half nine phas didn't listen to their dad when he said guys don't sin against God this was not a easy thing this was a hard saying and for a dad to come to your children to say you're busy sinning against God there's coming a reaping for that cuz you're sewing something that's bad you should remember that if you don't listen there's coming a sewing of what a reaping of what you sewed that's not Mom and Dad they don't want it for you but you bring it on you because you harden your heart you don't need to love us as parents that just comes naturally you need to honor them amen it says here honor thy father and thy mother that's the the Commandment Exodus 2012 write it on your your cupboard if you need to put it on your phone whatever you need to do kids remind yourself of this this is very important because we want you to succeed we want you to walk with God we had our chance we messed it up we made mistakes we paid for them you don't need to walk that way this message has overcoming power you don't need to Walk This Way the prophet of God says you don't need to go you can overcome there's enough Holy Spirit here that will raise you Above This filth of this world you don't need to worry about you can overcome but what you should do is what the Bible tells you to do it says honor the father and mother and here's your promise that your days May Bel long in the land that the Lord God has given you now Hine and Phineas didn't listen to Eli what happened who knows the story they died because they didn't hearken into the voice of their father they died and they transgressed the law of God and they died there was a penalty of death here no not saying all of you going to die but spiritually you might die because you think you're something the Bible says just honor them didn't say figure out what he sometimes I preach to Reuben and Li and they like have no idea what I just said but when I say can you please go to your room they go yes Dad fine they still honor what I said later in life when they have children guess what Revelation comes but all you need to do now is just listen to your mom and dad don't say you always have to agree listen to them they're there for you it says here in Colossians 3:20 so I'm not just pulling this is scripture this is the Lord telling us just listen to this it says children obey your parents in all things for It is Well pleasing unto the Lord so there's there's something that if you listen just to Mom and Dad God says bro I got your back still you walk between you and God but you're doing well don't worry we're going to the dads now so but but we'll get there so now here's the here's the and we're almost there man I'm trying to get through this I just got a couple of slides left okay we'll go fast and it came that the man of God went to Eli and said to him thus sayith the Lord um I didn't I plainly appear to you in the house of thy father when you were in Egypt and Pharaoh's house and then I chose you out of out of the tribes of of Israel to be my priest to offer upon my altar the burning in incense so it was a privilege for Eli and and his dad and and all his family to walk with God but see Eli was walking with God but he wasn't raising his children right because that that rebuke was was for me just yeah the people told me you're wrong there was I just don't feel there was an urgency to to go and and shake them and go man when your dad wants to shake you it's when he knows you're so wrong right now that you're standing at this Crossroad and if I just can't get through to you you will see it was we want you to succeed but now what happened is because he put his sons before God and this is what happens he says to wear the little e for but will is go a bit where KCK ye at My Sacrifice at my offering which I've commanded into the habitation and honorous thou Sons above me so instead of them just taking them and giving them a massive box law and chasing them out of the church and say you know what if you're that bad just rather go but don't transgress against God he still left them in their position still left them to do what they did yeah oh boys don't do it sorry don't do it but you're still priests knowing that they still transgressing God so there was a reaping for that it's a it's a happy service don't worry we're getting there I want you I want you to realize that the love the love that God talks about agapo loveia is the love that your father has for you to see that you're going wrong it is it is something more than just a feel your love it's God stepping into your dad and trying to guide you as a young man and young woman and and I'm talking about the dad because the dad is the the head of the house and the and the wife is underneath him but the dad is the one that that has to sometimes just deliver the male as it is and guess what you hate him for it sometimes you do come on man but when your dad correct you just loved him always hey oh thanks Dad you hate him for it sometimes because he says sorry you can't go tomorrow with so and so because I don't trust that guy is that love I was so angry at my dad one day I slammed the door in his face was that love so all of us are subject he never said love your dad he said just do it just do it because or else there's a a reaping wherefore the Lord of God of Israel say I said indeed that their house is the house of the father that walk before me forever but now the Lord saith be AAR from me them that honor me will I honor and they that um uh despise me shall I lightly esteem so now all the good work that Eli did all his life but he didn't look after his children he just let them do whatever they want to he didn't get desperate enough had a had a reward and the sons that couldn't humble themselves to listen to their dad now had a reward and he says they shall be no old man in thy house and his lineage died so the promise that God says in the Ten Commandments he says that the that when they spoke to Jesus said what is the two greatest Commandments love the Lord thy God and love your neighbors love everyone as you love yourself but see that love is not aili your love that's man this is serious stuff so if you love your dad with a agapo love you would listen to him you don't need to love him with a feel your love right now when he gave you the news have a gapo love for him know that he's trying really hard to do the best for you guys amen so because they didn't follow this there was a a reaping okay dads fathers provoke not your children to anger least they be discouraged so this is when us as dads step in and we want to fix it we want to and because right now what he did annoyed you so much and I'm so guilty of it and that's why I said I had to eat the sermon today you act out of carnality out of f your love that you lose right at that situation because the the honesty of your child or the dumbness of him or the whatever had you so frustrated now you just act out now the kids are laughing they're like and you do something that is just ridiculous and you're so angry with yourself because that's just what you did you discouraged them because you didn't God don't do it with you every time you sin but we do it with our boys every time they sin we just kicked them in the face man bye I told you go to your room shut up and end of the time you're thinking what did I just do you just discouraged your children because you would did it out of anger and sometimes I have to count to 100 cuz 10 don't do it and 100 is far I lost count to 50 and I to start over and that makes me every AG agree so just send them away go talk to the Lord about it I I don't do it good either but this is what I got today because I'm supposed to represent Christ and Christ had when I was lost in the world didn't just come and cut me off and send me to hell he knew when to call me so sometimes you might not speak on that and you might be very very angry just turn around and say hold that thought and walk away because there will be a time where you can sit with him and talk to him and win him to Christ because then you speak out of divine love then you speak with agapo love but when you lose Filly Your Love Don't Speak CU then you hurt then you throw punches Ephesians 6:1-4 children again this is for you obey your parents for this is thank you he's still awake for this is right okay honor thy father and thy mother not understand your father and mother not love thy father and mother honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may be well with the and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nature and admonition of the Lord the what the nature of the Lord so leave your carnality stay with love I had a couple of notes that we will skip on cuz I see you all you're all dwindling it's just because it's such small writing I can't read it there that's why I had this one okay now I picked on the fathers I picked on the mothers now we're going to pick on the husbands but first the wives he says give thanks always to all things of God the Father this is Ephesians 5:20 submitting yourselves one to another in fear of God wives submit yourself unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so if you want to see if you want to see if a a wife is submitted to her husband or if she's really submitted to God look how she deals with her husband think just let it drop if she's treating a husband really bad she's being Miss Bossy boots and all those things and just one her way and what guess what how she's treating God it's the same because God is the head of your husband and if your husband is not in his position you're under headship of God so how you talk to your husband is how you talk to God if he's in or out doesn't matter because if you're under God and your husband's not under God you'll treat your husband as if he's God you won't always agree with everything to him but you'll have reverence for him you'll have you'll honor him because he might be out of his position but you're still in your position Christ is still your head and you by your prayers like brother Brandon Met the story where the three drunkards was was drinking and and the sister brings them all back because she was in fellowship with God she still honored a husband he came in he was drunk and he pretended to be drunk and she still went about a business still loved him was still soft just just didn't understand what's going on but she was just pushing on and she won three souls to Christ so the thing is the honoring your husband is not condoning what he's doing if he's not in Christ it's how you talk to Christ you will talk to your husband if you find yourself not talking to your husband like you should talk to Christ you got a problem there you need to take it before the Lord because when I read this it says why submit yourself um as unto the Lord as the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subjected to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything subject it means I just do it now hold on I know there's now a lot of thoughts going follow me okay don't miss me now I do this in love because I sat and I asked the Lord just just show me this he says your husband is not serving the lord you serve the Lord first but you stay loving your husband Christ is your head if you love Christ with all your heart you will love your husband with all your heart and that love that you have will bring your husband back into his position because if the love for a the sunite woman could bring healing for a child then love for your husband can bring him back to God it's a it's a it's more than just feel your love this is deep love aapo love not turning a blind eye to what he does if he's in or not or whatever it's loving him like you love Christ and if you can do that your husband will be a king and you will be the queen amen he says wife submit your husband um yourselves unto your own husbands as it's fit in the Lord so remember the Lord May guide you as well we know there's been a lot of lot of how can you say Shenanigans a lot of things happen that would hurt husband and wife it's a very sacred place and and Satan will always try to tear you two apart that is his job he just wants to what God brings together he just wants to break but but as a wife if you respect and honor your head you will get the reward for it you'll reap what you sow hold on husbands love your wives I've got 10 minutes left I'll finish I'll five slides just all are you all still there I'm not fighting I'm talking about love I'm talking about a gapo love I'm not talking about just love your husband cuz he bought you something nice or he's giving you flowers or a hamburger my wife loves hamburgers more than flowers I'm sure of it I always buy her hamburger flowers are too expensive husbands if they bring the price of flowers down I'll buy a flowers okay husbands no I'll get you flowers one day I promise husbands love your wives it's on record even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so you as a husband you've got a commission your commission James and you're going to see it soon as it says love your wife he says but you must give yourself to her so now that it sees us she's not just submitting to you but you're submitting to her as well because Christ gave his life to us as a church he went and paid the ultimate um penalty punishment by death for us his blood was shed for us that's you and your wife even if she asked you to wash the dishes I just said that you go I can help you because you know what you're in it together but see Divine love God's love is whatever she asks it means a lot to you like King azerus when Esther came before him whatever she asked he stopped the whole thing that was going on pointed out his scepter to him and says come in my queen what do you want how was divine love and all she asked him what was she doesn't say wash the dishes just for your sisters she said I just want to spend time with you I've got something that's bothering me but I need some time with you and what did he do he went to a feast he didn't ignore her he spent time with her and he had to do it twice because she wasn't really ready to share this with him she was in fear and then she she asked him again can he come again and the next night that's when hmon was exposed but sometimes your wife might ask you Brothers for a bit of time and that's where we must be sensitive and stop and listen to what her wife says because she's got something that's concerning her and she she wants to talk to you you have to lay everything aside even your own life for your wife as Christ did it for us he says so ought men to love their wives verse 28 wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself now love I love you L cuz I love myself and I'll tell you why because the old me I hated but the one that God is busy making I'm loving every day because I can see more of him in my life I can see more of of what he's doing in my life situations can be desperate and and things can be like brother um Isaac preached you can be in a desolate place real far in here absolutely struggling with something but your wife will come and says lover you right and all I have to say for her just pray for me and I know it will go better see the love that's Divine love we need to have this operate in our church we need to have it operate amongst go don't go feel your love don't go paper thin it goes more than that you Brothers husbands loves your wives and be not bitter against them it said husbands understand your wives no nobody can understand a woman not even themselves Point finish CLA okay they can't they're all laughing but they know it's true all your sisters know it's true okay they the most up and down in their heads whatever can be you can be on the mountain The Valley in the Mountain Valley go where are you I'm very angry okay she's on the valley I'm happy oh yeah I can watch dishes yes watch dishes she's happy again yes she's happy again leave the dishes watch the dishes she's in the valley she's in the valley so sometimes we as husbands we just have to do things that we don't like to do but remember they don't understand themselves but it doesn't tell you understand them it says husbands love your wife CU you will never understand them and you young men that ever think you can buy a book that is how woman Works they ain't such a book because it would be written by a woman and halfway she disagreed with what she had written in the first place and then we have to start again she never got past page 10 it's true okay there's a little bit of humor I'm just saying but those who keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know that um what that we are in him that we that we are in him so if you want to know one John says if you want to know if you have God's perfect love in your heart in your life in every situation the very first thing you need to do is is what keep his word if you keep his word all other things just works out keeping his word is sometimes the hardest thing to do because we try to understand God he didn't say understand my word he says just keep my word this is like the dad saying to the son boy just don't do this right now and it doesn't matter if you understand why your dad says this or how this ties it beautifully and I want you to realize it just says just keep my word because in that I know that love is perfected in you because when you don't understand your dad that's when you need love I'll finish with this so here's the story of Peter and I'll just quickly tell it because that's where we end and then the musicians can come up I'll call you now Peter goes to Jesus and he says to Jesus when before Jesus went up to be crucified he said said to Jesus I will die with you I'm just paraphrasing cuz I know it's bit late I'll die with you I'll go and I'll die with you and Jesus says you will deny me three times so Peter loved the Lord but he didn't really truly understand what love was at that moment because his love is I'll die for you and of course all the disciples went yes we'll die with you and then the Lord said to them the Sheep will scatter when they catch me all your sheep will scatter I'm just paraphrasing I wanted to read it but you go read it Matthew 26:26 you can't miss it 2626 Matthew 2626 go read it okay and then he tells them this is what's going to happen and they go no it won't happen because they were excited because this was after it was the Passover and he broke the bread and he says drink eat the bread for it's my body and he says drink the wine for it's my blood of the New Testament and they have and they finished up the service with a him so they had a service so everybody walks out of there and Jesus is starting to tell them that this is what's going to happen and because they still under the influence of a cool service and Camp was going it was easy to love one another and it was easy to say yeah I'll die for you brother fish easy I got your back I'll die for you but that still feel your love he did not understand what Jesus was saying and then Jesus because he loves him back says you will deny me three times because he knew that Peter didn't know this love that he was talking about right now he didn't know what love is he knew filo love but he didn't know agap love so what happens Peter denies him 2669 he goes and denies him and he even swears he curses and I don't know this guy I have a oath I don't know him and he walks away from the Lord and he says and Peter wept bitterly so now everything happened the Road he looks at Jesus he knew oh mate it's all done I've I've messed up now Revelation hits his heart because now he understood that he didn't have the love that he just spoke about when he said Lord I'll die with you because if you really loved the Lord now here Here Comes Satan in hammers him if you really loved the Lord you would have been on your cross too if you really was a Christian I hope you're following me you'll do the right thing you will never say bad thing to the sister or brother because you got a Goa you just didn't understand love yet so Peter Peter does this and he's just you know what he gives up he says I I'm going back fishing I'm just going to go back fishing and his real real heart sore and broken and the Lord Jesus comes their way and they throw the net over the the boat and they haven't caught fish all day and Jesus didn't forget Peter though Peter didn't understand love God knew love and he knew Peter had it in in him though you don't understand love that doesn't mean you don't have it in you cuz that's the Holy Ghost within you that loves people so God knows you've got that love he's just going to send you a couple of Trials which you will miserably fail so that you can get Revelation so that you would understand that you're not you have a deeper love because when Peter failed he knew he didn't have that love at least he knew what he didn't have but then Jesus came his way and he says you throw that knet on the right hand side of the boat man and they hold fishes and it says and a disciple that loved God said to Peter it is the Messiah and Peter this is what the Bible says you go read it John 211 to1 17 okay go listen to this again you need it GS himself CU he was naked jumps in the water so he puts on a coat to swim why would you want to take close off to go swim see what I mean here he knew he was approaching Messiah he knew he was going to God so the very thing he did is he made himself decent and then he jumped in the water where I thought he would throw the coat off and then jump in because it's going to be dead way dragging it into the shore and the boat followed him that man was paddling Coten oil but he was dressed right and he was so desperate then to get to God because the motive behind it is I can see him I can fix this you didn't have to fix this but still his motive was I can fix this I got another chance that's your chance and then Jesus says to him he says hey Peter do you love me and Peter of course very quick on the trigger goes yeah Lord I love you and he says feed my lambs and then Peter goes on and he thought man I just redeemed myself there and he goes hey Peter yeah do you love me and he goes yeah of course Lord I love you I love you he says feed my sheep it says here in the third time he says he says Peter do you love me he says Lord you knowest all things you know I love you now that love was a different love that was a agapo love because he said the word knows all things and I love you I love the word I love everything that you give me now he said go and feed my sheep now Jesus wanted to teach him something and say listen before you quickly say you love a brother and a sister before you quickly say you love one another or you love me do you really love me and if you would leave love me you will believe my word very very easy amen musicians you can come forward I will bring this back with this last slide and it is 9 o00 on the dot so sorry I took a little bit longer but it was a you shouldn't let me bring slides cuz then I go too long hey I'll just stop with slides it says love should govern a home so brothers sisters all of you love should govern a home love is the greatest force that was ever put in the power of man listen to what the prophet says it was the greatest force that ever was put into the power of man so you have a power you have a force within you that is so strong that it could it could break a nuclear bomb heading your way there was a the there was a a maniac that went to Brother brandham to go and punch his lights out because he didn't agree with pastors and he was and he already you all know the story but I'll just tell you anyways and there was already a a slogan on this guy he punches preachers out when they preach brother brandham saw this man coming out and this man said I will Te You limb from limb and brother brandham used to be a boxer and he could easily go into the love the F of love and lose his calm and knock that guy back cuz brother brandom could box but he looked at the man and divine love started projecting and he says he's got a family that's a man just like any of us and this man got so angry and he ran up to go and hit the prophet and the Lord stepped in and he said today you'll fall at my feet and that man fell at the feet of brother brandom wasn't God doing the brother bam doing the fighting it was God standing for his word standing for his Prophet but the prophet did not act out of that way the prophet act out of love divine love CU I believe truly he did believe that man and he did love that man that man just loved that Spirit more than him Jesus Christ it g goes a home that is not disciplined by love is not much of a home if a husband and a wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other that is why I think instead of resting upon faith upon some emotion or some gift like shouting and speaking in tongues like that sister that was sincerely playing piano she just did not love the Lord yet with aapo loves she was still a babe is there all other things that we take for saying that we have the Holy Spirit when we do this those things are all right but if you come back to the principle loved first and then those things I think our church would progress a lot faster if we could get God first and God is love so at the end of the day it is is the Lord Jesus Christ doing all the work but how we choose how we choose to react to one another could uh seal the deal or it could break the deal could bring a world of of hurt or it could bring a world of healing so I hope this encourage you I I don't really like doing it always this way with slides because it kind of limits me to having to follow a a slide show Dads love your sons love your daughters Sons respect your dads honor them you can love them later when you have children and you realize what true love is when you're young you don't know love you don't as much as you say it you have no revelation of what love means until your child stands before you one day you will know what love is but still honor them and respect them and husbands your job is to look after your wife because it's God husband wife children don't forget that and wives your husband will look after you if you pray for him you stay humble you just submit yourself to him you'll feel like a king he'll treat you like a queen amen and brothers and sisters remember if we treat each other with love and respect we will reap the fruit that we do God will have preeminence in every service and souls will come to rest in this place because we stayed humble let us just bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord I always just mix up words father you know sometimes just speak English and self-defense father but Lord truly you showed me something today Lord that humbled my heart so much Lord is Lord that sometimes when I think I love people Lord I don't because I'm just a a m moral Lord with limited understanding father limited patience and sometimes a temper Lord

Just Surrender everything teach us your your love Lord teach us to be more humble and more soft natur towards one another Lord Lord cuz we don't know what is going on in the heart of man Lord you know that and father if we have any ought against a brother or against a sister or a dad or a mom or even a son or a daughter Lord we want to come and lay it before the altar tonight here Lord and say father forgive us may we go and fix that Lord and in a a gapo love Lord may we go and and project Divine love Lord because you said father if if love is projected then Grace steps in Father Lord we ask that everyone we love will love like you love us father and that you would just be gracious unto us Lord and to help us understand one another a little bit better and Lord as we walk here Shak now Lord we want to just ask be with our pastor tonight and his family we did ask him before Lord but please be with him father we see that there's many of battles that goes his way Lord many darts fired in his way sometimes and Lord he holds back a lot Lord for us because he waits on you Lord and I pray that you would lead him with your Holy Spirit father in such a way that he will continue in the healing Ministry with brother Ben Lord and may many Souls come Lord to Glory through his ministry father and Lord may we just help him as much as we can for one another and Lord may this this whole
