speak tonight on the order of battle and uh don't go anywhere musicians yet we just want to sing one more song soon but um I want to do the prayer discussion now because I don't want to come out of an atmosphere and land the plane and then try and take off again at the end of the prayer meeting so and we're just going to discuss our prayer needs now and so you can be seated and then we will go into the word of God and then just trusting the Lord uh tonight that we will we will we'll go amen because it's not us it's him right amen hallelujah and we're going to do what he has prescribed and then he's going to act a test battle who believes that tonight is God's battle right amen hallelujah it's not our battle and actually I'm going to speak on the order of battle tonight and so I you know we get the usual prayer requests and I just felt on my heart to mention this at the start was um um the boys you know they always ask for prayer for their friends you know their school friends and I'm sure you've all got friends we've all got friends that we want saved I mean we wouldn't be human if we didn't want people saved right so these people that we face out in the world and we rub shoulders with and you know can be influenced by on a good and a positive and a negative way um out there in the world we deep down want them saved can I have an Amen on that one we want them in heaven and so tonight I just want to entice you to war for your friends so you know all you boys Reuben and Liam and Abe's and all you guys that and school children and doesn't matter whether you're young or older or whatever let's pray for our friends hey man Hallelujah so that's a recurring per request boys we're praying for your friends and you're praying for your friends because you've got power with God Amen you've wrestled with the angel amen hallelujah um I'm just going to go through these prayer requests but while I'm just finding that is there anybody that's got something that they would like to discuss prayer wise or like to you know they've got on their heart to pray for can you please share that Shannon [Music] but they were going to discuss whether they she needed a stint or a bypass yeah which is amazing and um and I'm hoping I mean this is my desire that the Lord can use it to bring them to the end time message to get them ready for a Rapture because not only do we want people in heaven but we don't want amen amen Joe and Jillian [Music] Paul [Music] I believe sister sepi is listening amen and so she will be fighting with us in The Ether amen she's at home in her battle room

Tyler for her husband Lindsay whose friend was has passed away and um she just really wants to see the Lord move in her husband's life and I believe that God can answer prayer amen for these things as a desire of a heart amen hallelujah we've seen God do amazing things hallelujah amen we've heard stories of God do amazing things who believes he's still the same he still does amazing things right Hallelujah I can tell you in my own life he's still doing amazing things Hallelujah I think we could stand here and testify all night about how amazing awesome God is and so tonight you know we've put the set the battle is set in the rain I want to tell you that we are at War we're not going into a war we are at War and the only time we're coming out of that is when there's a new Heaven A New Earth and the devil's gone on the Lake of Fire it's it's so just don't get too comfortable I just want to encourage you especially your young children you know and and teenagers and that don't get too comfy because we're at War and comfortableness will come over us and scale over our eyes and we'll just take it easy but there's actually a raging devil and he's wanting to kill us and destroy us and blind us and and limit us but tonight we fight we're in a mission room tonight and the whole order of services geared towards the battle do you know that the whole religious service I'll get into the preaching soon sorry the whole religious service is all about God coming in at the end to battle to fight to fight against his enemy and our enemy to defeat him in every life to realize what he did at Calvary everything that he purchased he will come to fight for you and fight for me he's a God of War and he's our god of war and we've been enlisted in his army Hallelujah and so we have Jillian and Joe for Revelation and to that the Lord will bring them in when weather for Saturday Robin's sister Robin's eye sister sippy and um [Music] [Music] little Hospital and then through that situation like Shannon got talking to him because she would it was just something how she went back to see him [Music] through that conversation she found out he was a Christian and they prayed together therefore was that right for his wife at the hospital but he was rushing to go and see because he thought she could be deadly yeah she he gets there yeah so it wasn't just a it was an unusual [Music] wow so it's yeah yeah it was also on a Monday and then that night we had the youth service oh wow oh wow yeah amen God is good God is good amen and we want to pray for Heinz and Noel your teachers yep that they'll have peace pray for Noel's teachers that they'll have peace you know the world can only give so much peace but Jesus gives real peace from within and the only unfortunately out in the world the only way that someone's going to get lasting Pieces by coming to the Lord amen let's just pray I'm not this is not the prayer but I'm just going to pray and bring these before the Lord let's stand Lord Jesus Hallelujah father you heard the requests they've gone into your ears Lord and father we've read many times in scripture throughout scripture that when your children bring requests before you Lord if there's a devil involved that Devil's finished if there's any skullduggery going on it's finished because you're coming on the scene Lord to change situations to heal to bring restoration to cast out Devils to raise the dead to cleanse the lepers to let the gospel and power be preached and let people get saved through salvation and rest to the people and father Lord but we lift these requests before you and now Lord Jesus music and Lord and now the word and now the battle will come after that Lord Jesus so that is the order of battle Lord and we believe father that tonight Lord Jesus when these ingredients come together Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever we're we're counting on you Lord we're believing that you will operate we're believing that you will come and sweep through this place like never before and and fight fight with the sword and fight for us and and stand Lord Jesus for us as we stand for you Lord we're we're bringing the order of service through Lord as you've prescribed as it was prescribed right through the scriptures Lord that you said send the priests with the trumpets send the music forth to worship create an atmosphere of War where an atmosphere would come down and remove the fear and remove the doubts and the unbelief and the carnality of the people and then the word would go forth the ark would go forth and then following that would be the soldiers with the swords and they would fight Lord and you would come down and you would miss the enemy Lord and the enemy be defeated and so tonight Lord we're counting on you we're believing Lord that you will fulfill you're part of the deal for we're doing our part with all of our heart and Faith Lord we've yielded and we're believing that's all we can do is yield and believe and do what you've said Lord that's all and now tonight Lord you've heard the prayer you've heard the Cry of your people and you know even The Unsung prayers and Lord those things that are on every one of our hearts and all the things that we face in life and the struggles and the the everything you know it all Lord Jesus come on our behalf tonight oh God in Jesus name let the blood Cry Freedom and Jesus Christ's name amen let's just sing a little song before we let's just sing that song um I'm amazed that you love me just the chorus just a time or two and then the musicians can [Music] head down I'm Amazed [Music] that you love me I'm a man how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found and my sins are one they're all washed away all my sins [Music] foreign [Music] they're all washed away all my sins Hallelujah amen thank you musicians Hallelujah there's any good to us tonight Hallelujah amen I want to speak tonight while you're standing man am I going to read from verses 1 to 10. I want to speak on the order of battle the order of battle has an order War has rules you know that there's rules of war in God's economy and the devil has to obey them he can't cross them he's on a leash and he's controlled he's controlled and there's an order of battle that the Lord has set in place amen and I just want you to have faith tonight and believe right this is real simple stuff tonight real real simple but I want you to believe together with me we yield and we believe okay do we have a deal do we have a yielding and believing deal tonight amen you know oftentimes we yield and surrender but we're not actively believing but you know let's yield surrender and belief really have faith because that's what moves God it wasn't the shout or the physical shout that moved golden batamas time it was the faith shop how loud is your faith sharding tonight how loud is your face shouting Hallelujah you can your face can shout louder than any scream of humanity any any word that's verbal but your thoughts the faith of God and you can it was louder it can move Heaven it can shake the Earth it can move the universe oh my sorry I'm gonna just let you sit down a second yeah I've been chewing on this for a while so now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in even the thought of facing Us in battle oh sorry that's my notes I won't read that sorry I had them and I had it in parenthesis sorry and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thy hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor think about that right that's not just some he gives all into your hand amen every devil including Lucifer and you shall come past the city all you Men of War and go round about the city once thus shall you do six days and seven priests now notice priests and I want to talk a little bit about musicians you know and this isn't a musical thing but I just want to say that musicians are priests so don't belittle your position if you're called to an instrument you're called to a priesthood right a specific priesthood it's an access given anointing that's a priesthood so let me just let you sit down soon so shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns and the seventh day you shall come past the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets amen aren't you glad for the seventh day who believes we're in that day today Hallelujah where there's a great sound going forth a voice say man and a shouting and a music a new song because why you've been given it God gave you a new song Amen when the seals open amen hallelujah and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast which is a jubilee which with the Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout hallelujah who's thankful for the shout of the king that's in the camp amen there's a shout of the king in this camp tonight oh my I just feel real good right now with a great shout not just any shout this is a great shout and I'll talk about the definition of that in a second it's very good and the wall of the city shall fall down flat everything that held Rahab and all her family and that sin was broken at the shout hallelujah and the wall of the city shall fall off and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him turn not to the left to the right fight your enemy head on tonight don't deviate don't don't listen to your flesh that'll say don't go and enter and just pray and then get it done and then sorry and Joshua the son of none called the priests and said unto them take up the Ark of the Covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the people pass on and come past the city and let him that is armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord see that there's the music then the word so we've done music and we've done word and now what are we waiting for and it shall come to pass when Joshua has spoken unto the people that the Prince Seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of Ram's horns passed on before the Lord and blew the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priest that blew with the trumpets and the reward which is the people from behind come after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice and neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout Oh Glory oh man that just makes me feel good Hallelujah then you shall Shout you may be seated the prophet says here the word led the way when it got to the Jordan she opened up and they went over now we're just going back a little bit but we're going to come back to where we were went over his first campaign he put things first things first he had a reason for that he had a reason because God had commissioned him stay with the word let the word do it I just like that tonight let the word do it and I feel very much inspired to read a bit of scripture tonight and so the Lord's inspired me to go through some scriptures about him fighting the battle for us and when I read it I just please let's have faith this let's just believe together let I want to stir your conscience I want to stir you up and when we read the word remember it's the word of God we're not just reading scriptures we're reading the heart of God and I've asked the Lord already that the same spirit that inspired that writer would speak through me tonight to as I read it because can you imagine the anointing yeah when those writers Paul and Isaiah and Ezekiel and David when they were under that inspiration and God came and they scribed what we're about to read I just pray Lord may you magnify the the the glory of the word because as we read this word you see what we're doing is we're letting the Levites carry the ark into battle so we've done music right we've done the worship we're bringing an atmosphere for war an atmosphere for deliverance what is Deliverance it's War an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost baptism what is that that's War it's an overthrowing of governments the Old Government gets overthrown in your life and a new government comes in it's a war the whole thing is centered around a battle and the battle is godwins and the devil loses Hallelujah so what we've done is the priests have been up here now now I know that sounds funny but the priests have been playing the piano and the priests have been playing the organ and the guitars you guys are priests or priestesses you could say is that a right thing to say I don't know but but you see what I mean there's a there's this Divine access gone forth and that you can see that there is an anointing on the people there's an anointing on the musicians because they realize that they've got an office that is treasured they've got an office that is Anointed there's part of this priesthood what is it for it's to create an atmosphere it's an atmosphere where the fear drops off the people so when you walk in the service you may have had an atmosphere of arguing or an atmosphere or something that you need that but as soon as that music started the atmosphere changed and you get into an atmosphere where the devil can get defeated amen and that's what it's all about that's why God would send the music before the ark he'd send the music because why because all the soldiers were scared they were scared they were real fearful can you imagine I would be scared oh my you think about it you've got a sword and you're going to fight these big hairy beasts of men that are going to try and kill you it's physical oh man it would have been pretty scary what did they need they needed something to change the atmosphere because no doubt when they were standing there and they're shaking ready and but there's a lot of bravado going on but then the music starts and all of a sudden yeah now it becomes spiritual now it's not just a physical War see a god Israel had to fight as a physical War but there was a spiritual Overture over the wall God had a spiritual dominance over it but still they physically fought it oh my but you see when that music started the priest would go you know no doubt the enemy did he probably just thought they were crazy like what are they doing and that would have disarm them a bit oh man these guys are just loose you know like and and so you know they would have gone okay well they'll let down there but then the Israelites under that anointing they realized Jehovah's here yeah There's A Change of Atmosphere I'm Ready for War now because something's changes Beyond me yeah yeah and there it is it's something that changes that's beyond you that's why we have music and that's why you know we spend a lot of investment not just Financial but time and and effort and heart and prayer into the music into the band into each instrument you know it's a Ministry and it's there to cast Devils you know David he casts Devils off that's a very powerful thing Elijah he was having a hard day so he got a Minstrel and change his atmosphere now there's time for war because God would step in and now he would speak he would release the word over the Earth through a prophet and then the battle would come and the dead would be raised and their sick would be healed and lies would be changed the vision of the Lord would be revealed yeah amen amen amen and so here we are changing the atmosphere and we've done it in faith I just want to encourage you when we come up here and we play we're playing in faith because we've got a there's a vision in mind the vision is Victory the vision is War and the devil's defeat and he'll try everything he can to hold on to his ground and squat in our land and try and keep things from us but he is finished he's done he's scared too you know that said that Jericho was straightly shut up no one coming in and no one going out see even the thought of you praying shakes the devil and he gets all conscientious and he gets all he gets very much anxious about you do you know what he does he shuts everything up tries to shut you up yeah you know what you sit in service and you'll get all like tied it up and the mind battles will come flying oh I just can't wait for this to be over tomorrow's gonna be a good day oh my and and this one said this to me and he said she said or whatever the devil will try it yeah he tries it on me so I know he's trying it on you so you can't get away from this but you see what is he doing he's anxious when you get my medals in the services because the devil's afraid he's scared of you he's scared that if you really break through tonight that he's gonna get cast out loosen away and cast into out of Darkness he's not even going to have pigs to go into he's going straight into out of Darkness straight where he cannot come back oh my help me Lord Hallelujah and so that's why I just say look I just want to encourage you no matter how you feel no matter what day you've had doesn't matter whether you've been a successful Christian or not today the blood of Jesus makes it right for you Hallelujah we've come into an atmosphere where fear has fallen off unbelief has fallen off doubts have fallen off resentment falls off it might come back again sometime but right now it's off so now why don't you fight the devil in that atmosphere of War that's what it's all about so the music Goes Forth the atmosphere changes and then the word goes for and now the ark's going forth on the shoulders of the Levi we're bringing the word why because if you put the word first all things will be added unto you and this the prophet said let the word do it yeah we're not just reading some philosophy that's right hallelujah amen man I need a drink okay I'm almost done actually like that was pretty much the thought so Hallelujah I'm trusting in the Lord this is not a typical Andy style I feel like rolling my sleeves up Hallelujah what happens when you roll your sleeves up Hallelujah I've never actually done this before but this shirt's quite hot Hallelujah now we're ready let's fight Hallelujah oh my I believe that we're ready for battle we're together we're in the war together right with comrades Hallelujah comrades together on the winning team amen it's totally rigged we're totally won already Hallelujah the devil's just he's just defeated all right whenever the devil's future is bad his past is bad and now it's going to be even worse you know that when I look back I see Victory after Victory after Victory I don't look back and see oh this person did this and that one did them I failed there and no no I see Victory after Victory after Victory and when I look forward I see Victory after Victory after Victory and right now we're gonna walk in Victory I'm not worried about what I feel I'm not worried about mine nothing tonight we pray tonight we fight the enemy and you know what it's gonna be God that fights the enemy in our lives through us because he said he would do it we're just following the prescription what is the prescription bring the worship change the atmosphere bring an atmosphere give me Glory worship God and then the word and then the battle and the battle oh my you think of the time when Jehoshaphat you know they were had all the enemy coming in on them and Jehoshaphat was a righteous man before the Lord and so he got down and he started praying and God says fear not Jehoshaphat don't worry I've got this and even though all odds were stacked against little tiny Judah yeah little tiny Judah all these big enemies coming in God says don't worry and I say tonight no matter how big your enemy is no matter how hard it seems no matter what it is we've got a big God who's able to hold it he made whole armies hundreds of thousands of people just disappear oh my God you know what the next day after you know they just kind of had a meeting and they prayed and then all of a sudden it changed and I believe tonight it can happen the same because he's the same and all of a sudden the atmosphere changed and then a prophecy went forward and if God bring into prophesy Freedom over you and prophesy Deliverance to prophesy your enemies to fix Hallelujah gone finished the enemy's finished he's finished no matter how long he's been striving at you and how long he's been holding you down let a little music come forth yeah let your new song Hey listen just release it a new release you know what a new release you know the world the devil's got we'll follow them new releases new releases Kidder all over the place and everyone's like oh what about your new release there's a new release tonight release it out hold nothing back tonight this is the end of troubles this is the end now I won't say it's the end of Trials but whatever's troubling you tonight God can deliver you your end of Trials will be in the Rapture oh my and all of those things is ordered of the Lord until then oh my you know you think oh man what's next but that's all right because God takes us through everything and no matter what you how you've handled it it's one no matter how you handle you might be the greatest Christian through this trial in the next trial it's a bit harder and you kind of just Coast through and roll out of it on the ground and you think man but but praise God it's over you know what and that means now you look back you don't see some negative thing you see a positive thing you see a defeated devil on the ground done Hallelujah oh my Prophet says this I'm just going to continue that quote no they went put the word first that's where we were stay with the word let the word do it every campaign they went forth in the battle because God had charged him to put the ark first after the ark went forth what went forth then singing that she was around the other way players with of instruments but they also sung after the ark that was singing the whole time players of instruments before the fight took place Hallelujah that's what we need today it's what we have this morning singers instruments playing music rejoicing then put the word first read the word and I'm about to do that then the battle sets in amen who believes that tonight we'll have faith tonight then the battle sets in that's what I'm believing for tonight that's the burden I asked the god what is your burden what do you want Lord Jesus to do tonight and this is the what came so let's just believe that God wants to fight for you he wants to enter into the struggles that you're facing right now he wants to stand in and see so that you can see the salvation of the Lord Hallelujah doesn't matter how hard or how long or how wide it's finished because God is fighting for you and tonight we're going to walk together in a fight and we're going to pray together like we pray before pray Hallelujah that's what we need today is what we had this morning singers issue is playing music rejoicing then put the word first read the word then the battle sets in we're bound to win just got to win stay right with it keep its direction and it will keep you in the hour of trouble but Hebrews 11 30 to 34 says by face the walls of Jericho fell down hey man that's a big thing right we read it so much it becomes common but it's big God does big things Hallelujah let today be a big day a real good big day for you and a real bad big day for the enemy Hallelujah I'm inciting you tonight amen whoa whoa Hallelujah all the comforts you might go back to but tonight is different tonight we fight tonight think big God's big Hallelujah if there's any information coming to your brain right now that's negative cast it away we won't we won't look at you and go why are you saying stuff in the service because we realize that there's an enemy a real one and he's trying to swat our minds and he's trying to take a mind over here and a mind over there and connect those demons to try and get you both thinking because he works through men to create trouble but if he can't work through people he's got no power so tonight cast every imagination down for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds by faith the walls

devil's advantages is nothing he ain't got no Advantage you've got an advantage because before even he was created or even before it oh you rejected everything that he did in God's mind you stood for truth in heaven before the devil was even on the Earth Hallelujah that's what the prophet says we stood we rejected the devil's a lie in the beginning it's our Eternal identity if we rejected it there we'll reject it here if we receive it then we will receive it here that's why there's an eternal identity that you're being connected back to that's why you can receive the word because you've been connected to that Eternal part um who turned to fight the armies of aliens Deuteronomy 21 to 4 it says when thou ghost out to battle against thine enemies and see us horses and chariots and a people

Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh be Hallelujah do you believe that tonight all these things Shedrick Michigan a bit ago they were in the fire yeah and it didn't even smell imagine the power of God and the furnace if you go near a fire you stink of smoke right yeah God does impossible things amen you may be in a furnace tonight but just remember that all that's going to do is take your bonds off and if your friends are in there too their bonds will loose in the furnace fire burn only the thing that was detrimental to them but they actually got stronger you know why because the fourth man came and it got in fellowship with them so don't think that God doesn't go with you in those trials he's with you right he's in there and somehow you know when us right in this world and there's Flames all around you don't even smell powerful yes that's real Deliverance to me Hallelujah Hallelujah only with nine oh a thousand shall

refuge even the most higher thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come neither thy dwelling and I've been saying that a lot lately because I don't like plagues and I don't like colds I don't like viruses and I hate them and they get cast out all the time amen amen I will never accept it I just wanted to encourage you never never accept the devil's colds never accept those viruses never accept sickness never accept mental illness never accept any box of snakes that he tries to throw at you never accept it there might be symptoms all over you but you still stand and not accept it don't own it never take ownership he'll try everything but he cannot take you never let your faith accept anything that he tries to give you yes one Thessalonians one five for us gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake one Corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power this is New Testament stuff now Philippians 4 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengthen us me for though we walk now 2 Corinthians 10 3 to 5 to 6 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ every thought amen amen oh my Lord help us amen help us Lord oh my God oh thoughts everywhere so many thoughts some are good and some are bad now the Lord give us discernment to discern every thought it sounds like a big task but you'll get on top of it because God will come into you it's the anointing God is given he doesn't say these things and then he's no provision he provides the oh yes the power he provides the anointing he provides the strength he gives you the word the vision everything to to accomplish these things in you through you he just wants to be your source of strength amen and let's make God like just consciously just say Lord You're my source of strength amen just just just make an effort because we can easily find many things to strengthen us and be a source of strength but what about God what about me I think Belinda wrote that song saith the Lord and she sung about everyone getting busy and doing all this stuff but then and leaving God the gentleman who doesn't Force his way into your life but he will take what you give him what about me saith the Lord Hallelujah and having casting out imaginations every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having inner Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled acts 16 25 and 26 Hallelujah I just want you to really believe that tonight no matter where you're at and watch what God does in a situation which looked very hopeless and and some situations that we find ourselves in are so hopeless in the in the way that the devil would try and paint it to you but remember it's never hopeless you're never without opportunity no matter where you're at no matter how deep down no matter how far down how failed how whatever is always an opportunity always an opportunity God is a god of opportunity his promises are full of Rich opportunities and there's nothing that can stand in the way of them happening there's no situation no physics no economics no Devils no nothing stand in the way of God's promises making something materialized Paul and Silas glory and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed Hallelujah you see they're getting ready for battle they were in a prison they were in the prison of Prisons they got beat but they started singing and praying at midnight right in the middle of the night when it was real bad and they thought man we're going you know they didn't think that but the devil did the devil thought I'm going to kill these guys Herod and all whoever put them in there they were that that was trouble on their minds but actually that was the opposite way around Hallelujah tonight it's the opposite way around because tonight we're going to gather together we've done what we can in that sense we've put the music the words gone forth and now it's time for battle Hallelujah Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately if I say immediately all the doors were open not just some God doesn't just set you part way free yeah yeah Deliverance is total all the doors are open tonight all the doors are open it's time to walk through those open doors how far are you gonna walk just part of the way up you'll sit there daydreaming we're just gonna are you gonna act upon the impulse of faith because there's faith in the room tonight and the prison and the Earth foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's Bonds were loosed let's stand let's have the musicians that's any good to us you know when I was in Israel and I was at the Western Wall that's like the closest the Jews can get to the Temple Mount and pray to where the holy of holies was you know there's a real atmosphere there is an atmosphere of crying out to God for the Messiah you say because they're ancestors of ancestors of ancestors rejected the Messiah that you have freely got access to that you love that loves you that walks with you that you know and maybe need to know and just think and crying and I went up to this wall and it was big and slick from tears and sweat and in the wall and all the cracks there's millions of little notes can you play um um oh that song I wrote down your name is power is that how is that the name of it and all in the cracks of this wall was prayers and you go up and I actually prayed at that wall because I I pray that the that these people would meet the Messiah I want Jerusalem you pay for pray for the Peace of Jerusalem right who knows that scripture and so I prayed for the Peace of Jerusalem there but you could feel the the the intense desire for deliverance for that nation and for them for the Messiah to come and you think right standing amongst them was someone whom the Messiah was in and there was other believers there and I thought man how ironic it is and yet desires to pray and all around Israel who knows that Israel is a natural Bride As the natural type of our spiritually and we have the Messiah and he's living in us but they've and we fight a spiritual war on demons that control people you've got Authority now to rage a war on Devils that are hurting people right they don't know how to do that so they just fight the people they're going to fight all the Philistines and the Palestinians and they fight the the all the extreme jihadists all around them now I want to show you something [Music] and I've seen it in in my own um research and studies that whenever Israel goes through a war or a battle you watch what happens in The Bride spiritually there's a spiritual battle now watch as I don't know if maybe you guys don't watch Israel but I watch Israel news and the the whole Arab world is starting to gather right around them and they're closing in Iran and all of their proxies and all these enemies and all of these Islamic jihadists and and all these different groups are all closing in and they're going to try and take Israel the battle is hot and array and they're sending little things here and but one thing I want you to see is they they have rallies I don't know if you've ever seen a jihadist like Hamas or Islamic jihadist rally but they all wear these masks and they're shooting guns in the air and they're they say oh we're gonna take Israel we're gonna kill them and we're gonna do all these horrible things to them and you know what they won't do any of it it's all empty threats they can't take Israel you know that yeah yeah and they know they can't take it and that's the devil and the spirit when he tries to tell you things do you know what he what it is it's just as empty as they're rhetoric it's just as empty he just says all this waving stuff over you and tries to bring you down to try and stop you from breaking through but tonight I speak breakthrough over you I speak Faith over you I just want you to say I receive faith I'm gonna break through tonight I'm praying serious tonight I want to meet with God I will have a conference with God and I believe tonight the world's gone forth the music's gone forth now let the Battle Set an array hey man who's with me let's just sing this song I just think that rhetoric is lies it's empty and it's almost comical you listen to what they say and you think oh my goodness I can't believe they're saying it do they actually believe it I'm sure they don't even believe what they're saying because they know that they're going to be post but they said anyway and I thought man something just triggered me that's just like the devil he says all this empty stuff and it sounds so big but it's absolutely absurd it's not even it's got an overweight behind it amen go to the chorus your name is
