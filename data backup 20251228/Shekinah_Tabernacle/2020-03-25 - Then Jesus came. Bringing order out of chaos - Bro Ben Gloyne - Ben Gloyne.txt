god bless you all praise the Lord I mean so good to see everyone tonight amen so yeah we'll just see how this goes but yes good to see everyone and I trust you feel the spirit of Lord with you wherever you are and I'm you let's just turn to the scripture - I want to go to Genesis chapter 1 and in verse 2 if you've got your Bibles with you I mean if you want to unmute yourself so I can yes we're gonna hear one another it's perfectly fine they just say Amen when you're there and I want to read I want to read a Genesis chapter 1 and verses 1 & 2 so to my left is my as as the other five of the family yes oh god bless you and yeah it's yeah I'm just so happy we can still meet even though we can't physically be in the same building we can do it either doesn't Samsung team you know somebody it's not that out here okay so let's just go to Genesis 1 and and verses 1 & 2 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and let's just go - I just want to take a context from from John chapter 11 just which I trust as a well familiar story to us the story of Lazarus Lazarus being raised from the dead I mean and then I just want to take the first part of of John chapter 11 and verse 17 just as a bit of a context here on it so it says here then when Jesus came amen then when Jesus came and if I could take a take a thought or a subject tonight I want to speak about taking getting order out of chaos and so let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer and let's just seek the Lord Lord Jesus we're so thankful that we can truly as we have sung tonight Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that you're my god you are all together lovely you're all together worthy Lord you're altogether wonderful to me now I want to thank you Lord that in this day Lord the world is falling apart Lord there's great turmoil turmoil the land but Lord in the hut out of your bride Lord this peace nothing assurance this stability law because your word is on the inside of the inside of us Lord and I just pray father as we open that Lord as we've opened the pages of your word and lord I just pray father that you would Lord we know anyone who can read can open the book but Lord takes you to come the divine author and make it live in our hearts oh but I pray you'd manifest your word Lord father may your presence be very real wherever we're seated right now Lord we're so thankful you said in your word where two or three gathered in my name dear you are in the midst Lord so Lord we have full assurance you're with each and every one of us now O God and you also said you'd never leave us nor forsake us so you'd be with the individual as well I got so pray father we'd have a very blessed time Lord in your word and Lord our hearts burn within us as you speak to us along the way Lord may you grant it in Jesus Christ and we ask amen I mean so I'd like to speak if I could take a thought I want to speak about taking taking order out of chaos now we we we read there in Genesis chapter 1 where where the it says in the beginning that God created heavens and earth and there's a period and and brother Bram tells us we do not know the time between the end of verse 1 and the start of verse 2 we do know not the length of days or the years or whatever it may be but they came a time when the Spirit of God began to brood brood over the earth and God when he came to the earth he found it in a chaos you know was was without form and void darkness cover the face of the deep there's no even though there was seed there was life buried in the earth you know it was covered in darkness it was just a chaos there's no order there there's no arrangement of nature there was no there was no you know there was no what he call it you know you know different parts of nature of you know botany life and animal life and it was just a chaos and and whenever God we find when when God comes to the earth and and and very important junctions of time and he finds a chaos but he brings it into an order and so we see here when we read from you know you read through Genesis 1 and you and then you keep reading down through and and as the Spirit of God brooded you know you know came upon the face of the yo-yo the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and then he began to speak he said let there be life and light appeared and you know and he and he kept speaking the more as he spoke to the earth you know creation came forth and the and you're the water you're receded dry land came forth a minute it said God said let all the seed you know bring forth after its kind and and we understand from reading the scripture and and in the proper telling us that the seeds of the Botany life were already in the earth so their seed already in the earth God didn't say he created it it was already there but he caused the darkness to move back he caused the water to move back I mean for the for the seeds that were buried under the soil to come to a certain light would fall upon it the soil will come to a certain temperature that it could come to life the seat and in the life and those seeds started you know started growing and it's exactly the same thing with you and I friends your darkness covered us we were born in darkness we were born in chaos I'm in an age of chaos and but yet God knew that there was a life on the inside of the inside of us and he was he was determined to brood over us until the life that he saw before the foundation of the world would become manifested in our lives it's like when he brooded over the earth there in Genesis 1 and 2 I mean he wasn't hoping that life would be formed on the earth he knew life would be formed on the earth I mean that's why he had a purpose of a spirit moving upon the you know you know upon the earth because he wanted the life that was in his mind to be manifested and it's the same thing with you and I that's why the Spirit of God found you that's why this message found you is because you know he saw there was a scene see gene of God inside you I mean and he was determined to brood over you until that seed came to life hallelujah but you know it's an incredible thing we were born in chaos I mean we were children of Wrath even as others that season Jim Ephesians chapter 2 but God Richard mercy Alleluia I mean let's see it's such a tremendous piece of Scripture let's go to Ephesians in chapter 2 there's one of my favorite favorite scriptures right here men I mean can can can everyone hear me okay yeah Hey am I too loud okay sorry Ephesians two and one and you have he quickens he once did who were dead in trespasses and sins where and in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience this is what we once were among whom also ye all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others other sisters how we once were but God who's rich and mercy and he's still rich in mercy tonight for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace you're saved through faith and that is not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship I'm glad we're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them hallelujah so so God found God found the world and a chaos and he brooded over the earth and he brought out an Eden that was that was in his mind and not just those but then his children became manifested upon the earth so sorry took a chaos and he brought it into an order and then now you find in Noah's day the world was falling apart but yet even out of that chaos an order came as well God came came to a man called Noah he said I'm going to destroy the world because it's fallen into a chaos but then through Noah order came in and and Noah came under the Word of God he became one with the word for his day he built the ark amen and the people were saved hallelujah and then we can say I'm just gonna jump through the scripture quickly show every time God comes I mean you see the angel Lord coming to someone is to bring us to bring chaos into or rather to bring order out of chaos so you see in Moses day and Moses day the children of Israel were the children of God but they were living in a chaos they were they were in slavery you know they weren't in their rightful position they were slaves under the Egyptians so so it was just a chaos they weren't in their right order they weren't in their right place as God saw them and you know brother Bram tells us that when that when Pharaoh and Moses they both looked at the same people they both looked at the children of Israel and Pharaoh just saw slaves but Moses saw God's children right because he was looking through different eyes than what Pharaoh was and so now God came to Moses because he was going to bring he was going to bring the children of Israel out of a chaos of slavery and into an order he was going to place them in the promised land where they were ordained to be so so through through the Ministry of Moses God took the children of Israel out of a chaos and put them into an order hallelujah amen amen he can see the same thing when when Gideon was there there in the promised land but there was a chaos in the land because because the children of Israel weren't living in their right to be condition the Midianites were they're the children of the east were there but in the ancient Lord came down to Gideon because he was gonna take that chaos and bring an order amen you see there we see the cycle keeps repeating you know where there's a chaos God comes and brings order out of their chaos and he brings the people who are in that chaos and brings them into order with God's Word they become one with God's Word for their day amen so then you can see the same thing with Elijah you know Elijah on Mount Carmel there he was he was standing there and and he'd already made the challenge to the prophets of bale and he and but there was a chaos in the arrangement of the worship of God the other altar of God was was was fallen down it it had it had it had come into disrepair and he had to rebuild the altar of God the right approach to God so there was a chaos the altar was a chaos but the ministry of of elijah brought order out of that chaos he read says he rebuilt the altar of the Lord and then once he did that according to the vision he put there he put the wood on in the in the sacrifice and told him to pour the water out upon the you know sacrifice he says Lord I've done all this according to your word amen that and you know he prayed Lord I've done all this according to your word and that you know and that the people of children of Israel would know that thou has turned their hearts back again and in the fire fell and it's when the when the when the altar was rebuilt in the right order then the sacrifice was put at all put upon it and in the fire fell it's the same thing with you and I you know how our walk with God before this message came was a chaos you know many of us believed in three guards maybe not even there wasn't a God you know different ways of baptism different you know all different kind of chaos of religion but then but in this but then the Ministry of Elijah came through through the Prophet and he rebuilt the altar of the Lord now lives you know those stones represent Revelation where where where the altar wasn't disorder but in the word put those revelations in order and then we fell upon that altar right we gave our lives Lord Jesus Christ in the fire fell I mean so he came in to order we're in chaos but then we came in to order now I'm sure we can agree that you know when when Jesus came the first time the world was falling apart rather M says that the world was falling apart in his day but if we looked at his day would say well there seems to be quite a lot of water in his day you know they had they had government you know it wasn't a bunch of barbarians we would we would think back in that day the Romans you know had their great empire they had you know even in the promised land they had their temples they had their traditions they had their hierarchy you know in society they had the high priests and the chief priests and the you know and you know the rulers over the people you know they they had a hierarchy in society they had a you know a form of law and judgment and they had commerce they had religion and but the world was falling apart because the people had fallen away from the true Word of God so God had to come become a man become flesh in order to to to speak to that chaos and bring an order out of that chaos so the people because the people were not living in their right to be conditioned you know when Moses gave the law the purpose of that law was that the people would dwell in their inheritance and peace that was the reason God gave the law says if you if you obey my word then you everyone will live in their inheritance you know the you know you'll you'll you'll sit under your fig tree and under your vine and you know you'll possess the fullness of the land but they had long forgotten that God and now they're living in a chaos under the under the rule of the Romans and they were you know I'm Caiaphas and and and them said you know this man's gonna cause the whole nation to go after him and you know speaking of Jesus and and and they're all worried that the Romans would take away their position in the nation and because what had happened they had fallen into a chaos instead of being in an order with the Word of God that week yeah as this this all making clear so far I mean they need to be living in order but it was actually a chaos because they weren't coming lined up with God's Word there weren't one with the word for their day that's why there was a chaos in the land and then God God but then God became flesh he didn't just hear to just move over the people just in a spirit form but he became a man and began to speak into that chaos to bring an order so in that chaos of of of Israel there was he was a man by the name of Peter you know his daddy told him that you know when Messiah comes he's going to do the supernatural but you know you'd be careful there'd be a whole bunch of false ones come before him but you know we know there's gonna be a messiah and so you know he was told the promise of the scripture but but his life that he was born into was a was a life of chaos he didn't walk with God like Joshua did they didn't have the dominion over their enemies and any land like their forefathers did so it was a chaos but then Jesus came his way and so Jesus came his way and he said come and follow me and he began to take the man Peter and take him out of a chaos and into an order to become one with the word for his day so there was Peter he was a proud man you know he sure he was the only one who walked on water not once but twice you know he was the first one to answer Jesus you know we know that the Christ you know come from God and you know but but he had a pride and he had a you know he had a you know his humanity was actually in chaos because it wasn't surrendered to the word it wasn't surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ now I just want to you know I'm gonna come back to Jesus going to Lazarus grave but I want to go to the book of Galatians and I just want to show you how he say show you how we are in a chaos when we were born now let's go to Galatians 5 and this is probably maybe going on a big seek way but I just want you to bring this because you know we can say even well before this virus struck the world we could say this world has order you know we haven't had any major Wars for not in my generation there's been peace you know with this being prosperity people quote how many hundreds of millions appeals been lifted out of poverty in the in the recent future you know there's this rule of government there's all these things but in reality man is born into chaos and unless God comes and get a hold of his life he will remain in that chaos and we can see this here if we if we go to Galatians 5 and verse and verse 17 where where the Apostle Paul is speaking to the Galatians and speaking of the works of the flesh and then he and he's gonna speak about the fruits of the spirit now if we if we if we go to Galatians 5 and 17 assists for the spirit lusteth against this so for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that we cannot do the things that you would but if ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest and which are these now I'm sure as we read through this you can say this is chaos this is chaos adultery that's chaos because mimic chaos is just order that's been messed up right something that's an order buts all broken up that's now chaos and there's even the second law of thermodynamics and the universe is everything tends towards disorder that's a that's a that's a fundamental law of the universe the second law of thermodynamics who ever studied who's had to endure thermodynamics anyone [Laughter] but anyway very interesting but but that's a law in the universe that everything tends towards disorder unless a stronger force comes in and applies itself and then it can bring it back to order so we're going to come to that but but I'm sure we can see that this is um this is chaos now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelries revellings and such like that's all chaos but yet man is born with that chaos nature it's a fallen nature unfortunate we are born with that see we were born into chaos see it's not just the world was falling apart but man it's so so we can't just say the world is in chaos but man is born into that chaos we have this nature that we're born with and so unfortunately man under his own devices doesn't matter how educated it is how how cultured he may be he will always tend towards chaos because that nature's within him a man but God Richard mercy lujah amen and such like of which I've told you before as i have also told you in times past so i'm still and good to anyone that they which do such things shall not in here at the kingdom of god cause chaos go not in here at order you'd be called out of that chaos i mean but the fruit of the spirit is now these things are order love joy peace ec this list there's no destruction in this list its destruction in the first list are red hatreds destruction you know emulations fornication and cleanliness adultery you know wrath strife seditions all those things are towards the negative they had destructive so it tends toward that's the nature of chaos right but now the fruits of the spirit the the ones of order love see love brings together i'm in joy brings together a joyful heart doeth good like a medicine i mean peace brings brings together i mean long suffering brings together amen gentleness brings together it doesn't divide I mean goodness brings together you know you take the first list you know the fruits of the yeah you know you know the you know the fruits or the works of the flesh and if someone and unfortunately many poor people who aren't born by the Spirit of God they'll manifest the first list even though religious and the thing is you take it someone who's who who's very you know manifests although since continually I'm sure you'd agree you wouldn't really want to hang out with that person very much they'd be very detrimental to yourself because it's chaos it separates us divides and breaks down and destroys I mean but those who have love and I'm talking about Holy Ghost love those who manifest love those that manifest joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness faith goodness temperance against such there is no law that is order that brings together that unites that heals that binds you know that it strengthens that stabilizes hallelujah and those you know so there's the two manifesting themselves so God had to call us out of chaos and bring us into order but the reason that he but the reason that he um he he did so the reason he brooded over you is because he saw there was a seed in you that had the men that that was an attribute of himself hallelujah Amen so there's the two so so the Apostle Peter had to be called out of chaos those are sincere men though is a good man any other coming to order who's who's following me so far and you glad that the Lord brought you into order hallelujah I mean once you're in chaos but now you're in order so as I see it now the you know the the second law of thermodynamics is thermodynamics is that everything tends towards disorder and so everything tends towards disorder but unless there's an external force is applied that can actually bring it back into order so now here our shoe man 'ti you see see every two thousand years the world falls apart because it's the second law of Amyx everything tends towards disorder so in Moses I mean so Noah's day the world was falling apart there was violence there was hatred there was all kinds of things going on people multiplied there was violence okay you know what was people going into chaos but brother BAM says it was the most scientific age so there are smart people though educated people but because their nature was fallen I mean they had to tend towards disorder then when Jesus came the world was falling into chaos again it was falling apart I mean but even as the world was falling apart there God called out a bride in that day you take you take the woman at the well I'm sure we can agree she was in chaos amen she she had she had five husbands the one she would she wasn't married to her life was a chaos but deep down in that chaos is a predestinated seed that the son of man had to come across and speak to when he spoke to that woman I mean and and and it seed became quickened by the life hallelujah that that was being spoken through that word I mean and her life went from chaos water I mean it went from darkness covering her and just you know traditions and just how she was I mean that light struck her then she came to life a man and she began to manifest truly what was in her from the foundation of the world hallelujah amen so here we have Jesus so so unless there's a so unless an external force is applied everything will tend towards disorder now we have come down to this day we're now 2,000 years down the road as as brother Bram says every 2,000 years amen the world falls apart yeah and now so but down through the church ages God had send a messenger to the age and as the world is falling apart I mean that messengers minister actually bring order I mean I mean to that age but now we've come down to the end we've come down to the seventh church age there's no more Church ages there's no more messengers rather Gentile age is being wrapped up the world has to fall apart again I mean but even as the world is falling apart now that's when the Son of Man is revealed again and God calls out a bride from chaos into order hallelujah so this world is ordained to fall apart you know we you know we could go into the Book of Daniel and we could read about the fourth beast power that basically devours and consumes the world and and we see that anointing that's come down through the ages you know this world has been broken into pieces amen we know that there has to be you know America has to go bankrupt the world economic system has to be rewritten right it's been prophesied it will happen and look at what's happening look at what's happening in the world today I mean there's this virus has gone through the world people are pumping out heaps of money even America before the deer lockdown really happened they said that put out a stimulus of two trillion dollars and it's gonna go higher than that already and they're already in a massive debt that they've never been in before and it just keeps getting worse and worse and even last week you go look on the news it says that our Reserve Bank made a deal with the Federal Reserve in America and they borrowed about 60 odd billion dollars and a very low interest rate what's happening the world is in debt like never before that's right there has to be there has to be one that comes and actually actually actually pays off the debt and we know who that is by prophecy we know that there's the world counselor I mean so there's the Vatican with all the gold in the world see the rest the economic systems all just on on confidence that's why the stock market goes down when people lose confidence because the value goes down because people's confidence goes down in that system and so the whole monetary system is based on confidence so when the confidence goes down then the monetary system goes down but because the debt is so high and they're not and they're and they're afraid to actually just let the system crash they keep pumping money into it but they just get into a greater debt cycle it's going it's in chaos there's no gold standard against the you know who's who's ever looked at us just a little bit or studied economics in any way right there's nothing backing our money anywhere there's nothing backing it so now these kind of crises happen the world goes on shutdown they pump out all this money just create some more debt and there has to come to a point you look at the last few years America just votes in the Senate and they just raise their debt ceiling the world's busted brother Ram says in his day that those people are paying off you know your the debts they are making what in 40 years time they're still paying them off you know the whole system is busted and they're not gonna let Wall Street Crash I can't remember this is not about the little workers like us is about big corporations and they're not gonna let them crash they're not gonna let them fail so they something has to prop them up and then you see nowadays what do we have we have a president there who's a businessman he cares about business right and so he's the perfect tool in order to actually sell the whole system out to the Catholic Church that's right because they have the money but they have the money and the and the Wall Street has all the paper has all the bonds but those bonds begin to worth nothing so someone's going to come and pay the debt off and what happens the whole world of screw controlled by Rome the world is falling apart you know we have to we have to understand these things because sure this virus may go away I pray it does but the economic system of the world has but will be forever changed that's right and here we are born living in this chaos we're living in this chaos but I just want to make you turn your attention to two revelations chapter ten because as I said in this chaos the Lord comes into that chaos and makes an order when he comes himself Amen an order comes out of chaos and so if we go to revelations chapter 10 because whatever what a reason I said all that as I just want I pray no one is afraid of what's going on in the world we have nothing to fear as a part of God's program right it's all part of God's program nothing's going out of cater he's not panicking right he's not worried he knows exactly where you are Amen I remember the next thing that we are told we will see is the bride leaving this world the rapture which is the next thing on God's program remember it doesn't matter how badly the world falls apart the devil cannot take full control of the earth until the bride goes I mean cuz brother MCS in the fourth seal when the bride goes up the Beast comes down you know the devil comes fully incarnate as the Beast I mean so maybe let's read that scripture first shall this go to second Thessalonians you know it's amazing because because people can so panic all the devil's gonna take over the world and we're gonna be trapped here and you know we're gonna you know there may be for the people that go through the Great Tribulation but it's not the brides anointing it's not our lot to go through that tribulation this message came Christ Himself came in this day to give you a way of escape out of the room you know that don't you know be here when the Great Tribulation fully sets in so I mean so you know people are you know these people prepping and preparing for the Great Tribulation they believe they'll go through this because they're under the anointing to go that way I mean but we're not called to go under the sofa read here in 2nd Thessalonians and 2 and 7 maybe maybe licious yeah yeah let's just go from from verse 7 of 2nd Thessalonians 2 he says for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming now this may seem like a very obscure kind of Scripture it says the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so this one who let's write this is actually the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth I mean then the devil can have full control on the earth you know what the devil still you know doesn't have free reign on this earth you know why we're here it's the same Amen it's the same reason why the world's falling apart it's your fault they're full control because you're upon the earth amen and that's why the world is falling apart as well because remember there's a second law of thermodynamics everything tends towards disorder but in the universe is only so much order there's only so much entropy right so something goes towards disorders because thing else is coming into order right and the reason the world is falling apart is because the bride is coming into order with the Word of God Alleluia that's why this world's falling apart is your fault all right back to brother James on the phone last week I said you know you're you're the reason this world's falling apart brother James it's your fault Allu yeah amen why because you know we're coming into order with the Word of God so now he says he will litter here let his will let until he be taken out of the way and that he is the Holy Ghost so when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth with you know that's when the devil has full control but at the moment he is actually being held back from having fully having his way I mean but remember when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth we go with it I mean because were one with him it means let's go to revelations chapter 10 and I know this is um this is this is I think whether when a brother Andy's favorite favorite scriptures but I pray it's also our favorite so all of our favorite Scripture because what I've been really thinking about in this time is you know the word we believe it should mean so much more to us now you see it to me it seems to be so more real I mean where where where things where we look at revelations 10 and you know we we look at the world's falling apart and and how brother Brown you know prophesied that the you know that that the world would go bankrupt and the and in the Vatican will will basically buy the world with the gold and we see it becoming material more and more every day so it goes from more than just a prophecy but we see it becoming into basically the maturity of its fulfillment and so I think you know if we really look at the message really look at the Word of God we should be ail to see it becoming so much more real to us and it shouldn't mean so much more to us in this thing and then even before so so we see in Revelation Stennis is now I saw another mighty angel come up come down from heaven clothed with the cloud a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we know this is Christ the mighty angel coming down to the earth and we know that because as it's a symbolic book we just look into the symbols we see that he was clothed with a cloud he sees a comeback in a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head we know a rainbow all always I'm as symbolic of a covenant and he is the angel of the Covenant and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we we understand that we are his body in this day I meant the Bride of Christ is the body of Christ upon the earth amen as brother Chris Merrett said you know we are the we have the earthly strength of God upon the earth as the bride so now if its feet as pillars of fire we we need to look and say well where does the pillar of fire reside today I mean we can go to the you know yo we can go to the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 and the pillar fire came down into the upper room and separated himself into the believers now the pillar of fire was now in the church I mean so now God was now in his people so now it says that his feet were as pillars of fire I mean that means we are his feet upon the earth hallelujah I mean we are his remember we are his body upon the earth so this mighty angel came down through this message a minha now because we received this message and it brings us back to a true Pentecost because it brings us back to the what the Apostle Paul preached it takes us back to a proper Pentecost and a proper Pentecost gives us God dwelling in us again amen amen so now here we are now so so we are his feet upon the earth now it's very interesting to see where where where he stood so it's reading in in verse 2 and I won't be much longer and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now this is very important where he's standing because if we go to revelations chapter I believe it's chapter 13 we can see that there's two powers that come out come out and one power comes out of the sea one one one power comes out of the earth now we can just we just read here revelations 13 and one I'm not going to go into the symbolic of this but we know that this is the anointing on the world systems and the time of the end I mean so it says and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy now I'm just gonna read there but I just want you to notice you can go and read it later and see we're at Crawford cross-references into the Book of Daniel but he came at this power came out of the sea now we know the sea is in the book of Revelation as people you're multitudes of people's tongues and nations right mm-hmm but this power comes out of there so here's the demonic power raising up but then also if we continue reading down and we and we go to verse 11 of of revelations 13 and it says and I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth out of the land and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon so here's these two powers one comes out of the sea one comes out of the land comes out of the earth but where does this mighty angel now stand he stands puts one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth so he pushes this demonic power back I mean when he comes down as in this form Elias and now these demons demonic powers are rising up but now this power of God comes down it actually pushes these powers back so now here is God standing upon the earth the mighty angel upon the earth put holding these forces back until the until the Covenant of God the will of God is now opened and spoken to a people right and and we've received that open book amen we become one with that which is Christ and now we have been given the power to prophesy again yeah Christ is upon the earth this is why I really want to say Christ is upon the earth holding back the forces of darkness until we come to our position yeah I see revelations teen eight to 11 as as our scripture man I mean because John is a symbol of us in the book you know one man brother BAM says one man in the and the vision can be symbolic of a whole people and we see John at the end of Revelations 3 your lessons for one and I saw a door open and heaven and that same voice he come up hither and that is a that's symbolic of the rapture of the church so one man in the vision is a symbol of a whole group of people and hallelujah I mean so now so now God is upon the earth I mean Jesus Christ is here I mean in in spirit form all that Christ was is here right he hasn't changed one iota but but his but his physical form but who he is everything he does is still the same I mean today so so he is upon the earth holding back these forces right until we come to our position and once we come to our position in Christ then what we got in the rapture Amen that's right so I just want to say don't worry about what's going on in the world God will hold those powers back until his bride comes into her position amen and when she is ready then he leaves the earth and she leaves with him amen so we really have nothing to fear friends we have absolutely nothing to fear remember God God you know the devil can't do nothing he can push he can shove it and try all he wants to do but he can't do nothing until God allows him to oh he desperately cuz he knows he has but a short time you know he desperately wants to take over the yoke you know the world and completeness but he can't do it because you're standing in his way amen you actually standing in his way because God's hand is upon you and God is bringing you to your position thank you all hallelujah amen so I knew glad you've been called out of chaos and brought into order amen thank you as this world is falling apart God's called a bride out of this chaos manifest his word in the same time and I think we should be we should be the most thankful people in all the world I mean means hearts are failing for fear you know the world is falling apart but even as the world is in this chaos God is calling us I mean to become one with him so take advantage of the shutdown friends yes amen worship the Lord bring your family together I won't sing pray read together you know just just just worship God but we have an opportunity you say I'm the only one Daniel was the only one hallelujah when the land of Babylon was the only one but he stood he had a testimony I mean we can be the same way I just want to leave you with that world is in chaos but God has come to bring an order out of that chaos he's coming to call a bride out into order and then so we can we have the same Authority we have the same right remember the same one that said let there be life there's the same one that's in you amen and you can see your family may be in chaos you can speak to that mountain I mean you can speak to that mountain and the Spirit of God can brood over them and bring them into order out of chaos I mean I mean god bless you friends I'm gonna leave it there I love you all don't be afraid don't worry about this thing don't don't let that spirit of fear that'sthat's out in the community fall upon you we have nothing to fear we have nothing to worry about it doesn't matter how bad member brother is doesn't matter how dark it gets there's a man standing prison that can turn on the light there is the Lord Jesus Christ standing prisoner he's not just here he's with you I remember he's not just I've got to come to church to feel God no no God can be wherever you are my choice is don't neglect the gathering ourselves together and I think God we can do it in this fashion but you know we still the same God with you so I'll just leave it like that but just just worship Him these four weeks they thank you Lord I've been called out of chaos in a minute to order and then your your spirit is brutal of me that now you've called me out now you remove the darkness from my life and all the water and the and and and that seed that was in me before the foundation well is now blooming forth and growing as your ordained it hallelujah gracious Lord Jesus I mean we just want to pray Lord us wanna just one commit ourselves into your hands Lord want to thank you Lord Jesus that we can meet in this way Lord though this lockdown is Lord the world is being shut down because of a virus Lord we want to thank you Lord Jesus that Lord you're not surprised by this even as the world falls apart and we see
