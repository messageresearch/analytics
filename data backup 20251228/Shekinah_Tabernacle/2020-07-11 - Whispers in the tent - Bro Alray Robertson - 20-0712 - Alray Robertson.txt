[Music] good morning welcome to the house of God this morning it's good to be a Christian it's good to have faith how would your life really exist if you didn't have faith now if you couldn't believe four things and believe there was a greater power than just our ability you know and we you know we have such an awesome privilege as Christians to live a life of faith you know that could make us so positive you know because we faith says yes you know an amen that's faith no sir and every situation where yes you know the children of Israel often got into a lot of dire situations but God always brought them through I was reading them the other day when they and I don't know what they didn't believe but the things they went through even when they got to their read see God see why you crying to me tell the children to move forward just move forward doesn't matter if there's a Syria that you that if you have to swim to it just long throught but when they walked forward it opened up there's faith amen so yeah we that's the God that we come to this morning and who's excited to be in the house of God amen I believe we can have a good time I like the flowers when I was younger I didn't like

want to just acknowledge brother brother Bain and sister Christine dearest dearest friends and just really appreciate them and I want to also bring special greetings from Stratford and my god my god bless you in every way to die you want to switch the whole thing okay I'm sorry this is just a commercial break am I on praise the Lord Oh leave this here okay second Samuel chapter 23 and we'll start from verse 14 maybe before we read the word let's pray one more time precious father Oh Lord we love you so much we appreciate you so much Lord our God we we're so privileged Lord Jesus to be part of your your word of this day father we are so thankful Lord you've called us Lord we're so thankful to be in your house this morning precious father and we we want to invite you again but we know you're already here just on a welcome you into our hearts this morning well Jesus I pray that you will just have full preeminence in the service Lord father your children has come well Jesus and prayed up open hearts Lord but maybe many have gone through things this week Lord all sorts of challenges and pressures and impatience Lord whatever it is I pray now Lord that you will open all those channels father that you will forgive that you will clean Lord father that we can receive from you this morning well Jesus I want to pray Lord that you will speak every word that he spoke and lord I pray that you will take me out of the way father so that you can just use me as a mute instrument in your hand father Oh God we can let every part of the service into your hands now and convert this word that we will into your hands I ask it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can put that first slide on so long but the we'll just read the sports portion so second Samuel 23 from verse 14 and David was then in a hold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in basically and very well-known portion and David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but pulled it out unto the Lord and he said be it far from here Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of the main that went in jeopardy of their lives before he would not would not drink it these things that these three mighty men I mean you can take your seats this morning I mean it's a very well-known portion and I want to want to get there get you that's a little lighter I trust that everyone is comfortable that everyone is relaxed and trusted but we can just I also it this way you can just look over my my mistakes and my wrongs and and just allow the Lord to speak to your heart this morning so before I want to get going I particularly wanted to put up that slide be because I want to just kind of create the background of all the or the principle against which I want to share these things this morning morning Maria it's good to see him I mean praise the Lord and and I just want to see the the the kind of background or principle and that is that you know to hit you that story of Isaac and Rebecca and and we read in the Bible now now we know that brother Branham when he asked the Lord for a scripture that pertains to his ministry the Lord showed him Aliza and he was our ELISA and and the whole principle was that ELISA now went out and searched for a bride for Isaac and found brought her back and and then Rebecca and and and in these that that beautiful song that as as they riding along but she sings ELISA tell me more I mean what does Isaac really look like and we had an ELISA that told us what Isaac what Isaac's word is I mean and we're so thankful for those things so so then they come to this place where we eyes extent he's and the Bible speaks about how it was his mother's tantony and he took her into the tent I mean so so Rebecca jumped off the camel and ran into his arms and this beautiful love story I mean and they embraced each other and he took her into his mother state and and and the thought that I want to she this morning is against that background now you have of course we're talking about the civil Celia we have now Rebecca and Isaac now in the tent and he's there whispering secrets into her ear he's revealing himself to her now in in the tent so that's kind of the background that I want to speak these things against now so so if we can can kind of have that as the mental picture behind everything that I want to share this morning there's two very important principles that I want to share and the first is in that tent let's Eve this is on yes first alone in this in the tent he reveals things to her that is she's with nobody else you see these things are the husband and wife she is that's for absolutely no one else it's got nothing to do with nobody I mean it's for her I mean but if she is what while he's I'm gonna say what if she's really either was for her specific but what he now reveals under the Seventh Seal to us individually it's very specific for us and then the second thing is the motive for everything that is shade is love there's no other motive that God has and that is love I mean so remember those two principles as we go on so I want to kick off by speaking about predestination a little bit and and you know you might think okay this is strange why do we jump from day to day but you will see as we go on the Bible says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the earth I mean and I believe that when God remember you hi brother branham I'm so thankful for ELISA how he went right back into the mind of God I mean and and how he said that God dwelt alone with his faults I mean thank God that fold allspice and time and eternity I mean and how God in those thoughts that he had I mean God had attributes I mean and and God had and and if I might just just in order to kind of relate to it a little bit I'll put it this way I got at two different types of attributes the one lot of attributes was God's redemptive attributes so God was healer and God was Savior and God was Redeemer and God had all those attributes I mean and and we can look at their similar redemptive attributes of God Jehovah Shalom and all those different ones I mean God had those attributes and he needed to express them he wanted to express them and and while he was any in his clothes alone well before the bride was manifested I mean before God spoke the words and before the creation started rolling out God could only think about it I mean but there's something else and that's the other type of attribute of God and that is whenever God thought of himself as Redeemer as Savior he thought of you you see God could not think of himself as Savior without thinking of the ones he's gonna say I mean and that's the other type of attributes we are attributes of God so God needed these attributes are sitting here this morning I mean in order for God to be a savior I mean so we and and that's the wonderful thing of being his bride is that God reveals those attributes to us now here's the fun part God doesn't do a steal relation okay God doesn't just teach us this my children is what peace is all about you see God allows us to go through heaps of turmoil so that when jehova sholom comes across I pry I mean if you said this is what peace is all about I mean God allows us to go through times where we have shortage so that when Jehovah Jireh comes and we appreciate you have a jar God allows us to become six winned over comes we understand what it means I mean and bring that's what's happening now while the bride is in this else I second fires of a three-fold purpose of the civil seal while we're going through this time I mean while we are well we are growing in God God is allowing us to experience all these things to come across her path so that God can reveal himself to us so that wind this bride is pulled back to his side I mean so she's gonna be a river lighted bride she's not gonna be a bride that was taught in a seminary she's a bride that's gonna be forged like gold I mean beaten and beaten and beaten and tried in the fire until he can see himself in her I mean and we are so thankful that God sent us he ELISA that gave us a peep into the heart of God so that we can see those things so to bring it back to predestination now when when we were predestinated we were not only predestinated as bain or as Andy or as I see course as whoever it is God did not predestinated us you know he didn't predation I just just as the name God predestinated us absolutely intertwined with his with his attributes I mean God predestinated us from the start and even the term from the star doesn't deploy to God I mean God Emma started I mean God always thought of us through those redemptive attributes and I thank God for those things we read in Genesis how how God did the creation and and and even when Adam and Eve fell who immediately God's response was the seed of the woman will be given I mean because before God spoke those words in Genesis I mean God had already thought in his mind and he already thought of the Lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the earth the Bible speaks about those things I mean and then as time progressed we read about Abraham Abraham who who was as far as I understand he was idol worship and grew up in a house where his dead you know made idols and all sorts of things and and and God called him because he was a predestinated son I mean God called him God reached out to him he didn't reach a reach out to God I mean God reached out to him like brother branham shadow so clearly even on the garden of even Adam never came back to God God God we are you I mean I mean God reached out Adam Adam where are you it's always God I mean it's always God reaching out to us by His grace he's predestinated grace so now God called Abraham and God walked the path with Abraham I mean and and God God made him promises and so forth but but I want to just focus on one thing for a moment and that is we we you know I don't know if you remember that that place where we God made a covenant with Abraham I mean and and it's so beautiful when you read it brother branham actually most profound statements about it Harris said that God had to put put him asleep to get him sorry out of the way so that Abram can see you did nothing about this he had nothing to do with us I mean you remember God said to him you know get those animals and divide them asunder and so forth and then in and speaks about how God then came on the scene but it says God put him in a deep sleep and when Abram was asleep so he could not contribute to that he could do nothing to meet God halfway I mean then God promised I mean and God said I am gonna do this and I am gonna do that and I am gonna do this I mean there was nothing to do with Abraham it was nothing to do with what I drew Abram was gonna keep some rule we're gonna keep some commitment or gonna keep some promise from his side it was all God that did the whole thing and we thank God for it and then brother Brennan makes it at the children of Abraham now this covenant people Israel down in Egypt on account now listen to this I just love the fact that we have a prophet man I mean you can't say these things from a denominational perspective these government people now remember now God is the principle of sowing and reaping so now I was blown away when I read this quote the first time they were in it in Egypt on account of disobedience and of selling their brother Joseph 400 years suffering slavery and all sorts of things because of what they did to Joseph you could argue also on the other side it was all according to God's predestinated plan I mean just like when when when God spoke to two I think there was Judah I mean before he let him go into into captivity and so forth God said to him I know the thoughts that I've thought about you I mean I mean and what God said he says I'm gonna bring you to an expected end and God made all those promises just before he let him go into captivity for 70 years I mean you see God knows the end from the beginning God knows that purpose God knows exactly where he wants to bring each one of us to I mean hallelujah so let's just try again now this covenant people Israel down in Egypt on account of disobedience and of selling their brother Joseph and was taken down into Egypt and was there for hundred years and the bondage I want you to notice they never lost their covenant they lost they freedom I mean the fact that they missed up the fact that they did that to their brother Joseph the fact that they you know they're all sorts of silly things all that or the conniving of Jacob and all of that stuff did not change the governor did not change what God said did not change predestination so what about you what about me I mean we've got a covenant in fact claiming before God added a weird in his mind we were the redeemed receivers of Redemption I mean we were thee hallelujah and we have a spiritual seed of Abraham I mean and we were like I said in the mind of God and I just want to see these things I I just I just want to share this weird and and this morning I just want to be a blessing and just say thank God for the word amen then he sees then God's you know you and I can't say this but when a prophet say this I mean because I praise the Lord when God's just as duty-bound to you as he was to Abraham just as duty-bound because what he I was you something no because he said because he's worthy I mean because his covenant see God made the Covenant God by the commitment then he says say that would take all the skier out of it God don't want you to be scared of nothing race solemnly upon he saved I mean what he see and and you can also say on what he thought because what he thought he said I mean I thank God that I was in the mind of God hallelujah but you know in our minds we often think yes I understand that intellectually but I've messed up today so I feel this thing from God we often do and then we live at arm's length from God and we are afraid to come close to him we often we we you know we think we need to do penance or something that's a Catholic spirit in it you know we often and that's just how human beings are we think that you know we've messed up so much or maybe we have to have so many good days before we can pray again or before we can approach God again or before he can bless us again or something like that I mean that's human thinking that's not God's thinking God never looked at us God never looked at Abraham I mean God looks at his promised God looks at what he said and God is sticking to his word and God sticking you could say you know you hear sometimes human beings saying I'll stick to my story well God sticks to his story but the thing is it's not a story I mean that's the eternal Word of God and he's sticking to it and I thank God brother Brennan says is the one thing God cannot do and that's change his word Amy Bell Brown sees these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in the new season but the same elect are called by another name according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down this definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promises having to do with election or the choosing of God and that's exactly what we've been saying these were of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God and were in the mind of God and his thoughts in the church age book sneaking here this is polished up playing which here I mean but it's still the slot that comes from God in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally he's thoughts about you and me never started it never had a staff so it can never have any praise God I mean in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season and our season praise the Lord was seven seal season hallelujah ego season praise the Lord as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she's feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ and if you look at your faults in your failings in your mistakes in your daily battles you can never associate with it fully and that's our problem as human beings we often face or look in the mirror I mean and and I don't know if you ever do that and speak yourself in the mirror but you know maybe I've just got a few screws loose but I do sometimes and I say to myself you idiot you made up so bad why did you deal with that situation in that way you know but the problem is we judge ourselves from a critical humanistic perspective God never looks like like that yeah God never looks at us like that I mean God never looks at us through our opinion I thank God for that but I thank God more that God never looks at me through other people's opinion you know because we are so critical so quickly of ourselves and of others well random also sees he sees as the eternal logos God was manifested in the son and in Jesus throughout all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and they by guiding the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed and i and i just just to color that picture in a little bit the first seed went he to the ground I mean Jesus Christ the first c22 the ground but now it's harvest time it's time with that one seed is now bringing forth a crop a mini membered crop now that seed in multiplied form hallelujah those eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn which is a very important principle only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non seed there's nothing to quicken God has predestinated us and that is clear and the sad thing is many churches these days don't even believe in predestination because from a humanistic perspective they say God is unfair but you see if you read the word and you see here a buzzard I mean you gonna call God on fee but when you read the word you see I was a eagle from the start and when I was always an eagle I did nothing to deserve to become an Eagle are you gonna say praise God I mean praise God I'm an eagle I mean so what the buzzards opinion of the word is I don't care I don't kill him praise God but I just see I'm an eagle and I thank God for God has predestinated us but now the question that I want to want to ask remember now he's speaking about the secrets that he's sharing in his team how much works is God expecting of us how much his guards are asking us to meet him halfway how much is God saying I can make you a deal okay you do this this disinvest and then I will I mean now you obviously know the answer I've already said it was an unconditional governor and we know these things very well I want to continue in this line of thought now so God made a covenant with Israel God made a covenant with Abraham God provided the way out of Egypt now look at what brother Branham sees yeah I want you to notice this beautiful picture and this would be good for legalists you said listen God never come down and said no I just want to say I'm not trying to criticize legalist or anything that's that's not my heart but you'll see as we go what what the forties that I want to get across this morning said listen our God never come down and said now if you'll do certain things if you do certain things God's grace provided the Savior Moses right in that time they needed a savior the Savior that God seen for them in that time was Moses that's right not under any conditions was Moses brought but by Sovereign Grace God sent Moses not only a savior but grace provided the deliverer without any law without anything just solemn grace of God he sent down Moses to be a deliverer and the savior of the nation to bring them out God in that season sent a savior a deliverer and I want to say in that same way and don't quote me wrong and don't say I'm you know lifting brother branham up but we can say the same thing in our day God sent again a savior why a representative of his word I mean a representative of God's thoughts hallelujah and God did it it's all God's doing I mean like he's like brother Ramses this is something that will address the legalists and so on it's so easy to get legalistic it's so easy because of a human mindset of how we are brought up and different things I mean to have the mindset I mean that we somehow need to meet God halfway we Samiha need to purchase our own salvation well why did God purchase a thing in the message Kalish Barnea brother Branham says God has acted to the covenant people without any effort of these but he sent freely from heaven to his covenant people act of grace upon the sovereignty of his promise what a sovereignty mean it means doesn't ask nobody it doesn't ask your opinion got it as the devil's opinion God doesn't ask the the Angels opinion God does not your opinion or whether you worthy or not I mean sovereignly God decided and God made the promise and because he promised he will do it thank you lord you see I've heard it too many times that when someone is asked why are you in the message what is the message what makes the message different I'm sorry to say it but I've heard it so many times you people say well we you know we we way along he and graces and so forth I feel it since so many times that's not the message the message is not a dress code I mean if it was as easy as that well you know we would draw it right to what's these people Mike Bettes buttery for whatever the different ones and we say here's a few patterns just make sure you cover these and then the bride can all be ready because we can make our clothing according to those patterns yeah now don't give me unbalanced on this now wait till I'm finished okay but now my question is if it's about the dress code or if it's about how they look on the outside I mean then and and I don't like calling names but but moment consider wait what about the Brethren they I mean well most of them have long here and most of them wave feeling long dresses and so on and I mean and sometimes sometimes some of them look more modest than than some of the message ladies let's give that to thee there's a form of holiness there but does that make the message believers so I'll ask this question how do you know you're in the message I mean how do you know you get the message sticker book of approval you go to the mirror so you go with a long big to say okay I won't even give examples of you know because I might step in my own toes yeah but you know or do you go to your cupboard and go through yeah that one's okay in that one's okay that one's borderline failed today try again tomorrow I mean that's not what it's about so let's play it safe I mean let's play it safe let's say you're in the message when you have it in your head in your house okay you've got a Hoffmans head picture well we had a surprise a little while some Mormons visited us and when they walked into your house I said hey there's our picture I said no way there's our picture they've got the picture in their house so does that make vain be message believers no it doesn't well okay well we've got one up on them so let's put a cloud picture and a halo picture I mean they're not gonna do that right but the fact that we have the cloud and the hilar in the house doesn't make us Macy's believers I mean hallelujah I trust this is okay brother bean so how do we know when we are message believers there are so many people worth along here with the long graces where the pictures on the walls that claim to be in the message that setting misses churches that's not in the message that is not in the message well Brenda makes the statement he sees so it doesn't mean that you have to have a measuring stick in your church if you do this if you measure up to these rules if you measure up to that rule many times people will lie aside little things like that to belong to a church and the thing is still in their heart and they slip around and do it I mean but when a man has meet God's requirements and being born again of the Spirit of God those things that took care of his life he doesn't want to do God removes the thirst for those things and years the irony you might still sometimes fall and slip up and make mistakes but that doesn't take away from it I mean when God changes the thirst in your heart when God gives you the rebirth when God lives on the inside that makes you I mean a message believer yeah and and I trust this is okay brother Ben you can clean up afterwards I mean but you know you sometimes you have the question ask well I'd rather be a Christian than a message well what's the difference I mean hallelujah Paul wrote in the first church AG said this is the message that I have happened Paul was in the message and I believe Iranians was in the message and Martin was in the message in Colombo was in the message and all of them were in the message for their age I mean but we're the messages progress to now is where we are so in this eyes message equals Christian hallelujah and we've read in that was at that point that I have up there you can only be born again I think it was a previous code what you can only be born again if you were predestinated and here's the thing the difference between the foolish and wise virgins was that the wise had well in the lamps was born again only the bride Amy so what's the message then well it's the same message that Paul preached just now age-specific the earth day because in our day we have the benefit of hindsight we have the benefit where we can look back over 2,000 years and see God prophesied that there's gonna be an emphasis age and then there's gonna be a fire and it's gonna be or if it isn't then Smyrna I get them all mixed up now I mean but whatever you you get the point I mean God prophesied God prophesied how that the tree was gonna be eaten down will have for bugs and how God was gonna restore all of those things I mean God said to Daniel God said to John seal the book up but in this day he's taiking the seals off i mean in this thy god has revealed what god wanted for this day because this is the darkest of our this is in the midst of satan's Eden but this is now for the bride shall long time I mean rise shine the light is calm I mean the glory of the lord has risen upon thee I mean we walking in the light as he is the light I mean and though the world is in grace darkness we are living I mean in Goshen we're living in the light I mean they sometimes it's these arguments about you know people get upset when you say we in the bride age well I say it's because brother Branham see right but then they say we say we not in ladies here anymore no wrong that's not what we say the world around us this place we were to look at the in the dire in laodicea but I am NOT in lady CA I mean I'm not part of that anymore hallelujah because he asked me to come higher I mean into him what did he do he say to us Rebecca coming to my team girl I mean this stuff I want to share with you and she's saying well but but but Isaac I need to water my camels no forget the camels that's like this year I mean coming here I mean let me whisper things in your ear I mean hallelujah brother branham sees this I hope you don't mind me using so many quotes look at it in the world today we all this isms rise up watching all the cults of non meat-eating and Legolas that I've got to do so and so I've got to speak with tongues if I don't do this can you see that whole legalistic attitude I've got a speaking tongues I must think about so I need a measure I need a some rule something I can keep if I don't do this if I don't shout if I don't dance there's something wrong with me that's legalism we are saved by grace through faith nothing what you've done it's what he did he did what you could not do if you could have saved yourself then he wouldn't have had to die but he died in order to save you where you could not save yourself that old God dishonouring proverbs says god helps those who can't help things god helps those who help themselves they say that's just vice versa if you can help yourself god expects you to do it if you can save yourself then god says okay let me see troy i mean god helps those who can't help themselves and you can't help yourself to be saved so God by His grace saved you it's not him the growlithe or him that runneth the Bible says but God that shows mercy it's all by His grace Amy again brother Branham says oh god they need your hopes be built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness of course that song all around the soul gives way then he's all our hope and stay foreign the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking said to know him his life not to know the orders to know him the person I mean he's saying not to know the rules not to know the orders not to know what your church expects not to know you know think these boxes not to know go look in the mirror and say mmm is my hair long enough today is my whatever saying that's not a mark that you know him I mean that you in him I mean you must know him the person of God a man the best we can produce on our own is this men and women who profess to be Christians now this is there's something profound that I want to bring out here men and women who profess to be Christians and live like the world they say oh I belong to church what difference does it make it's a shadow of the deceiver from the Garden of Eden who pretended to be good who pretended to have light who pretended to have wisdom but was a deceiver whoa this is close and and I hope you forgive me for saying this who pretended to live the message of the air but was not born again the deceiver from the Garden of Eden the Pharisees are the same attitude and Jesus said you're of your father the devil in brother Adam takes it a step further it is now the mark of the devil is impersonation works not grace mazing statement the mark of the devil is impersonation works not grace the work shadow things to come Apocrypha going to church pretending to be a Christian and like I say Christian equals message in this time I mean pretending to be in the message living like the world having a phase with the world going out and acting like the world and so very close to both sides will be looking exactly deceive the very early so you can give both the maratti they look exactly the same but one on the inside is a Christian and the other one is not yeah I mean brother Ram speaks about these things how Esau was twice as as good as Jacob was I mean he speaks about how the devil is religious the Bible speaks about how the devil believes and he trembles I mean but God looks in the heart I mean and God saw that deceiving conniving Jacob I mean in his heart he wanted the birthright I mean why does brother branham hammer that whole principle of the birthright so much what's the issue with the birthright I mean in general the birthright speaks of inheritance I mean and we've got an inheritance I mean and I want a inheritance and in fact the base right the inheritance that the predestinated place that God has for me should be more important than the daily things should be more important than the layered easier that we have to walk into and we get up for work tomorrow morning should be more important I mean than anything on this earth I mean any responsibility anything that we hold dear anything that makes us excited it should be more important about than anything else I mean in Jacobs case I mean in Jacobs case that birthright was everything to him and it was even willing to lie in connive and steal and all sorts of things in order to get the birthright I mean but his attitude towards the birthright was right and God loved it and God loved him and he hated Esau I mean because his attitude towards the birthright was good and our spiritual birthright also is to bring forth the promised son you see we are in the same place that Mary was be it unto me according to your word I mean we read in Revelation chapter 12 about that woman who is wanting to bring forth the manchild bring forth the word in this age and so forth I don't want to spend time on those things now but by God's grace I mean we in such a position that we many times we mess I mean had just how much God has for us and I thank God for His grace I say it over and over I know I've seen it over and but I just cannot get it out enough I mean if it wasn't for God nobody could be saved it was only him who could step across them it was only God they could cross the bridge brother Ram cesium way back in the beginning when he seen that there were some people who was going to desire to be saved some people who was going to want to be saved some people who would be loyal in the heart I wanted to be saved then he's got to make a preparation for their salvation that's right or they will never be saved God has to and here's the amazing thing just to again speak about how we often measure ourselves this now we can't create timber but we can take timber after God has created it and make a house out of it because we offsprings of God's sons and daughters of God no matter how fallen we are still we have to recognize that we are sons and daughters of God in our fallen estate we star sons and daughters when Eve messed up when Adam decided to walk away because of his love for Eve whatever condition died when God still loved them I mean the lowest of lowest position that any son of son or daughter of God can ever get into I mean God still loved thee that woman that watched Jesus feet I mean there was a prostitute that had Seven Devils I think the Bible speaks about and so forth she was still a daughter of God when she was in the dirtiest place when she was in the vilest position when she was at the lowest point in her life she was still a daughter of God I mean she didn't suddenly become like I said in that previous quote I mean she didn't suddenly become a daughter we don't suddenly become a son or daughter I mean the day that we are reborn I mean the rebirth just manifests what God already knew I mean we were already a son we were already a daughter we were already a part of God we were already an attribute that God saw before the foundation of the earth and that is because of that I mean that God brings us to the position I mean we we get a revelation of who we are we can lure us into that thing by His grace and he's st. easily easier way how did you become Christians because you see it I want to become a Christian because that you saw God with tears no obviously not because God by grace called you that's right not because you saw him because he sought you I mean we read about Moses in the Bible and we read about how how he studied hard and he you know learnt all the skills of the Egyptians and I mean he learned everything he could and and probably I would say that his mother probably told him from a young age that you remember she she raised him for the first few years she probably imprinted in his heart remember use a deliverer God is gonna use you one day and so forth and Moses just like we would all do I mean started making plans how he was going to deliver the people they started making plans how on earth am I gonna do this and Moses after getting all the knowledge he could and studying hard and putting all the effort in he could it failed it flopped and it all amounted to nothing all he could show for all that effort was one date Egyptian failed miserably but five minutes in the presence of God quickened the seed that was in hallelujah I mean when God finally meet him when God came across his path I mean then that five minutes brother Ramses meant all more than all the teaching that I ever had meant more than all the knowledge that he gained went meant more than all the effort that he putting all the hard work and hard slog and dedication and effort and wanted to help all of that stuff I mean just went by the wayside because now God had met him in our God made that little seed in Moses life alive I mean probably at the point we had given up when you had stopped thinking about Egypt when he didn't have any any desire possibly even to do anything for you no he probably just he thought maybe that was just not me maybe my mum was wrong maybe maybe they maybe it wasn't an angel maybe he could have said all sorts of maybes maybes maybes like we often do sometimes teenagers quite often do we do I fit what am i what am I supposed to do you know where do I belong and all those kind of things I mean the reality is from God's perspective he was still the deliverer from God's perspective he was still the Savior I mean from God's perspective everything was going right amen everything was going right and God at the appropriate time God came across his path guard meeting and guarding called Moses Moses we are you Amy it wasn't Moses calling God it was God calling so I can ask the question you believe you remember of the bride I mean but many times we try to do God's work for him I mean we tried to fix ourselves we try to make the word come to pass we try to fix our families we tried to fix the people around us and all we do is we make a maze all we can show for it is or not one date Egyptian but one might be spiritually dead New Zeeland the rule or whatever I mean but God has a perfect time and God has a perfect plan for each son and each daughter and I believe it's time we trust God more these things have really spoken to my heart recently I mean sometimes sometimes we want to apply the humanistic natural things way too much sometimes we need to allow God I mean to do the supernatural and and and don't get me wrong it's not meeting God halfway that's not at all what I'm trying to say but what I believe we should do is we should just do what the word sees in simplicity but in faith trusting God brother brother Chad made a statement that for me personally was profound a while ago in wind when he said that was how he said he always had the mindset inand I'm putting it in my own words and forgive me if I if I presented slightly wrong but but he always so well you know when you have to do child training he couldn't understand that you know he would spank and then he would spank harder and that he would spank more regularly and and and so forth and he didn't have the desire to fix it obviously he was not you know smacking hard enough but that's not what it's about it is actually just following what the word sees and trusting God to do the change I mean so it doesn't mean smooth means pray harder when you smack and say god I'm doing this according to your word and we should do that same principle with everything in our lives I mean just do the bit that God gave us to do I mean but not God I meet you halfway god I've done all that you know God you said I mean it's nothing like that I mean it is just I mean following day to day what God puts across our path and trusting him and in faith just leaving the results up to God we said well the dilemma brothers and sisters that God requires us to be perfect but at the same time that God requires us to be perfect it is impossible for us to be perfect and there's many places where brother Graham speaks about these things I'm just gonna see this one haven't you heard many times the people say oh there's none perfect that's right you can't be perfect in the sight of your fellow man but you've got to be perfect or you'll never go to heaven I mean that's right so that leaves you in a dilemma the Bible says Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes Matthew said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how can we ever be perfect like that how can we ever meet that I mean how can we ever by putting fault by putting effort by working hard I mean by dedicating ourselves more by doing anything be as perfect as God is be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect you've got to be just as perfect as God is or you lost well if we look at it humanistically it is okay god I'm done I give up I'm not gonna make it now one little mistake and you lost one little flap of the eye and you're gone cause nothing can enter to those places but perfect now if the legalist only quotes that portion of the scripture then we all in trouble I praise God ow ELISA gave us a balanced approach God put Satan up day one time as an angel which he was the son of the morning and he took the good things of God and perverted them into evil God sure that nothing will end today that'll ever do it again I mean he's still making the point we need to be perfect I mean he says now you've got to be perfect Jesus says be therefore perfect even if you God father in heaven is perfect now how are you going to be when you continually sinning when you're continually doing what's wrong now this will kind of put a little kink in the legalist but notice is this it isn't what you do it's what God has done it's not what you do it's what he done see you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in Christ you are perfect you're not trusting in your own good works or your own church you belong to but you're trusting in the shed blood of the Lord Jesus there you are that's what makes you perfect that's what anchors your faith what makes you perfect his perfection is attributed to you his righteousness is attributed to you when God is saying show me your righteousness are you gonna be good enough you just take his righteousness and show it back to you I mean you can't show him your unrighteousness because you have none I mean I have none let me put it on myself maybe you good I don't but I am NOT I mean we can't show back to God my righteousness I mean I have nothing but we can take his righteousness and present it right straight back to him and God wants that I mean and what God is saying when we do that is that's my boy that's my girl you get what I'm saying I mean I remember now he's whispering in the taint and he's saying to his dear wife his beloved his to his dove in the thing he's saying to her this I want you to get I chose you but god there's so many more beautiful woman that I chose you I mean but god I can't do this as good as that person and I can't do that and I don't have so many talents I chose you are you criticizing my taste I chose you I mean God is weak we so often present to God God I fail you you and God I fail you today and God girl just get over it I mean it's like a wife going to a husband oh I wish I could be a bit of cooking I love you cooking because I love you I mean I mean my one sister-in-law her husband always hit when when they got married she even burnt the salad Amen but he loved her I mean he doesn't love her any less thanks God it's a love relationship and that's the point I want to start getting to I mean it's a love relationship and we must judge it we Sammy I think we need to validate yourselves beside me I think we need to prove ourselves to God we Sammy I think we need to kind of meet him halfway or all sorts of stuff like that that's not how God thinks that's not how God ever intended it I mean we thank God that the lamb took our place that the blood was shed and the Bible said in the Old Testament had that lamb had to be perfect and he was I mean the perfect lambs blood was shed for us I mean and that lamb is now presented back to God I mean and God has accepted he I mean even though we may fall we are still perfect even when we make mistakes we are still perfect through his perspective not we have fellow man pray maybe not through your own I mean but through his perspective we are brother Ramsay's they straps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to do that God you know it you stole perfect well hang on you've just stumbled isn't they like you know sometimes when you have medication and stuff there's an exclusion period after that you know God I mean three days of penance and then I should be right no nothing at all I mean hallelujah I've just messed up but you still perfect I mean hell because you your heart is right with God and win-win that conviction in your heart comes you immediately go to God and say God I'm sorry I shouldn't have said my attitude to that brother was wrong my attitude to that person was wrong I mean my my response to the situation was wrong god I'm sorry please forgive me and he does and it's gone and it's immediately gone and wiped out as if it never happened I mean is that instance way with someone came on the platform and she was really worried because they were I can't remember what was wrong some some attribute of sin in your life and as you were standing in the queue to get prayed my brother branham she was really worried that he was going to call that thing out in her life and she prayed in the line there and then and she committed it to God I mean she came in front of the Prophet he said nothing about it and I think she asked him ask two words if I remember the story right and he asked then and and he said to it when you confess to God it's gone God doesn't even remember it according to according to God as as if you never done it I mean and that's one of the things I mean no no church at the no denomination at thee has any concept of being justified it's one of the things that he whispered to our ears through our ELISA I mean Wade says if we never done it in the first place I mean my brother random ascribes it's so beautifully if if if you heard that someone was drinking and then you go to them and you say I heard you were drinking I forgive you and I say no you had it wrong I never did it I mean I wasn't there you got your information wrong I never did it I mean that's how clean we are before God and like I said it there's no exclusion period I mean there's no way three days and then it's gone when you give it to God it's gone I mean immediately I mean it's clean as if you never did it in the first place and I thank God for justify Alleluia justify Amen God requires perfection but we can never be perfect in ourselves I mean perfection is only in him but he's looking for his birth perfection so these are the things he's whispering to us in the tenth most denominations don't believe in election anymore most denominations don't accept these things what they do is they grab grace they make a disgrace of it I mean and I run with that in the wrong direction but I need these things to be solid in your mind before I move on to the next part now we can do nothing to increase God we can do nothing to purchase our salvation we can do nothing I mean to meet God halfway hallelujah remember now God is expressing a nice thing to his beloved bride and he's saying my fair one my dove I chose you and you are good enough for me I'm not looking at your works I'm not looking at mice or anything you do I'm looking at my sacrifice on Calvary but and here's the but a very important and big but there is an attitude that we have there's a attitude way we can own that we can only really find when we look at our Isaac through eyes of love remember one of those two principles everything that gets sitting that Tinky's through eyes of love brother branham expresses at the I don't know for me just the Prophet as a way of expressing these things like no one else can I want to hear him say it was well done my good and faithful servant I want to show you my appreciation now listen to this and he brings it to relationship now he sees my poor little old gray-headed wife how I would love to do something for her that I know she likes because I love her he sees because of my love because of my relationship with so I want to do something for her I'm not buying a love but I love her already I mean because I love her and I know she loves me and if I do that for my wife in the human love what do I have to do to know that God by grace before the foundation of the world seen me as a poor little sinner staggering and was going to hell and couldn't help it and he for dined me and put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and what he's saying brothers and sisters is because of his love because of what he's done for me I want to do things that I know he loves I mean it's not a disgrace it's not just tramping on the world it's not just ignoring the things that God revealed to us through the Prophet he wants us to do those things through the eyes of love because we're loving to his beloved now I believe he whispers he's perspective he's balanced I mean I believe that's all happening now under the Seventh Seal it's all part and parcel of it so now I want to go back to that opening Scripture we read about those Gentile warriors so we read about how those three Gentile warriors I mean so now I want you just to picture this now so Bethlem is surrounded and these brother Ram speaks about 15 miles of Philistines all around the city and and David and he's worried as they are they are somewhere else and David just expresses an embroidery probably just said under his breath I just wish I have some water this old you know water in my old goat skin is so warm and I'd love to get some of that water from Beth Lee he not for a moment instructed nobody to do nothing I mean he did not put pressure on him he didn't play games with him I mean but the Prophet sees not working can you flick on to the next slide please he had some servants day that my just the least of his desires was a command I want to ask you this the David's threatening no I mean he didn't even ask me it just expressed this is what I want I mean did he put fear on them that he play mental games with him if you don't go to base Liam you don't really love me that sounds like the Lila the loyalists are the same you don't really love me I want to kill you but you don't want to give me the secret I mean that's devil's manipulation games God doesn't play manipulation guy God is just putting an LP this is my desire hallelujah and there is three warriors I mean why did they go why did they go all those 15 miles through thousands of Philistines they could have died and they were willing to give their lives why because they loved him because it was David who asked it wasn't man's opinion it wasn't someone else playing mind games it wasn't the leader of the army that said to him boys if you really like your king you would do this they just did it because he expressed the desire I mean and that is part of what's being spoken in the state in our day under the Seventh Seal I mean I want you to notice it wasn't the command to them just as long as it suited them it was a command to them because they loved David they were all in butanol and I believe those three Gentile warriors is an exact type of this Gentile bride in our day sometimes we make the statement if it takes the skin off my back I will do this and let the other those three they meant it when they said it if it takes my life I'm gonna get water for David I'm gonna get water for my king I mean David wants a drink and I love him and I want to do everything to give him what his desires are I mean not by fear not because I'm forced not because I mean not because someone is preaching me and holding me over hell every Sunday I mean but I love him I mean I want to do what he says I loved him and because I loved him I wanted to fulfill his desires even if it meant they death so what does it mean to love the Lord I mean what does it mean to love the Lord with all and then so as the Bible speaks about does it mean that we desire to be with him and spend time with him well that's part of me I mean but because of his headship over us genuine love for him for Mica's do his will where do we find these well well easy in the Bible and in the message and it's all the Word of God what's the result when we love him we do what he says and I trust that you get the whole picture now because if you quite only the first half of the sermon you wrong if you quote only the second half of the sermon you're wrong but because we love him because it's only by grace we also do what he says not because of any other reason but because we love it so we can argue and I know I'm running a little bit of here for myself and I won't be too much longer but we can argue so easily well you know shouldn't everyone out they have long hair and long Grace's and so forth well if everyone had that same love for God they would but the things that are spoken is for you and me I mean the things that is she is under the Seventh Seal in this little little building in the team whatever you want to call it I mean it's for us and it's not for us to judge the world and criticize them and look at all the you know look at how bad they are understand that he's saying to you do you love me do you love me scripture is full of examples and I don't have time to quote them so I'm just gonna bring a New Testament example but I'll just quickly refer it in the Old Testament I mean there's so many so many places we it actually makes the statement like this you have to love me and do my commandments all those who love me and do my Commandments you see those things are linked together because if you genuinely love God you will do what he says and it will be a commandment to you God is not interested in a wolf cracking relationship where he has to boss his wife around to get it to move every time he wants her to move come on get off your fat backside and do something for me that's not what God is saying I'm sorry if that offends anyone but the principle is I mean expressing his heart and this girl's so lousy I mean that she can't do enough for him I mean that she wants to do what God wants once done I mean that she wants to be a vessel in his head she in his hand she wants to be used of him so in the New Testament Jesus makes the statement he says if you love me keep my Commandments now like I said God doesn't play mind games this is not the Delilah kind of if you love me I mean God does not have any bad intention with that God just throws his word out and he's making the statement if you love me he will do what my word sees Jesus could just as well have said if you say you love me and you don't do what my word says then you prove yourself that you lying or that you are deceived and I want you to know something else Jesus did this and he led by example he makes the statement he says but that the world might know that I love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so did I do you see even his relationship was like that I mean because of his love for the father because of his love for the word I mean he did what the would see I mean love and Commandments goes hand in hand Jesus loved the father and followed these Commandments but sometimes like I said sometimes people try to manipulate us if you loved me you would have picked up the wood outside if you loved me you would have the sensor that's manipulation I mean God doesn't do that but God puts his word out there knowing that his bride will submit because she's predestinated to submit I mean Jesus wasn't manipulated by the father Jesus wasn't trapped by the father God guarded and God didn't manipulate things you know in a nasty humanistic white outside this I mean I mean to get Jesus to do the things against his own world he totally by his own will submitted himself to the world he went to the cross brother Ram sees what held him to the cross was his love for us his love for the other attributes Alleluia and we are part of the word now of course we cannot speak about these things without just briefly touching on headship also so I'll just say this in this under the seventh you understand I mean we we know that brother on speaks about the threefold purpose and how the second purpose is God kidding getting preeminence in the boy that that whole principle of God getting preeminence in our lives is this woman by choice submitting herself completely to the will of the Father hit ship is so entrenched in our relationship with God and that means that we count his word above our own ideas above our own desires above the things that's important to us you speaking above our own judgments above our own hurts and pain I mean above our own excuses this word takes first place in our lives and I believe God will bless us and even in the natural the Bible speaks about how honoring your father and your mother's is the commandment with a blessing over with it with a promise and so forth I mean as such an important principle for God to fully submit to him and what if you feel that the word is just a booth well that means it just hasn't revealed himself to you yet but when you meet Isaac hallelujah then your attitude to the word changes significantly and I just go back to that scripture that I read a little portion of and just as we're starting to wind down now jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments and then in verse 26 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him you see if we look at this realistically I mean we can apply it all to rules rules rules if we look at it Calvinistic lee we can just look at the gray spot but the reality is the balances both sides together jesus said unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it that that will make myself known and to us a note on to the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me and it's so beautiful hair is expressing I love the father and therefore his word is everything from and I expressed the words through my life and you and I should be able to say exactly the same thing I mean when you hear my words you hear the father's words because I love the father and what the father's opinion is is my opinion I don't have an opinion of my own I submitted fully to his opinion you see the message of the gospel the good news however you wanted to call it I mean is the revelation of the mind of God and I believe in NSS I am winding down so just be with bear with me for a couple minutes I believe that under the Seventh Seal God is bearing or God is opening himself up fully and indistinct under the Seventh Seal God is revealing to himself to us the doctrine absolutely but is it just the doctrine no we enjoy the doctor me and enjoy to see how that the Bible and Falls and how the mysteries are revealed we enjoy that we might for that we eagles I mean but it's not only that it's also an expression of who he is but it's not only that it's also an expression of his attributes I mean which is who we are but it's not only that we want the whole package we want everything of him because what Rebecca didn't want just this part of Isaac she wanted everything she's saying tell me more tell me more I mean give me everything so it's also an expression of what God wants done with his word and you know I want you to mark this that or notice this that wind brother been and picked up his spin and and and wrote one of the things that was said was she will know what he wants done with his word and done is an action something that needs to be done some energy spent you see when God thought about our conduct addressing our daily lives that was also in God's mind and when God is revealing himself under the Seventh Seal I mean he's also revealing to us how we feel about certain things but his desires are for our conduct for church order for all those things I mean and when it was time for God to reveal his mind fully in this age which I believe it is I mean God included those things in what he revealed that's why God sent us a prophet who could tell us that certain things should be done in certain ways and so on I'll leave the detail of that I don't feel as my place do you say that in another church but as God revealed through the Prophet I mean the ABCs so to speak the do's and don'ts so to speak I mean they should not be received by us as do's and don'ts I should be received by us as this is what my husband who I love with all my heart desires and maybe some of you think I'm in nut case when I say this but those things are just as glorious as the revelation of the seven see as the revelation of the seven thunders a revelation of how these things fit together of the revelation to see how the seven Church ages flowed over the last few thousand years we love the doctrine we love the deep things of God but a son and daughter of God also loves a conduct order and doctrine because it's all part and parcel of the same word and he is the word so I just want to say in closing now these things are not for the other woman it's not for the other girls outside the teenth it's not for ladies hear these things is for the bride and and maybe I can use this terminology and I hope this doesn't throw anyone will confuse anyone but in the bride age and also it this way when you are in Christ when you have come into him I mean part of what he reveals is what He desires for us to to live by everyday I trust these things work I've rather been feel free to correct missing like I always say sticky oh pastor I mean goddess God has given him to bring you through and trust that something will say that was a blessing to you this morning let's stand together and we
