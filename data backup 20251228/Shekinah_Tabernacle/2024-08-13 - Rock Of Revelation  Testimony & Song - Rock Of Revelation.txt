========================================

I want to share something just before we do this song because we're we're going to teach you this. We'll play the song as an item and then we'll sing it all together after that as like a congregational song and then we'll call up brother Ben after that. Um, this may be uh a little bit different, but um the song came in an unusual sort of way in that it came reasonably easy for me to sort of pin it together. Could I have brother um Cuban, can you go and stand next to uh Vanessa for a second and stand up as well, Vanessa? So, put you on this is I'm just going to put you on the spot for a bit. Usually songs, most of the time I not all the time, but most of the time you go through something and then you pen an experience that you've been through. That's how that's how I've always done songwriting anyway. You sort of pen something that you've you go through some trial or some up or down and you sort of capture it in a in a tune and bring it out. But the other week, I think Ben was preaching something and I was just sitting on the chair over here and and this bit of inspiration came and it was like, I don't want to pen something for myself, but I want to pen something for somebody else. I just want to have get something for somebody else somehow. I don't know. I just wanted to capture something in some way. And I was sitting like this, I guess, like that. And I looked over this way and that's where the the moods sit over there. And it kind of something just went and a little spark went off and and and then I then the song sort of came reasonably easier than what most songs do. It sort of just every time I picked up the guitar would just a more would come and then I'd sit in church another bit would come and it would it was it wasn't there wasn't any effort. So I feel like it was I'm not going to say it is but it I kind of feel maybe if something was inspired I don't know what inspiration is but that maybe that was it. The reason why I've got them to stand up was because I I don't I I feel like it was maybe given to them to then maybe share with us if I could put it that way. So is it was a wee bit too supernatural for my general undertaking of how I do things. You know, I usually fumble around. So So I kind of Yeah, maybe I'm going on a limb, but I just feel like there was something supernatural happened. And this is this is your song. It was It was I feel like it was sort of given to you. Now, we all will partake of it because we like music's like that once you put it in the public domain, we all we all we we all take our little bit of it, you know, but there's an inspiration behind something and I feel like it was sort of I just managed to capture it and oh, here it is here and and pass it over. That's kind of was what I So, this will always be So, take this I think is from the Lord for you and and and take the words yourself there for you to speak out. Okay.
