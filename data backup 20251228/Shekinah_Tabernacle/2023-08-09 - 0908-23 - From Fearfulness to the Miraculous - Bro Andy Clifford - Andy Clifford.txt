Pew to every life Lord Jesus for when perfect love comes Lord all fear is dispelled and Lord tonight I pray Lord Jesus oh God if there's anything holding us back if there's anything Lord that's hindering our lives Lord father I pray that your love would come and remove all fear and Lord bring a real change tonight father Lord I pray that you would just come Lord and visit us in a special way Lord that Lord father there's no no man can do what you can do Lord and we're depending on the Living God to move tonight and in a mighty way Lord that's our expectation tonight Lord whether we're here in this room or out on the stream Lord Jesus father we've all got needs father Lord we all face a real enemy that comes to do real trouble in our lives but we serve a living God who's greater than that enemy and greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and so tonight Lord Jesus let that greatness be expressed Lord go beyond all ability of man because we don't have any who we're looking to you out all sufficient living loving sacrifice our Jesus the one that paid it all for us and the one that's got the the greatest bank balance the spiritual bank balance to back up your word to back up all your promises for they're all yea and they're all amen and tonight Lord Jesus I depending on you and I'm asking Lord that you would take complete control of preacher and hearer whether in this room or on the online Lord we're just asking now that you bless the service have your way to night Lord take control of every spirit oh God just depending on you now father in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah amen who's who's ready to have church amen hallelujah hallelujah you know I just get so caught up I forget what I'm doing and oh man what's next Hallelujah the Lord knows amen Hallelujah um thank you musicians amen hallelujah you can oh I can drive it here that's right he's getting used to this it's all here now we don't have any pointers anymore amen if you can turn in your Bibles tonight to 1 John 4 17. and 18 and oh my amen I believe you know I'm just depending on him tonight because without him you know this is just another sermon or and it and it could without him it's just subject matter that you've heard before right we've heard these things we've read these scriptures we've heard this preached before and Ben definitely has because I preached it in Africa so but it will be different so you know but with with this depend on the Lord you know we're depending on him and so tonight if you've just come to hear someone speak then that's all you'll get but if you've come expecting him to come and do something in your life Hallelujah then I believe that you will walk out of the service change and maybe you don't want God to do anything in your life but I believe that God is greater than that and he can help you and he can change your situation and take that fear off your life that's holding you back because fear holds us back it stops us from doing things amen it restricts us oh my it makes us be controlled by other people's opinions or what we think other people think that they might not even be thinking I want to speak tonight on the subject from fearfulness to the miraculous and I believe the Lord is here tonight to turn the tables of fear Hey Brother Marion good to see you bro hallelujah amen I'm so glad brother Marion's back hallelujah amen let's read sorry I'll keep you standing hearing us our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world that's a definite reality for you it's your inheritance as he is so are you in 18 there is no fear in love amen but perfect love casts out fear I'm so glad that love is powerful and it's got the power to cast out fear because fear is torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah do I just click that there we go the prophet says this and a personal experience with God he says this loving him oh we say we have faith we have love but if we had love we'd have faith for betters perfect love casts out all fair and when fear is gone faith is perfect let me read that again and when fear is gone faith is perfect as me and Isaac also there's your problem right there John fear fear is a is one of the most prevalent emotional problems that the human race has 1 John 3 19 and I'm just going to lay a foundation then we'll see what the Lord does Amen 1 John 3 19 it says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and know of all things beloved if our heart condemn us not condemneth us not then we have confidence towards God and confidence towards God is a key element to you having faith to believe and to loving God because when you love somebody you have confidence in their word you'll have confidence in their integrity in their character in what they you will have confidence in how much God loves you and how he cares about you and what he's made you so that you can have faith in what you are and that really is the key to perfect faith but it starts with a real confidence in God a loving of God I want to read a quote here it's not in the slideshow but I just it just so impressed me just earlier I just want to read this so it's not on the screen so just forgive me for that but um yeah it says here love has no fear love casts out fair and I noticed in my meetings so much that when I come into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear and you know a prophet could see the fear could see it it can discern it and see what's restricting all these people and I can tell you everyone in this room has got struggles in their life that's either rooted or as a derivative of fear it's got something to do with fear it's afraid of something fear of rejection fear of failure fear of change fear of all these different things but let me tell you God gave me the subject tonight for you so that he can come and visit you and cast that fear out of your life and turn the table because what I just read before is two different types of fear there's a there's a a fear that's made you afraid and hold you back but there is actually a real fear that you should have and that is the fear of God an uncorrupted perfect or who said the word awesome our god is awesome he's awesome and he wants you to be in awe of him but what the devil does is he makes us scared of him and he makes us scared to react it makes us scared to even express ourselves and sometimes it gets so bad that you're even afraid to worship you're afraid to do something I even you know I preached about the devil a while a long time ago a few years ago and I had such a bad trial it was like weeks of just oh my and it was a series I never finished it you know and I think I must admit I was a bit afraid because of the the attacks that I got I thought man do I even bother you know I was ready to leave the ministry leave everything it was so bad and I remember after I preached that brother and poco's man you really exposed the devil tonight and I was like yeah but then for about seven weeks after that I went through one of the biggest Trials of my life and it's all in here and it's all because of fear and he just grips you down this fear and oh my yeah oh I'm gonna hold fire because I just want to get to something first okay I'm being a good boy and I'm laying a foundation Hallelujah amen oh you know and I pray Lord let this because fear even now right getting nervous being afraid you know it can happen it can happen in the pulpit and it can take us and derail as someone that's preaching by fear and I tell you one that is the fear of what people think or the fear of of of of of doing something wrong but I tell you what this is where the perfect balance is because you don't want to be overconfident either but you've got to have confidence in God and you've got to have such a love and confidence in him that you can totally rest and allow God and love this atmosphere to express what he wants without any fear of man but a true restoration of uncorrupted reverence towards God now fear the bad fear really started for us on the earth in Eden yeah man I tell you what it was hard to find a decent image right oh my I said you know fig leaves and Eden and things like that and I had to sort through a few things but we'll leave it there but from or so here we have an Eden and a perfect utopic condition and Adam and and his wife you know they were one with God and they fellowship with God and they were an aura of God and they feared God but it was a real fear it was a real or there's a real emotion a real fear a real reference but the thing is when they separated from God and Satan needed this to happen so that he could come and he could put a corrupted fear on the earth so that that's what would drive his whole civilization but you can see here how they're afraid of the one that can only one that can help them what is that and that's been inherent in man and is run from God and maybe you're running from God and maybe there's a fear in your life that's holding you back tonight but just remember God's come God's purpose tonight is to visit you is to visit your Pew to visit your mind to visit your heart and take those fears out of your life and everything that's restricting you he's the one that does it not me not no minister no one but Jesus he's the one that can do it this is the Lucifer's whole Vision was to create an Economy based on fear an economy that's driven by fear an economy a world that everyone's afraid of missing out and you know what that creates greed and greed is what drives the economy and people will they won't do it for free they will get paid to do it they'll want money they want gold they'll want you know what the whole driving force of this economy of the devil is gold and that is the pavement in heaven and so I just say praise the Lord we're going to walk on it amen that's why if that's the case and you're already there then why not you let it under your feet don't let money rule you let money be a tool and by faith conquer it amen hallelujah some common synonyms of fear I'm probably saying that wrong alarm alarm dread fright Panic Terror and trepidation while all these words mean a painful agitation in the presence or anticipation and that's the big one because yes the fear is good that you need that man if you're you know sometimes you've got to run sometimes you've got to fight sometimes you have to especially when that enemy tows the line with you right you've got to stand Hallelujah but don't fear Him don't be afraid of him but I tell you what the trouble that we have and the human race has is the anticipation Crossing Bridges before you come to them worried about all the possible outcomes it could be what does that do it breaks your bond to Jesus Christ it breaks the bond that you have to Jesus Christ because you're afraid of what others think or you're afraid that you're going to miss out on something you're in or you're afraid of what possibly could happen and yet and there is an outcome and God has said you know I've I I would above all things that you prosper and be in health and if you seek me first all these things will be added to you you'd have to worry about all these natural things in life you don't have to worry about the economy you don't have to worry about anything the moment you worry it breaks the connection of faith it actually cripples Faith fear cripples faith and that's the very thing that crippled the faith of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt who knows the story they came out of Egypt they saw Great Mighty wonders and they saw in the hand of God through Moses and still they've disbelieved still they feared and still they were severed from the promises of God because of fear they were afraid of the enemy and in that fear which is an atmosphere excuse the pun but in that fair as an atmosphere which breaks the faith when they've broken the faith and they've stopped believing then all the Devils just coming in and then the devil has a field day in their mind and what does he do he goes back into their subconscious four or five generations of slavery and starts to stir up the slave mentality within them oh man and uses that old mentality and they Wonder whistle the Miracles where's the supernatural I tell you what it gets severed by fear and tonight I believe the Lord if there's any fear in your life you don't have to leave the service with it Hallelujah just ask God I don't know what fear you have in your life unless I'm really close with you and you've you've had confidence to tell me about yourself but God does and maybe and I shouldn't say maybe but certainly God knows fears in your life that you might not even be aware of that are restricting you and you might think it's something else but really it's rooted in fear but perfect love is here Jesus Christ is here tonight to take fear so that you're not afraid to worship so that you're not afraid to express Who You Are oh my you know the devil over the ages has always used fear to control the races on mass even with the covid-19 vaccine all those things he and the and the pandemic that came fear just gripped the whole world within 24 hours the world was under control of the devil through what fear it wasn't a pandemic of germs and colds and flus it was a pandemic of fear and it was the fear that people are still out there now and there's no covert and they've still got masks on because they're fearful and they develop fear because they have a mask on and then all of a sudden they're hiding behind a mask and now they're scared to take it off because they've and I me and Isaac went to China and they lived behind masks and we asked the girl that translated for us and she was like yeah now people just are so scared to show who they are people have got behind this mask and they live behind it and they get plastic surgeries and everything they're so insecure insecurity but perfect love is here tonight to take your insecurities especially school children you know oh my goodness the social media and all of the everything I mean we've we struggle with it with movies all that stuff in our time and now it's probably 10 times worse but the image of perfection that the devil waves in front of the people the made-up woman the made-up boys all of those things that look so good and yet they're not even that good it's all just Photoshop you know it's all just some fancy thing and then you behold that and what does it do it makes you insecure and that's a fear on your life that stops you from expressing Who You Are and you may not even realize it you may even come to church and have a good time but you've but there's more of Christ to be expressed in your life so I just pray and I want you to pray this Lord if there's anything holding me back show me tonight just show me tonight that's what I depended on the law for I'm just going to share a few scriptures and things but I'm depending on him but listen to that the anticipation of danger fear is the most general term and implies anxiety and usually loss of Courage and what did Israel lose their courage but what did God say to Joshua when he went into claim an air inheritance be courageous be very courageous and I want to just uh commission it's not the right word but I'll just use a you all and myself be very courageous because there is the Last Frontier of the battle and and of our inheritance to claim and it's going to take courage and it's going to take confidence in him it's going to take perfect love and an atmosphere where there's no fear in your life in the church and so when you come to church you know the perfect love comes and that's what we pray for amen it's the greatest thing the prophet says lay aside everything yeah yeah until you have perfect love what is it's the Holy Spirit you see it the Holy Spirit starts in your life as a little white button Prophet Sid start small and you feed it on the word and he feeds on the word what does he do he begins like that little rock you know in Daniel's dream Nebuchadnezzar's dream how that Little Rock was came off the mountain and it smote the image of Babylon and it blew that image up that Little Rock that's that's the Gentile dispensation finish right we all know that is there anyone that doesn't know that right the whole Gentile Justin station was prophesied in that dream and and the The Little Rock which is Christ that came from the mountain cut without hands smote the very feet of that image and blew it all up do you think happens when the Holy Ghost comes into your heart it blows up the image of Babylon out of your life no more you know you you won't struggle with those things anymore it's like a total Deliverance it's a total change of character a change of heart but what does it do he comes in and what does it say in that dream it says that he comes in and he starts to fill the whole Earth what is he doing as the prophet says he says it starts off as a little white button of light and begins to grow in your life grow and your life grow was it doing casting out all the fear all the anxiety or the trepidation or the loss of Courage all of the all of the distractions and the lusts and the envies in them and all the competitiveness you know that insecurity where you've got something to prove all the time we've got nothing to prove he proves he's the one that proves his own word in our life not me not you him Hallelujah amen what does he do he comes into your heart to fill your whole earth to fill everything in your life so that he's taken over Amen to give you courage oh my has he not ever heard the word petrified before I've uh you know like oh man he's petrified or petrified with fear you know fear can get such a grip on you fear can grip your whole body and spirit until you are completely disarmed until you cannot function until you on my computer if I really stuff it up it goes into safe mode is it unheard of safe mode before and it's like blue screen of death and you can you may get it back oh my how many people get stuck in safe mode spiritual safe mode come out of safe mode my son my daughter Hallelujah I believe the spirit is calling us out of safe mode calling us out take the safety off and just let God Express himself through you don't fear the enemy the enemies nothing greater as he was in you than he who is in the world greater Hallelujah the Lord is intent through the scripture from Genesis to Revelation fear not my bride fear not little flock for it is your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom Hallelujah Esther she was afraid why did she have to be afraid for it was her inheritance all she needed to do was stand before the king in Courage and he extended the scepter and she received unto half the kingdom but we get this this is what happens in life petrification that you know like um it brings an emotional disconnection through Pro prolonged fear and anxiety you know emotional disconnection to petrify you you become imprisoned to fear you become imprisoned to depression because you're constantly anxious about stuff and apprehensive about things and Crossing Bridges before they come and your body says come on come on that's enough I say this to my children all the time because sometimes I have to tell them off well probably all the time but you know children children but you're always telling people telling them off you know because they're and you've got to in love and and you know sometimes it's hard and I said you know every time I say something like this I always say look it's not hopeless yeah yeah because what I'm showing you right now what is being revealed in this conversation there is a right in this moment is a way out right in this moment is the opportunity for change for a real experience with God and the purpose of the law the purpose of of the of the word is to come and show us the mirror image of ourself right the marriage of Christ then you see it and when you see something in your life that's not meant to be there then you say oh God help me Lord I don't want that in my life anymore I don't want fear in my life I don't want limitation in my life I don't want anxiety in my life I don't want to cross Bridges before I come I don't want to have an anticipation of what could go wrong because what does that do it cripples your face and you knew live emotionally disconnected from God and from people your body says no I'm sick of feeling like this fear creates a negative chemicals in your body bloodstream and your body doesn't want that anymore so what does it do it says turn it off depression then you become disconnected you begin to pull back and pull away it gets all too much but there's an answer tonight there's an answer that's flowing in the House of David the blood that flows from Emmanuel's veins it is speaking Freedom tonight it's speaking better things than Abel's blood that's in Revenge Revenge but this one says Mercy Grace Hallelujah and there's a people tonight that can worship and say Grace Grace unto it because there's Capstone has come and what is he to do to get rid of those things he came in many times the angel of the Lord we'll get to it soon and he visited the ages and he visited different times when they were all in a big mess who comes on the scene the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord why because he wants to take fear out of their lives because they're afraid of the enemy they're afraid of missing out you know they get afraid of missing out God delivers them then a generation goes by then they get afraid of missing out what the world's got they get fomo who's got who's suffered with fomo before oh my that's a very bad thing you know like that can draw you into the world you think oh I would like to try that and that's what Israel did they like to try it and then the spirit of it comes upon them and then they get mowed down and then they scared of the enemy because they've lost faith but then who comes this one here I don't know if I really had it properly but if this is a sermon in itself is always in fight or flight mode and now when you're always in fight or flight mode who knows what that is does anyone not know what fight or flight mode is children you can be honest fight or flight mode is where it's activated it's a natural instinct than the human being that when something dangerous is happening or something that's causing you to either fight that thing or run yeah did you know that human beings often live in that condition they're constantly living in anxiety and fear and and torment and they haven't really connected to perfect love even Christians people that sit in this church can sit and live in that fight or flight mode because they're as worried about stuff and worried about money and worried about what this one says children worried about what my schoolmates would think if I was like this worried about what my boss would think if I did this or said that let's not be worried because I'm worry how can God lead you because you see these when you're in vital flight mode it actually it's in Galatians 5 it talks about how the flesh comes out and fear and all these things in the flesh The Works of the flesh begins to come out because you can't be led by the spirit because perfect love casts out fear but when you've got fear and you're in vital flight mode how can the spirit the dove come down and lead you and put you in an atmosphere where you can have faith and win the fruit of the spirits the fruit of the spirit you should bear Above All Things you know that Above All Things but it's that easy as a Believer Spirit-filled to get thrown out of condition that's State it's a state of mind of of love and we can get distracted and we can get busy and we can get apprehensive we can worry about our families and worry about this and that and everything else and stay in a fight or flight mode and what happens you start getting carnal then fleshly starts to manifest in your life but God is saying walk in the spirit favorite walk in the spirit shall not do the lust of the flesh because the spirit the the flesh lusts against the spirit it's against the spirit but the spirit is also against the flesh which one are you going to yield to tonight which one are you going to allow to lead you tonight because you don't have to stay in fight or flight mode someone on that camera you don't have to stay in fight or flight mode you can come out of it tonight and have perfect peace and perfect love and the love the spirit of God can come into your life and truly bring you into rest and Lead You Hallelujah this come out of final flight mode some potential triggers of of fear now I just put these up here and there's a lot of them and there's lots more but the the whole purpose of this is just to I've asked the Lord if there's anything in our life that is triggered that we can deal with it by he can deal with it tonight that he can just come right now where you're at you'd have to wait till the end of the service it can happen as the word Goes Forth amen Darkness spiders you know snakes spiders lizards mice Heights flying social interaction man's opinion that's a big one have I told you about what happened you know we were given a dream well many years ago now probably five odd years ago um of uh you know I we were driving and I was I was in my car and Brahman was next to me and I was driving but my hands were off the steering wheel I wasn't on the steering wheel and it was driving and bromham was like that's like a room it's been driven from a remote and and often times in a spiritual dream akara represents Ministry and the Lord was and there was a whole bunch of other stuff that happened after that but this one was very clear the interpretation came very clear that that you you cannot let other people's opinion drive your life and in this particular instance Drive the ministry to drive how I preach what I do what I say you cannot because when you take your hands off the steering wheel and you let other people's ideas or what you think they think drive it who's leading and that's same for your life that's the same whether you're at school or you're at job or you're traveling the world and preaching that's the same thing let God lead you have no fear of what people think have no fear of man's opinion rejection man what a big one fear of rejection just remember you're accepted can I tell you that tonight you are accepted in the Beloved you don't have to earn it actually you can't earn it don't even try you're given it God loves you so much all the people of God love you so much you're part of the family of God you know they talk about prestigious families and how good it would be to be born into such a family or a powerful family in that you're actually being born into the most powerful family you are the most powerful people on the Earth I'm sure you've been told that many times but you're part of the greatest family and you can't join it you're going to be born into it through the new birth repent turn from your wicked ways and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you until you your children and to all that are far off we're far off and even as many as the Lord shall call amen is he still calling Hallelujah the promise is still fresh they're still real God is still filling with the Holy Ghost maybe you need the Holy Ghost tonight why don't you ask because if you ask the father he's not gonna he's not going to ignore you fear of your heart being broken you know and that really brings a problem for people that can't commit is a commitment issues they can't commit to a relationship can't commit to friendships struggle enough with their immediate family that can't really connect with other people can't connect with friends Brethren the church cut really open deeply to people but tonight that can change right now that can change really perfect love and Jesus Christ can come that's where the church is oh I better push this all right I'm going back I've missed some fear of losing control fear of death fear of missing out we know that one change fear of change fear of failure and fear of losing face Pride can stop us these things can hinder us but as the past has been preaching put it in the fire lay it in the fire of God lay those things you know what's limiting you you know what's holding you back lay it on that fire just place it in there Rahab had to put the Scarlet rope out her window it was a token of faith that she believed in it it was a sure token and and and and and you have to make an action towards laying that thing in the fire allow that thing to be burned up Let It Go you know the Lord how he spoke that time and he said that if if you hold on to those things they can take you to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean yeah yeah and you drag you down You Can Let It Go yeah you've got the power to lose just let it go oh my God that's where the church is you're always scared and it's not going to happen that's what you know that's the reason it don't happen when fear love casts out fear when you got love fear is gone I thought Lord you know I've been praying this for for all week just Lord and always we're just praying these things but Lord let that love that this prophet's talking about love that neutralizes Hornet's Nest love that turns balls away men that wanted to kill the prophet put them down at the feet to sleep to take away your fear Lord that's my inheritance Lord I'm coming to the King's throne room tonight and I'm I'm gonna touch that scepter and that scepter says yes that's it that says it's yours that word says it's yours the judge has come to judge you faithful to judge you true to judge you a Believer why because you believe in Jesus why because you've taken him at his word amen Hallelujah when you've got love fear is gone but as long as you got fear love cannot operate as long as you got fear love cannot operate so Lord take all the fear out of my life Lord just remove every little ounce of it or any sort of inroad you know like a wall and the devil has little footholds to try and climb your wall oh God get all those footholds out of there make it as slick as possible so he cannot penetrate any part of my life Hallelujah I don't want the devil climbing my wall climbing in how many times he climbs in and how easy it can be sometimes and you know who you are I don't know I'm who I'm talking to by the way but we all have a thing in our life things that the devil can try and get us on and he just seems to get it so easy sometimes why get the footholds out God is here tonight to take footholds to remove that you know the prophet said that we should be an invincible Army what does that mean like the devil can't get you he can't even you know he's so just just discerned out of the whole picture he's Bound by circumstance and Hallelujah and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was an offerer that pertained unto joash the abarite and his son Gideon thresh Weak by the Ryan wine press to hide it from the midianites see his whole life has been encompassed with fear he was living in a limitation he was threshing his wheat and and the livelihood the seed the grain it was all the things that he could live by he was afraid of the enemy yeah he was living in a limitation he was limited he had the silencer wrong sit in silence too scared hide behind the wine press hide behind that thing hide behind that structure of man hide behind this thing that I've created hidden fearful oh God help us and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him now look the grace of God who loves the grace of God see the Lord does not want you to remain in fear see the angel of the Lord and we're going to get into him in a little bit the angel of the Lord has a purpose and that purpose is to take fear out of your life to take the limit off your life so that you can truly worship so that you can truly praise so that you can be at peace and so that you can speak and it would happen and you can get in the spirit Hallelujah take you from warming up you take you from just existing who wants to go beyond existing and really thrive in the presence of God and live in the miraculous who wants to go from fearfulness to the miraculous and you want to see Miracles take place in your life Miracles take place in your family Hallelujah and see God make a change in your children to see God prophesy through you not just from here but from your whole life where your life becomes miraculous where your life causes the Devils to flee just by being in his presence Hallelujah this is our inheritance we don't live below our privilege we don't have to live below our privilege we can live in a full privilege hallelujah oh God help us first Lord that's my prayer with all my heart by the way and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor I just want to say that to you thou Mighty Men of Valor thou Mighty woman of Valor I want you to say it I am a mighty of Valor whatever you are say it I'm a mighty man of Valor do you know why you are that because he said he told you that and if he hasn't told you that tonight tonight he can so that he can take the fear off your life so that you can function so that you can really function don't turn up to Kemp minus 20. come to Camp plus 50 and get and leave Camp plus a thousand really on fire really just beating up the Devils on left right and Center Hallelujah you know sometimes we get this kind of expectation oh I'm just going through such a hard time oh I just can't wait for camp you don't think like that you don't need camper to get there you can be there tonight you can get there now whatever you're struggling with whatever those fears are in your life the angel of the Lord has appeared who believes we're in the appearing are we in the appearing is that clock right is that right that's right eh oh good I just need to keep an eye on that we're good praise the Lord don't turn it back on mud amen he's sneaky okay amen and there came if I read that I have and Gideon said unto him now listen to this response oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us that's a good question and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of there's something in that yeah as you can see I made it big and blue they and and blue I mean I didn't think about this but blue is pretty cold right now do you know what they shouldn't have just told him I don't want to just tell my children of God's Miracles I don't just want to tell of someone else's testimony or speak of something that happened in the past I serve a now God a god of the present a God that can defeat enemies tonight a God that can take all that fear out of my life so that I can be a Son of God so that I can function so that Babylon gets out of my life out of my family out of my home out of the whole Stokes Valley for that matter why not why not out of the Hutt Valley out of Wellington oh my God 20 odd how many 15 odd years ago there wasn't really a vision in Wellington but look what God has done and happen if you if you believe and when you can say I'm not I'm not telling you you can God and we want to see his miracles but the problem that they had in Israel the trouble that they had is all they could say was the testimonies of the past why because they feared why because they were fearful of the enemy and I want you tonight to realize you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be afraid the devil wants you to be afraid because he knows if you believe he is toast yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah you know the devil has conferences in hell yeah they have meetings and every now and again you're on the agenda now I'm going to speak what you should be and I believe that you are really when the when you come up on that bill and that you're up on their projector screen uh and they start saying right and they gather all the devils and and then they're like and then your name comes up and all of a sudden the Devils start going to the back no way and they're like all right call them the higher Powers then call them the the national Spirits then so the national spirits come in and they say your name oh no no no no no no no no and now the devil's real angry now Lucifer comes and then when he sees your name he says no no take them away we will not we can't do anything to her we can't do anything to him because they have no fear oh they don't speak our language they speak a language of Heaven they speak a language of love they receive Jesus Hallelujah that's right he has no power over you I want you to really express yourself in his grace and his presence so that you don't have to tell your children or just tell of some past God but you've got to now God Gideon had real enemies they really came and they really destroyed his crops and they were hungry and they were weak but God rich and mercy he's not gonna leave them like that Glory who believes that Oh Glory removing fear through Angelic visitation this is really the Crux of the slot it's not a historical thing yeah yeah you see we're in the appearing of the Lord we're in the age where the mighty Angel himself has descended into your life he didn't just Ascend into the age in 63. he descended into you you are part of the program news flash front page is it on the front page you are part of this there's no you know sometimes we just think oh it's the collective Gideon probably thought we're just stuffed as a nation because look at all the troubles and problems and if Gideon continued on that fearful kind of vein of thought he would never have had a Revival but you see God comes to you tonight because he wants the Revival to be in your life not just don't just think oh the church the church and all the collective yes we want them all we want everyone to be in Revival right but it starts with you it starts with you tonight with an invalid visitation into your life an Angelic visitation that is powerful enough to take Peter out of prison yeah amen it's powerful enough to remove the walls of Jericho so that Rahab can marry the captain how much more that real angel that would come down in this age Hallelujah to remove the walls of your own limitations and fears and holding you back in your old life how much more can that angel affect your life breaking slave mentality removing not just covering Allah but removing fight or flight mode when you totally realize it satisfied yeah not yours it's not yours when you're in vital flight mode what are you doing owning the fight to yourself right right and then you're getting in fear but when you can surrender the fight to Jesus surrender the fight to him yet we'll take you out of final flight mode and you will come into perfect love then surrender becomes easy surrender becomes pleasurable oh Hallelujah I love this and we sing this a lot this poor man cried and the Lord heard him Hallelujah and save them out of all everyone say all all his troubles and the angel of the Lord and came to round about them that fear Him so now that fear that you had for all those things and fear of man's opinion and fear of what couldn't come or could come and all the things take that Fear cast that into the darkness and now fear the lord now I have a reverence for him because there has to be a fear in your life there has to be something that you're fearing but a positive fear to the right one and if you have fear in the right one he will encampus around you what does that mean he stays there night and day in your dreams in your wait time at work at the dishes at church at church lunch oh my when you're doing a special and there's fear on you oh I can't say oh I might muck it up don't be afraid of mucking it up God will take over yeah if you get scared of it how can God come and take over your song well how can God come and take over that thing that you're doing you just have to this is where confidence comes out don't if you've got confidence in yourself you will be in fight or flight mode and you'll be sitting up here ready to fly ready to fly off because you're scared of people and congregations and whatever but if you can just say Lord I'm not coming in my ability I'm not coming in my my skill or how much I've practiced practice all you can but when you come up here you just let go of all of that and hold on to him and say Lord here I am now Minister through and Lord bring a life to the gospel bring a life to yourself through the song or through whatever that you're doing for the Lord because in that atmosphere where there is no fear and you've got confidence in humor all things are possible all things not just for you but for the people that listen it changes the whole atmosphere of the whole thing everything changes when he comes everything changes when he comes amen do you believe that tonight amen who is the Angel of the Lord that came to Gideon does everyone know this here tells you who he is oh my and all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them Hallelujah can you just think about that all the things that they went through Israel and everything they did this Angel of the Lord the angel of his presence saved him and who in his excuse me in his love and his pity he redeemed them what did he do he brought them from a con a horrible State and brought them back to their original condition Hallelujah it doesn't redeem you just to lose you he redeems you to keep you Aaron's Rod when it stayed in God's presence it flourished do you think it just stopped flourishing I would venture to say that there was a nice identity Garden in that place oh man I've never thought of that but about three weeks ago or something the Lord just kind of said you know what what what could happen if you stayed in the presence of God you know like the the rod would just flourish maybe he the high priest alone that would sin would see identical conditions in there I don't know but just think in the presence of God and as love he redeemed them to bring you to something that you were originally them and he beared them and carried them all the days of old this is what presents mean the angel of his presence the angel of his person the angel of his face the angel of his countenance the angel of his favor this is the hour of favor of God the king gives you favor Esther the king gives you favor Rahab the king gives you favor Hallelujah oh God let that favor come Lord Jesus let that favor come to every Pew let that favor come to those that are sitting in here and don't want to be here oh God change Minds today woo your children today let the fear of God come into this place and turn the table so that the devil we're no longer afraid of carnal things we're no longer afraid of what people think we're no longer afraid to be honest we're no longer afraid to reveal who we really are we're no longer afraid to come out of that lie we're no longer afraid to truly worship God we're no longer afraid to raise our hands and worship without limitation we're no longer afraid to tell our boss about Jesus Christ God is here to turn the tables of fear so that you no longer fear these things but the devil fears you so that when there's a conference in hell they all run because they know that when they come to you they don't return in one piece they return with a solid beating and not just them but all their brothers all their fellow demons get beatings too and then National Spirits get deep beatings too and the international spirits and everything just gets a big hiding because you know that you've got an atomic weapon room in your prayer life and you know that you can send Atomic missiles down the devil's chimney and it will hit him and doesn't matter where he is in the world Hallelujah you're the most powerful people in the world Biden Trump Putin got nothing on you do you know that most powerful people in the world you you me yes you and you just say me because of what he did and it's the hour of his favor there's a visitation of favor I wish I got the definition for that but we all know it's a very good word his love was expressed in this Angelic visitation in Exodus 23 verse 20. and it says how the angel would come and Lead Israel into the promised land and cause their enemies to crumble at their feet and they were just all they had to do was walk forward and start slashing the sword don't worry about where it goes you just walk this way and start swiping and you swipe this one and swipe that beer and swipe that jealousy and swipe that hatred and swipe that malice swipe that SWAT that lust Hallelujah swipe it it's all he asked this Angel says I'm giving you favor all you need to do is walk forward and start slashing the enemy have his taken your children slash him down just keep slashing don't give up just keep slashing because Israel if they keep slashing they would have the whole end until David and they had everything why because they keep slashing they just keep cutting the enemies down one time one man cut 800 and it set his hand cleaved to the sword couldn't let it go oh God bring me to that place where I can't let your word go where your word is so precious to me and it's so personal to me that I can't let it go I'm apprehended of bed which apprehends me Hallelujah Hallelujah the word of God and all he says is keep flashing it's the hour of your favor it's time it's time in the name of the Lord Joshua meets the captain causes Deliverance over Jericho Hallelujah Gooden Gideon takes Gideon and his family and the whole nation out of fear they were scared of the midianites Midian means brawling it means fighting and disunity brawling the brawling a fight they were fearing all these things Paul he says this angel came to me who's I am identifying this Angel as Jesus Christ the Lord says in Exodus 23 that my name is in him who knows that says don't offend him my name's on him amen and then obviously now in our day Revelation chapter 10. but what does he say to every single one what is his message what is the Crux of it right Lord let's have the musicians let's play this on fear you tried to have your way but not today amen not today his message fear not comes walking on the stormy seas of your life he says Be not Afraid it's me visiting you the real living God I've come to deliver you from a real enemy who's got no power but he is very real and he'll try everything he can and he'll try and bring you down and disable you but condemnation will not disable you because God's love he judges you righteous oh my imagine if we were if condemnation could disable us imagine if we had to live in condemnation how miserable that would be but God says fear not he visits us and says fear not he says fear not All Through the Ages is that right has he said fair not to you stop fearing these things it doesn't matter what people think of you so that will pass that'll be forgotten soon but what about the one that can help you tonight amen Hallelujah all right I've just got a couple more things to read while that music's playing I just wanted to share a couple of I shared one already you know I was when we first started all these businesses and things years ago you know Isaac and myself we work so hard and everything just was going wrong and the more wrong it went the harder we had to work and it was just getting really hard and I was working from three I was working from Seven a.m to 3 A.M Some Nights and never getting really anything truly done and I got so out of catering I was fearing failure I was just afraid that I was going to fail I was afraid that the businesses were going to fall I'd gotten into I was in fight or flight mode and sometimes in our work in our natural life we get into that mode and we think we can do it and if you're listening on there you think you can do it you're wrong you cannot rescue your businesses you cannot achieve anything if God is calling you because you see he's got a powerful powerful promise if you seek me first if you put me first you will progress in the greatest manner and all these things that shall be added to you what is calling you to is fellowship in your bed chamber Fellowship in your secret place he wants you to meditate on his word and meditate on him in the Night Watch don't watch YouTube get off that habit there's a better there's a better greater form of joy and he and he actually promises if you do that he's going to bring marrow to your bones and prosper you all your natural things you won't need to worry about that he doesn't want us to fear natural things he doesn't want us to fear what's happening to the families he doesn't want us to fear the unknown or the future he just says trust me have confidence I've got this and that's what happened to me I went down to the river and I prayed and I said Lord what's happening and he said putting God first is the greatest progress and I was got so carnal and I sat on my bed one night because it did take a while for me to my thick-headed way to change and I still carried on for a bit and then I really my whole house got out of cater my children were going wild real wild and man Roman was having nightmares all the time and my house was out of cater and you know what I would lay on my bed one night and I was about to watch a cooking show because I was so desperately needing to learn all the stuff so that I could do cooking shows to make money and all these things while fearful oh God help us to not be like that help us to trust your lord and I I I I I laid on my bed and Bronwyn had been asleep for hours and she rolled over straight voice and said the Lord has been very gracious to you and then roll back over went back straight to sleep and I thought Whoa man well there goes my cooking show and then I felt like I should read the Bible and I felt like I was in a crossroad right there and if I took this if I took the Lord's way right now that it was going to be good for me and my family but if I didn't it was going to be a bad time for me and I was going to have to go through what Israel went through maybe or something like that where they just didn't go God's way and you know what I just opened my Bible and something said to me Psalm 39 and I read Psalm 39 and it was really really good but real bad for me it was telling me everything that I needed to do and what I was and where I was at you know the word can tell you all that's in your life the word if you really trust them and look up to his word not down on it not cross at it look up to it and faith and say Lord speak to me he will prophesy in your life and he will tell you where you've gone come from where you're at and where you're going and how to get there this is the word of God Saints children it'll work this has got a Bible in it the word of God Amen I need a paper Bible and anyway I read this thing and I said Lord I'm going to read it again and if it really means this I'm really done and I read it again and I was done I've done done done and I thought Lord I'm going to read it in the Greek now or the Hebrew and if it says this I'm really done I felt like Gideon with the fleeces and then I really read that and I was done I was out down and out the Lord was sitting on my bed the angel of his presence the angel of his favor came to my bedroom that night and he changed me from Darkness into light and the next day I confessed all my troubles to Bronwyn I was holding back I was as hot as all internalized don't internalize it trust your spouse trust your pastor trust your friends and if you don't that's fair and God's come tonight to take that fear out of your life so that you can be honest so that you can reveal the real you that you don't need to be ashamed of you don't be ashamed of yourself he takes all your shame away so that you can be your real self and God can help you that's who you really are just reveal who you are just be yourself be sincere and I really wasn't fair to my wife and you know what everything came back into alignment the Lord's the the angel of his presence came and he brought favor he took fear and since then it's been it's been a journey I tell you what it's never a dull moment but it's been a journey and he stabilized my family my children came back into alignment the nightmare ceased if you're finding yourself in turmoil your subconscious is twisted up and you're just fearful and the devil's attacking you the Lord can show you and take that out tonight amen we're gonna sing this song but I don't just want you to sing the words I want you to speak it because this is that you can speak it tonight
