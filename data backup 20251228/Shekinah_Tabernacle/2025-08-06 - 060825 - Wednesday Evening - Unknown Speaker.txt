Lord, we thank you that we've experienced that amazing love of God, Lord, when we've experienced that it's so rich, so pure. Lord, its motives are so pure. There's no no hidden agenda to do us harm Lord. But your love towards us, Lord, is only for our good, for our benefit, Lord, to to build us up, Lord, to to enrich our lives, Lord. And as we surrender to you more and more each day, we we Lord, we we experience more and more of your love towards us and your goodness, Lord. And we're confident no matter what situation we find ourselves in. We begin to be confident of your love towards us, Lord. Lord, although things might seem contrary in our minds when we look at things, we we know that Lord, everything you do, every step we take, Lord, is for our benefit, Lord, when you're with us, Lord Jesus. So, I just want to pray a blessing upon each one. Thank you for your grace to us, Lord. Thank you for calling each one here this evening, Lord, that none of us are here just as an accident or with no purpose, Lord, but we all have a purpose for being here this evening. We all have a purpose for being on this earth. And we just thank you Lord for touching each heart and soul. And we just pray you bless those that are streaming tonight also. We just commit the service into your hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you all. How you doing? You doing good? That's good. You can actually take your seats. My opening scripture isn't um for a little bit. Thanks musicians. So this is how the sermon came in into being tonight. Two weeks ago it was a Wednesday night and I actually on that particular Wednesday I couldn't make it along. I had to there was things I just had to um do unfortunately which I try not to do that but and um I was busy doing something at 7:30 when the 7:29 when the service here starts and my phone was a little bit from me and I noticed it rg and it was brother Ben ringing me at um 7:29. I'm thinking that's unusual. Why would I be getting a phone call at 7:29 from Brother Ben at church here? And and then at this this sort of very awful reality sunk down upon me and I thought, "Oh man, I've done messed up this time." So I I was up in Levvin and that phone call was brother Ben Ring me saying um you realize you're preaching tonight and are you on your way here? Oh man, there's no excuse for it. I said, man, are you I said, look, I I done messed up this time and then slot me put me straight back in the next one. I don't want to let the team down. Um you know, we can say we're busy and this and that, but now we just need a proper calendar and put it in. And anyway, so I thought about that. I, you know, I forgot. I I just I knew it was there, but it just I it was just it's never happened before, but I forgot, which was not good. &gt;&gt; Do you forgive me? So So, so that got me thinking about this thought. But I thought, you know, there's this concept that we forget and there's this concept that we remember. You know, as people, we we we remember some things. Sometimes we remember things we ought to forget and sometimes we forget things that we ought to remember. And there's a lot in the word of God about forgetting about and about remembering. &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to speak about. Um my thought tonight is remembering and forgetting. We just stand and I just want to read the first scripture. So, if we could turn to um um first Coronicles, I believe it is 16:12. We'll just read this one just as we stand this evening. And this verse says, "Remember his marvelous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth." May the Lord bless his word. You can be seated. There's a lot of things in the word of God about remembering and there's a lot of um exhortations or encouragements to us to remember. And this scripture here says remember the marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his of his mouth. And David would also say he said bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits. He's speaking to his soul. He's saying soul don't forget all that the Lord's done for you. reminding his soul, don't forget what the Lord's done. There's an exhortation to youth. It says when you're young, there's a lot of opportunity out there and things you can go and do and entertain your mind with. But the the scriptures encourage us to say, "Remember now thy creator." Don't let the memory of your creator slip from your mind and you go you start to go through life and through these exciting things without without remembering the God without remembering the great creator and just going your own way and forgetting that there's a God that he's watching that he's looking over all that you do. Remember now thy creator &gt;&gt; in the days of thy youth. There's another scripture that that we're taught that when we hear the word of God, we're taught to remember it. Don't just hear it and then it just means nothing to you and it just drifts away. James says, "But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass." If you ever tried this, you know it's true. You look in the mirror to see what you look like. You turn away. You can't remember what you look like. You forgot. He says, "For he beholdeth himself. He looks at himself. Then he goes his way and straightway forgets what manner of man he was." It's like he's saying, "Don't be like that with the word of God, where the word of God comes and then you straight away you just forget it." We're not supposed to do that with the word of God. We're supposed to remember it and do it. Don't forget it. He says, "But who so lookth into the perfect law of liberty and contin forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and God's got this awesome memory that God can remember things and he can forget things. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got a way of doing that. And God remembers the things he's supposed to remember. And he forgets the things he's supposed to forget. And there's no blurring the lines between the two. &gt;&gt; And he he says of us, he says, "This is the covenant that I'll make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. I'll put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." &gt;&gt; Amen. you and me when we when we repent, when we commit our lives to the Lord, when we receive the Holy Ghost, he says, "I'll write my law in your hearts. I'll cause you to remember it and all of your sins, all your iniquities, I'll forget them all." &gt;&gt; We serve a God that forgets it all. We We confess our sins to the Lord and he forgets every single one of them. &gt;&gt; He doesn't remember it. He can't recall what it was. He forgets it all. &gt;&gt; He doesn't just It doesn't suddenly creep back into his memory. It's gone forever. He forgets it. Your sins, your iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't forget his promises to us too. One day he was there and he went down and and the children of Israel were in bondage for 400 years and they were they were afflicted. They were crying out to God. And one day God visited Moses and he said, "I've heard the groanings of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I'll remember my covenant." &gt;&gt; He didn't just drift away and forget that I had made a covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, with Jacob. He remembered his covenant with them. you can be sure he was going to live be true to the covenant that he made with them because he wasn't going to forget it. Sometimes we think, "Oh, is that person going to remember that I'm here waiting for them?" You know, are they are they going to meet me here? Do they remember? God never forgets. If he's supposed to meet you somewhere or meet his word, if he's at meet you at a place where his word is, he'll be there. He never forgets. And yet, yet we in our minds, we can sometimes uh remember things that we ought to forget. The children of Israel left Egypt. They should have just left Egypt. They should have left all the things that were there and they should have moved on to the promised land and just forgotten all those things that were in the past and move forward to the promises of God to the new the new land that he had. But the but the word of God says that there was a mixed multitude of different ones that some were trying to forget, others were trying hard to remember what was back there. So they were mixing together. And it says and then they it says they fell a lusting or they started thinking about this and desiring it. And it says and then the children of Israel wept because they were starting to get hungry. They were starting to get sick of the manner all the time. And they said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" &gt;&gt; And then they said, "For we remember, &gt;&gt; we remember the fish that we used to eat." I can still taste it in my mouth. The fish back in Egypt. We remember the cucumbers. Who craves after cucumbers? And the melons. Melons. I can understand. The leaks, the onions, the garlic. They remembered all these things. cuz they remembered well it was that was quite good. They were starting to relive all these memories and it displeased God cuz they should have been not even thinking about that just looking forward to his promises. &gt;&gt; And then they said there was nothing at all besides this manner which was angel's food. &gt;&gt; They despised that and they started casting their mind back and remembering things that they ought to forget. And other times when God had wrought a mighty deliverance in their land, he he had raised up a man called Gideon and he he had worked powerfully through Gideon and he had defeated all of their enemies and he he gave them peace in the land. I think it was for about 70 years or 80 years they had peace and God blessed them once Gideon came through and defeated all their enemies. But then as time went on and they began to they forgot what God had done for them. It just become common that they were blessed in the land and that it was it became common that they were blessed in the land and and that things were just going their way. And it says, "And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side." They they began to forget that the great thing that God had done. They just began to forget it and they that they let it fade from their memory when they ought to have remembered it. &gt;&gt; They they were busy remembering the leaks, remembering the cucumbers and busy forgetting the powerful works of God. They they deemed a cucumber more important than the mighty deliverance of God. &gt;&gt; God when people become like that, he he speaks in Psalm 50 about those that follow the Lord. And he talks about the wicked that forgot God and how they would just cast God from their their thinking and they just do all sort all the things that they want to do. And God says he he he doesn't have a lot of time for that sort of behavior because he says now consider this ye that forgot God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver. He's not interested in people that ought to be remembering him that just start to forget him and walk another way. He doesn't like that approach &gt;&gt; to himself. He wants us to remember. And there are many men in the Bible and women in the Bible that went through very hard times. Yet, they still remembered God. They still they still cried out to God. They didn't just forget. One of them was Job. And in all of Job's trials, he still remembered God. He didn't just forget God like his wife said, "Oh, just curse God and die. Forget about God and move on." But Job would cry to God. He said, "Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the grave. That thou wouldest keep me a secret, keep me secret until thy wrath be passed. hide me away somewhere. He said, "But at an appointed time, remember me." &gt;&gt; At an appointed time, come and find me again. Don't just leave me there, but remember me. &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible called Hannah. And Hannah had always wanted a child, but she was barren. She can never have a child. And one day, she she came to the was in the temple and she was crying out to God. And I believe it was Eli, the priest in the temple. They thought she was drunk because she was so desperately crying out to God. And she was saying, "Oh God, hear me, Lord." She She was saying, "Lord, look on the affliction of thy handmade and remember me. Forget not thine handmade. Lord, don't forget me." If we cry out to God and say, "God, don't forget me." He won't forget us. Lord, remember me. &gt;&gt; And he thought she was drunk, but she was just in desperation crying out to God. Lord, remember me. Give me a child, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you do, Lord, I'll commit him over to you. Two things. She made a promise to God. And God knew that she would remember her promise. Yeah, &gt;&gt; she wouldn't. She said, "Lord, remember me and I'll remember my promise that I make to you." &gt;&gt; The Bible says that she went home and she they she knew she she knew her husband. They did that. And it says and then it says, "And the Lord remembered her &gt;&gt; when that happened. The Lord remembered her. Remembered that she'd cried out and and we know the story that she had a had a child. There was another man which was the thief on the cross when he was there and he was he was on his last breath and he'd seen the whole situation unfold and he'd seen this innocent man being put to death and there was something in him that that he knew that this person was more than just a mere mortal man that this man was the son of God. That's why he said Lord remember me when you go into paradise remember me. The Lord said this day you should be in paradise with me. Samson was the same when Samson would looked like he lived a failure of a life. The Lord had blessed him in time past, but over as the years went on, he forgot God. And he began to go after other things, and he ended up grinding in the middle with his eyes plucked out. And it seemed like there was no hope for him. And he was like all his hopes were gone. And his life was going to amount to nothing. And he was just going to become a a a skeleton, a few a bag of bones in some grinding mill, and amount to nothing. But he said, "Lord, once more, just remember me. Lord, remember me." But the promise to him that God had made was that he'll be a Nazarite from the day of his birth till the day of his death. That means he was a son of God. He had the power of God upon him from when he was born to when he died. Didn't matter how bleak his life looked. That's why he could cry out, "Lord, remember me." And and right in the last moments of his life, the Lord remembered him. &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord has this way. He the Lord has knows how we think and that we forget things easily. So the Lord actually puts things in place and wants us to do things out of repetition to make us remember before he delivered the children of Israel when he was going to when he was going to slay all the firstborn in Egypt. He he said they had to get some hissop and they had to get some blood. They had to paint it around the door. Then they had to kill a a lamb and eat it with bitter herbs. But he said you're not just going to do it tonight. I want you to do this every year. We're going to call this month the first of the month for you. And every single year you are going to do this year after year after year purely for the fact that so you remember what I've done. &gt;&gt; So this doesn't just this massive event doesn't just happen then it just drifts off into the past and there's no memory of it. But I want you to every year in this same day make a feast eat and remember what I've done and then down the line it says down the way you way way way down it could be a generation could be 10 generations it could be now children ask why are we doing this feast? Why are we eating this? And the what's this for? And he says, well, this is so we remember that way back then, God delivered us from the from bondage. &gt;&gt; And you know how you know it's true. Do you know that? Do you do you want to know how that that happened to the Egyptians that the Lord sail the firstborn? &gt;&gt; Because they still remember it now. &gt;&gt; This originated from a certain point which was the night that it happened. &gt;&gt; It didn't get made up later on. And it happened. That's why 2,000 3,000 years later, the Passover feast still happens in this world. People still remember it &gt;&gt; because it happened. &gt;&gt; And and children still ask, "Why do we do this?" And they still say, "Because we remember." God and and the Lord when he was here before the day the night before he was going to be crucified it said he took he took the wine and he took some bread and he broke it and he said I want you to do this always in remembrance of me &gt;&gt; this do in remembrance of me remember don't just forget that I've paid for your sins but he he he often does something to trigger our memory that's why he says take it take some unleaven bread take some wine and when you look at it it will trigger your mind to remember I I'm not eating this bread because it's something special in the bread, but I'm eating this because I remember that the Lord's body was broken like I'm going to break this bread. We He He said, "Do this so you remember." Every time you drink the wine, you're not drinking the blood of the Lord. But you're remembering this wine looks like blood. There was some blood that was shed for me. Now, when I drink it, I remember that there was blood shed for me. I remember that I'm paid with a that I've been bought with a price. I remember this wasn't cheap. I remember someone had to make an effort for me. &gt;&gt; I remember a body had to be broken for me. We remember Peter says a lot of times after he's after he finished talking about the stature of a perfect man, Peter was was so intent on making sure we remember. &gt;&gt; He said it four times. I want to make sure you remember that that that this is that that as a Christian, you're supposed to be being built up in the faith and you're supposed to be enriched every day and you should be adding to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge to knowledge, temperance to temperance, patience to patience, godliness, to godliness, brotherly kindness. You should always be doing that. I want you to remember, don't just forget that and focus on something else. You should always be being built up in your spiritual self to the stature of a perfect man. He said, "Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them and be established in the present truth." And he said again, "Yay, I think it meat or I think it's a good thing as long as I'm in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in my remembrance." &gt;&gt; Always reminding you, reminding you, are you building up the into the stature of a perfect man or a perfect woman? Are you making effort into that or are you just letting it drift aside? Are you remembering it all the time? Lord, build me up to the stature of a perfect man. I don't want to forget that, Lord. I want to make that my focus. And he said again, knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle. In other words, I'm going to die. I'm not going to exist anymore. Even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me, then he says, "Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance, even after I've gone. Don't forget this stuff. Read it. Tell your children. Tell the fellowship. Tell everyone about it. Build yourself up into the statue of a perfect man." We had a very drastic one of probably the most traumatic events that happened to this country was was World War I where it wasn't here, but a lot of our young men, the the you'd say the best and the the brightest, the fittest young men went overseas to fight in in in a in a in these wars that are a complete waste of time just because a couple of people can't sort of resolve their differences. millions of young men and women now have to go and die for some pathetic squabble that a few people have. There's nothing good about a war. People that glamorize them. There's nothing good about wars whatsoever. We know that in this world where there's hatred, there's going to be wars. But we I don't I I personally think you you imagine this like like you've got a you've got a some a family's raised up a a couple of boys and they spent their them think of all the effort that the mother and father have put into these boys from a baby to raise them up and to to instill values into them to teach them about to teach them skills. all these things in years, years, 15, 20 years and then these boys get taken off to some foreign shore and then some bullet that another person just kills that person that doesn't even know who they are or why they're there or nothing. They just shoot them and that's that that whole life gone. It's such a futile, silly waste of time. But this war here in New Zealand, there was one there was a about a million people in New Zealand at the time of 1.1 million and about 120,000 went off to war. So that's that's one in every 10 people went to off to this war. That's a massive part of the population. That's that's huge. And two out of every 100 people in this country died from that war. You might not think that's very many, but you know 100 people easily in your circles. You easily know 50 people. That would be you. That would be two people that you know dying. &gt;&gt; And some people know more than 100 people. That would be two people. And you imagine everybody that you knew in the whole country knew someone that died. Whether it be close to you or a friend or someone, you all knew someone that died. So the whole country, it was like this time of mourning. This whole the the whole country had had suffered mourning because two two out of 100 people had suddenly died. &gt;&gt; You can imagine it was such a traumatic time for this country. That's why you go around there's so many memorials all throughout. You go to some rural little town in the middle of nowhere, there's a memorial, there's a there's a hall and there's a memorial because from that little community, someone died. It was such a traumatic thing. And these these the people didn't want to forget. &gt;&gt; They that the whole saying is less we forget. Less we forget that this is what happened to us. We these boys went off and they half of them didn't come back. Less we forget. There's a and they that's why Anzac Day they read this this little poem. It says they shall not grow old as we that are left grow old. Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them. We won't just forget that that this massive portion of our population just went and died on foreign soil. But we will remember them. But not so for the righteous. The of the righteous it says he shall never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever. &gt;&gt; That's the part I want to get into here. That the righteous will be remembered forever. But not the wicked. The wicked are going to be forgotten. And every man and every woman that thinks that they can they can go on with their life without making Jesus the king of their life, eventually they're going to be forgotten. They're not going to be remembered forever. There'll be a there'll be a time where every even the memory of them is forgotten. They don't exist anymore. They're forgotten. The wicked will be forgotten. There's a scripture in Psalm and it says, "Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise thee? Shall thy love and kindness be declared in the grave? All thy faithfulness and destruction? Shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?" There's a land of forgetfulness where it's just forgotten. &gt;&gt; There's a land of forgetfulness where everyone that turns up there is forgotten. It's the land of forgetfulness and all and that the wicked go to the land of forgetfulness. We we call it hell. We call it whatever. But it has an end because it all gets forgotten. &gt;&gt; It's the land of forgetfulness. There is the there's no righteous man that's going to have a memory in the land of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; And that's why even all of our sins that's that's why they all originate when your sins are forgiven. and they go on to the one and dragged down to the land of forgetfulness and gone forever. And that's where the Lord, when you get forgiven of your sins, it goes back to whoever originated it because it was caused, you were caused to sin by somebody, somebody tempted you to sin. You realize that? &gt;&gt; And when the Lord, the Lord cast it in the sea of his forgetfulness, he casts it back here. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a and it goes back to the land of forgetfulness and it's going to be gone, punished, and gone forever one day. But there is a land of and forgetfulness. You've all seen these pictures of old cities where these were once glorious cities that that now they they dig a bit under the ground. They say, "Well, there was a city here at one point. The city was forgotten. &gt;&gt; It was no more. This the city at one point was maybe a glorious city with commerce bustling, people coming and going, festivals in it, all sorts of things. But at some point something happened and the city began to decay and fall and another country, another kingdom took it over and the city becomes forgotten and they they find ruins of an old city that's been forgotten. And all of these cities in the world, we think of these great cities in the world. If these cities don't surrender to the name of the Lord Jesus, which they haven't, these cities one day are all going to be forgotten. &gt;&gt; You might go there now and think, well, this is such a glorious city. They're all going to be forgotten. &gt;&gt; They're all going to be forgotten. Every single one of them are going to be forgotten. &gt;&gt; They're going to be worse than this one. &gt;&gt; No matter how glamorous they look, how how great they are, how big they how big they build the buildings, nice glass faces and all that. They're all going to be forgotten. Every city in the world is going to be forgotten. But there's one city that's never going to be forgotten. That's the new Jerusalem. That city's never going to be forgotten. It's never going to be never going to be under ashes anywhere. And John said wrote about it. He said, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride for her husband, the new Jerusalem. This city is a city we're after. It's a city that's never going to be forgotten. These are the cities. I don't care too much for these, but I'm into this. New Jerusalem, the city that's never going to be forgotten." And and as a type in the natural, that's our spiritual Jerusalem. But there is a natural Jerusalem. And and the the what what that is to the believer is what Jerusalem is to the Jews. And that's why David said, "Oh, if I forget Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning." Think of how good David was with his right hand, too, with a sling and with a spear. Think of how good. And he said, "Lord, if I forget Jerusalem, if I forget that holy city, let my right hand forget how to throw a stone, how to sling a sling. Let my right hand forget her cunning." He's saying, "Let everything else, oh, let me forget everything else. Don't let me forget Jerusalem." And that should be like with a believer. Lord, I don't mind forgetting everything else, but don't let me forget you. Don't let me forget your kingdom. Don't let me forget your love and kindness. Lord, don't let me forget your goodness. I don't mind all this other stuff, but don't let me forget that. Just like David said, Lord, don't let me forget Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; That's why when that when the children of Israel ended up when when they sinned and they forgot about God and they were dragged over to to Babylon, they sat there and they said and and and David describes it. He says, "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and there we wept. When we remembered Zion, &gt;&gt; when we remembered that city, we'd forgotten about the city. We remembered it again. There many times the backslider. They get to this place. They're they're in the good things of God. They're serving God, but they forget God and they go away. And when it all comes crashing down, they end up in Babylon by some foreign river somewhere that means nothing to them. And they think about the good things of God. And they weep when they remember Zion. when they remembered, I I I just want to be back there like the prodigal son when he was in a pig when he remembered far better back in my father's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, all their captives said, "Oh, sing us some of those happy songs of Zion. Pick you up your guitar and give me a nice old strum and sing some of those happy songs of Zion." They said, "How can we sing these songs in a strange land?" And then David goes on to say, "If I forget thee, oh Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. If I do not remember, prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy. And that's why I say, Lord, let me forget everything. Whatever there is here to forget, let me forget, Lord, but don't let me forget you. In my in my time here in my mind, Lord, I don't mind if I I learn a math equation, I forget the answer. Who cares? &gt;&gt; But I don't want to forget you, Lord. I don't want to forget your word. If I I learn a bit about the sound and I forget it, who cares? I'll relearn it. I learn a recipe, I forget it. Who cares, Lord? But don't let me forget you, &gt;&gt; Lord. And that's what Paul says. Yay. Doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. Lord, I'll forget everything, but don't let me forget you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For whom I've suffered the loss of all things, and do count them, but dung that I may win Christ. &gt;&gt; Paul was prepared to forget everything he ever knew, just so he could remember Christ, remember his word. That's why he ended up in a prison. But he said, "Doesn't matter everything else I can forget. Forget my old life. Forget everything, Lord. But don't let me forget you." And sure as anything, that's the one thing we need to remember. Don't matter about anything else really. When you boil it all down, you can forget forget everything else. Don't forget the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people forget the Lord and they walk off certain ways and it doesn't do them any good. And that we can get like that in our own life. We can sometimes let our carnal nature take over and start to plant in us an evil heart of unbelief. We we we we even serving the Lord, we begin to forget him. We begin to forget his goodness. We begin to forget his ways and we can actually be dragged away from our from really having the Lord in full remembrance in our mind. It can drag us away and we start to just push it aside. But we can let that carnal nature come in and and take us aside this way or take us that way. We all know that we've been there. That's why Paul says, "But I keep my body and bring it into subjection less that by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast away." And once more he says, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief." When you start to forget about the things of God and then unbelief just starts to settle in a bit and he calls it an evil heart of unbelief because it starts to just cloud over your mind and we start to forget God and other things become more important than than the word of God than the things of God. The things of God no longer satisfy us anymore. They no longer give us joy anymore. they no longer that that little bit of that little bit of warmth in your heart that used to give it doesn't give it anymore because we've let this evil heart of unbelief unbelief come in and this type kind of works and I just want to go through it a bit but you can look at Egypt you know as long as Egypt had Joseph there they were blessed &gt;&gt; even though they were an evil nation as long as they had Joseph there they were blessed and and they were going along and and and life was going well for them because he because They they had Joseph there and they let the children of Israel dwell with them and and you could say that was like the spirit of God was dwelling with them and that and and as long as they were dwelling there with the children of with Joseph, they were right. But the Bible says that later on uh the the Egypt's carnal nature rose up because there arose a pharaoh. There arose a king that knew not Joseph. Stopped caring about Joseph. didn't care that ah that the reason why we're prospering. The reason why we're one of the greatest nations in the world is because we've got Joseph with us. But they begin to not care. And it's the same with a with a man or a woman or it's the same with a even a denomination. They could the law can move and they start to think, "Oh, we don't really need the Lord the spirit of God as much anymore. We can carry on our own way. We've got this now. We got a bigger church. We got everything sorted. We don't really need the spirit of God as much anymore. We can go our own way. We we can sort of forget about the how we used to be all in revival. We don't really need that anymore." Even countries, you know, they start off in a revival, but then they drift away. We think we don't really need God anymore, but they always need God. And God God is he he was diligent to point out to us. He told of the children of Israel, he said, "Watch out for that mindset coming in you." He said, he said, "When you get into the land," he says, "If you start to say in your heart, my power and the might of mine hand have gotten me this wealth." If you start to think that, forget that it's the Lord. He said, "But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant, which he swear unto thy fathers, as it is this day." But over time, Egypt began to despise Joseph. They began to forget what he the Lord had done. They begin to not care, and they just they despised Joseph so much that that one day Joseph departed from them. &gt;&gt; Now, they were thinking, "This is the greatest thing out. Joseph departed." But it was the worst thing that ever could have happened to them was Joseph departing. And the Lord says, "My spirit will not always strive with man and that he is flesh." You know, and we don't want to strive with the spirit of God so much that one day it just decides to depart from us because the minute it does, we're in trouble. We our life can be going a certain way, but you you'll you'll know for sure when the spirit of God begins to depart from you because things aren't as good as what they used to be. Life is not as fresh as what it used to be. It goes a certain way. And that's just what happened to the to Egypt when Israel departed. But they thought they could just go on without the spirit of God. Forget about it. Forget Joseph, but where's I haven't got a picture, but but Egypt only prospered for a short short season &gt;&gt; and the whole of the Egyptian army was brought down in a single day. the whole might, the whole everything that Egypt was was brought down in a single day. And it was the same with Noah. They forgot God. They didn't want to retain God in their thinking. &gt;&gt; And what happened in a and within two months from a certain point, the civilization was finished. &gt;&gt; But not so for the righteous. In the book of Isaiah, it says that we might become at a time where we we we can get a bit despondent with life, you know, because things can sometimes get a bit hard. It says, "But Zion and and the Lord can I think he understands how we get in our minds sometimes." And it says, "But Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me." You ever get that situation? You think, "Oh, maybe the Lord's forgotten me." Maybe he's forsaken me. You know, we know he hasn't because he says he'll never leave us or forsake us. But we can sort of we don't watch it. We can let this sort of thing come upon us. But the Lord's reply to that to you to you to his children is always the same. Can a woman forget her her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? And he says, "Yay, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget thee." &gt;&gt; You might think the Lord's forgotten me. And the Lord's reply back is, "No, no, you're my child. I'll never forget you. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you. He goes one step further. He says, "Behold, I have engraved you, engraven you on the palms of my hand." &gt;&gt; That's how much I'm not going to forget you. Your your your name is engraved on the palm of my hand. I'm not going to forget you. And he even says, "I've written a book before me about you." And he said, "It's called the book of remembrance. And all the thoughts and all your deeds, everything you've thought and everything you've done, I've written in a book before me. It's called the book of remembrance. Malachi spokes about it. He says, "And they that feared the Lord spake one to another. And the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and their thought upon his name." And we're not talking about the book of life. We're talking about the book of remembrance. The Lord loves it so much when he hears you talking about him and when he sees the things you do, when he sees it not going well, but you still praise the Lord anyway, that he wanted to write a book of remembrance and keep it before him to write all of your deeds in in that book of remembrance. And the thing about it is everyone that's written about in that book, God's going to take with him. &gt;&gt; He says, "And they shall be mine, sayith the Lord of host, in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth me." He's talking about the people that are written in that book in that book of remembrance. And why is that? It's because you and I remember. We don't forget. &gt;&gt; If we're on a mountain, we remember &gt;&gt; that he's a good God. &gt;&gt; That's easy. &gt;&gt; But if we're in the valley, what do we do? We remember. &gt;&gt; He's a good God. &gt;&gt; We don't suddenly forget when we're in the valley. We remember. &gt;&gt; Lord, if I'm on the mountain, I remember you're a good God. If I'm down in the valley, I remember you're a good God. &gt;&gt; I remember. Remember, if we're well, we're in good health. We remember God's a healer. Praise God. He's a healer. I'm in good health. He's a healer. I remember God's a healer. &gt;&gt; If we're sick, who is he? &gt;&gt; Not a healer anymore. No, he's a healer. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's a healer. If I'm sick, he's a healer. I remember he's a healer. I don't let Satan come into my mind and say, "Ah, maybe he's not. Maybe he's just left you." No, he hasn't left me. He's a healer. &gt;&gt; I don't care what my body looks like, what it's telling me. He's a healer. If we have abundance, we have a lot. What do we say is he's our provider. Well, you're just saying that cuz you got everything. That's what Satan said about Job. Oh, he's just happy cuz you're blessing him. Take away all his stuff and he won't be happy anymore. So God said, you watch this. So he took away all his stuff and he was still happy. He said, "Though God slay me, yet will I trust him. The Lord gives, the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." He remembered he's a good God. &gt;&gt; He didn't just He didn't suddenly forget when times got tough. He didn't suddenly forget. And you and I, I said, we don't just forget when times get tough that he's a good God. We remember he's a good God. No matter how much the devil tries to tell us otherwise, we remember he's a good God. That's why when we have nothing, we still remember he's a provider, but you got nothing. Don't care. He's a provider. &gt;&gt; He provides all my needs. When we're surrounded by those that love us, we got a got a good group of friends and family. It's like we're we got all that we could need. We remember he's our comfort. Well, you don't really need him cuz you got good family, you got a fellowship, you got all this. There might be other times where we end up all alone. We still remember he's my comfort. Even in that's what he's my comfort. Whether I've got plenty, whether I've got nothing, he's he's still my comfort. Whether I've got friends around me, whether I don't, he's my comfort. &gt;&gt; We know we're in if we're in a storm, we don't just forget, well, he's left me. We remember he's the master of the storm. &gt;&gt; The disciples got in a storm and they got all flustered. They forgot who he was. &gt;&gt; He said, "How long must I suffer little faith?" He spoke to the wind, "Peace be still." When you're going through something, don't forget that God's your deliverer. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan come in and try and move your mind away so that you forget. Don't just remember. It's real simple. Just we just remember God's my deliverer. &gt;&gt; The next day when you're still not delivered, he's my deliverer. Every single day when you wake up, he's my deliverer. Doesn't matter what it looks like. And a time of peace. I remember he's the he's the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; But then in a time of war, he's the prince of peace. If there's war in my house, after there's all these things going on and it seems hard, he's the prince of peace. He's going to come in and bring peace. &gt;&gt; Doesn't look like it. It doesn't matter. He's the prince of peace. I remember. That's what he said. I'm not going to forget it. In a time of war, I'm going to forget. I'm going to remember that he's the prince of peace. The Lord said when times get hard, he's he's already said in this, we remember. Oh, that's right. The Lord said in this world, I'll have tribulation, but don't worry. I've overcome the world. Just remember that. Don't suddenly forget that when it gets hard. Just remember, we remember that that if God's word says it, we believe it. That settles it. &gt;&gt; We remember that. That's right. I remember the word of God says it. What do I do then? I believe it. What happens then? That settles it. I remember. Easy. &gt;&gt; Easy equation. Satan tries to reason something out with you. You say, "No, hang on. The word of God says this. I believe it. That settles it." The Bible says, "Resist the devil. He will flee from you. The best thing to do is remember the word of God. Apply it. The devil just has got nowhere to stand because he cuz he he can only he can only come and stand and and and get you if you say the word of God says it, but I'm not sure if I believe it. Then he can come in and have a go at you there. But if you say the word of God says it, I believe it. That settles it. He has to flee. Where can he go? What can he do? We remember that we should hide his word in our heart and meditate upon it day and night. We remember that. we remember. Well, if I want to like David, Lord, I want to I I I I love you so much. I want you to read your word and remember it so I know what it is. So then so that when things come up, I can apply your word. I people make so much effort to get a PhD in a certain thing and they learn all the equations, everything there is to do with that certain thing. We want a PhD in the word of God where we study the word of God so when we end up in situations we know which part of the word of God to apply. We don't want to end up there and not know what to do. We want to study the word of God. As David said, Lord, thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against you that I can remember it. When a situation comes, I remember what your word says. And we remember that. He says, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; We remember that. We don't just forget that. We say, "Lord, I remember you said to keep my commandments." We remember that every situation we got to act like a son or daughter of God. We reme we don't just forget one day that we're a that we're a son or daughter of God and just act in your old certain way. No, we remember when we wake up in the morning, I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I remember. I'm not just going to forget like that slave that was ended up in America. Even though he was far from home, he remembered he was a son of a king. I remember I'm a son of a king. &gt;&gt; I didn't one day, He didn't one day wake up and forget. He remembered every single day. And that's what we want to do. Remember every single day that we're sons of the king. We remember that he watches us. We don't just go and oh well, no one will see this. We remember God sees us. &gt;&gt; We remember that he that he sees all that we do. So we want to be live right before him because we remember. We remember that he hears all that we think. So we want to keep our thoughts pure. We can't just think things and God doesn't hear it. He hears it. Brother Brham said his thoughts speak louder in heaven than do our words. So we remember that. So when our mind starts to think something it shouldn't, we remember. Hang on. God hears this. &gt;&gt; God hears this. &gt;&gt; Lord, you hear this. There's no point hiding anymore because I remember you hear this. &gt;&gt; Cleanse me, oh God, from my secret faults. Lord, help me to think the right thought then, Lord. when there's no one else around, when it's just you and me. That's the hallmarks of a Christian man. It's just you and the Lord. No one else knows. That really is your Christian walk. It's not what everyone else sees. It's between It's what you and what you and God know together. That's really your Christian Christian walk. But we also remember that if we do wrong, we remember that we can ask him to forgive us our sins. And we remember that he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins. We remember that. We don't let the devil come and say, "No, he doesn't actually forgive you." Oh, no. I remember that he does. I remember that if I ask for forgiveness, he and I confess it, he'll forgive me. &gt;&gt; And I remember that not only that, he casts our sin into the sea of forgetfulness. I remember that. I don't forget that. I remember. And then then if we remember that, then we can move on and say, "I never even did in the first place." Satan tries to come at you with these past sins you've done. If they're under the blood, you say, "I can't remember a thing. I forget that." Because God said, "You can just move on from it. Just forget it. I've forgotten. You forget. Just move on. And we also remember that he told us to forgive others &gt;&gt; and apply the same tactic to other people. Don't remember stuff that they did and bring it up and that. Forget it. Apply the same thing to others. If if you just forgive, forget, move on. Don't don't harbor things. I remember that they did that. Don't remember just remember good things. &gt;&gt; Just remember good things. Don't remember any evil stuff. Just forget it. &gt;&gt; Satan's the one that always wants you to remember bad things. He's always bringing it up, wanting you to remember. I remember what they did to you. Remember what they said to you? Remember what that person said? Forget it all. We're called to forget those sort of things. Don't remember them. Just forget them. &gt;&gt; You can be sure of anything that if we confess our sins to the Lord, we want him to forget it. &gt;&gt; And then we want to hold on to this other remembrance that someone else did something someone else did to us. Just forget it. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Don't remember any evil stuff. Just forget it all. That's I found that to be the best technique in my life is I just forget any evil. I just remember the good. Gets me in trouble sometime. Some sometimes cuz I remember, man, that was a good time, wasn't it? And I shouldn't say this, but Shannon will say, "That time, don't you remember this and that and that?" I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot all the bad stuff. You just remember the good stuff." Because we remember that that the Lord gave us an example. He said when you come to the altar, he said if you remember, he didn't say if you remember what someone else did to you &gt;&gt; cuz you're supposed to forget that. He said if you remember that you've done something to someone else, &gt;&gt; go and make it right. &gt;&gt; Not not ah I remember he did that. We don't remember that stuff. We forget it. That's why and Paul says, "Brethren, I count not myself to a reprehender, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press forward for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." We want to forget. The devil always wants us to remember stuff from our past and and bring these things up. Just forget it. And we just want to Lord, we want to remember you. We'll remember your promises. You want to move forward into into the the the promises of the word of God. Move forward into all the things that he has. And and and if you've put everything under the mud, just forget it. Move on. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. I want to share one more. That was that was my thought I had um about remembering and forging. Can I share one little testimony with you? Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Shannon's looking at me. Okay, I want to I I was I I want to share this at the end because um I want to share this because um I spoke about this I think maybe three Wednesdays ago or four. I think it was a maybe it was a morning. You remember me talking about the &gt;&gt; So you all know but you know this I've been on that this um mission to make this film for about 12 years. And just to recap this one here and when I was at the dump you know this can was there and was going to boot it in. The Lord said pick up the can and um you know keep it never get rid of it. And I didn't know what it was but it looked and it was the you know the the same the the inside the can not in this one but it was a mint cake that Edmond Hillary ate on the top of Mount Everest. So and that was significant was the Lord had always said you know the this is the mountain you got to climb and you'll get to the top and those sorts of things. So, um, uh, and the date, I actually didn't get it, but I wrote the date 14th of the 7th on the inside of the can, which was when the Lord said, "Now start climbing to the summit." Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Um, and there So, the other Call me crazy, but I kind of am, but I think when the Lord does things, you can always there's they're always strange. like when the Lord not strange but but the they go outside the realms of probability a lot of the time they're not just a normal occurrence when the Lord's hand is on something you can see wow that looks like the hand of the Lord you know there's something bigger on it you know it's like if you feel like I should move to this place but you're not sure if the Lord wants you to go he will do all sorts of things to make it known that no this is my hand you can you can go and so um the date on that was 14th of the 7th And um I didn't time it this way, but from when I got up and spoke and then went down, it was 14 minutes and 7 seconds when I shared that, which I the Lord always does things in twos, you know. So, but but now I've got to say this the right way and I think I will. this and in and with Shannon I it's always sort of been I've had this you know this idea to build to do this film and do that and Shannon's been very supportive all the time you know of me and everything I do so so if I'm going to do something she's going to support she supports me with a ro that way or that way so if I go and do that she'll support me in that not but the difference is she's not so much doing that she's doing this and I go and do that you know like okay we'll go and do that but it's not like I'm going to do that I'm going support you if you do that then we do that. If you do that we do that. But I it was always interesting to me because I thought you know the the and because I'd shared this the the Lord there's this idea that when the Lord calls someone he calls his wife brother Ramstead you know that you get sort of called together in a certain thing and and I thought it's kind of I haven't really had that like that with this film you know it's been Shannon's been very supportive don't get me wrong it's always been but just not that not not a little moment to go oh actually I want to do that as well sort of is that I got to tread carefully, man. I got to live with her. I got to go home tonight. But I want to explain it in the right way. So So it's understood, right? Okay. So we we haven't been away for a long time, so I wanted to go take her away. So we went to um Toppo um on the weekend. Just went for a couple of days that we could have off. And um we do a bit of running here and there just for a bit of fun. And um we were Shannon was driving cuz I still had to do a little bit of stuff on the way. But we got to this place is on the um at the start of Lake Topold near um Tudangi. And when we're about 5 minutes from this place, I said, "Oh, Shannon, there's a place up ahead of me that I would I actually want to stop at because I've always had this idea that there's a I've looked at it on the map, Google Maps, and I figured that if we park in this certain parking spot here, which I don't know if it's there, but it looks like it is on the map where the red starts by the road. If we park there, I figure we can run down this track there. We can run along the be uh like the the lake front there. We can cross over the eststerie there like through through where the lagoon is and then I think that's a there's a mount there like a big hill little mountain. I want to basically I'm telling her I want to go to the summit of that mountain real quick like it's about a 12 13k round trip or something like that but can we just pull over here real quick? I just want to let's do a quick run up to the top of this mountain and back. Right. So, she was not happy at me, but I kind of figured once we get to the other side there, there's a little township over there. There probably is a track that goes and up to the top of this mountain. So, we can go across and intercept the track and then go up the nice track. Man, was I wrong. So, that's the that's that's where I wanted to go up to the top of that. This is actually on the other side, but we were starting off on the other side there. This is the next day. So, I want to get to the top of that mountain because I like mountains. cuz I like to climb to the top of them. Now, if you're new in New Zealand, we have a thing called a trig, which is this thing here, which marks the highest point at any given piece of land. If you have a station or land, you'll have a trig. And um so we start the first bit is nice. We run along the the the down this nice open track and then we run along the the the waterfront. That's beautiful day. Everything's things are going well. Then we hit the bush and man, this is thick bush. I don't mind it because I'm a bit of a bush man from way back, but this is thick bush man. And I notice Shannon's getting quieter and quieter as we're running through this dense bush and I'm pulling branches out the way and stuff. Muddy would have loved it. But um yeah, we're going through and and I'm thinking to myself, man, she does not want to be here. And she's got these running like she's got her skirt then these running tights and they're being ripped by all the gor and the the um the supple jack and all sorts of stuff that's in there. and um and her brand new shoes, these white ones, they're full of they're covered in mud. She's like, "If I knew we were coming here, I would have bought my hiking shoes." So, and and we get over to the point on the where I think the track should be. I think I say the track's coming up here soon. All this hardness is going to be over and we're going to be able to go up to the summit in a nice track. So, we get to the end there and there is no track in sight. I'm like, man, it looks like we're the only ones ever in civilization to ever set foot in this place. Nobody's here. So there's no track. There's no nothing. So we say I say I say, "Look, what do you want to do? Do you want to do you want to head up to the summit or do we turn back and we could go back to the town and then run back down the road?" In my heart, I hope she'd say, "Go to the summit." Cuz I'm like, "Man, I've come this far. I don't want to not make it to the summit." and she she very enthusiastically said, "Yes, I'd love to run up to the summit. Lead me on." Okay. I wasn't that enthusiastic, but she managed to get a well. Okay. Like, we've been going for maybe 45 minutes by this time and through all this bush and that and then the the um so we were sort of down by where my head is behind there. where to go up to the from that point all the way up to the top. It was a bit of a hike through all this bush. There was no track and I've kind of got my I didn't come prepared. I had my phone with a Google map and it sort of could tell you which way to go. But I kind of being a bushman, I know my way around the bush. I figure we just go we'll go flat and then when we start going in that direction, we'll be going up a hill and we'll just keep going up a hill till we get to the top of the hill. That sort of made sense to me. So, so we go up there and then and then which I hope this will be there. We get right to the top of this thing and there's a trigger at the top which is kind of neat. You know, there's something there to mark. Okay, this is the top and that's actually the that little marker on the ground is the summit. So, they put that in then they build a trigger around this little marker. So, so, so we're at the summit and then people being people, they love to graffiti and I thought, oh, people have probably graffitied and scratched names all through the underneath. So, I get underneath the the trig there and look around. And then I pointed out to Shannon, I said, "Oh, look, there's um look that there's your name written up here and there's your name on the behind the trig there." And and we we go up a little closer to it and it's her name, but it's also says 81. Shannon saw this. Shannon 81. She said, "That's so strange. That's the year I was born, 1981. And I don't know, call me crazy, okay, but what are the odds? We've just got the summit thing in our mind and the law's busy sort of Okay, now put I'll just cut to the chase. Shannon said, "This is weird. I wonder what that means." I said, "You know what it means? It means that we climbed this whole summit for you. This is so you could come and realize your name's on the top of the summit. Shannon 1981. When you were the the year you were born, your name was up here. Another Shannon the other side of the world walked all the way up here, wrote their name and wrote 81 and walk back down again. And and it's just one of those moments where you feel like, you know, this has been this is so uncanny. It feels like the Lord the Lord calling I want to call you to the summit as well. It's not just Isaac going up, but I'm calling you to the summit. And there you are, Shannon 81. And Shannon said, "Yeah, I think it sort of means I was born for this." I'm like, "Oh, you got me there." Okay, I might be crazy, but the the the the whole playing out of the situation was like I think when I got back down, we we were back down at the back down at the this was where we ran across and there's the mount on the back there up at the top. I pointed to Shannon, I said, "We ran all the way up that hill just for you." But I thought I wanted to share that just because the Lord does these little things to, you know, and and because I shared the thing a few weeks ago. I wanted to just share that because I think when the Lord does things, it's kind of like, you know, when it's the Lord, like the the the balance of probabilities are just too strange that you think, okay, I think the Lord's trying to speak to me. And I think, you know, in your own life, you know, we begin to realize we serve a supernatural God where we bump into people. There's unusual things and we can start to see the hand of God move in our life. But don't be shy to sort of to just look out for the hand of God in your life and look out for his leadership because he does he does want to lead. He hasn't forgotten you. He wants to lead you and guide you in your life and and give you purpose, give you direction, let you know which way you should go and and give you answers to things. He doesn't just want to leave you there, confuse you, give you answers. He'll show you the right way to go. Amen. So, let's um let's just stand. Um maybe I'll just lead us in a a song this evening. Let's um let's stand and we'll just start. Can I ask some musicians to come up? Amen. We'll just um uh there's a song um I'm this sing I'm amazed that you love me. But just as they start playing, we just we'll just um pray this evening. Dear Lord, I just want to thank you, Lord, for as a personal testimony in my life, Lord, that I can look back and know, Lord, that through all the different paths that I've been on, I know that you haven't forgotten me, Lord, that you've remembered me, Lord, and you've you've cared for me. And I believe you've had the same care. And for each one here, Lord, that you haven't forgotten any anyone that's here, Lord, but you've your eyes been upon us, Lord.
