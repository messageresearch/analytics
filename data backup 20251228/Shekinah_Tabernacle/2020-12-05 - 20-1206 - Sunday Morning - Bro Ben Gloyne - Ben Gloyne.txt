========================================

[Music] a [Music] me [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] ah [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay [Music] christian hey i always appreciate having hope imagine living with no hope hopeless that will be awful but i don't know what it's like to live hopelessly because by the grace of god i've always because i was brought up a christian i've always known about the concept of god you know and that of faith and that there is actually more to life than just i guess fate in our own effort [Music] but i wouldn't have it any other way and who's got who has brought up a christian here hmm who wasn't [Music] oh interesting yeah it's hard for me to get my head around not understanding god you know not not thinking like one day thinking well maybe there is something more than this because i've never thought that way i've always thought there is something more than this from my earliest memories but you know [Music] god just takes people from all different walks and places and and we all make up this body of christ from all different experiences in that i was overhearing um sister stacy's conversation yesterday when they were doing a puzzle sisters were doing a puzzle and she was talking about how the you know there's all these little puzzle pieces and they they all have a little place to fit within the puzzle and you sometimes don't know where a piece goes until later on after you think where does this piece go but then you have to get all the other pieces and then you're like oh that's where that piece goes it goes in there and you know every one of us here are all part of that we're all part a piece of the puzzle of the body of christ you know and we all came in at different times different different places to make up to make up the body of christ let's um let's um we'll stand this morning i'm just going to open in prayer [Music] i've had a funny thought this morning i was thinking way back to when we we first brother ben first started the fellowship and we sort of turned up we were all quite young fellas back then i think brother ben how old was brother ben was he 27 or 28 [Music] well yeah and i was i think i was 30 but i'd actually just finished running a church for a couple of years before that brother andy would have been 28 or 29 [Music] we were just young fellows [Music] i don't know why i'm saying this but it was just who's 28 [Music] i've been thinking lately looking at some of our young people i'd be thinking i was your age when we started a fellowship and we call you guys young people how old are you brother jeremy [Music] it's an interesting thought that i've been thinking lately you know we we're supposedly the elders now you know i feel like a young fellow and i can actually joke around as i've been in the message for 20 years but i still feel like a young fellow you know but [Music] young super youth you're actually not really youth you're actually adults like you're not youth some of us we were the super youth running the fellowship when it back when it started i'm going to leave it there let's open a prayer this morning [Music] thank you lord jesus that we can be here lord as vessels that have been saved and called by you from different [Music] parts of the world from different walks of life [Music] at different times in our life lord some of us were young some were old when you called us lord but we thank you so much that your grace and your perfect plan touched each one of our lives at your desired time lord and made an impact and brought us all together here this morning lord jesus we just thank you for the work you've done thank you for each soul here lord i believe each one of us are here by your divine purpose and your divine will lord we don't believe in fate or just chance things happening haphazardly lord but there's a purpose in all things there's a greater hand lord that guides all things so we just thank you for this gathering this morning lord we believe that you saw this gathering before the foundation of the world this isn't just this wasn't just a couple of young guys and girls trying to maybe try something out but this was your divine plan [Music] lord and we come under expectation this morning lord that that you're going to work in a mighty way this morning in our midst lord jesus and continue to fulfill your plan lord we want to invite you here may you have liberty in our service lord to speak to hearts and speak to lives to

you all today brother ninny god bless you great to have you here praise the lord amen amen sister army god bless you andy god bless you because you feel at home and welcome amen praise the lord everyone great to be here today amen so just a reminder that we're going to have the sunday school picnic celebration everything straight after church at the at the park and amen who feels good today amen let's just go to the scripture we're going to go to the book of jude amen take courage the battle is the lord's amen hallelujah i mean we're going to read the first three verses of judah then we're going to go to um we're going to go to second corinthians 9 and 15. jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called grace unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints amen this is where we're here we're here to contend for that faith that resurrection faith hallelujah amen and then we've got here in in in judges a bit of a context about two here and after him was shamga the son of anath which slew of the philistines 600 men with an ox goat and he also delivered israel he was earnestly contending one day he wasn't contending but then the next moment he was and look at the result amen hallelujah and then and then the apostle paul would say here thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift aren't you glad for the gift of his holy spirit amen amen let's bow he's in a word of prayer this morning lord jesus we just want to bow our heads before you and thanksgiving in our hearts lord that you're you're alive lord you're the resurrected all-conquering almighty god and dear lord we thank you we can stand here in commemoration of your resurrection and lord we can rejoice because you have rose from the grave lord so we are alive and you lord we have resurrected as well lord out of the death of lord sin and death lord to alive lord to be alive and you and i just pray dear god may just take the service lord may take these lord i have these notes but lord one word from you is the thing that matters lord jesus lord i just pray you would take the service under your control lord may you anoint speaker and hearer lord i pray the devil would have no place to move in this service lord i pray your blood would cover each soul each spirit each body lord may he have no avenue to work whatsoever dear god and may just have free course in our hearts and our lives lord we thank you for this beautiful day you've given us lord just ask father your blessings upon the reading of your word lord i pray you be it those who couldn't make it today be their portion as well those sick and body lord those who may be watching by the way of youtube as well father and i just pray lord may may you be praised this day lord you've done mighty things for us lord you're doing mighty things we thank you for all you're doing lord in our lives we love you we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i was sitting i was sitting in the prayer meeting on on wednesday and and a thought came to my mind and this may not make a lot of sense but i trust it well but three words came to my mind love fought for now something that's fought for after the victory is one it's treasured a lot more than than before the battle you know sometimes we can take things for granted but when it stands in jeopardy maybe you can stand in losing it but you fight a battle and you get it back that's when you can really treasure you know what you have you know there's a saying you know you never miss the water until the well runs dry who's heard that saying so you take you take the well for granted you take the flavor of the water for granted take the take it for granted you can just get a drink whenever you need but when that well runs out then you really begin to have a hunger and a real desire and you really appreciated what you have now i'm not saying for a second the wells run dry we're tapped into an inexhaustible fountain of the lord jesus christ amen he can't run dry he can't run out hallelujah but you know i think we should uh maybe you know we should fight for what we have right we you know we have something worth fighting for we have something worth dying for amen hallelujah now in order you know luke what jesus would say here in the book of luke or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand so there's before a uh a war is fought uh you know a king or the government will make a decision can we win this war and you know are we able to win it now the something that has been i'm just going to backtrack a little bit now when something has when a victory has been won that thing that has been recaptured or captured is not taken for granted now before a war is raged there's normally a few things that must be weighed up now this is not a list of importance it's just it's just what i've got here can we win this war let's think about this we're going to war okay the question is can we win do we have a big enough army to win is the cause we have right right is the cost or the price that we must pay worth it right this now i'm just talking along natural lines now what are we fighting for the greater the value that something so just say if we were fighting just say if another country came and invaded new zealand you know they took the south island or they took some part of the country if we put great value on that piece of our country we'll fight for that piece of our country we will make great sacrifices to get it back but if we put a little bit of value on it we'll let them have it or maybe you know compromise and come to negotiations and you know because the value we've put upon it is not as great as maybe it should be but if great value is put upon it then we'll give everything we have we'll give all our resources all of our energy we'll give our lives for it because we'll put great value on it now this is just talking along natural lives but how much more spiritual lines the question is can we win amen our captain's already won he conquered hell death and the grace hallelujah do we have a big enough army too when i say one is a majority with god moses was one man 80 year old man anointed commissioned to go into egypt he went into the superpower of the day said let my people go and the end result was the people were let go hallelujah so one man amen you can be the one that can shake the world holy now i'm not talking about overthrowing governments that's not what we're here to do we're here to overthrow the devil's kingdom in people's lives that satan would be dethroned that unbelief that had its way in people's lives would be kicked out it would be replaced by faith hallelujah and god would live in that person's life so we're here to tear satan's kingdom down and i'll say we have something worth fighting for as the prophet would tell us one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds hallelujah so we have something worth fighting for is our cause right absolutely it's right we have the right cause and it's not just trying to spin it a certain way to try and sway public opinion to fight a war no we have a right cause hardly because the devil's taking people captive amen but we have we're under a mandate from god i mean to take them back hallelujah we have we have the right cause and is the cost of the price worth it absolutely 100 hallelujah we got to put value higher value and what we have this is maybe i'm talking to myself but when you think when you think about even wednesday you know we can take prayer meetings or even services for granted where god comes down and he begins to speak and touch hearts and change lives we shouldn't take that for granted we shouldn't take it casual or the lord's in the room right we shouldn't take it for granted even when you pray at home in your car he comes and visits you and speaks to your heart and ministers his word makes it alive we shouldn't take that for granted we should treasure that that's something worth fighting for that's worth something defending hallelujah amen now there have been many great feats of heroics on the battlefield down through the ages though i'm just talking about natural battles where men would literally give their lives on the battlefield to defend their homes their families and their children and they would many times know they will never return right they knew this was going to be their last day upon the earth but the cause they were had that was burning in their hearts was so real and so great they said i'm going to give my life you know we know the story of arnold van winkld you know in switzerland where the austrians came in he says brethren are just a bunch of farmers they didn't have the same equipment as the austrians they didn't have the weapons like them but he said brethren i'm going to give my life to switzerland today over that down in that valley's my family i'm never going to see them again this morning i kiss my my wife goodbye my children can buy i'm going to give my life for switzerland and they asked him what are you going to do arnold he said just follow me fight with what you got and he found the thickest part of the spares the thickest part of the army and then he pressed into that said make way for liberty pulled the spares into his own bosom made a bridge you know in their formation and the swiss garden and won the battle but he made up his mind i'm giving my life for switzerland it's worth it he put a value of the freedom of his country greater than his own life hallelujah now our lord jesus now that's just a natural thing that's just a natural thing nations will come nations will go you know at the end of the day there will only be one nation which is the nation of our lord jesus christ in the millennium and in the new heavens and new earth right but he gave his life for switzerland now our lord jesus was much the same way but far greater remember he didn't remember he he didn't try and bypass the devil's you know you know the wall and barrier of sin and death he didn't try and go under it he didn't try and go around it try and find a weak point but he hit the hardest part of it he took death head-on hallelujah he didn't shrink back he said no i'm going to give my life for adam's fallen race this day i'm not going to purchase their salvation i have in my body amen the blood that can free every man woman and child that will believe hallelujah and he took death head-on hallelujah and he bridged the chasm hallelujah now he gives us the same ability to fight with what we got amen jesus would would defeat the devil with the word in the desert hallelujah showing that the weakest of christians aiming can take the word of god and quote it at the devil and defeat the devil any place any time anywhere hallelujah he did not use his great powers he could have he could have spoken the devil out of existence who believes he could have done that amen he could have turned him into anything he could have but he just used the word he said it is written hallelujah and he defeated the devil right there hallelujah there have been many great last stands in the in the history of warfare a last stand is basically going to make your stand and you know you're probably not going to get out of it there would be a time in the texas revolution this may not mean much to anyone but you know there was a there was a there was a series of battles called the texan revolution where the state of texas which was kind of just forming would fight against the mexican government and they and there were a bunch of texans that would that would that would set up a defense in the alamo mission who who's heard of the alamo davy crockett was there who's heard of davy crockett right he would lose his life in this battle but they would just a few hundred of them would would defend this mission against the you know you know thousands of of of texan um uh soldiers and the texans would win this battle and literally wipe out everyone that was in the alamo now it became a rallying cry of the texans after this they would say remember the alamo when they would fight their enemy now if if a defeat could could could rally a people remember what they did did to us there remember how they killed the prisoners remember what they did at the alamo and it rallied them i mean emboldened them to fight amen this you know you know this mexican force and we know the rest is history and texas is now part of america but you know if a if a rallying cry of a defeat could stir a people to fight how much more if we could say remember the red sea hallelujah where moses took the people across on dry land remember when joshua took jericho hallelujah remember remember we said sun stand still won't stand still and they won the day oh remember mount carmel hallelujah where god came down and prove that he's still god the god that has us by fire is god hallelujah amen remember when elijah went up in a chariot yes sir hallelujah remember when shamgar killed 600 men amen remember when david remember when david killed goliath shouldn't these things stir something in our hearts remember to be a christian we must be identified with all the glory and all the shame of the believers down through the ages so i was there with moses at the red sea i was there with joshua there around jericho i was there with david fighting goliath if i'm a christian i must be identified with everything the believers did i was with isaiah in the temple when the lord came there amen harlow i was with elijah mount carmel i was with elijah when he went up in the chariots amen i was with john the baptist preaching the kingdom of god is at hand if i'm a christian i must be identified with that amen i was with i was with david when they took jerusalem amen i was there when the ark was being carried and he was praising and singing and hallelujah if i'm a christian i'm to be identified with all those things i mean if i'm a christian i'd be identified with the law's death burial and resurrection amen if i'm a christian i must be only if i'm a christian i'm identified with those in the upper room harley where the holy ghost came down and filled the place and filled them if i'm a christian i'm to be you know you know i was there when when paul was on the ship on the way to rome and there was a great big storm but after 14 days he said the angel lord came and stood by me whose i am and whom i have served saying fear not paul no man will lose his life only the ship if i'm a christian i'm there if i'm a christian i'm to be you know i was in the arena with the with the martyrs in the early church hallelujah because i'm a christian right hallelujah amen if i'm a christian i'm too identify with martin luther nailing the 100 you know your 91 thesis on the church door there if i'm a christian i must be holy if i'm a christian i'm to identify with john wesley preaching standing on his own father's uh gravestone preaching to the masses hallelujah if i'm a christian i'm with those at azusa street amen hallelujah amen if i'm a christian i'm to identify with an angel coming to the prophet in the cave if i'm a christian to identify with the book coming open hallelujah the angels coming down on mount sunset hallelujah if i'm a christian i've got to be identified with all those things i mean so we could use any of those and say remember amen remember the great victories hallelujah they're not defeats they're victories amen and so we could say remember calvary amen remember when the son of god took our sins that day up calvary's cross remember when he gave his life remember when he took the stripes amen that should stir something in our hearts i'll let you stir a rally and cry this is worth fighting for this is worth dying for i remember when he went down to hell hallelujah in our place as a sinner that we don't need to go there because he took your sin down there in your place i mean that you don't need to go down into that place and remember when he rose triumphant amen hardly over hell death in the grave remember those things hallelujah yes sir i say we have something worth fighting for amen i we have something worth dying for hallelujah hallelujah one soul is worth more than 10 000 worlds now we can live in such a way where the kingdom expands amen where god comes and lives now we're talking no i almost had to walk away from the table yesterday i was like get out of my notes everyone stop talking about these things no but we can either live in such a way where we can just go through the status quo we come to church we do everything believers do we have family alters at home we pray we talk about the lord just but we just go through the motions we can live that kind of a life and from the outside that looks pretty good or we can live a life that is that but god living where divine love is projected and sovereign grace takes over and god supernaturally touches people's lives we can live that kind of life i mean we can live a life where actually we have love one for another i mean we can actually enter the burden of someone's need hallelujah and more than just say a prayer for them but pray a prayer for them i mean where god actually begins to undertake for someone's life hallelujah now the reason i'm saying all this is because we've got something worth fighting for do you think the devil likes a people that are filled with the holy ghost and god lives that's the one thing he doesn't mind if we believe the message he doesn't mind if we actually make a profession of faith but the one thing he minds is when the life of god enters into a human vessel and begins to live himself out remember the devil didn't roll out of bed even on the day of pentecost but when peter and john were walking past the gate beautiful and they began to see a crippled man that was sitting by the gate of the church that no one could help they stepped over they couldn't help him but they looked down and said look on us and say silver and gold we have none but such as i have give by thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and they just pulled him up onto his feet i don't know what was going through his mind but hallelujah amen he was walking and leaping and praising god brother ram says after that happened then all the guns of hell began to turn upon the believer because now the one that was in jesus was now in the disciples doing what he did before the before the death burial resurrection amen hallelujah so the devil hates that kind of thing the devil hates god living in a people he will let you be a message believer without a birth he will even give you this message without a birth i mean but once you're born by the spirit of god and you can see a book of acts being written be sure they'll be opposition hallelujah and the more opposition you have you should be the happier person amen because if you say well the uh yo this is a heavy load what's good the devil's trying to force you into a corner but you're going to recognize devil i am being forced in a corner my god is bigger than you he defeated you you're a defeated being you're nothing but a block i'm not standing in a corner devil i'm pressing on hallelujah why because this is worth living for we have a resurrection message it's worth living for we actually have eternal life not religion not church forget about churchianity religion this is not religion this is a relationship with almighty god however he would come and change our lives i mean that we wouldn't be drug addicts or prostitutes or drunkards or gamers or whatever more we'll be living living people full of the holy ghost amen hallelujah hallelujah if he's alive you can meet him who's had that experience it's real simple if he's out of the tomb you can meet him hallelujah that's right hallelujah i believe it amen easter means more than just a tradition it is also now for our bodies it quickened with him and we're sitting in heavenly places and this body may rot in the sea it may rot in the ground it may not be a spoonful of ashes but she's coming forth for the spirit that raised up my lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body amen it's quicken your mortal body and we are beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life that i talk so much about you know no wonder he said fear not he says it a lot in the bible don't fail don't be worried don't be scared fear not holy because remember when the lord ever comes to someone he doesn't come to him and say stay in your hole stay in your place stay in your hole he didn't come to giddy and say stay in the wine press threshing in secret he said no i'm bringing you out of this you're actually a mighty man of allah i want you to see your mighty man of fellow and now i'm going to prove it in your life hallelujah he took that mighty man of valor hallelujah and defeated a whole host of people heaven 300 of his brethren hallelujah that's right because he said you're a mighty man of valor and here he is in secret just trying to you know look at the bible in secret and have a secret oh because it's a personal walk with god and you know listening to the message in secret and not telling anyone about it and not you know rejoicing not letting it bubble forth because of fear but there he was a circumcised son of abraham living in the promised land living in his adopted place in the promised land but he was afraid of the enemy around him the devil's whipped he is have you ever really read this he's whipped amen he's worked yes i read in here where he's going to burn in the lake of fire and i read in here i'm going to be dancing on streets of glory hallelujah after he's in the lake of fire yes sir hallelujah so he's his destination has been pre-destinated yeah that's right you know his end has been because god by his full knowledge could look through the strands of time he could see iniquity in the heart of the devil in the beginning and he could see also where he would end up in the end do you know he's predestinated but if he's predicted on the negative what about the bride of christ on the positive but if he's been predestinated amen to burn that's right holy but we have been predestined to walk on streets of gold i mean when time is no more and eternity rolls on we'll still be there holly because that is our destiny has been predetermined i mean so it doesn't necessarily matter about our struggles in this life hallelujah it doesn't necessarily matter about the hardship we may have to endure it's all for our good anyway it's molding your character god's doing your work yes sir holy joseph you know joseph spent many years in prison god was doing a work yes sir hallelujah it's the same thing with us you say well i'm just going day by day all the same god's doing the work god's doing her work he's working mildly in you and me you may not appreciate what he's doing what he's doing that's the main thing hallelujah we are beneficiaries i love it we are and we are beneficiaries of his resurrection you know i love about the lord he doesn't just do something and say isn't that wonderful he's like no it's wonderful but i'm going to show you what it does for you hallelujah i mean he died on calvary now he's going to show i'm going to show you what it does i'm going to show you what my blood does i rose out of the tomb i was thinking i was driving from work and i was thinking what would it have been like to be one of those soldiers one of those roman soldiers you find yourself on the third third day or third night or whenever just before the dawn of the opening of the tomb and that's your watch nothing's been happening maybe you're getting a little bit bored but then there comes a presence down it says they fell down as like dead men that's how awesome it was these were soldiers that had been trained in battle maybe fought some wars maybe took some wounds but they never stepped into this kind of presence and they all fell down as dead men and the stone rolled away and angelo came and sat on the stone and the lord came out of the tomb what an experience what an impact they couldn't have you know they couldn't have forgotten that i don't know what they did with it but they couldn't have forgotten that kind of a service they couldn't have gotten that kind of a camp that's right hallelujah would have gripped them so much but it's what you've got to give yourself to it hallelujah that's it you've got to give yourself to it we're beneficiaries and that's why the prophet's ministry is so wonderful to me because god says i'm going to show you what the blood does i'm going to show you a contemporary of yours in this modern world and show you what the blood does hallelujah and we can have a testimony meeting right now we can all stand up and say i'll show you what the blood has done in my life amen holy how it saved my soul amen healed my body quicken my mortal body other gay show me things to come amen change my heart open the word made it alive to me yes sir hallelujah amen couldn't we do that wouldn't that be a cool carnage oh we can do that amen hallelujah amen fear not he would know as for paul said death where is your sting grave where is your victory i'm full of quickening power thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ yes sir quickening power oh my he's alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8 notice messiah the anointed one so is his bride the messiahettes see the anointed one the same anointing upon him is now upon her i mean to do the same works hallelujah so if that's the case now we should press the battle amen hallelujah it's worth fighting for yes sir don't you think so if that's how you get out of the service i pray god just anchor it in your soul it's worth living for this gospel is worth living for i mean it's worth i mean prayer and giving our lives completely to it seeing god live it's worth it amen oh jesus and sometimes it means a lot sometimes it costs you something anything that don't cost you something it and sorry isn't worth not having all great things have to be paid for yeah people would rather pay for something and be given to it free yeah it's worth something and if it's worth something it's worth dying for and this religion that we have this pentecostal holy spirit that fell on us glory bring back to us and resurrected jesus christ alive after 1900 years it's worth all of our time and our efforts and everything we do it's worth all to us hallelujah now that doesn't mean we have church 24 7 but that every our whole life should be the whole theme of our life should be his redeeming love amen and it should be him his resurrected life it should be him living amen amen how we treat and very much help me lord jesus right now how we treat our children how we treat our family i mean everyday life how we treat our work colleagues or or school buddies whatever it should be that should be the principal theme of our whole life because it's worth everything glory hallelujah brother band would say in the great and mighty conqueror before any victory can be won there must be great prices paid oh what prices sometimes they are very deep and they make great scars tearing down but in order to have the mountain you've got to have the valley before we can have the sunshine we've got to get the rain before we can have the light we've got to get the knight before we can have right we have to have wrong or you would never know what wrong was but in order to conquer and to win the greatest battle that was ever won one stepped out of glory many years ago he did not take upon himself the form of an angel he did not come as some great person but he was going to prove that don't take muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to win a war what a statement amen he clothed himself in humility like a little baby and was born in a manger now just stop right here remember the first prayer meeting we ever had when this church started the lord told us if we remain humble my word will continue to come forth and i'll bring people here and they will find my rest right what is his rest the holy ghost now we never got told that's done right who came here and found rest hallelujah so i say you are better you are the product of that prophecy but we're not done the lord never said no that's finished amen so in my opinion god's still going to bring people and they're going to find rest now they might not stay in this church that's irrelevant but they will be they'll be sealed into the kingdom by the holy ghost god might move them on somewhere else that's perfectly fine but he said i'll bring them here and they'll find rest for their souls amen hallelujah that's right so thanks humility he clothed himself in humility like a little baby and was born in a manger there was not even a place for his birth when he come i want you to look at the different material of warfare that he used what he used now adam's race was all in bondage there they were without hope without god without chance without mercy without anything that could help them the great enemies of the lower regions of the lost had shut them up in darkness there was not a way out there was no one could help nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss but our hero i love that statement he's my hero jesus is my hero not someone who creeps around at night wearing their undies on the outside their clothes with a cape on that's not my hero my hero was the creator of heavens and earth my hero is not someone running around in shorts on a rugby field or a sports field they were once upon a time but not no more my hero came from glory and revealed himself to me and he's my hero harlow he's my hero he's the one i love hallelujah no one else could ever step down and say i am the resurrection in the life because i live you shall live also and i begin to see it in my life happening hello he's my hero hallelujah my my hero can step to a grave a man's been dead four days old and he can say lazarus come forth and if he did not call lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection because he is the resurrection and the life heller my hero can go by a funeral procession and it doesn't end a funeral procession you know everywhere where jesus went where there was death the devil was your torment like legion it never stayed that way there was life there was redemption there was healing hallelujah there was resurrection that's my kind of hero my hero can take a tormented individual and give them peace in their hearts my hero can take someone who's just between two opinions this right or wrong and show them the way yes hallelujah that's my hero i mean my hero can take someone addicted to all kinds of things and set them free hallelujah they're just buried in the world floating along he can grab a hold of them amen and bring them out thank you lord that's my hero and i'm not talking just about a historical figure i'm talking about a present tense god i mean because he is a present help in time of trouble i mean from a time of trouble he's a present help what does that mean to be a prison help he's here if i'm present i'm here i'm not absent i'm present highly alike at school you'd be waiting for your name to be called in the role you'd say present present present you didn't say absent because they're looking and saying no you're present sometimes it was only present in body but you're still there i trust you're all president body and spirit today hallelujah but you know he's my hero hallelujah hallelujah amen but our hero who came down from the portals of glory condescending down for there was no man on earth who could do the job we were all as worldly speaking in the same boat we're all born and sinned shaped inequity come to the world speaking lies and none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated chaos at every hand all united we could not keep laws and ceremonies finding their weaknesses and so forth we could not do it and it seemed like the whole human race was laid waste but then he came he came down hallelujah where i could not when i could not go to where he was he came to me he came to me and then he came he came down because he was in the beginning the bible says he was the word and he was the logos that went out of god and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word and then when he ascended up on the glorious day of easter he became not only the word but he became the high priest of his own word oh what a glorious thing brother neville just think what a glorious thing shekinah tabernacle just think he's not only the word but he's the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we would receive what we asked for for he is the word and the intercessor of the word so he didn't just give the word but he's here to back up and make his own word come to pass i mean if he's the high priest of his own word the bible says he is the high priest of our profession amen amen so if we profess his word he remember he can only act on our behalf if we profess his word to him right it's not us professing our situation or how we feel oh this is going on this is going on when we profess his word to him then he can act on our behalf and remember nothing can stop him from acting nothing can tie his hands nothing can stop him the devil can't stop him saying no you can't do that god come on come on oh no no no no god just pushes him to one side says get out of here satan hallelujah these are my children this is my people get out of here i'm gonna act on their profession amen that's why it's always very important to just say what the bible says about you about a situation amen there's only virtue in that hallelujah amen the logos became word and the word made flesh in the same flesh that was the word received up into glory and now as the high priest making intercession by himself to his word that's what it takes that's the material the church has got what a weapon there's never been one like it he was the word and when he come down he was born in a manger he came to use the weapon of aloe ve love to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come in a different manner he came in the form of love he was god's love hallelujah and if he is in your heart then that weapon's in you he's going to let it have its free course amen but the devil will try and put complexes and pains and hurts and try and get us to withdraw but it's worth fighting for amen amen this faith is worth fighting for it's worth contending for amen hallelujah amen amen but someday when the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from god we'll pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that will uh that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection if there wasn't a law to it sons and daughters of god could create them a world out here and go live a private life on it i mean we have the power you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it see i'm not feeling very strong in faith today you've got the power to do it that's right amen hallelujah if you've got the shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are what if the creator remember the holy ghost is the creator himself it's not a different god a lesser god it is the god who said let there be sun moon and stars comes and dwells in his people so if the creator that could create all things comes and lives in you if there wasn't a law to stop it you could say let there be my own private world and go and and then you'd go live on it and don't let your mind go wandering off saying i'd have beaches or mountains or valleys or what temperature but of that law but there's a law stopping that from happening i mean but the creator is in us hallelujah omni um god is omnipotent right so he's all powerful now if if if that is the case now i just want to jump here you know there's nothing you know man is all powerful you know there is nothing impossible with you we think we so many times oh god there's nothing impossible with god he can do all things do you know if that powers in you there's nothing impossible to you do we know that i'm just going to jump to because sometimes people yeah i really quote people are i need a scripture for that or okay well we'll just go the scriptures then we'll go to the quote okay and they brought him unto him and when they saw him so this is a member of father's the story of the you know the deci jesus comes off the mountain these disciples try to cast out an epileptic spirit i believe it is out of a little boy and you know they can't do it and and so this is jesus coming on the scene here and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straight away the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it a go since this came on um uh unto him and he said of a child and often cast him into a fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can us do anything have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him him that believeth so to the believer all things are possible not just some things all things all things are possible to the bride of christ not all things we should never limit the faith we have we should never limit this power that we have i can do this but i can't do this no no it can do this and do that and it can do more besides hallelujah amen jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth do we have believers in the room today and straight away the father of child cried out and said with tears lord i believe helped out my unbelief now that's a good way to be if you don't you know if the revelation hasn't dropped into your heart for something say lord help my unbelief give me more faith lord take my unbelief and when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked this foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter into him no more and the spirit cried and rent him saw and came out of him and he was as one dead and so much that many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand lifted him up and he arose and when he was coming to the house the disciples asked him privately why could we not cast them out and he said unto them this kind come can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting now i just i just want i wanted to read that whole thing just to show you know sometimes spirits come out in different ways but i'll say this if if it takes prayer and fasting to cast a demon out is it worth the sacrifice if you feel led to to to do that i'd say it's worth it i mean the battle's worth it the sacrifice is worth it i mean if we keep the goal at the end in our minds whatever sacrifice must be made to get to that goal i'll say it's worth it you know olympians or great sports people they will have the finals in mind they'll have that podium finish they will have the world cup or whatever you know winning some olympic gold you know those who are training for the america's cup they have the victory in mind and that is their goal and they're not worried what sacrifices they have to make in order to pick up that old mug as it's called it's called the old mug you know because they are determined we're going to win this we're going to win this thing we're going to win this you know and so their whole lives remember they're not amit it's you know it's not amateur hour it's 24 7 living breathing sailing that's right right and now this is just professional sport how about eternal things it's worth it amen it's worth it to god hallelujah thank you jesus it's worth it now we'll go back here amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden now man i'm going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he say mark 11 22 whatever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when two omnipotents meet and god and man comes together too omnipotent something's got to shake i mean whatsoever you would say with that creative power of the omnipotence of god knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to us things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful how isn't he wonderful that he yet that he won the victory but he just he didn't just keep that victory to himself he says no i'm gonna i'm gonna share it with my wife amen hallelujah isn't that incredible as as i say nothing is impossible to you all things are possible to them that belief but you've got to only believe to only believe does not mean have faith and then look at the circumstances that's not only belief right that is believing and but he said only believe so only believers i'm only going to take god's word into consideration that's only believing nothing else abraham did not pay attention to his own body dead sarah's body past age the impossibility hey he he looked old he sounded old he felt old you know she looked old she sounded old they were old but abraham only believed he didn't consider those things he said god's made the promise and if god made the promise god's obligated to fulfill the promise remember it's not us trying to force the promise to happen it's actually god if he promised it it's going to happen then we can go rejoicing giving him thanks praising him for things you see not because you know it's on its way because remember faith declares as though it is though it is not hallelujah you say that's a crazy way to be well abraham had isaac and maybe he would be juggling him on his um you know shoulder saying who's crazy now who's crazy now here he is do you want to see the evidence this is this is the evidence of my insanity apparently is this baby boy who's crazy now hallelujah and when we're changing a moment of a twinkling of an eye who's crazy now hallelujah who's crazy now oh you're a crazy man i'm real happy this way the other way didn't make me very happy i was depressed i'd cross the road going from the island village there at university down in canterbury across ireland road to go to university traffic would come and i would not slow down to get hit by cars but i actually will like something just hit me that's how unhappy i was on the inside i've never felt that way like this hallelujah i've only been happy this way have you had hardships yet but i've never been like that because i know in whom i have belief i know who's in charge of the whole thing and i know what he said about me is not yeah he said no you're going to make it because i'm going to make you make it all right i died on cross for you i died at calgary for you i've seen this message to turn your heart back to the original faith you're going to make it i've opened my word to you this book is now open hallelujah i've descended to take over the battle hallelujah are you going to make it yes sir amen i say amen absolutely lord jesus let it be unto me according to thy word yes hallelujah glory to god now brother brown would tell a story i'm i don't think i have it on here but but he tells a story of of of a bicycle race i just saw it whoever whoever puts the little snippets of his sermons on i think up in uh fielding whoever does it i say god bless them and and they just put on the one about the bicycle race where where uh a company that made bicycles said we'll give you a free bicycle a brand new one if you can ride over this bit of wood however long it was and make it all the way to the end and so all the boys in the neighborhood said yep let's enter this thing and there was one boy who they thought man he's a useless writer he'll never do it but but he joined in as well and one by one those boys got on the bike they tried to ride across but they fell off every one of them but then the boy who who had no you know they thought no he's never going to win he got on the bike and he just went straight across no wobbles and he got the you know he got a new bike so all of his buddies who thought he was useless they asked him how did you do it because they wanted the bike now he had the bike now they're jealous of the bike right so how'd you do it and he said you know i was watching you fellas and you're biking along but you kept looking down at your pedals and looking down at the board and you all fell off so i decided no no i'm not gonna look i'm not gonna look down at my feet or the pedals or the board i'm gonna look to where i'm going and that's how i got across now if we look at our faults and our failures and our humanity and this brother did this assistant did this and this person did this and this is doing this you know we're looking down at the board oh i better stay in the middle of the road how's this going to happen you know trying to trust in your own ability you're going to fall off but if you look under jesus at the end if you look at the end destination if you look at where you're going look at the promise amen you will stay in the middle of the road and you'll stay in a balanced walk hallelujah you know my dad told me when i was learning to ride a bike and being on go-karts he said you know where you look is where you end up driving you know so you can be riding along if you're looking this way you'll start turning this way you know or you're in a goku even in a car why do so many you know people sticky beak and rubber neck and they crash why because they're not looking at the road they're looking at some other thing so it's the same thing what your eyes are towards is what you'll walk end up going towards that's why we should keep our eyes on jesus on the word on this message we should keep it on him not on this world and other stuff because you'll end up going you'll hit the gravel and then you'll be you know you've got to watch where you're going hallelujah we should be looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's the one we should be looking for um unto him hallelujah if we keep our eyes on him who gave the promise he who said i'm a present help in time of trouble the one who said he will fulfill his word then we will keep walking straight as sure as there's a heaven to go to hallelujah amen that's what we need to keep doing now as i said we can't help anyone i think i was saying to the brothers there at the table i said you know it's like there's a difference between sitting in the trench and charging forward getting over the top and charging forward you know when divine love is ruling a life that person's over the top they have gone over the top of the trench and they're charging at the enemy because they have redeeming love in their hearts they are determined as he died to make men holy let us let us die to make men free there's something in them saying i'm not staying in this hole just trying to live out this this wall going through the motions no i'm going over the top you know we have invincibility whoever played a gamer you get the invincibility then yo it's just all on we have invincibility hallelujah we have nothing to be afraid of amen hallelujah but we can't help anyone staying in the trench we can go through the motions you know a soldier in the trench a soldier on the battlefield they're they're still a soldier they have the same equipment they have the same boots the same helmet the same gun whatever whatever but one is fighting and one is just going through the motions and we're not called to just go through the motions you know the devil if he could make us lukewarm formal and powerless that's his goal so his goal is just to make us have church and nothing happens but it's worth contending for that's worth fighting for amen it's worth giving ourselves for lord i want to see you live lord i see you i want to see a word manifested in my life lord give me a revelation of your word i want to see the reality of you in my life hallelujah thanks you know you know brother brown when he was hunting squirrels he was meditating on i think it's mark 11 24. if he sounds to this mountain and he's just thinking about it and then the lord comes to him and says do you want me to show you what that means you want me to interpret give you the interpretation of that scripture and he says what do you have need of well i'm hunting squirrels well where do you want them he says well i want one on that limb and one appeared and then another another another one he shot them you know the story but god was interpreting that scripture to the prophet saying this is what it means when ye say unto this mountain when you speak to the situation now i don't need squirrels i don't need a storm to be spoken out of existence i don't need a tumor to be spoken out of the side of my wife i don't need those things but there's situations we have amen we say lord interpret that scripture see it's all very well being someone else's story but what about our story what about our testimony what lord make that scripture real to me holy make it alive to me lord jesus not just that oh brother this happened to brother brown was like what about our lives hallelujah he said well it's just uh you know you pray and one grain of sand begins to fall off the mountain that may be so what about the whole thing just just just gives way what about the whole thing just gives way if you say unto this mountain you're the same voice you know god can anoint a person in such a way that is not them speaking it's deity speaking brother it says that if a spirit-filled spirit-born man or woman takes the word of god in faith and speaks it across their lips he says the same as god speaking deity speaking every mountain has to move nothing can stand before that man or woman hallelujah and this is and well why do why would god want to do those things he wants to show us the power of the blood that this power doesn't just save us it doesn't just keep us but it gives us overcoming power against the forces of darkness it gives us overcoming power against unbelief against two opinions and and lukewarmness and things it gives us overcoming power against these things you know the devil just bowls in right right but we have a right to kick him out we have a right if he comes in how does he normally come in by words by images amen that's how he comes in well how is he going to go out by words hallelujah by an image of living image god living in a people amen holy well who's going to speak that word you're going to speak that word amen you've got to address your enemy amen just like jesus did and you've got to tell them where to go yes sir well we've had too many disappointments don't worry about the disappointments don't worry about them if we look at our disappointments we're going to stay disappointed if we look at our don't worry about negative thinking don't worry about disappointments well i thought this would happen joseph thought that he was going to get out of prison he thought it's going to be all fine he stayed there but two dreams gripped himself in such a way his whole life revolved around two dreams hallelujah and he just kept walking according to that say well i've been a lot you know weak it's very easy to sing that song we're looking for a city and here in disappointments often we so sadly robe and earthly friends no longer speak one word of love isn't it right it's easy to sing they say yeah glory i'm looking for a city you know but we do have a lot of disappointment but that disappointment shouldn't make us withdraw that's right that disappointment should make us press the battle i mean because the devil wants to use disappointment say i thought you're a christian and this didn't happen look at this and this and this and this and this and he's trying to erode your faith in the word amen but the devil is brother tazewell said it camp he's a liar even if he says something that's true he's still a liar because it's him speaking and it's always there's an agenda behind what he says and the conclusion of his satan you're a liar i'm not listening to you now i mention this on wednesday this is from wait we'll come back to that don't read it this is from the usa today and and this is just the article a florida man who had been reported missing at safe was found clinging to his capsized boat on sunday morning about 86 miles which is mr google tells me 1.38 i mean 138.4 kilometers off the coast of cape canaveral which is florida official said sometime after midnight on sunday the man stuart b was asleep on his 32-foot sea ray called the stingray when he was abruptly awakened by water rushing into the front cabin of the boat said petty officer first class david uh milkaf a spokesman for the u.s coast guard the boat filled up with water almost immediately petty officer uh milkhoff said um adding that the vessel quickly capsized and that the force of the water pushed him out of the front hatch for hours mr b 62 climbed to the four feet of the boat spell that was above water then after sunrise mr b noticed a ship in the distance so he took off his shirt and started waving it to get the crew's attention he lost his glasses in the process crew members of the uh angles a 225 meter liberian container ship enroute to willing uh will millington uh i think delaware uh saw mr b around 11 a.m and got close enough to throw him a life ring used to pull him to a ladder to bring him aboard the ship that's an epic rescue isn't it now this is the picture that this is the picture of of this is where he was on his boat so so he's there one moment resting in his boat everything's fine and then this water comes in somehow and he's clinging to it like this this is a photo from the container ship this is a desperate situation isn't it you know we can just go along in life on our boat everything's fine but then something like this happens yeah some of us are in this situation like this they don't realize they're in this situation and then so he's there waving his shirt trying to get help and the coast guard is looking for him and everything and so here's someone now my question is what if this container ship was withdrawn just going through the motions came to church went through the motions had no love for the brethren or for the lost and was just going through the motions they would have just continued on route because that's what was unexpected of them but they made it up in their mind we're going to press the battle we're going to rescue someone who's on the verge of drowning amen and so here he is this is him coming out coming up the ladder of that container ship imagine i don't know what the first words that came out of his mouth but he would have been so happy i'm so glad you came my way i'm so glad you saw me waving my little my little shirt saying help me i'm lost help me i need help hallelujah and now he's on terra firma safe yeah that would have been real desperate yeah remember he didn't have time i don't think to turn on his located beacon like the water just pushed him out the front hatch and there he is hanging but a ship came his way you say i'm on course everything's fine we're on route to port we're on the gospel ship of zion heaven is our next destination but sometimes we're going to look out the port side or the starboard side and you know we can we're going to have a lookout are there some people who are drowning yeah they can be sitting right next to you and drowning or on the verge of drowning and they don't know he couldn't get the boat out of the water he's stuck he's 138 kilometers from from from shore that's a long way you can't swim that far maybe if you're ultra iron man ultra ultra but you know i doubt very much with currents and sharks and whatever you know so these ones decided we're going to go by and say how are you doing yes this is how we should be we should have love we should have such a redeeming love in our hearts is it worth it this is ten thousand worlds got rescued out of the ocean that's the value i don't know what the value of the of their shipment was in their container ship but they just picked up 10 000 worlds hallelujah that was going to drown now this is just in the natural but how much more you and i when we see people you say hello 10 000 worlds and it's not a stock market that goes up and down in value i don't know the value of 10 000 worlds but you know it's a lot there's a lot of zeros behind that one you know it's not in zimbabwean dollars either it's in policy you know but you know it's worth a lot of money it's worth a lot of money you know shouldn't we have this kind of heart yes you say well they've got to feed an extra mouth on the ship it was worth it they're going to find a bed for him it's worth it amen they're going to look after him now it's worth it he might have covert 19. it's worth it he might have something you know i'm saying like they had to weigh up the is it is the victory worth it and they decided yes because it's a life it's a man like you and i maybe he has children grandchildren you know he's got struggles he's got hopes he's got dreams you know he was worth being picked up shouldn't we have that same kind of heart towards anyone irrespective of how they've treated us whatever you know the bible says it's easy to love those who love you what about those who don't love you it's very easy to love those well of course everyone treats you good it's easy what about those who don't treat you well those are the ones who are actually like this and those are the ones you know these guys weren't concerned about their crew mates they're on the boat this guy's not on the boat right but they decided we're gonna pick him up i'm not saying you don't but i'm saying it's worth it well look remember remember in a battle you're gonna count the cost and say i'm going to give it my all amen please go now in the book of revelation i'm just going to finish poly segway but i just want you to think about that now in the book of revelation jesus is shown as as john is on the isle of patmos and he sees one like under the son of man walking among the seven golden candlesticks now we know that this is all symbolic it's a prophecy it's also a book of symbols and and this is the lord walking amongst the seven churches down through the seven church ages so he was the same lord in the first church age as he was in the second maybe manifest himself in different ways but it's the same holy ghost all the way down through now those remember we can't help someone unless we're really converted just like i think it was brother asian or or brother freddie i can't remember which one they said when jesus said to peter when thou art converted strength in the brethren so he couldn't even help people in his unconverted state though he was a believer he had to go to pentecost meet the lord that way and then he could strengthen the brethren so now what happened is there was 120 people in the upper room and it was like a it was like a lamp stand that was full of oil the wick was there but it needed it in ignition it needed a light to come to get the thing burning hallelujah they were there they were ready they were under expectation but then the match had to be dropped if i can put it that way the match had to be dropped into the room and then hardly the lord came down cloven tongues of fire sat upon each one what happened the light got lit the candle got lit yeah you know there's a song you know i've been touched by my by his fire so i'm gonna let the whole world come and watch me burn hallelujah who's been touched by his fire then let the whole world come in come on watch me burn come and watch him live hallelujah hallelujah so so now the candlesticks gave light and a dark time and so it's the same lord walking through each church age now we know we are in a bright age but we're still part of the we're still in a later cnh the world has gone that way but we're in a bright age but we're giving light remember jesus says ye are the light of the world amen right we are the light of the world amen so now here he is so the candlesticks give light in the inner corner and the tabernacle in the wilderness or in the temple and this is a type of the light that the believers would give off through seven church ages from calvary until now now i say the believers because we know a church or a church age is made up of individuals right this is not a collective thing on one sense it is but it's actually it's just all individual remember god should be individual to you or not right so it's individuals that that are actually a wick that their feet you could say are in the oil and the light is burning and it's drawing the oil through their vessel and it's now pouring out as i mean once it was just a dormant substance that had potential but now it's got a place to be drawn through and give light to the world as the oil right so now here we are we are here as lights to the world we are all now with the seven golden candlesticks there was one reservoir of oil that lit all seven so the same holy ghost that that was being drawn through paul and his light to the world was the same one that was through irenaeus and martin and polycarp and all the believers down through columbus different ones that same oil was in azusa street that same oil is through the prophet of god that same oil is in the bride because we're adapted to the same reservoir of oil amen how are you following me amen but now it takes it takes a lighting of that whip to draw what's in the reservoir to bring it forth oh god what's good having a having a great lamp stand that can give light without an ignition remember there was a whole 120 candles or lampstands in the upper room they needed an ignition but when they were ignited they changed the world uh they had something to fight with now they had a living god on the inside the inside of them that help them fight live through them now what is a candlestick it's a lamp stand and notice how beautiful here when he turned he saw this one like the son of man here standing in the midst of these seven golden lampstands which means seven church ages to come and each pipe or lamp stand um hooked into the main oil sensor and this oil come forth to a little odd-shaped lamp that set with a wick in it and the wick hung down into the oil and they poured the oil into the top of the stand which filled up the main big stem the big branch and it ran out into the stems like this and the lamp with the wick hanging down this pipe and it kept burning day and night you never had to light it it never went out they just had to keep pouring oil into the main pipe hallelujah we've got plenty of oil there's not an oil crisis here in this world there's no oil crisis there's no shortage and these lamp stands would come out like this lamp sitting uh on top of them the wick from the lamp uh run down into here got its life from out of here oh what difference it is from a candle how different it's a lamp stand and it's pulling oil now these lamp stands the fire that was in these lamp stands in the old testament when they lit one lamp they could not light the next lamp with the same fire they had in their hand they would like one lamp then pick it up and let the other lamp then set it down and then lit this lamp then took the other one and lit this lamp with the same fire that they started at the beginning oh i hope it don't go over your heads jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same fire of the holy ghost lit every one of those churches right down through the ages so the fire that fell on pentecost lit the next stage then it lit the next stage then it's come down to the seventh age and slit the sage up hallelujah then he says here oh a real wick of god is a believer is a wick look he's got a fire on one end up here and the other end he's dipped into the oil joy and oil are making fire what a church what a power what a place to be hallelujah even this is what we are we're at work come watch me burn i'm on fire hallelujah fire fire fire that's what it is hallelujah and this is this is what we need you say well i've i know the potentials of it just like you know i don't have a picture but but you know there's been a few uh space shuttles launched satellites and things and you know they know the potential of what's in the gas tanks they know what the fuel can do they know the potential of each stage and what it can do but when it's ignited everything they have learned in theory is actually in practice and it becomes a reality when that ignition happens it can sit there on the launch pad looking pretty so yep this is going to the moon or this is going to the international space station or this is going wherever maybe one day it's going to mars but the potential can't just sit as potential it's going to become a manifestation so what's in the gas tank has to be ignited and it's got to go through the stratosphere and it's the same thing with you and i this word is full of this is unlimited potential amen the power of this word is unlimited amen hallelujah but it takes an ignition and i'm not saying you're not ignited hallelujah but if your eyes you say lord just just draw i'm going to draw more draw more of your word through draw more of your presence through hallelujah to give more light to the world that people would see joy people would see something they actually want not a not a dry-eyed confession not a stiffer stiff and starchy stirred oh i'm a christian and prosciutto no but a joy and a love and exuberance and a fire and a passion huh and a real genuine love hallelujah shouldn't it be that way amen amen he's got one firearm one end up here and the other is dipped into oil hallelujah to see the fire of god live that amen could come into this place and they could have this kind of look on their face amen hallelujah i'm so glad i came this way i was on the i was i was sinking in despair and sin but then you ca you know somehow the lord has brought you across our my path amen now i'm safely on on the gospel ship shouldn't this be our life is it worth fighting for absolutely is it worth contending for absolutely amen hallelujah we're not here to go through motions i'm just gonna clear the musicians please we just gotta wrap this up but i just wanna say don't just go through the motions don't be afraid to step out onto the battlefield amen hallelujah let's press the battle is this worth living for yes is it worth dying for yes amen hallelujah and if i could say like you know like the texans would say remember the alamo what do i remember calvary i was weeping so much when i was thinking about remember what he did for us hallelujah i was lost and undone but he won a great victory for us hallelujah took our sins now i'm gonna i'm gonna pack these away that you don't need to be encumbered by these things you don't need to be condemned by these things i'll take your judgment upon myself i'll take the wrath you should have received i'll take it for you oh i'll go in your place i'll be your sin offering yes hallelujah i'll be your scapegoat and he carried our sins that way up calvary that day and senate is done that is finished hallelujah shouldn't that be a rallying cry yes hallelujah [Music] that we'd say remember the blood remember the baptism of the holy ghost what it does how we could stand and fight for a victory hallelujah amen let's stand this morning pray just take these chopped up words in the name of jesus christ and think well i've been hurt so much no no no press press out of the bat yo press onto the battlefront i've been disappointed so much press into the battle it's worth it it's worth the sacrifice amen thank you i've been mistreated press the battle hallelujah let's can we sing that
