finished all the songs and just before I come up could you call me up I've got an item I read the text about three times and I texted him back and I said are you singing [Music] he said no I've got a different sort of an item so I'm going to call up brother Ben and he's got an item for you this morning amen yeah that's a different card of an item amen praise the Lord um you just want to all stand with me we got a very special moment we're going to have this morning amen so you just want to start playing there musicians you want to stay where you are we're going to sing a song afterwards but um and [Music] amen so brother Matthew sister Priscilla approached me last week saying they want to renew their wedding vows it's been 20 years praise the Lord and you just want to come stand here we'll just I wish we had more room do you want to stand side by side you know amen I got a few words to say um first you know this is a very special day amen and you know I was I was thinking about before we go to the vows I mean who loves the milm family you know I just marvel it's like when you guys move down here it's like hand on glove you just kind of just slot it in it's just family it's a beautiful thing yeah brother Ram says in kinsman redeemer he said hatred had a beginning and so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end but love never did begin and it never will end see it's Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever sep at them because they're from eternity and they stepped out into space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time and then it goes back right up into eternity again it cannot perish and when I read that where where brother says death nor nothing else can ever separate them I thought of you know the Apostle Paul would say in Romans 8 and we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God before us who can be against us hallelujah he that se spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us amen I just love this this why I started way up there instead of you know from what I'm about to read who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril sword for it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that's what I read he said death or nothing will separate them I thought yeah the Apostle Paul said nothing can separate a real love Hallelujah so amen so I'm going to I'm going to I'll hold the microphone Shalla you just want to come hold hands this is a special time you know we know you did this 20 years ago but you can look back and say we've come this far we're going to go all the way yes Hallelujah so brother Matthew you want to repeat after me yes um 20 years ago

that same inspiration that fell on the Apostle Paul same inspiration that fell on John on the aisle of Patmos Lord may you that inspiration fall on us today Lord both speaker and hearer my Lord L dear

take the service under your great control For Your Glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you musicians thank you brother Isaac amen thank you everyone yeah I it was it was a surprise that's why I thought well how can I make it a surprise and say well I've got an item now that's a surprise anyway but God bless you brother Matthew sister Priscilla amen um I sound a lot worse than I feel I feel actually fine I've got a few frogs but you know so if I start croaking up I'll just start sipping water and we'll be okay but um I got tested for Co and it's negative so don't worry I don't have that you know but you anyway so amen I I I have a slideshow here um got a couple of scripture readings here if we want to go to Luke chapter 22 then we're going to go to Ephesians chapter 2 um I want to follow him behind what Brother Andy was preaching on on Wednesday these things I didn't get to last um Sunday or whenever but you know I love it how he said we can never be two free I like that statement we can never be two free so I want I pray we just go in behind that and you know hit the devil for a six all those who know Cricket Luke 22:31 and the Lord said we're going to get through this and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen the Brethren amen uh so basically the devil had plans for um for um Simon's life but then God had plans and God canceled the devil's plans this is basically the Crux of my sermon today um God loves to cancel the devil's plans amen Ephesians 2 and 1 and you have he quickened who were dead and trespassed and sins ACC uh wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we had all our conversation in times past so we live the same way they did and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we by Nature the children of Wrath even as others aren't you glad he changed your nature amen amen but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know I love it when people make you sit in a place he's made us to sit there amen hallelujah amen but in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by Grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning now we've been I think last Sunday we're looking into Joshua and and how Joshua we understand the Book of Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians where the book of Ephesians the Apostle Paul would tell the church their position in Christ he would he would tell them the armor that they have he' tell them what the Lord has done for them and and it's the same with Joshua the Book of Joshua we we we have been taught that um the Book of Joshua is where where what the word that was given to Moses now Moses could never take the could never take the children of Israel into the land because he represented the law but Grace had to place them in the land and and so Joshua is now the tribes being positioned in their in their part of the land just like we are put into our part of the body of Christ so they are put in the promised land now I just want you just to maybe just go back in your mind when you when you think about the Book of Joshua You Know The Enemy did not quit did not leave the land just because they took Jericho right he didn't you know they didn't just they didn't just leave they didn't just all leave AI they didn't leave any other part of the land just because Israel was taking more of the land but they were still fortified they still had their troops and basically the devil was saying when he built Jericho he says he's basically saying to God your children aren't coming in here and then they took Jericho and then no doubt the devil would say no you're not taking Ai and you're not taking this place you're not taking this place but Joshua was anointed he was he was commissioned that they would take the entire promised land it's the same thing with us we come in but the devil says you may have this spot but you're not going to have the spot so you may be justified but you're not going to get Sanctified then you get Sanctified oh okay so you may get sanify but you're not going to get filled with the Holy Ghost then you get filled with the Holy Ghost he says well you may have the Holy Ghost but you're not going to be adopted into the body then you get adopted into the body right there's a power in the bride that's going to get her into her position in in Christ right but now but the devil's basically saying you ain't going to get it prise the Lord amen but you know we just got to kill some devils we're got to take out our Giants you know it's not a one one time thing you know there were more than just one giant to kill amen there in the days of David so it's the same thing there's you there's actually demon power is actually you know just like in heaven there's archangels there's there's other Angels there that are less powerful than archangels you know just like a hierarchy in heaven are you all following me you know just like in a natural Kingdom there's the there's say there's the Prime Minister then under there's the deputy there's the cabinet you know everyone has a hierarchy in the government right it's the same thing in heaven but then it's also the same thing in Demon power because because remember demons just Fallen Angels they had a position they had a position in heaven they had different powers different things they did when they fell they just came in a perverted form of what they had so now it's those head demon powers that we've got to take out just like David killed Goliath we're going to get there you know all right okay you know just like David killed Goliath Israel rallied and then they beat the Philistines down but it was when Goliath was taken out now that's when the rest of them who didn't have the ability to do it could rally and take out the Philistines now brother brandham he he he gives the account of when he is confronted by the maniac in Oregon now as I I'll probably come back to this as the Lord leads but um so don't read it too quick now so so so he's coming to this so so he's relaying this account of when the maniac you know I'm sure we all know the story of when the maniac comes before him on the platform in Oregon and ches and the devil is challenging the prophet of God basically saying I'm going to tear you limb from limb and and brother Tommy Osborne was in this meeting this is actually inspired him am mean to actually go back him and his wife and read the Bible again and see that Jesus Christ is alive you can hear Tommy osband give the account and so it says and these police found out that he had broken a Jawbone in a shoulder of a minister the day before and they had uh a search warrant out to get him or a warrant to get him rather right away and he was out of the insane and insane Institution he just didn't like preachers he just hit them everything so he thought then he could do it and when he run up there and how the Holy Spirit leading I know at that moment now excuse me without a vision first something said to me don't be afraid and I when he come to me I thought of what that angel said I'll be with you I thought if you if you're here which you said you'd be then what's he now this should be personal because the Lord said I'll never leave you nor forsake you so if the Lord is with us then who's this guy amen now how will this uncircumcised Philistine defy the Living God so he come up um come he come on up towards me he said I'll break every bone in your body and he drew back his fist I said because you've challenged the spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet I didn't know I said that see that was a spirit talking it done took over then hallelujah so there uh there was both challenges he run up to me and said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he drew back his great big fist like that and the audience sat Spellbound and just as he drew back his Fe fist I said Satan come out of him and he threw his hand hands back like that his eyes bulged way up like that rolled over he threw his head back and spun around uh around the floor and fell on my feet so that the police had to come and roll him off my feet uh for I could move right across the platform he was perfectly just laying there the police said is that is that man dead I said no sir said is he healed I said no he worships that Spirit see he' bring it back to him because he thinks he's right now who's heard brother B say people worship Spirits now how do they worship that spirit cuz they think it's he's right they think they're right so they can have a lust Spirit on them unforgiveness bitterness resentment whatever Spirit it may be and because they think they're entitled to feel that way then that's that them worshiping that Spirit oh yes oh yes let's just bring it on home this is what people you know don't care about God they think they're right everyone else is wrong everyone everyone's wrong them and they're the victim of everything it's a spirit they're worshiping because they think they are right so I say Lord help us that our mind is not filtered through a spirit but may it be through your holy spirit that we can see every situation according to your word and not according to how I feel about it right so it says he isn't healed um they rolled him over I said get him off my feet he was he was cramping me he laying there that big man up on my feet I couldn't move my feet out and both of them together and so I couldn't move my feet out they rolled him over I took my feet out away uh and went on to get and at that time when all them demons had seen their Chief man defeated they just be to raise up out of wheel chairs cot stretches everything El and walk that was the end of the meeting they just everyone was just healed and walked out that was it everything see now you see when Satan Was Defeated there the whole audience believed with one Accord and went out Hallelujah so what happened is the chief devil in that place got defeated then the Lesser ones cuz there a bunch of cows said well we better run boys cuz we're going to get our heads taken off too and then what happened as as as the bondage that was holding down the people in the audience there were people in that audience that beli God God right they had Faith but because that demon was there holding back that Faith right once he was cast out once he once he was defeated then people being spontaneously healed why cuz the Giant in the land got taken out Hallelujah it should be the same thing you know we shouldn't be an ice cube sitting here this is not a freezer we have a walk-in freezer you know at work and just this cold thing blows on you it's- 20° we keep our samples and things in there those who have walked in those kind of environments know what it's like you don't want to be in that kind of atmosphere too long there's no life everything's just frigid and Frozen we don't want to be a bunch of ice cubes I mean this is not an ice cube place this is a place of Life Hallelujah this is place where God should move and your reality of God should happen and Hallelujah so so once the chief one was taken out then the other ones ran tuck tail and run Hallelujah and it should be the same thing here you know you know there's demon powers trying to hold back every service you know the devil resists us when we come into the house of God he resists us when we pray he resists us when we would read our Bible you know he resists us when we want to sing and we don't sing and we just sit there and we don't we just stand there maybe we go through the motions you know we just kind of conform and see well whatever kind of read the mood of the room and just kind of conform to what everyone else is doing we shouldn't just I don't worship God I don't raise my hands cuz other people are raising their hands I don't worship and sing cuz other people are doing it no this should be something from my heart H Lord you're so good you you've redeemed me I've been washed in your blood I'm a new creature in you Hallelujah and that's why we sing that's why we praise God Amen Hallelujah yes amen so once the chief one was taken out then there was a great Liberty came into the place Hallelujah and I believe we can have the same kind of thing you say well there's no demon power holding us back I guarantee you the devil's here too you know I used to go to a Pentecostal Church before I went ever went to a Methodist Church I didn't have any trouble sitting in that place but as soon as I had to go where the truth was the devil would say you should walk out a voice would actually tell me I should leave get up and walk out and I realized he now devil you get out I'm not leaving you get out I'm not going out I never had that kind of problem in the Pentecostal church and when I came to the message church I thought now I'm finally getting fed so wasn't wrong with what was being taught wasn't wrong with the people but the Devil comes and fights you in your mind to try and to try and deflect what God is trying to get across to you we should be very aware of those things Lord but our God's greater than all those things hallelujah praise the Lord so once the chief one was taken out amen then the Lesser ones ran Hallelujah now we're living in a time how God Lives Hallelujah I'm just trying to get back to where we were now as I say in the beginning the that God cancels the devil's plans now I think someone preached this overseas someplace but I can't remember but it sounded cool and when I was but not because that triggered this When I Was preparing a couple of weeks ago this you you this came on my heart but you know God told Jesus told Peter that the devil has desired to sift you as wheat so so the devil had plans for the Apostle Peter right he had plans but God canceled his plans and God had another plan for his life now I just want you to notice that God doesn't automatically just a cancel plan that nothing actually goes into motion you know God actually allows the devil just enough rope to hang himself he actually allows him to go far enough to look like a fool what happened in the days of Moses you know you know he actually allowed he actually allowed pharaoh and his army to try and chase them across an open Red Sea but it was just a death trap to pharaoh and his men it was actually making the devil look like a fool Hallelujah and that's what God actually allows the devil to go far enough and he thinks he's oh I've got them now and then God comes on the scene and the devil just looks looks like a complete fool Hallelujah so here we have you know his plans were you know go you know Satan's plans for Simon Peter just just fell apart and actually did good for Simon because he was the one who jumped out the boat walked on the water he gave the answers he was the one who was going to you know he took the sword SW he is the one who drew the sword you know they had two swords that says in the scripture but the other guy didn't draw it out maybe Simon Peter was a commander guy with both who knows but he just drew one out yeah but noas drew a sword to defend the Lord he was the one to the you know and so but he had to end up as a total failure for then God to rebuild him and use him as a spokesman there in the book of Acts so you know even the devil's plans God could just twist it around in such a way that actually works out for our good Hallelujah you know hmon had a lot of plans in the Book of Esther and God would allow his plans to go far enough just to ensure hmon would build a scaffold Hallelujah that hmon would end up being hung and and all his PL see he just looked like total full imagine imagine that feeling you've actually so you're at the feast there with the queen it's the second one you've been invited to by the way so you think oh I've really arrived you know yeah it's you the king and the Queen no one else it's the second banquet of wines that the queen actually the queen invited you to it it wasn't you trying to push yourself into the Inner Circle they just been they've just drawn you into the Inner Circle and you think finally My Day of Victory is here I built the scaffold this is how it's going to happen but imagine the feeling when the queen would begin to speak to the king and maybe they're making small talk before who knows but then the but then the atmosphere in the room gets a bit serious where the king says now why Esther why did you invite me to this Feast what's this really all about yeah and and then I don't know what hmon was thinking about that that at that time but he would have so it up real quick when she would have said oh King the life of myself and my people are in Jeopardy we're under a death sentence and he's got in his mind I'm going to kill I'm going to kill morai maybe he's already been imagining what is like him kicking up you know being hung between heavens and earth there dying maybe he's been imagining that kind of stuff and then and then he hears this come out of the Queen's mouth and she he realizes for the first moment she's a Jew and I'm the enemy of her and she's the queen imagine that feeling imagine and then and then he tries to you know the king gets so mad he storms out walks around the garden just you know how could this ever happen and she tries to petition the queen please spare me and then the but the esa made up her mind you gone down you stood against my people you're going down it should be the same thing with the devil devil you come against my family you're going down you've come against me you're going down Satan you're going to hang you're going to look like a fool as a defeated being H you you tried to work this out for for for my demise but it's going to bring your demise Hallelujah so imagine that feeling and then she doesn't she's not going to intercede for her enemy and then so and then and then the you know the you know the cloth or whatever's you know you the servant comes along puts the thing over his head cuz he's going to die that's the last thing he sees Maybe was was the queen standing there triumphant amen Hall see the the plan went long enough just to make him look like a fool God cancelled Hon's plans yes Hallelujah the three Hebrew children God canceled their plan I mean not their plans but he canceled their enemies plans you're following me this may be very Elementary we say well I'm going through a real big trial you know there's a real hardship there's everything's against me just just have faith in God lord just have faith in God God will see you through it amen hallelujah they were in their last step or they're just about to be thrown into the furnace and they're there in the furnace you know and God canceled the heat affecting them all it did was release some of the bands that they were tied in Hallelujah and he had and he had fellowship with them as the fourth man so remember trials all they really do is is is actually just burn out the ropes of hindrance that are hindering your life maybe maybe there's a resentment maybe there's just a pain or something you just put up a wall and why do you act this way and God puts you allows you to go through a furnace and you walk out of that trolley say I don't respond that way anymore Something's Happened what's happened the ropes that bound you up they just got burnt off Hallelujah then you can walk free sir so it really does you good Lord hallelujah Daniel being thrown to the Lion's Den Hallelujah remember God canceled remember God didn't God didn't keep the Hebrew children out of the fire he didn't keep Daniel out of the Lion's there he put them right in it he allowed them to to you know Daniel was there all night he had a line for a you know he had Leo the line for a cushion Hallelujah he did Hallelujah that's right Glory you know but his the devil's plans were cancelled and the and the whole process the purpose of the lion then was to get rid of Daniel's critics so it did good amen hallelujah he say well what's this got to do with me well we just read here in Ephesians that we once walked according to the prince of the power of this world the devil had plans for us yeah you know the devil when he when he made Adam and Eve fall he knew that God was a just God he knew that God was a god of his word he stood there remember the Angels were the first things created the prophet tells us so he stood there Lucifer stood there and saw God I don't know what kind of form he was in saying let there be sun moon and stars and he saw sun moon and stars materialize he saw the Earth come into its place and he saw Life begin to come upon the Earth you know so God so the devil knew that God is a god of his word so what he says happens right he didn't say let there be a sun and then there was a bowl of jelly materialized no it was a sun right or let there be a moon and it was a banana no it was the Moon it was was exactly what he said it would be it materialized so when when God would say to say to Adam and Eve do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil because the day you eat the other day you shall die he knew that God being a god of his word death would come yeah right P guilt you sin would come death would come amen so he knew well he's going to be a he's going to be a one that will punish so you know so he caused us to come in such a way that our first birth actually condemns us the nature that we're born with right so so his plan so the devil's plan for you and I was to actually cause us to be born in a fallen state that that Fallen state would cause us to go to judgment and be condemned by the things we did in the flesh amen amen that that that's the devil's plan but God cancels the devil's plan hallelujah hallelujah so so he began to cancel the devil's plan even under the blood of bulls and goats he made a propitiation even for even as Adam and Eve were walking out of the garden they were clothed in Lamb skins brother said even the blood of those Lambs was still dripping down their legs as they walking like the skin was beating against their legs as they walking out and that was a physical manifestation of a promise that the son that that the seed of the woman is going to undo going to cancel this plan permanently Hallelujah so so all the Believers Through the Ages were were living under that promise now but the thing is we know the blood of bulls and goats could never change our nature so the nature we were born with you know I just want to by the end of the service I just want you to pray by the spirit of God you'll realize you are so free you have no part of the devil the devil has no part on you there's there's such a gulf between you and Satan yeah there's such a gulf there was a gulf between you and God one day but that Gulf has been eradicated and now there's actually a Chasm you have nothing in common yeah it's amazing you know people you know ordinarily we would probably never meet on this Earth because the circles that I would be in and you know with work and stuff we you're not in those circles you know you know what I mean so we have no we' have nothing in common ordinarily right so so we wouldn't have a relationship because we had nothing in common right but because we have Christ we have all things in common but now beforehand before the Lord came our way we had a relationship with the devil we had a lot of things in common with him that's right right hatred Strife Envy lust whatever it was anything that God made just perverted and he gives it to you and the nature you have loves it that you're born with right because the devil twists our own desires so we had a lot of fellowship with them but then one day Jesus came and canceled that plan remember he lets the devil come far enough just to look like a fool you say well I've had a very dark past God wants to use that past oh yeah to shake the kingdom of Hell to shake the kingdom of Hell doesn't matter if you're just keep praying for this thing amen anyway you know our past should be such a as is actually such a we don't glorify our past now we don't glorify what we did but if someone comes along and they're struggling with the same thing you can enter into their burden and intercede for them in prayer like no one else can Hallelujah that's powerful even to be raised in church not knowing god then one day you meet him you can intercede for those who are growing up in church never known God's real but because you've made him you say Lord I've walked in their shoes before I know what it was like just to sit in church and conform and do it because your parents said it and this Pastor said it whatever said it but then one day it became real that is so powerful you can use that Amen to intercede for others Hallelujah am hallelujah it's an incredible thing he said I don't have testimony we all have a testimony you've been saved you've been saved Hallelujah you know what it's like from to reach down to his hand for you amen hallelujah hallelujah so our God now made a way to cancel the devil's plans it's incredible you think of Legion Legion didn't wake up one day in the tombs he didn't wake up one day and now he's in the tombs with a legion of devils in him you know but but he opened the door maybe by peer pressure took a little little drink begin to watch the wrong thing begin to open his mind to Spirit up you know people say well oh you're just too narrow-minded well I'll tell you being widm minded in the world didn't get me very good places they just got me in a sewage Pond basically let's be honest oh that's being open no no I'm actually open-minded now cuz my because their mind is closed off to a god living it's just on material things but now my mind is open now God is real Heaven's a place to go how a place I'm not going Hallelujah cuz I said Lord if you died if you died for me I accept it amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so now you know never let people you know the serpent came to Eve and said well you just don't know I want to show you something cool you live a sheltered little kind of life you know you just haven't seen what the world's really all about I want to tell you what it's really all about and God wanted to tell her what it was really all about but the devil always come along first and give us the Pervert way give us the wrong kind of way I don't know who I'm talking to but I'm talking to somebody you know he always say look at this oh you just so are you're boring you're lame you're a square I think they used to say that in my day you're an egg you know you got to be cool be hip be with it no no you don't those things just cause a bunch of wreckage along along life's journey I'd rather have peace in my spirit there's a lot of things unfortunately I can't erase from my memory of things I've seen and I've done you can't you can't you can't push the erase button you know you've been forgiven cuz the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from it but it's lodged in your spirit and if you could go back if I could go back you think I'd want to watch those things again no way I'd bypass it but it just some things just get thrust upon you you can't help it TR be frank about it yes sir yes sir you know things like pornography I don't use that word over the pulpit no it's real it's out there it's it's invasive whether you like it or not yes sir yes sir you know there's a style of cake now forgive me about this but you know there's a way of icing a cake called a nude cake it's just a way of icing it I thought I don't I'm not going to Google that what will you get yeah you're not just going to get what you really want to get you get all this other kind of crazy stuff right and does it yeah it just messes people up that's it not talking about the nude cake I'm talking about the the wrong kind of nude cake anyway you know but stuff just gets imprinted in your spirit and you say oh that was you know people say oh it's so cool no it's not cool I remember you know you can be fed a demon Spirit can be so upon you you can be so you you become so used to it now I've probably shared this before but you know when I was about 12 to about 15 16 I played this little tabletop game you know you paint armies and you roll dice and you cast spells and you know I used to love it but then after I meet the Lord years later I walk into a shop where it's sold I just felt a demon Spirit on the thing just walking it's like this filthy horrible Spirit but I used to live in that atmosphere I I was used to that atmosphere that was my normal that's like a fish that lives in the bottom of the ocean without any light that that's that's their normal but then if they get lifted up by a current into the sunlight they get a new normal and why would they want to go back into darkness again oh that's the same thing with you and I like why would I want to go back with that kind of stuff and live in darkness and it's the same Spirit on computer games entertainment everything amen that's not of God does it draw you closer to God or does it draw you away from God you say well if I live that kind of Life I'll have a boring life oh no oh no to live in the presence of God to know him in the power of his resurrection amen that's it's a very entertaining life Hallelujah I've never been bored once I've met him it's not boring well I don't believe that taste and see that the Lord is good you know people who normally have a negative um they have a negative attitude towards Christianity they've never ever met him that's right they just think it's some church thing and this is just a you know no it's not it's not even really about this yeah it's walking with him that's right amen hallelujah but you got to you know if you've only been in darkness I give you an invitation come up into the sunlight amen it's really awesome Amen it's really awesome Hallelujah that's it is really awesome I'm honestly I haven't been bored I've been entertained hallelujah amen no has it always been Cloud n and awesome no but that world wasn't always cloud not and awesome you know this actually helps me cope with reality I don't have to make Homebrew no more I don't have to bury myself in a computer game no more I don't have to watch movies no more or some you know people binge watching you know um seasons of of of well it's on Netflix now but we used to call them TV shows Once Upon a Time you know I used to do that kind of thing but it's not reality you just get bored and you get so engrossed by the stuff and you know and you walk out of it at the end of the day it's like well what did that do for me I used to read I used to read books by um you know who's okay well I read a lot of things but you know I used to read books by this guy Terry pratchet I think you pronounced it you know the disc World Series who's heard of those oh God bless you all but you know but you read them and it's entertaining and funny because he's quite witty and but you read it and then you get to the end it's like well that was a waste of time and then you read another one you get gross again and you get the same feeling at the end and if we're honest a lot of stuff is like that there's just a void there's no satisfying portion Hallelujah but when you meet Jesus Hallelujah it is a satisfying portion you say I just need this to cope with my life he'll help you cope with your life you know we have tools we have tools available that the world knows nothing about I love David if we don't get to this well forgive me we'll we'll get there one day where are we I'm glad you're a patient people hey what did this go sorry I should just look on my anyway David would say in the Psalms when my heart is overwhelmed there weer no I'm very sorry there we are who's is someone driving this too I got to support Navigator here we go now he says the psalm of David hear Hear My Cry Oh God attend to my prayer from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy not everyone has this Rock to go to amen everyone's heart will get overwhelmed amen you with me we are built the same way as everyone in the world we have the same emotional realm same bodies everyone's got the same kind of equipment amen right but we have a predestinated seat on the inside of our soul but we have but because we have that we have a place of shelter and safety to go to so the Bible never ever says when you meet the Lord you'll be free from worry or you'll be free from anxiety or you'll be free from stress the Bible doesn't say any of that right you will still have those days and you'll be upset and worried about things but you have a place to go to that you can let off the pressure that you can actually find a a relief Hallelujah that the world knows nothing about they talk about you know prescription medicine now if you need those things nothing against them but you know we have a place to go to when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I what is that rock that's a rock of Revelation that you built upon amen so what does that rock tell you you're predestinated am mean you've been elected I mean you've been Blood Bought you've been Blood Washed you've been redeemed Hallelujah you are the child of God you're a son or daughter of God you know where you're going Hallelujah glory amen he is your god he he doesn't save you to lose you am mean he saves you to keep you Hallelujah and he's not going to drop you just before a body changes is going to take you all the way through hallelujah amen so we have tools we have we have a place who's ever felt overwhelmed if I who didn't put their hand up I need to ask you after the service how you how do you stay in that kind of state amen but God knew that we would feel overwhelmed he doesn't hold us again he doesn't hold it against us because we do he understands human Frailty he was a man himself yeah I Marvel I look at our little boy I said Jesus was this age hallelujah amen this is a kind of a jumpy round kind of service well we'll get there but we're going to take out Giants right amen we can never be too free be good if we had that plasted somewhere on the church somewhere you can never be too free amen so so why stay in the darkness when you can walk in the light I've never been bored being a Christian Hallelujah so now God had a plan the devil had a plan I can't blink this thing I've got to just move it so the devil's plan was to keep us under the anointing of himself and live according to our first nature and the Deeds Done In the Flesh would take us to judgment and God was righteous would be righteous to judge us and find us condemned but God rich in Mercy canceled that Devil's plan Hallelujah and then that's why he became a man am mean to take our place on Calvary Hallelujah to redeem us to purchase our Salvation when we could not when we could not save ourselves I couldn't save any of you I couldn't I there's nothing I could physically do in my own Humanity that could get you to heaven it's impossible doesn't matter how good I am smart I am how much Charisma I might have or sway or whatever there's nothing I can do true it's only God that can do it Hallelujah and it's the same thing so he came and he cancelled he came and cancelled the devil's plan by by Dying In the Flesh for us redeeming Us by his own blood and then the life that was in his blood was now released into the church that was actually changed their nature now I just want to go you know the reason I want to go through these things is is I was I was thinking about John's John's response when the lamb took the book now John wept much he wept much I'm not going to read it word for word but he was weeping when he found no man was worthy to to do the second part of redemption sure Angels were worthy but but but they weren't people a man a man lost the book in the beginning so man had to claim the book back Adam lost a title deed to the Earth so a man had to come and claim it back he saw no man was found worthy but then Jesus stepped forth the root of David stepped forth he has prevailed to open the book and loose the seals and when he looked he behold amen this lamb stepped forth this was this lamb that this was the lamb that would that would he would he would rest on his bosom when he was in his Earthly pilgrimage this was the lamb that would speak to the wind and wind and seas and say peace be still this is the one that spoke Lazarus out of the Grave you I heard brother Dwayne Lawson preach a service and he said you know he said it's never too late amen Lazarus was 4 days in the grave dead but it wasn't too late for Lazarus Hallelujah Martha maybe thought it was too late but it wasn't too late for Lazarus am mean Lazarus came forth sometimes we think well it's could be too late for someone it wasn't too late for Lazarus so it's not too late for them Hallelujah so so this was the lamb that he saw raised Lazarus out of the Grave this is the Lamb he saw die on Calvary this is the Lamb he saw go his body put into the tomb this is the Lamb he saw that rose out of the Tomb Hallelujah you know we were reading we you know we're reading through the we're reading through the Bible as a family at night we pray and we've got to Revelations chapter 1 well we started at Matthew we just going through the New Testament we're going to do the old you know and it so gripped me here is the Alpha and Omega appears there's the lamb that that you know that John saw but now he's in his glorified form Supreme deity head wide as wool he comes to John and it so moved me that same one that came to you know John on Patmos is the same God that came to me came to you and I that same God hallelujah and I just prayed Lord the inspiration that the scripture was written in May that same inspiration fall on us cuz that's what we need for it to be fulfilled I me the same inspiration that fell on Isaiah a virgin shall conceive that same inspiration fell on Mary to fulfill that prophecy Hallelujah and I pray the same inspiration where where the Apostle Paul would write amen that there's a there's a there's a church there's a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Hallelujah I pray that inspiration would fall upon us where we would realize that we're that we are without blemish without or wrinkle or any such thing because the blood of the Lamb is so thoroughly washed us thoroughly cleansed us Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so now here he is and he sees the lamb step forth and he takes the book out of the hand of you the one who sat upon the throne and then they begin to sing a new song so what is John about to experience he's about to experiencing he's about to experience the third pull the third pull is the opening of the word and I've got a quote to who support that so this is his response to the word opening hallelujah amen and so they begin to sing a new song thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and just from reading that I'd say this should be our response when you see the lamb take the book for you when he opens the word to you this should be your response it's not to elevate a Doctrine right it's not to elevate even a prophet it's to elevate the lamb am how remember the message people have said we need to get back to the Bible I say we've always been in the Bible this message you it doveet tales with the Scripture it shows us Christ in the scripture right so we don't need to get back to the Bible we've always been in the Bible Well I need an example how we how we baptized we're baptized according to the scripture amen right amen hallelujah yes sir what about the godhead we believe it according to the scripture what about how we dress we dress according to the scripture how we treat one another we do it according to the scripture Hallelujah we anoint the sick with oil according to the scripture we pray for them according to the scripture lay hands upon the sick they shall get well according to the scripture amen hallelujah we treat one another according to the scripture amen so we've been in the Bible the whole time Hallelujah cuz the message the you know the prophet never downplayed the Bible he says this is my absolute amen he magnified the word of God his desire was that the word would be what people live by Hallelujah yes yes so now when John sees this happen he begins to rejoice and behold and then they heard and every creature in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth heard me saying and in the sea blessed and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever so when he saw the book and I was so blessed when you singing that song brother Isaac I thought that's just you know we don't plan these things you know other churches other churches lay out this is what we're going to teach for the next six months they actually have a we're going to have a theme this year it's everything just oh ties in so well well of course cuz they plan it we don't have a theme hallelujah our theme is the Lord Jesus Christ actually but you know we don't have a specific you know we're going to do this and you know so so here was John's response with the book being taken he wasn't intellectual about it it made him Worship the Lord Jesus Christ the lamb more and more Hallelujah so when the word comes open to us what does it do makes it worship him more Hallelujah he says and the Very this is from anointed ones in the end time the very day when this messenger when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first poll he healing second Paul prophesying third the opening of the word so here was the here was John experience about to experience the opening of the word and made him worship the lamb and praise him and everything heard him do it Hallelujah yeah amen so you know we shouldn't be quiet about it we should be ourselves sure but you know personally I think I'm free to shout if I want to shout I'm free to be quiet if I want to be quiet I feel free to cry I want to cry I feel to I feel free to dance if I want to dance I'm at Liberty to do anything of those things I'm feel free not to do anything I'm at Liberty to do all those things I'm not oh I don't feel Liberty to do this or this I got Li I feel I have Liberty to do all those things amen and this is I believe we should have we should feel Liberty to worship God how we feel to worship God Amen Let our amens be Y and Amen Let It Be True amen hallelujah amen now you say well is there really a lot to worship about we have a lot to praise the Lord about you think about you know in Luther's day he he would teach that the just shall live by faith and that's as far as the people high as the people could live now when he would teach that he would say that they are forgiven right they justified by their faith they are righteous they're forgiven because they believe but now but in this day when the book came open justification had a far greater meaning right it would mean that we never did it in the first place that's right amen so it's more than just being forgiven for something it's actually no no no you never did it in the first place so the evidence the actual thing that you did doesn't even exist in the mind of God hallelujah you think about never doing it in the first place now well what was the first place the first place was in God's mind so how he thought about you before the foundation of the world am me was rejoicing Made In His Image worshiping him Hallelujah that's why he would ask job job where were you when I laid the foundations of the world and the sons of God Morning Star you know shouted for joy and he was trying to get job to say job you're in this trial you don't understand what's going on but where were you before this happened Hallelujah he say well I'm in this real dark place right now where were you before that happened Hallelujah where were you what is this message trying to get us to to see you're from God and you go back to him Hallelujah that's why you respond to the word the way you do because you come from the word you are the word right and you're going back L Jesus Hallelujah so it makes us look at life a whole different kind of way Hallelujah he says I've always preached that he was deity not just a man he was God manifested In the Flesh God the attribute of god of love the great attributes that come down displayed here on Earth of God Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in he was the fullness of the god here bodily what God was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood and notice not only is his bride washed forgiven but she is Justified see did you ever try the word Justified to see what it means for now for instance if brother green heard that I had been drinking I had been doing bad things then he found out that I didn't do it then he come and say I forgive you brother Bram forgive me I never done it what are you forgiving me about see but if I'm just guilty then I can be forgiven but I'm still um but I'm still not just because I did it but the word Justified is though you never done it at all Justified and when the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from sin till it's put in the book of God's forgetfulness he's the only one that can do it it we can't we can forgive but not forget I could forgive you but I always remember You' done evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sinned in the first place why she was foreordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuously she has no no sin on her at all he says therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout this is from the Rapture say it's like you never done you've never done it in the first place Lord so why do we let our guilt of our past Hold Us Down if it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness if God doesn't even remember it why should we allow it to be held against us remember this walk with God is not you the devil and God true right the devil has no part in God's covenant with you even in the Old Testament where it speaks about the scapegoat you know how there are two goats the blood of one be put on the other or be taken out to the Wilderness rather all the sins of the people would be put upon that goat and be sent into the Wilderness that wasn't the devil because otherwise the devil were have part in Redemption that scapegoat was actually Jesus where did he take your sins down into hell to be torn apart right just like a goat that went out into the Wilderness you know there were wild animals there things that could you know kill it eat it up but the sins of the people went upon that goat and he carried them away who carried our sins away not Satan jesus carried living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified me freely forever one day he's coming oh glorious day so he is our scapegoat the devil has no part in Redemption that's right Hallelujah Jesus is our scapegoat amen so there is nothing so so that's why I say the devil has no part in our relationship with God he's not even in the you know he's not even in the picture he tries to push himself in he said hold on this is not a three-way thing this is me and my this is me and my Lord and what he says about me is all that matters it's not what the devil says about me he's called the accuser of the Brethren and what does that mean he's going to accuse the Brethren yeah he's going to go before God and say they did this and they chatter chatter chatter chatter away like a chipmunk but then God is actually going to say hold on boys get the record books out amen you know sometimes you really just got to tell the devil to I'll say hold on I've got the Talking Stick I never gave you the Talking Stick so stop talking who's had to do that in their family let's have a talking thing I'm holding it I can talk now he wants to grab it off you know hold on Hallelujah amen you know you say Satan shut up basically let's get the record book let's let's get the record book out now let's start talking about you you want to put it on me let's put it on you so Satan let's turn to the Book of Ezekiel do you like that book no I hate that book let's find where it says in Ezekiel now I put myself on the spot but let's try and find in Ezekiel where it talks about you anointed cherub that cover let's go let's go there somewhere let's open this up if we can't find this one we're going to go to Isaiah 14 now if I can even find Ezekiel and I have tabs help me someone oh I'm looking for Ezra that's not what I want 284 there we go Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover here we go Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover let's talk about the devil because he loves to talk about you and your faults yeah but remember he doesn't have a blood to fix his faults all right Glory he's got nothing to mend him it's like something's broken you know sometimes the little girls sylvanians have broken things like Daddy have you got any Superglue to fix it sometimes I have sometimes I don't if I don't have the superglue it ain't getting fixed but if I got the superglue it's going to get fixed right and it's like the devil ain't got no superglue he's got no blood if I can use a real kind of silly illustration but he's got no blood to fix his Brokenness fixes you know bad points but we do now Ezekiel 28 and he says here in 14 Thou Art the anointed let's go from 13 thou has been in the Eden um been in Eden the Garden of God every precious Stone was thy covering the Sardis topaz and the diamond the barrel the ANS and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover and I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee Oh Satan you've got iniquity you are you've got iniquity remember hey we're reading through the record now okay let's see what else you have by the multitude of thy merchandise thou has filled uh they have filled thee with violence she full of iniquity and you're a violent person you got an anger problem all right you got a temper problem and th has sinned oh boy yes oh youve youve sinned devil therefore I will cast thee as a profane out of the Mountain of God okay so devil my God thinks you're a pro he says you're a profane thing he's going to cast you out and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherb from the midst of the stones of fire GL thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty so now you've got Pride remember he points out oh you did this and you thought this and you've got this and this is this and well you say well devil the record tells me you've got iniquity you're violent you're lifted up in Pride amen thou was corrupted thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness oh see see it's all about him see people who are inward looking it's not good don't be fixed on you be fixed on him amen you know the devil wants us to just look at ourselves and our own problems this is what's going on no no never look at that look at him because looking at ourselves won't it doesn't help none thou Hast defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities Al so now there's more than he's got heaps of it but um by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I will bring forth a fire from the midst of the it shall devour thee and I'll bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee so the devil's a piece of work e he's got a lot of problems why are you preaching this way because you got to turn the tables on the devil the devil's all the one all the one firing the firing the arrows this is what's wrong with this person this is what you've done this is what's going on here look at what look at you and you think you're a Christian and this is this and this and this and he said hold on I'm reading about you devil here and we can go to um Isaiah 14 but we won't okay but now that is that is what the devil can I have my slideshow back now but so it's good to remind the devil actually this is what's in your heart devil he saidwell what about me because the devil saidwell well hold on what about you now the B okay let's just start here this is what the record says about me for he hath made him to be sin for us who's that Jesus who knew no sin that we might be the righteousness of God in him Hallelujah so he became sin for me and everyone loves that amen but to believe the first part you must believe the second part so if he became sin for me here's my sin offering Glory he didn't know no s he he knew no sin but he became my sin offering that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Hallelujah so if he was my sin offering which he was then therefore he has made me to be the righteous of God in him so I can stand here and say based on that I am righteous as God is righteous there should have been a big resounding hallelujah thank you Jesus you said oh that's being proud no no this is this is what the Lord's saying actually this is the purpose that Jesus came and died for me that I become as righteous as he is righteous hallelujah amen now if we go here this is in the message Perfection Christine sh this quote with me I thought this is pretty cool if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me if there is one thing that I can do that would Merit anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain no lawke keeping no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own Holiness no things that you could quit doing so I got to quit lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to the picture shows still you are lost nothing can do it joining Church's ritual ceremonies baptisms orders of the church reading of creed saying of prayers all those things would count nothing you're lost not one thing you can do in yourself for you are a sinner under condemnation and there's not one way within yourself any Creed or anything that you could do or think of of yourself that could Merit one thing in the friends of God because you are a sinner to start with you say well that's pretty harsh No actually that's good thing to know cuz if you know there's not one thing you can do for yourself then you can call out to the one that can do it all for you Hallelujah Jesus but I love this if there's anything that I can do to make myself perfect myself perfect in the sight of God then Christ did not have to die for me but he had to Die For Me amen if there is one thing that I can do that would Merit anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain that's why I Rejoice why do you rejoice in this because like brother Braham said I'd hate to get to heaven on my Visions on my preaching on any Miracles that were done in the ministry I I'd hate to try and get to heaven on any of those things I'm only wanting to get to heaven because of the blood of the Lamb am Hallelujah and that should be our heart our hearts cry I'm not trying to do anything to Merit anything in the presence of God the only way I Merit anything in the presence of God is because he provided a way that day on Calvary with a perfect lamb hallelujah hallelujah amen aren't you glad we got nothing to bring to the table it's him he he's brought everything to the table Hallelujah that's why I say Lord I can't do nothing you got to come and take me and make me your own and that's what he wants to do amen hallelujah amen you say well that kind of leaves me in a bit of a No it should we shouldn't be proud in anything we do for the lord well I do this I dress this way I no no no no it it because we know brother Braham taught us and and to me it took it it takes such a pressure off of people works as Faith expressed right because it used to be such a big weight on the people you've got to do enough to to Merit anything right are you praying enough are you reading enough are you listening enough you know and all those things are good but it shouldn't be well I've got to do an hour of this an hour of this an hour of that it should be a relationship right right it can be an hour it could be five minutes but as long as the Lord comes down and does something then you just keep walking on but it's not about metrics and and analytics you know this week you only listen to five ser the week before you did 5050 oh that's negative whatever perc you better pick up your socks boying no no no no no it's not anything it's it's not that but works as Faith Express what the prophet taught us that our works is an is an expression of our faith Hallelujah you say well then then then my Works don't show too much yeah but but Church in my opinion has made Works what they classify as Works they aren't the real works amen but works is just an expression of what you believe so Noah Noah believed the world is going to be drowned so his Works were on building an ark yes right that was his faith expressed was the ark being built remember Moses after he met the um you know the you know the burning bush then his works his faith was expressed by his Works was getting the people out of Egypt but it wasn't him that actually delivered them it was God so the same thing in our life it's not us that does these things it's not us that lives a Christian Life every day that's why the Apostle Paul said you got to Die daily it's not your it's not your nature that actually does it it's him but to Die daily you got actually yield say Lord you come and live in my life today and you be the Christian in me Hallelujah isn't that isn't that the only way to do it he's got to be the Christian so we're got to get this weight to me this is a devil that sits on people you're not doing enough how are you ever going to be Rapture Ready if you don't do enough no it's what he does but it's what I give myself too I just give myself to him and he gets me ready you following me you know he we are his workmanship right if I try and subcontract any of me getting Rapture Ready off God then he died in vain that's right amen oh but this is a big project and he says I know it's a big project no no you don't understand this is a big project I was born in this project oh boy yeah he knows that amen he doesn't need us to put our 5 cents in otherwise it'll become a leaky home and you know you know how those things end up rotten and moldy right but if he just does the work Hallelujah everyone's kind of real quiet today we're going to let him you know just yield let the Holy Ghost move let him liveen let him have his way Lord so I saying works is Faith expressed now even Jesus was asked when when he is telling them you know the only reason you've come to see me is because you got a free lunch and then he begins to tell them labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that which meat which endureth from unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sent uh sealed rather you know brother BR makes a statement I don't have it I don't have it on my slides but he says you know I could go hunting and fishing for the rest of my life life and I'd still be there he actually says that he actually says that whether you'd say well well why didn't he just do that because when the Lord comes into someone's life it's never about them and what they can get out of anything it's always Lord for other people amen maybe we'll just remind me John 6 now Jesus would okay I I was going to throw sit here before I get there you know I think my girls were asking about this you know but I have so many things I want to do now when the Lord meets someone he doesn't automattic like like we all have desires if you're not married to get married if you don't have children to have children right if you have children you want to have grandchildren one day if you don't own a house it' be nice to own a house you want to go on holiday you know we have all these plans these things we'd like to do right cuz it says there are many devices in a man's heart right but when when when God meets someone he doesn't automatically just like kill off all those desires that now you just want to be a monk right he doesn't do that but he puts all those things in Balance but then people begin to be like like children that you know when you're yay big you don't necessarily think about getting married and having children in your career but when you go into a teenage then that world opens up to you you're like well what am I going to study am am I going to go to UNI or and what am I going to study am I going to do a trade or you know what am I going to do and then who am I going to marry then so there's all these all these things that are in someone begin to come out then they get confused but I love the Lord but I have a desire to do this and you know what but we got to understand there's many many devices many things in our hearts right I think I I believe I have the I believe I have the definition for that now this word device it means an intention or a plan a purpose or a thought right there's many thoughts or intentions or plans in our hearts nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand so it's not it doesn't mean you're not a Believer if you have a desire to to go study something and that's pulling you that way but then the Lord you know you know the Lord's calling you this way or you want to get married that's a natural thing who's who's following me you know all those it's normal God doesn't just kill those things off just because you meet them and just because you have those those desires doesn't mean you don't know him right but if you know him you'll put him first and you'll prayerfully any decision you'll make in life you say Lord now I'm not talking about decisions about well should I have toast or cereal today you know he does actually give us choices and if you stay fasting and praying about that I don't think it'd be a god-given faster of prayer God said well I gave you food just just eat something that's healthy you know but he actually God God doesn't make us robots yeah you know who's who's thinking ever just shut down because they got the Holy Ghost no one's you know he actually because remember God wants to give us he wants to place us as Sons and Daughters of God that what we say and what we do and our intentions are exactly the same as what he would say and do in his intentions right just like brother Aram would say about the son being adopted into the family the father was told by the chudah he's he talks like you he he reacts the same way as you do you know the the decisions he he makes you would have made the same decision and now the father says my boy's ready and he gets adopted that his name his name or his his signature on the check is as good as the father's because the father his heart is in the son his mind is in the sun Hallelujah that's right so now the son doesn't have to go to the father father what should I do today no no no the father says the son son you know what to do because you got my mind you got my heart you've been raised Dr you've been cheed right you know exactly what to do with my word amen so you know but we should prayerfully things in life say Lord is this the way that I should take hallelujah amen now we'll go back to John 6 so they ask him what shall we do that we might work the works of God see cuz people say I need to I need the work I got to show my faith faith is no works is Faith expressed I've got to show my faith by my work so what kind of works do I do to youo show my faith you following me that's what people ask because am I doing enough are my Works enough are they are they the right kind of works are they or am I too slothful you know and so they ask him what's our work what shall we do that we might work the work of God and Jesus answered said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on whom he hath sent this is actually now you want to do you want to know the works you're going to do believe on him who he has sent Hallelujah but then now I want to ask the question because I asked myself the question well what does that produce because many people say I believe Jesus and you know all kinds of stuff all kinds of stuff they do don't do you know so now this is the work of God that you believe on him who he has sent so so now what does that Faith produce and John says he came unto his own and his own received him not but many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name right so the work of God is to believe on him who he has sent right and then those that he would give the power to to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so these ones that believe on his name he there's a Power released them to become the sons of God Amen so now their works are going to be the works of the sons of God are you all following me I want you because remember faith without works is dead right but but our works is actually the works produced in our life should be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost should be the word becoming flesh right so now these ones who believe on whom because basically to believe even to them believe on his name that's to believe on whom he has sent yeah this is not mental gymnastics this is just how it is right you following me so now he would give power to them to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so now last night I begin to ponder well what if I can find it here then what would sons of God do you think about this are he following me and I'm sorry time's up but you know what would sons of God do because many people say well there you know Sons and Daughters of God but but what would Sons and Daughters of God do now the main thing the Sons and Daughters of God would do would take God at his word right believe his word accept the whole word a real child of God will not say that some of this is opinion and some of this is God's word that say this is the whole word of God right this is this is God from cover to cover even you know and the cover also you know Hallelujah you know this is God in print form the whole thing and so Son of God will actually acknowledge this is the absolute of God right and if it's that way if they acknowledge it's not opinion but it's God's word they'll say then Lord this is how I want I need my life to be governed by Your Word because if you say well that's just Paul's opinion here or that's just for that age cuz the culture and this is how it was this is why he wrote this no it's for all ages am right the Bible tells us that all scriptures inspired for Doctrine correction reproof that the man of God be fully furnished all scripture right not just some and then there's SEC well you know First Corinthians is just is really just second opinions of Paul no it's First Corinthians right it's the word of God so a Son of God or a daughter of God will believe the word of God he say well that's pretty Elementary but do you realize how powerful is actually just to have faith in the word of God and actually see it living in your life am mean the things you actually believe you see it become material not we may not have all things in possession but we're going to get all things in our possession right we may not have it all but we're going to have it all Hall just like Joshua going into the promised land they had a lot of places to take but they did take them hallelujah amen so now so then what would sons of God do well the first thing is they would they would receive and believe the word and then they would become that word maybe we'll come this maybe we'll approach this another time but see Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it came come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word now I just want to say this everything you receive you will become yeah yes yes I wanted to be a cricket star I wanted to be Denny Morrison everyone who knows that kind of era when I was yay big that's what I wanted to be so I received that so I I started to become like that I wanted to bowl like him basically take off the umpire's head when I was coming in and you know some of us brother AR knows what I'm talking about but some are looking at me blank and you know but I received that I I received an image I said I want to become this guy and so all my everything I did I tried to become it and then even I I was growing up other things with I want to be this guy I want to be this guy so what you receive you become yes so you receive rap music you'll become a rapper you receive punk music or heavy metal music or whatever kind of music I don't know what kind of music is these days I don't care but that kind of music you'll become it you know there's spirits on different kinds of music Amen brother kaidro said you know when gangsters would go up before they kill someone they listen to rap music they get the spirit of murder on that music or or pop music is a spirit of lust right or country music's got a spirit of depression Al those spirits come upon you as a what because people receive that spirit and they become that Spirit but then if people receive the spirit of Christ they receive the word of God they will become the word of God that's why it's so important that's why it's never well I can't obtain to that it's not what you obtain to us what he has done that matters hallelujah hallelujah amen you be and we become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you my word which this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see if ye say to this mountain be moved don't doubt but believe what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive that you ask for and you shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with Hallelujah GL now I just want to finish with this point and then I'm sorry I've been I've been over but I want to finish with this point and this and Christian and I were talking about this the other day I thought this is such a powerful thing see Jesus see we go through Gardens of Gethsemane and we always normally look at the anguish of the decision but never what the decision could produce so Jesus we think of you know Jesus he's in the garden he's praying not my will but thy will be done and drops of blood like sweat are falling off his head and you know great anguish and he surrendered his will to the will of the father but do you know without that we wouldn't have eternal life you think of the victory when he laid aside himself and actually took the father's will above his own human will he won salvation for the whole world right so often we think oh I've got to give this up or I have to stop doing this and God's dealing with me to quit this and listening to this and quit this podcast and quit this Netflix and quit all this stuff do you know the do you know the power of what could happen if you give those things up do you know what God would actually fill that space and what victories would be one for other people if you actually give those things up Lord so you say well this is an extreme case yeah but you know you could have the same he won the victory for you and I right there hallelujah amen because he said not my will but thy will be done but what if he held on to his Humanity he said actually I like my disciples I don't want to die I don't want to go through this well where would we be we would be men and women most miserable and the devil would have it all but he actually decided he won because he put us before himself he won the victory for others and that's why you got to look you know the devil wants you to look at this little world that you can create and live in this little thing and oh it's too much to give up but in reality if you give it up what kind of Victory can be won not just for yourself but for everyone else around you Hallelujah amen you think about a church that's fully sold out to God fully sold out God just moves in the mid Sanctified life that's dedicated to God and God just lives through that person the kind of atmosphere that's around that person the victories that happen because you know because God living in that person's life what if they decided actually no no I don't want to live that kind of life you think about any one of us who actually decided in the past actually no no no I'm not going to walk with god what would be missing in this church what victories would not have been won because one of us decided Well no I'm actually no I don't want to live that kind of life or maybe I'll be wishy-washy and maybe this but you know what if what if any one of us didn't make that decision this church wouldn't be what it is amen Camp wouldn't have been what it was the services we have wouldn't be what they are amen you you see the ramifications of our choice because it's not it's not about us we say well I'm going through it yeah but it's actually for others think of the ripple effect think of the ripple effect of just these words not my will father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done think of the Ripple effects of just those words of that decision Jesus would say and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so he says for for thy for their sakes not for my sake for their sakes Lord I sanctify myself remember Jesus he could have got married he could have had children he could have done all kinds of things but he said I'm going to sanctify my I'm going to live this kind of life I'm going to Forfeit my right to do those things that they would be Sanctified you know we can get in such a little world that we just look at our own four walls of our own little life and we forget the effect that we have on other people both positive and negative what if we just had a purpose Lord I want to live a kind of a life that would just be for the positive hallelujah amen isn't that a powerful thing I think amen what's that got to do with taking out Giants what if David didn't decide to take off Goliath's head that's right yeah oh yeah wouldn't have what we have you know okay forgive me but we're got to make way for Liberty you know when they when the austrians we'll just leave this you know there's a story from Switzerland you know when the austrians had had the had the Swiss up against the wall and they decided the Swiss were going to you know you the Swiss decided they were going to fight and Arnold Von winkl who was the hero hero of the day said boys just follow me I'm going to find the thickest part of their Spears and just follow follow me and fight with what you got those just a bunch of farmers he was telling those austrians he cried out in his native language Make Way for Liberty Make Way for Liberty and basically was saying get out of the way for Liberty Liberty is coming through Hallelujah and he gave his life that a breach would be made in the walls of the Austrian Spears and the Swiss won the day because of his decision and this is how now that's just a man fighting for a natural country right how much more Supernatural people who are fighting earnestly tending for the faith that was once deliver to the Saints am mean shouldn't there be if there's anything that comes in our way some kind of cold Spirit comes Upon Us indifference unforgiveness can't just a formality comes upon us we should just declare get out of the way for Liberty you're going to get steamroll devil if you stay in my way cuz Liberty's coming through Hallelujah that's how it should be shouldn't it we should have such a dedication Make Way for Liberty as get out of the way cuz Liberty's coming through hallelujah hallelujah that's how we should should be you know indifference comes in the family some kind of trouble Make Way for Liberty hallel there there's no peace in the home Make Way for Liberty Hallelujah cuz we want peace in our home don't we and we want God to move don't we we have to live and anoint our prayers and change our lives and Shake our lives and living us and Who Make Way for Liberty oh yes Hallelujah some of us some of you look at me like this is man just ranting away but we should have

Let's uh I just want to sing when he reached down his hand for me I'm so glad he canceled the devil's plans hallelujah amen brother Isaac when he reach down his hand for me when he reach down his hand for [Music] me I was lost and undone without God for his son when he reach down his for when he reach down his head [Music] for when he reach down his hand for me [Music] I was lost and undone God his when he down his verse one my soul was a from [Music] that me I could but myor in love gave me peace from above his head for me when he reached down his head for [Music] me when he reach down his hand

for me [Music] I was lost and undone without God for his when he R down his hallu bless [Music] when I left home I didn't know that I was going to give a testimony but as we were singing the song that says I'm no longer a slave to fear for quite some time now that song has been so meaningful to me and as was singing something kept on say you know what there might still be someone who is a slave to fear won't you just share how you overcame amen but I felt you know what my testimony has got a lot of things that might not sit well with others how do you give a testimony where you're talking about seeing demons how how do you give testimony that has got witchcraft in it where you overcame then I'm like no I cannot actually my my my my my first option was maybe when I stand there I'll ask the brothers to just switch off and not be online then I'm like but what if the person who needs to hear this is actually online then I realized that it's fear again trying to creep in reasoning then when the pastor is preaching he's talking about demons he's talking about killing the Giants he's talking about faith right then I was like well I didn't know that he was going to preach about those things which is some of the things that I wanted to testify overcoming so it is okay let me talk you see as a child grow growing up I grew up in a Christian family my mom was a prayer Warrior who always prayed for me and as a child you go to church with your mom you don't really see how much fight is going on in the spirit I remember one morning I was I think six she called me just before I went out going to school she said to me I had a dream as she you get out of this gate as you walk someone from that family is going to quickly come out with with an orange to give you don't take it if you take it you're dead and being me I always listen to my mom as I walked out someone came running with an orange what made me to even believe my mom mom was more was that he was holding an orange like this but the finger was inside the orange and he tried to give it to me I said no thanks he said my mom said I must give you I said no my mom said I mustn't take it then he threw it down opened it fill scent in it put it upside down stamped on it so that no one can take it and the others were asking him how can you do that such a waste then he said no my mom said I must give it to him I mean to her and if no one takes it no one must eat it then when I came back I told my mom she couldn't stop praising God because that was only a way of protecting me that was a protection from God then you grow up your mom praying for you you just think being a Christian is just a very easy thing nothing much happened then my mom passed on when I was 25 by then I had my own family still while I was married while I was an adult she was still praying for me I lived through her prayers now I am there alone I still carry on with my life the way I Carri it on I'm a Christian but a very Shon then you start hitting things that's when you realize that demons actually do exist there were times where I would be lyed down on my bed I would literally be in a state where I'm not fast asleep I'm not awake then I see the demons coming in you're praying but your prayer does not have that it it's not backed up by faith you are praying with fear so you cannot overcome when you've got fear and I Liv alive where at some point I would say you know what devil I know this is you point number one and I know you cannot do anything to my soul so you know what go ahead do what you want to do I'm just going to turn and sleep literally I would do that and I would hear this thing coming and sitting on my back and just relaxing and I would be like if that's what you want to do go ahead but later in life when I look I realize that you know what sometimes we walk with diseases we let them control Our Lives we become moody people we let those moods control Our Lives we walk with all kinds of things that the devil brings to us we just accept them and said this is me this is a way of life no that is being a shallow Christian amen you don't do that you need to learn to be an overcomer so at some point it came to a realization that no you cannot carry on like this you cannot live a life where you know that when I go to sleep whether it's during the day or whether it's at night the demons are going to attack and then either I'm going to pray and they'll go or I'll try to pray then they don't go then I just give up and sleep then I said Lord you are the one who created everything that means even the demons you created yes and they've got more experience than I do they've been there for more than 2,000 years I was not there so as I'm going to sleep I'm going to pray that you come and fight for me because on my own I cannot do it that's when I started living a life of an overcome realizing that on my own I cannot do it but my God can come and surround the yarden my God can come time and be in each and every room amen and protect each and every one of us but the devil does not give up then all those demonic attacks stopped because now I commit everything to him and say Lord just come because I know well you know if you you you've tried your best to live a Christian Life he's not going to come and let you think about going to a bar because that one you've passed already he's not going to try and let you think about cigarettes you don't even know how to smoke a cigarette he's going to come on another level so that's why he was just trying to torment me but then seeing that now that was overcome he would try and bring maybe a disease or something so 2018 just before we came here I went for an OP so that solved all the problem that were there it's fine but then about two or 3 weeks ago I was supposed to wake up I was working at home and then suddenly I couldn't walk I couldn't turn that way or that way or move out of bed then we are human beings you forget that this is an attack you think I am sick I laid down there I said I'm sick everyone is getting up trying to get ready to go to school and all that then something said no you are not sick you are being attacked by the devil then I said Lord you are the Creator and you created me and the pain that I'm feeling is from an OP that happened two years ago is when you check medically they'll tell you when the nerves get operated on they can then try and later send messages to the brain that say I'm mean pain then the pain is ex exaggerated but that's medical terms but here I'm seeing the devil trying to attack now now God you created me you created the devil now devil my God is greater than you won't you please just pack your BS and go and I stood up I thought I was dreaming there was not a single pain took the first step I could walk second step I could walk I went and brushed my teeth when I got to the kitchen my husband is like how are you feeling he's like I'm I'm saying to him no I'm fine he's looking at me I said I'm fine said but I left you in pain I said the devil just left then a few days later I can't remember it was a headache that was trying to come I said no the same way that you left a few days ago just pick and go because my God has created you and this is not your territory am try elsewhere then I realized that you know what there might be someone who needs an upliftment who needs an encouragement that you know what as Christians let's live an overcoming life and that can only be through faith not fear hence I'm saying I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer as Slave To [Music] Fear I am a child of God I am no longer I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I am I'm no longer I'm no longer a slave to [Music] Fe I am a child of God thank
