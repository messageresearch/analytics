in the atmosphere where you are lord we we're our hearts are comforted lord because we feel like we're at home lord we're where we're supposed to be when we're in your presence lord jesus and we just thank you so much lord for the great price that you paid for us to be here this evening lord this didn't come easy this wasn't free lord this was free for us but it wasn't free for you and we thank you lord that you paid the price for us lord that we could have all things lord and that you've freely given us all things lord so we just thank you so much for this opportunity that we have this evening there could be many things that we could be doing and there's there are many things on offer lord but there's something in each one of our hearts that says i want to be serving god and i want to be in in fellowship with him and with the brethren serving god lord and i just thank you lord that in spite of everything that the enemy has to try and tantalize us with and distract us with lord there are still those that say i don't want that i want the living god lord and i thank you that we're amongst those victorious brethren this evening lord and that everyone that you get get a hold of no matter who they are no matter what they feel like they are they are victorious overcomers that's that's who we are in you lord and that's who you make you don't make sissies lord you don't make weaklings lord but you make strong sons and daughters lord and everybody is a strong son and daughter of you everyone that comes to you or that's what you make lord you don't leave anyone behind so we just thank you for that promise lord and i just pray your blessed service this evening lord in jesus wonderful name amen amen praise lord you can actually um you can take your seats because i i don't have an opening scripture i don't want to seem like i'm not spiritual but i have lots of scriptures i just don't have an opening one you know sometimes we do it just because you think we have to do it but we'll get to the scriptures eventually because you know we can say a lot of things but what we say could mean nothing it usually is but when we when what we say is is based on the word of god or is is the word of god then it's value you know it's eternal thank you musicians thank you davo good [Applause] i was um i told him i might share a little testimony before i start um and i said i don't know whether i'll do it or not but i will so i was standing about over here maybe six months ago when were you down south jenny when were you in christchurch a year ago wow was it oh well okay so so it was a year ago you know um david wasn't quite doing what he was doing today a year ago and um you know you try and raise your children in the fear and abolition of the lord and and you know you do the best you can you do do what you can but there comes a point where you understand that it's all in god's hands you know we we think we're pretty good and we can do listen to all that but you get to a point where you realize you can't i can't do much you know it's only by the grace of god it's only by his grace it doesn't matter you can take every parenting technique there is and read all the books to all the stuff you know it doesn't matter you know they're all good they all help here and there yes but you know for god to meet a man that's that's god's domain not ours you know and that's what that's what we as parents believe for is that god would meet our children not not we can teach them these things and they could become this and that you know that's what we know as value you know and we and that's something we can't teach we can't put in them we you know we do the best we can i understand but that's something we lay hold on by faith i believe that and we don't let that go that's one of the things that we don't let go we say no i'm not letting that go we can do that with the promises of god you can say no i'm not letting this go there are many things in life that i've i said lord you can take this take that do whatever you want with me throw me around do anything anything so you know kick me to the curb whatever you want but i want that when it came to my children i said i'm not budging on that i don't mean to be rude but i'm not budging that's it that's like that was one thing i said lord i'm just not moving not so and um you know but the devil gets at you when things don't appear like they're going as well as what they could you know maybe their son or daughter goes a different direction you know and the devil was i remember one week he was just playing at me all the time you know you can tell when the devils when it's the devil speaking to you because it's always opposite to what the promises of god are yeah he's always saying oh i know it's not going to happen because of this it's because you did that it's all these other things and it's not going to happen and no you just give up and all that it's always the opposite to what his promises that's how you know it's the devil because if it if it doesn't say amen to a promise of god then you know it's you know where it comes from you know you don't have to listen to it even though at times it might seem very convincing and very inviting to listen to we might even be in a bit of a downer mood so we kind of feel like i just want to embrace that because you'll just go down with that you know yeah that's the what happens right let's all be honest but don't go there and so i um but but i'm not saying the fight is easy because it's not easy we can stand up here and look back and say it but at the time it's hard we're not going to say it's easy you know standing on a promise of goldman it all looks bleak is not easy you can't tell me that jonah was in the belly of a whale just having a grand old time was the greatest thing that's ever happened to me i just can't believe it well what a blessed guy i am things weren't looking too good for him in that whale's belly and he couldn't really he didn't have a lot to smile about but he said god i believe if i look to your holy temple you know then he only had faith to look to and you know that's where god often gets us in the trial is we only have faith to look to because nothing else looks like it's going to happen like hezekiah when he looked out all he saw were armies all around him the soldiers and that there was nothing good going on for him at that point in time he only had faith to look to lord you're going to deliver me so so after weeks and weeks of this that they will let you at you at you and i thought you know what i'm gonna i think i'm gonna pen a song and i'm gonna deliver him my response you know when when you i can imagine two armies coming together you know one one army is saying what they're gonna do and they send out a they send out one of them in this they're um they're messengers to go see the other army and they say um you guys need to surrender otherwise this whole army is going to wipe you out and you know you can make you have terms of here's our terms of if you surrender to us this is what we'll do for you you know they try and make you surrender you know that's what devil's trying to do just give up surrender and he's at you you know and i like those i like those stories where the leader of the other army even though they might look like a ragtag bunch the leader of the other army says uh you go and tell the guy that sent you we'll never surrender we're never going to back down and we're coming after you so peter we'll give you the chance to run where you can otherwise we're going to wipe you out there might be only 100 of them against a thousand i don't care we're coming after you you're like why these guys look crazy when they're really gonna come you know but that's what a christian does in the face of all odds you just sign up i'm like like goliath and i was coming out bring me a man bring me a man all week he was saying oh for days and days months bring me a man bring me a man and then david said okay i'm here bring it on you know and then he delivered his response back i'm gonna your head's gonna be off you you know it's like you're gonna be done that was his response you know so i thought i'll pin this similar response so that i wrote a song that night sitting up here and then i came and sang it the next day i was that one no matter what i see no matter what i hear no matter what i feel i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah on the altar and if i look and it seems like it's over hallelujah on the altar because he's a miracle working god you know and and i that you know things weren't looking good when that was pen but that's not what you look at you look at the promise it's gonna be all right he's a miracle working god i don't care how much it i don't care what it appears like so i just want to declare to you guys and confess to satan he's a miracle working god that's the god that we serve and this isn't limited this is everybody it's all the same we're all in the same terms there's there's no one that oh i can well he does it because he got this and that no no it's all the same terms we all just believe and god fulfills the same way there's no he doesn't have any little special i think i'll do it for him at all you haven't really been that good i won't do it for you it doesn't work like that we all come by faith it's the same it's exactly the same just sometimes god put some of us up we have to our ones have to play out in front of everyone you know to but maybe that's just to encourage you know to say look that's the god we believe i mean and i had hannah on the woods down there too so we had a it was good fun um okay i'm not gonna um i've got a little thought when i was trying to get something together nobody i've got to say what's this modern technology um so i just was i was wanting to talk about something quite simple tonight i just felt like i'll just do something nice and light and simple it's not really but because the things of god even though he might god may say simple things like oh so i went out to sew you know and he said just say the nazi you might appear like oh that's a children's story not actually a children's story when you think about it you could dwell on that for a long long time and the the the depth in that is phenomenal and yet he would just deliver a simple story so maybe this is one of those but um it's i but i did want to just make something quite quite simple tonight and it's i don't really even have a name for it i couldn't figure out what it was called but it's about god being a director a movie director in our lives being a director and and how god's creating something in each and when you're all part of a you're all part of a you're part of a movie you're part of god's movie god's a great movie maker and he's crafting this awesome movie that you're the star of it you like that eh and um but just to just before i before i get too carried away now the reason why i'm talking about this is because i i in the natural realm i do that so i understand movies i direct stuff but because i want to make the movie on brother brown after that i couldn't really care less you know i'm done with it but i just need to that say these few disclaimers like the trade in itself is a great trade like it's a very it's a very complex making a movie is those of us that do it to us it's just a trade you know we we do it we learn the skills we do this and that and it's a very complicated trade and it's a funny trade because people will do it directors will do it for a long time 30 40 years and still want to make another one and they've got all the money in the world they don't need to make another movie they need to make a single dollar more and you'll make another one you can't show me many people that are like a builder once the builders made his money man he's out i'm off the tools i'm done most trades right we as soon as you make enough money you're done but this is a it's such a complicated trade that there's just something about it that even though these people like the guy james we deal with you know he's he's he's a he's made movies he's one of the biggest directors in the world and he's he can sit back and do nothing the rest of his life doesn't need the work doesn't need nothing but he just he spends all this time making another movie because it's it's such a fascinating the art in itself is very complicated but it's one of those trades that's very powerful it has a very powerful aspect of it that can deliver a message so satan loves it because it's got an ability to deliver a message and he wants to deliver his message and there's only two main powerful trades as as in the world as movies and music are the two most powerful trades that that exists you talk you take someone that's a that's got the ability to make a movie i would suspect that there's going to be more demons hanging around him trying to have their little message out through him rather than someone that's i don't mean to say this this way but like you're in the front but if there's a builder he's going to try and work through a builder to get a message out it's probably going to have a reasonably hard time there isn't as much of an avenue so as a result of the power of this trade satan is all over it he's all over it like he now that doesn't mean to say everyone in the trade or evil people because there are there are many good people in there that genuinely might want to tell good stories and things but but i can assure you once they get along a bit satan is at them and he he wants to he wants that he wants that talent to use it and and and of course the more that because it's such a an ability there's an ability for that to make so much money the love of money is the root of all evil the love of money and these people that that run the movie studios have a love of money and they will just they don't care what story they tell as long as it's going to make money and so the morals and values go out the window because it's going to make us money we'll tell the story we'll tell that story that's why the new stories are anything progressive that's going to sell we'll tell that story and we'll promote that not because they believe in the story because they want to make money you see and then and then that's what that's the stories they want to make and they go out and try and find directors that want to make that because hey we've got the story we've got this money to put in it you want to make it then you make it now that movie director will just make it just because i'm getting paid he doesn't he probably doesn't care about it either in in that realm but you see the whole it's more the love of money that drives this whole thing um so i don't i'm not promoting the industry like it's a good industry because it's not on that on the whole of it it's one of the industries that satan's got hold of and that he he drives you know so i don't want to promote it like that um that's why is that a good disclaimer yeah you understand that good okay that's that's my that's that's that one right now i want to read some quotes from brother and before i and i'm just going to get into this this is brother i'm saying did you see uh cecil i don't know his last name the mills ten commandments he's saying the ten commandments the old one in the 50s 60s i guess many of you did i don't believe in going to picture shows all the stuff but i recommended to the church that anybody that if they didn't have nothing but that they wanted to see it it would be all right if they went to see it because i would not let um first some of my brethren went then they came telling me i hadn't been i hadn't been around one for many years finally i went down here when i was at this drive-in i looked at it i seen what it was i said to the church if you want to go see that it's all right there it was it was lovely beautiful so he went down and watched the ten commandments and he was taken back by what he saw he's got another quote here did you ever see cecil demille's ten commandments did you notice when the commandments was written how we caught it i didn't know there was two or three things that i seen in it i really liked first thing is that emerald light that's exactly what it looks like i thought that was quite good because he said i watched the movie then the emerald light that's what the pillar of fire looked like he said the pillar of fire that i see he looks to see so i think he actually um here's a picture of it here that he he described this scene here he said when the pillar of fire came and wrote the commandments he said and he said when it went away you see that's what it looks like when it comes in and goes out when i make the movie i'm going to use this as a reference because if brother ramsey this is what the pillar of fire looked like i'll tell the vfx guys make it look like that that's what he said it looks like man but now he also said this he said yes sir it's all moved up to us brother sister why is it in the last few years never has the movie world ever done what it's done on the screen comes the story of the ten commandments by cecil de mills on the screen comes the life of jesus christ through being here on the screen comes the life comes the big fisherman the conversion of peter and all these religious plays which the movies has refused and dirtied and thrown away but god and his mighty power blasted it forth just the same and there was a time they called it the golden age in the 60s where there was just these phenomenal movies being made massive blockbusters like and this is before vfx so these guys were building whole cities to film the stuff in um and a lot of them were these men here were doing it a lot of them were um christian based ones like um well this one here was the ten commandments and what brother brandon was saying was there was he said the the industry didn't want these because they're christian ones they were like no we don't want to make that stuff but they got made anyway and they were massive they were they were millions of dollars poured into these and they they made these and even the the brother um i think brother brown had a lot of time for cecil because he he said even before he showed this he had a viewing in his studio and he invited all the ministers around the country to go and watch this movie first the ten commandments and to critique it and let him know what they thought about it i think he genuinely wanted to promote god and through his trade of course the money takes over and now this won't have a market these days but back then and brother brown seemed to notice he said there seems to be this time where these ones are just all going forth the other one he mentioned was been her who seemed been here been her don't get me started on being her overcome being here after a while when i when she so he's in the scene i've got i've got a picture later on with the baddie you know he's in the scene and he has a run-in with us with um what's the bad guy's name masala yeah and then they they come to a disagreement on how they're going to deal with the jews in that and and masala says what's it going to be you know are you are you with me or against me and being here says if that's the only choice i have then i'm against you so that's always my response to shannon if we're at a disagreement where she wants to go to like a certain place to eat not i want to go there if that's the only choice i have then i'm against you so yeah man he's like he was a he actually he actually starred in both of these this was him there too he was massive in that time and and this was the other one brother brandon mentioned the big fisherman this was about the life of peter so there was a time in the 60s where a lot of these massive movies got made this was just something that i thought was interesting um was this one this was made by mel gibson which didn't really have much of an interest in the things of god as far as his his past history was concerned but for some reason he wanted to make this movie i think up to this point there were a lot of jesus movies but they weren't really they were made by churches they were pretty soft you know there was no they weren't really hard hitting like it would impact you it was pretty mellow stuff you know mellow little whips and that but i think he had a different vision to make it like let's tell it the way that it was i find one thing interesting about this i don't know whether it's true or not but we've got this modern thing happening today called cancel culture you know where as soon as someone uncovers something bad about even big stars oh no that guy did this he was a womanizer right let's cancel him and he's done right there there have been many many big names from the 80s and 90s that they look back and they think well that guy was a womanizer or something right let's cancel him and then he doesn't get any more work in the industry nothing he's cancelled been a good you know a lot of the times it's good because these guys were they had a when they you know when they had ability to choose they chose the wrong things and they kind of they read from what they saw and right but one person that the the the if you follow the stuff that the sort of movie world that people can't understand is why isn't mel gibson cancelled like he's done all these things but he just he's he's got this ability he just carries on he gets work he's just you can't you can't hurt him you just can't he the other guy's in the same league as some of a lot of them have been cancelled but people are this is the one person many people write about they say we don't know why but mel gibson just seems to he just has got this inability to be canceled although he should be why hasn't he been cancelled sometimes i wonder it's because he made something like this and he you know and it's like the lord said right you're gonna i'll just leave you to carry on then you can i don't know maybe maybe maybe not but but he made this movie just because he felt like he wanted to and i think it was a lot of it was on his own what money was you know his own investments in that but one one interesting thing was when he was talking to um mel when mel gibson was looking for an actor he looked to this guy jim cavazo kaveezel to play the part of jesus and but mel gibson warned me said you know if you take on this role that'll be the last you ever work in hollywood you know no one's going to want to touch you so he actually advised them off but he said no actually jim i like you're a great guy i don't want to ruin your career you know and jim said no no look i want to do this he and then he said look mal think about it my name my initials are jc and i'm 33 years old let me do this it was true so and even in that world i think this there's something sometimes in all this that god is god god does these these things so now as god is a great movie maker the first thing he needs is this first thing you need if you want to make a movie you need a good script you need a good script the problem that we have today is a lot of scripts that's so negative and down and boring you know but a good script has got a good happy ending like a story you know think of all the good stories they always have a happy ending a good story does does it you know you got a happy you don't want to you don't want to finish the story then this the good guy dies everything's bad and then you just left finishing your story and all of this you're worse off than when you came right you think of the greatest story ever told because there was a movie made of that too the greatest story of it all which was the gospel it's got a happy ending you know in all of jesus stories you've got happy endings now for the if you're on his side like you know david went out this man was coming against him but then david went out and he defeated him you know and they they won you know or or elijah there were all these men coming and then god the angels were around and then elijah was delivered or hezekiah was delivered or jesus came down and the romans they put him to death but then he rose again and now he's alive forever more you know we've got happy endings you know and that's those are the sort of stories that we're a part of you know our script of our if god's making a movie about you your script has a happy ending your script the good guy doesn't die in the end the good guy lives in the end you stay alive you you you make it through all the enemies the world around you but you make it out and you you just escape all the baddies and you make it through that's that's the sort of that's your story that's your script you know it's a and that that's the story that god has for you know this this is this is sort of what he bases his scripts on for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end that says so when when god writes us when when he's working on the script in your life he's is a happy ending all you guys have happy endings you're going to live forever you're going to make it through you're going to live forever everything's going to be all right that's your that's your story and you know we all we all have different lives we're not all the same you know yes you get all sorts of different stories like you might have a drama action story war story a political drama family you know you've got all these different as in the same way everyone is all different you know we're all now in the in the visual world people like to see something with a bit of action they always marvel like they have these silly um police programs where they follow police around that arrest people you know now some guy is has i don't know ridden a bike on the wrong side of the road and oh we've got to arrest this guy running after him and tackling him to the ground and you know and strong in jail we know that but it makes for good viewing right because you're seeing the police run stop buddy and they're chasing after this guy and they tackle him and you know we're all glued to the screen watching where they're gonna get the baddie and they get him on the ground he tries to wrestle him and the other 10 cops come in and smash him and get him you know yeah i mean this guy might have stolen a lollipop from down the road you know you know but but it's viewing we're like well this is this is good viewing the viewer wants that they're a blue cot they're like white collar criminals out of stata in the process of stealing millions fleecing families up there the family will work and save up fifty thousand dollars for their retirement and they'll invest in some scheme by some cannot and lose it all their whole family's destroyed their financial life's destroyed they've got no way of making it all back up again but it's not good viewing they're knocking the door hey buddy we're going to reach you because you stole that money oh you caught me you know not good viewing he's done something far worse but you know we we we we like when you tackle the guy to the ground and boot him you know this is yeah catch them but i don't know why i said that but all of the but all of our stories are different right you got like your lives you know i i said that to to actually say like just because something looks like a small action it doesn't mean it's any better like like we like to hear stories oh this science went overseas and went on this big mission and went there and faced the raging seas here and there was you know attacked by robbers here and then there were there a wild beast got him over here you know and then we compare that to someone that maybe is just going to the job down the road and at work teaching somewhere and there and they are they look pretty boring you know but it's not it's just a different story like these ones one is a drama story one's an action one's a political one's a family story we all have different stories and god likes a variety of stories he doesn't want he you know he doesn't want to just sit down and watch a war story the whole time he wants a bit of drama maybe a bit of romance i don't know like he wants so so everybody you're all different you all have your different stories you know it's we and and they're all important they're all you know the god knows that the the viewer might think oh this one's a bit more important because they you know wrestle this guy to the ground but god knows their all of our stories are important now and the the when god is the story he has what you call a cast list you know in a film you get this okay who do we need we need all these characters and you get what you call a castle list so you've got to you've got to find out who you're going to cast for that and you don't cast people there like that you just cast people that are going to be a good right but there are there are many times where someone gets cast in a story to play a role that they they they are not that like like this guy here you know how many times you get this is this guy this guy is so that's that's the normal guy on the this guy bradley right he's like a quite a skinny like probably never never shot a gun in his life sort of guy you know like a you know wellington the people that grew up in the city that most of the people that come out of the acting school you know i run a mile from them which have none of the listing they're all the city folk never most have never seen the sun white skinny arms you know they're like you know just and then you you go to you you go to try and like i do a war film you know you need guys to play soldiers and you look at the crop that come in and apply for your role you're like oh man you guys don't look like soldiers you know you just you've got no veins in your arms or nothing man you've got to have like you know you're just you're all and you walk all you know soldiers like they their bodies are tough you know they're ready to go they when they move they quit you know their reactions but and maybe this guy was not that you know he doesn't out of film school out of acting school you know but but he gets the job so they say hey bradley your role is to play this this american sniper you know there's a guy that's a warrior from his youth you know so i mean he he had to beef up he ate 8 000 calories a day apparently to just put on not fat but just bulk his body up you know and he he lifted weights and a lot of the stuff he did himself in the movie because he got he basically trained like a soldier and became a soldier to do that role now the reason why i'm telling you that is because it doesn't matter what you are yeah god says this is the role you're going to play right so in this situation he had david this little boy coming in uh he comes in and god says yeah this is the guy that i'm going to cast so little david comes in all like that your role is going to be i'm going to cast you as a king amen you won't look like much of a king it doesn't matter what you look like your role is to play the role of a king that's your role you're a king and he he went to gideon hiding away you know threatening his wheat to hide away from the enemy so it wouldn't get stolen uh get in i've gotta i'm just making this film and i'm gonna cast you as the main character in it oh really what am i going to play the guy that's you know hiding away threshing wheat nothing like that no no you're going to play the role of a mighty warrior that slays all the enemies me yeah you that's your role you're the you're the mighty warrior you're a powerful warrior i don't feel like one doesn't matter you're gonna act like one and you're gonna become one and in the film you are gonna be one now that's why they have this singing film called in character heard about in character or they call it method acting it's like it's where the characters when you have to play someone you study who is that person that i'm going to play then you study them and then you become so much like them that when you start filming you just act like them all the time you're in character so so if you're if you're like if i was playing an american and a film then all the time i talk american hey you know even when i'm at doing my coffee hey john how's it going i'm always american i don't just like talk okay we action now we actually oh hey john you know okay and all the all the americans are called john as well for some reason they're all john [Laughter] see you get in character and you you instead of just acting like the character you become the character and you just are always the character you always it right there's a reason why i'm saying this so this is daniel day-lewis he played the role of abraham lincoln and he studied that role for a year and and he he became so much like abraham lincoln that even when he when he was on set he never broke character he was everywhere he went he was abraham lincoln he talked like him so if you talk to if you would go up and ask him a question he's going to answer you like he's the president of the united states of america he spoke to you always like abraham lincoln all the time and you know the guys that do that they're the guys that get really good because they embody that's who i'm going to play then i'm going to be that person you know and god's got a role for us to play he says this is who you're going to be now we can be like a this guy won three academy awards by the way for his acting because i just read you this one i want to just i want this to sink in this is an important principle in god's movie making what he wants from us this is this is this is just in the natural but we can type this to the spiritual so with abraham lincoln it said he always spoke like him and the last of the mohicans when he played an indian warrior he learned to build a canoe and skin animals and just go out in the bush and then the boxer he learned to become a boxer so he wasn't just playing the role of a boxer he was a boxer right now you want to win an academy award in this in god's movie then then then don't just be like this little gideon guy here think lord if that's who you've maybe that's what i'm going to be lord i'm going to be there all the time um you know and the good actors when they they just become it all the time it's not like on sunday i'm i'm this mighty man of valor then on monday no monday i'm this mighty man of valor too i'm gonna i'm gonna stay in character all the time you know all the time i'm in character you know the good ones you want to win an academy award to stay in character because that's it shows that you mean business you know you're serious about this i'm not i'm serious about i'm not that person i'm not that okay yeah sure that might be me but no the lord said i'm this so i'm a man of faith i'm a woman of faith i'm not just this little that's what i was but that's not my character this is the character god wants me to play so then then we get on to the set you know we start we we do our we're gonna we're gonna start acting jenny knows all about this she was acting and the director yells action and then you stutter on your line like there's a term that in the film industry you have um yeah you have this what they call a um uh continuity person and they've got the script always they tell they're listening to make sure the actors say the right thing so those are the that's the person if you forget your line i've got a few actors that them they're most the line they use the most is line line you know what that means that means i forgot my line can you please tell me what my line is they go line and then the and then the um continuity person says hello my name is john thank you all right and then you do it again right there but when that happens it's a mistake it's not where the word mistake comes from but because mistake is an older word but it's uh because it's called a take then it's a mistake oh we made a mistake and sometimes when you're making a film you could go through 10 15 takes of the same scene to get it right you know like you do one take and they get it they get it wrong at the start then they go through a bit further and then they mess up but further it could be 15 20 takes to get this thing right it's called a mistake right i just want to show you that just out of interest have you seen ben who this is how they did it back then look at that like you'd never get away with that these days but they built these big they basically built that whole arena these are all people these are real things about and they strapped the camera onto some use in a way they went flying around there and the guys on the back you know videoing these horses but you would never get away with that these days you know it don't have to be over there's probably remotes and all cameras and you know but i wonder how many mistakes they made here but well the reason why i told you that is because we make a lot of mistakes sometimes our line might be lord i believe that you're gonna that you're gonna fulfill your word that's our line right this is your line you when you come up against the end and you say lord i believe you're gonna fulfill your word but we got to say a line and we say i just don't know if i can ah the director got that cut cut cut no that's not your line that's not your line let's reset you know we have this thing called reset means you go back to where you were all right let's let's give this another go picture this in your own life you know because this doesn't happen instantly but maybe one day you you're supposed to say that but you don't that's all right the lord said don't worry reset maybe the next week you come up against the same situation right action you come up against it you're supposed to say lord i believe in your word and we're going to overcome through your word you say lord i believe your word but i only usually just don't know i just don't know uh cut reset reset we're going to do this one again it was a mistake you know and god's a good director a good director just keeps on going and and what this guy's a director here saying okay and sometimes you've got to get the actors aside say hey come here come here look that's tough but you can do this man you've got this you can do it this is your line man this is you you you could just go out there and deliver it you i know you've got this you know that's what the lord does to us he we're going to deliver the perfect line we're going to be that we're going to be that actor he's not just going to say oh that'll do no we're going to go and deliver the line lord i believe in your word and i believe you're going to overcome we're going to deliver that line he's going to do heaps and heaps of takes till he gets the perfect line whether it takes weeks months and years he's going to keep on doing it till he gets the perfect line one of the other funny things in that is sometimes you're on set and you've got all the crew you know that this is a very very small crew you know a lot of sets here got like 30 40 50. and you know in this one here you've got probably that's probably the director here talking to the actors this camera operator the two boom operators you've got probably the the probably the first assistant director in the blue the the girl in the back there is she is probably that she's got the book she's probably the continuity person i'm not making sure they're saying the lines the person with the hair yellow here she's probably the focus puller so she's focusing the camera the the other two as the holder in film there's about 10 people working about 20 people standing around watching getting paid that's how the industry works but and and they'll get paid a premium dollar too and you've got to buy them lunch you believe that these guys get paid more than most people in the industry and you have to provide them lunch as well i it where's my lunch man and it can't just be a sandwich you know it's got to have a variety you could have like this that that see we we have that problem here because we we get all the contractors that have worked on like avatar and well we'll international movies that that hollywood are just pouring their money into so they get bought a nice lunch you know so we try and get these same contractors on our films they're like oh where's lunch that's lunch oh you got to be kidding me and they have they form a little committee you know and then there's a committee spokesman and they they they put forth their demands what they want for lunch you know and it's got to be a you know you've got to cater to the different dietary requirements some are gluten free some of this some of that man there but the reason why i wanted to point out the crew when you have to reset some of them like could reset like we might be filming you know and it's like three or four takes and i want to get another one i'm like okay i want to get one more of those i think the guy can do better sometimes the people like no one i'll think to myself hang on hang on you get paid bro what does it matter to you i could you wouldn't do this all day it means nothing to you this is costing me here i'd do another one it cost me i pay you to do this i pay all these people it costs me all this money why are you saying another one you just get back there reset and we're going to do this again you do this all day if we have to it's just the way it works now the reason why i said this because you know we got to watch out in the fellowship you know if someone's having a hard time and then they want to try again well we're never going to go through this again with this guy hang on hang on what does it matter to you what does it matter to you you get paid all the same our job will just go we're doing again yep let's do this again you've got this sister margaret you've got this you've got it yep this we're going again we're going again tomorrow yeah all day let's do this you know hey we get paid all the same don't we you paid the same who cares why why do we what are these guys saying we don't do it again but somewhat we just leave it don't get to take and move on how does that work a good director i'm going to get this tape we're not moving on sometimes we get to the end of the day and there's my first idea is telling me oh if we go from now on it's over time we're going to be paying thousands of dollars an hour and we've got to stop now i used to get so angry i'm like we're stopping we're getting this take i don't care if we have to pay 10 grand we're not packing up we can't make the film's gonna get the stake this is how it works you know god's gonna finish it off and we have to cooperate lord yeah we go okay we go again let's do it i've got all day you know our job is to serve when we serve in the in the kingdom of god if it's reuben's movie then i serve it was my movie he says me you know and and if there's dave's movie i serve him we all serve each other that's what we're here for you know are we going to reset with them let's go reset let's do this you know 10 years later still in the same scene i don't care let's do this you know that's the way that we work in the kingdom of god now as in all these films you always need a in film they call it an antagonist you know but that's because everyone tries to be like show their intelligent right who's the antagonist the protagonist you know that means why don't they just say goody and baddie you know honestly but people like to show their intelligence it's like a medical world they call everything greek names like come on man we speak english just call it a knee to call it some other greek name we don't speak greek man knee foot hey we try and we try and show our intelligence and yet we just that's why people like warren buffett so much as the you know the we used to be the richest man in the world because you've got the ability of explaining something really simple he's explained to people he says look if you bought a car young fellas he says if if i if you turn 18 i give you money to buy a car that he's trying to give a lesson on the young people look after their bodies right he says young people if you turn 18 i'm gonna buy you a car and i'll give you five thousand dollars to buy you know no no i'll buy you any car you want when you turn 18 i'll buy you any car you want you'll be like man this is awesome he's going to buy me any car i want then i say to you but the only catch is it's the only car you're ever going to have in your life you're like oh well i better get a good car b i'd better look after it that's what you're going to say it's the only car i'm ever going to have man i'm going to park this thing in the garage if i didn't tell you that you probably have to i'll get a bit slack park it outside this net if it gets run down i'll buy another one but i've said to you that's the only cave you're ever having chances are you look after today yeah man because it's the only one you've ever got he's like so it goes with your body it's the only one you get look after it you don't get another one you can't go and i'll just grab another one now if you break it you're done he's like guys are turning 40 and 50. their body's broken it's like man you ripped it you have looked after it man you know it's the only one you get i don't know why i said that but so the the here it is here look here's the scene here this is the goodies and the baddies you know this is masala if that's the only choice i have then i'm against you so and every good story in every good story there's got to be a goody and a baddie where all the goodies and the lord is what we call the goodie you know and but in every film and in every good script it has to be a baddie job there was a but you know the the thing with the thing with this is is that it's all scripted the baddie never can never ever ever get the goodie never his script is all you do is listen no more that's all you do you never ever get the goodie no matter how bad he is how much he wants to get the he wants to get the goodie it's like sorry man but when i read the script all you can do is this and that's what happened to job one time the lord said if you consider my servant job and satan's he's essentially saying yeah i haven't but if you let me adam he'll curse you he says no he won't but um okay you can do this to him that's all you can do i'll give you this piece here's your script here he says here's the next one and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job there is none like him and all the earth are perfect and upright man one that feareth god and assureth evil and the lord said unto satan it's the lord said satan then said you know he only serves you because you bless them you've put a hedge of protection around him but then god said the lord said to satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth on hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord so saying all right here's your script here's your script baddie you can do anything you want to his stuff just don't touch him and that was no matter how much satan wanted to mess with job's body he couldn't touch him sorry not in the script cut you want to try to go towards him cut back sorry that's that you cannot touch him now now god let him go a little bit further a little bit further he said okay he can touch his body but you're not having his life because see these baddies they're limited they in god's great script the baddies can't touch you they're only there to test you so they're just a tool in the see the baddie just makes the goodie gives a bit more spice to the story you know imagine there's no baddie you know no resistance he's just at all that's why brother adam says satan don't have one right or nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had at calvary when jesus taken the sinner's place and died at calvary satan has no legal rights over nothing no more hallelujah or he cannot do anything to you he's just a has anyone seen pilgrim's progress or read this read the book that's that was the two lions right when he when he came in and they look really like these big bad lions but he realized you know if i just walk through the middle here they're actually chained up they can't touch me i just walk through it's all right you know the baddies in this script never get you don't matter what satan tries to say or how he's chosen to say he's going to win or nothing he never wins he the the baddie in this film never wins there's something else they have in films called a stunt double you know because all these you know the actors i talk about the skinny guys never you know they they jump and they break you know i shouldn't say i'm just so bad i hope no one ever sees this but they go to the actual reason why they don't why they get start doubles in in real life is because these actors are insured for millions of dollars you know you can't hurt them you can you get a scratch on them there's a lawsuit coming from their lawyers you know you scratched my guy you know so so when there's anything when there's a bigger scene that needs a bit of rough and tough action a bit dangerous then then comes the stunt double that's you know that comes in and these are that that go and do the stunt work that they don't want these guys to do because they don't want them to get hurt and maybe they can't do it some things the actual actor cannot do like man that's you want me to swing off that and do that jump there and then land on that man you know i know i'm trying to play the role as best i can but man i i can't do that i'm just i'm limited in my ability i'm limited in my human strength lord there's things i can't do i just lord i'm just gonna need you to take over in this situation lord you do this lord you know the lord's our stunt double you know when there's situations in our life where we just lord i just can't do this you know when you go through a situation you think lord how did i ever get through that yeah and it seems like the lord just comes in steps in and just thing suddenly it's all you make it through like well i don't know i don't know how i did that it's like the lord did it well he did there's times where he's our stunt double he comes in and he does it now people think it's us you know they when the film comes out man you did a good start there it's like it wasn't me man it wasn't me because you guys said sometimes you can't even tell who's who look these guys look which one's who's who which one's the tom i can't figure it out i think the guy on that side with the watch maybe he's wealthier but a watch i don't know who's who though but you know that's why you know when we when we become like christ it's hard to tell who's who about the lord when he steps in oh god i know i'm unworthy i'm weak my strength is gone but dear god thou art strong and i know that i'm unworthy but you are worthy and it isn't me after all and i'm so vile but in the light of calvary on perfect jesus made me that way by his grace you know he's our stunt double that you know and when we can't when we can't he can he steps in and and he does the things there's another concept in film which is very very popular these that's called vfx video effects where it means that puts some things that aren't there so later on the things get added it's it's almost disappointing to see like you think you know you it would almost be hard to act a reuben like if you if you're acting against that green screen and they tell you the director tells you reuben you're in this old setting with all these cars driving around you and you're sitting over there thinking man i can't see nothing you know you're like but then when the movie's finished they that's what actually you that's that's what was there the director's like no don't worry all this is there you just can't see it but it's all there often times in our life we think it's what we do is insignificant like i don't know i just turn up go to work it doesn't seem like much going on and that there's nothing like that in god's movie it's all significant there's so much more going on there then then there is nothing that's just average i can tell you that now when you wake up in the morning there's nothing average about your day nothing you might think it's like that up against the green screen a lot going on like like this guy you know oh this is average i'm just sitting in this basket no no that's not average there's a raging torrent around you and you're flying down in this basket down this river i am it doesn't feel like it feels like i'm just going along but when it's finished that's what it looks like you know none of our lives are insignificant and times i remember brother was it um i heard a story maybe it was at a testimony from the easter convention or something but someone was very sick a daughter was very sick and she she'd actually died and went away from her body do you remember that story who did brother andy say the story and remember they said that when the dad came in and prayed and when he spoke the name of jesus she said i saw this like power come into the room when he said jesus could you help he said pat that she said i saw just power come and then he would say some more things in but when he mentioned when he prays the name of jesus because the lord says he inhabits the praises of his people he couldn't see anything he would have just been sitting there maybe laying hands on his daughter lord jesus help you know nothing looked like was happening there was a lot happening in that room it's like this you know look maybe there's not much happening though these things happening all right there are big things happening you just can't see it there are massive things happening like this this you know it seems almost disappointing when you see what it what it is to what it was when it was you know but our movie is going to be epic of our life this i think you're going to look when you watch it you'll think man i didn't realize that when i did that that was all going on now when i prayed that that happened wow look at that the power of god came look at this one it looks like they're just walking up and looking out and oftentimes satan will tear that oh you're just looking out over a building but the director says no they're not they're looking out over the ocean you know god say declares things that are not as though they are yeah and he he says that's why i mean this is god's movie here when you know when was it elijah it was or elijah one of them you know when they when the servant was worried oh all these all these soldiers are attacking us he said open up his eyes let's just let's just click the show vfx for a minute click click this is what's actually there just so you know this is what's actually there these are the vfx that are there it's not not just that there's not nothing there click click there you can do that in film you click the button show all the effects you're like wow that's what's there yep that's what's going to be there god knows what it's going to look like in the end we might think it's mundane but it's not this one i like the editing room i like the editing room it's a great place it's a great place for us there's a saying in film and it's probably translated to a lot of things that oh that's going to get left on the cutting room floor don't you like that you do a bad take you do a mistake you know oftentimes when we film i don't use that saying but i'll film and then it's a bad take i'm like that's the right i won't be using that one yeah it's going to get left on the cutting room floor never to be seen never to be heard never it's done away after that be put in the fire it's gone all of our mistakes we ever made everything all the bad takes all the mistakes everything like that when god goes into his editing room to edit it all together at the end he's only going to get all the good bits all the rest of the stuff every all the mistakes all the bad things are all going to get left on the cutting room floor gone they're not going to exist anymore he doesn't use those takes even if you did a hundred takes if there's one good one the 99 are gone no one's and and and the editors in control never can oh why don't you put this taken i don't want that take like this one then then i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now salvation and strength now salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ have come for the accuser of our brethren who accuse them before our god day and night has been cast down you know the someone might come and say oh that guy was a terrible actor i saw him remember and that take he did that uh which one no this is the take here you mean this take oh that wasn't that one it was another one which one oh the other one oh this is the only one i've got of that scene this one here perfect take look at this perfect oh where's the other one don't matter where it is gone are we cut that out i'm not using that one when we ask god for forgiveness and it's under the blood is gone he cuts it out and it doesn't get used in the final take in our lives and the final cut it's just all the good stuff all the good takes all the perfect takes you know that's what he had us together not the no bad takes on this one it's all the perfect stuff that's why when he said of um people's often say you know the the new testament is the final take you know the old testament's all the the all the takes you know the new testaments where it's all been added together like like he said of god said of abraham he staggered not of the promises of god's unbelief did he stagger not well there were times where he staggered but not in the final cut he didn't stagger he was strong in faith and believed god when you see his life it was he was strong in faith even sarah says of sarah through faith also sarah received strength to conceive and was delivered over trial when she was past age because she judged them faithful who had promised is this the same sarah that laughed in one of the takes that take didn't get used that they got left on the cutting room floor the only type god used was the good take that's and when god makes our movie and it's school got the music and everything it's just a by his grace you're the hero of the story and you make it through and hey i think i think i can say that god likes a good story too you know he doesn't just like to sit back and be bored he likes a good story he likes it to be a bit of action a bit of a bit of suspense oh they're going to make it or they're not going to make it he even likes to show off to people you know oh look at that girl that oh it doesn't look like that guy's doing so well you know like the children of israel you know when they would sin and they would sort of seem like they're all going bad and everything's going downhill i think the enemies will sit back let's watch this story unfold you know and god would enjoy and and even they will be taken out to babylon and away but god's like don't worry there's a you haven't the script isn't finished yet as brother codra dixie to be continued there's more on the story at a certain point one of them is going to say god we want to call upon you again and then they're going to i'm going to start to move amongst them and they're going to start to rise back up and then they're going to get stronger and stronger they're going to overcome you that's in the script you know and oftentimes in our lives that happens you know but god always overcomes he likes a good story and he always overcomes that's all i had this evening so we can um we'll just um stand up and we'll just um just pray tonight and thank the lord that he's in control if you ever get overwhelmed don't worry god's script for your life is is he's got a happy ending it's a happy ending it's a very good ending it's a very good story you're not going to lose you're going to be an overcomer and you just be the person god's made you don't don't let the devil tell you you can't do it any time he tells you you can't it's because he knows you can you don't
