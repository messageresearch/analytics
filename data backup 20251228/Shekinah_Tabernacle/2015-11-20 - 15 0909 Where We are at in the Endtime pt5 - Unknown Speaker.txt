the scripture go to Genesis chapter 24 just reminded I'm going to have other AGM after the service on Sunday will have it in here because there's more room in here and over at home so we'll bring some sandwiches and thanks for the kids to tide them over while we have it I think probably the best thing to do you have anything you'd like to raise this please send it to me before that time and we can put it into an agenda so we're going to just read again where we read just read a smaller portion of Genesis 24 we'll just go from verse 56 and we understand this is very much a scripture that is uh speaks of us in the stay an hour or 34 verse 50 60 sitter he said unto the impending me not as Eleazar speaking to Rebecca's family seeing the Lord has prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire her mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her will they'll go with this man and she said I'll go and they sent away Rebecca this is to end her nurse and Abraham servants and his men and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her thou art our sister beat out the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gates of those which hate them and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they followed so I and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way we'll just go to John chapter 1 and we're going to read a scripture here this is a bit a bit of context John one and so st. John chapter 1 verse 43 and at CCA such as Jesus now he's calling he begins to call its disciple this is the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and find its Phillip and saith unto Him follow me I mean let's just our heads in a wood of prayer father we have opened your work Lord with so now heart desires that you'd have your way in us Lord and you would come and mold and shape us into your image father Lord we know any man can open your work but it takes you the great author of your word to come and speak and forth to us and father we praise we've gathered here on this Wednesday night that you'd come down among us in this and this time and just speak to our hearts Lord young at all father may just annoyed speaker and hearer Lord just be with us oh god father be with those who couldn't be here tonight look at those who may be streaming in father and Lord we just pray you just have your way in us our God and Father is one of the list us to handle you into your presence by prayer just praying you give it a strict and her body Thank You the bio stripe she's healed father and any other sick among us Lord we thank you that you are the Lord God that heals all our diseases and it's a finished work it's already done and we thank you for that father-daughter pray you just bless us now father in your presence may he granted oh god open your word to us we ask please in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may you may have your seats so I want to continue where I was speaking on Sunday just going into a bit of a thought here where we are on the end time and we understand for reading Genesis 24 that we are living out that scripture we are the Rebecca and in that story and that shadow there that we read about it as being looked out in your life and we understand by the reading of the scripture that the eleazar call we have heard the eleazar call where your there's no dispute that we have received Malachi 4 we have received you know we have seen the Son of Man be made manifest in this day yo there's no dispute about those things and but the great thing now is there's a challenge now it says come and you know said there Rebecca followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and and went his way and then Jesus we understand when he would call his disciples he you see to them follow me and they would something ever may just drop their life and they just followed her and this word follow is quite a quite interesting it it speaks about it speaks it says as a particle of union that means a road properly to be in the same way with that is to accompany this is specifically as a disciple to follow or to reach so to follow someone is to accompany them along the way and to follow someone is you know you become what you follow this is what I'm going to go down the road today tonight you become what you follow you know it doesn't matter whatever it is in life whatever you follow in life you will become that thing and and that thing that you follow you say well I'm not following anything anything you admire you become and that thing you admire is the thing you're actually following so you can come to church you can read your Bible you can do whatever you want but the thing you admire that's the thing you're really following that's the thing that's really has your heart is the thing that that that you admire and I even remember your boarding school there was a guy in my boarding hostels and here as me this this this yo he wasn't even my friend but I but I admired him you weren't even friends but you know we didn't even hang out or anything by thought he was cool and i ended up eventually dressing like he did because i had mine and mike's he begin to follow him amen i begin to become him and we understand that in this hour that our lord has done he has revealed himself in such a way that you know what we follow we are looking we're looking at him and the scripture tells us I just want to read a few scriptures we just let's go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and i know this is play very familiar scripture to tell us but you know Paul begins to say something that's quite profound where he would say that we had changed and I'll just you know as we're turning you just paraphrase says that as we behold him we changed from glory to glory and we read this here in 2nd Corinthians 3 and 16 to 18 that says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord speak of the Jews the veil shall be turned away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all would open face beholding as in a glut and a glass the glory of the Lord had changed and to the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord so there's something that has caught our attention on the same time and we were holding it and that thing that we are following in that we are looking at we're being changed into its very image right and we can see this if we I just want to go to Leviticus chapter 23 and I want to just speak about the wave sheaf offering because Eleazar even though we understand that Eleazar was the faithful servant but a faithful servant doesn't represent himself he doesn't inject themselves and anything he does he is just a like a mute and everything he speaks is not as I'm thinking not his own ability as not as I'm cressona but it says master speaking he is just an empty vessel that his master reveals himself through and so when Eleazar would speak to Rebecca it wasn't his fault it wasn't his ideas it was Isaac was being revealed through this man you know true to repeat current and the very words that he was speaking to Rebekah course Rebecca to fall in love with Isaac I mean because it was Isaac being revealed us and we can see this this end time where we do not love we have not fallen in love with brother branham even though we do love and appreciate him you understand as a brother but he is not our Lord and Savior we do not worship Him we do not adore him we don't follow him I mean even though we do follow them but we don't follow them because Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and ultimately those have received Paul's message weren't following the man Paul they are feeling our following the God that was being unveiled krupal that's the same thing in the same time we we don't follow brother Brennan but we follow brother branham because they follow the God to reveal himself further profit you see and that is the one we love understand the veil is just the veil that God uses the valve is the one I you're being veiled in that bail that we want to really get a hold off amen glory you understand so now here and in Leviticus we have so we have this feast of the first fruits and we'll just go to Leviticus chapter 23 and we go to verse 9 and we understand that these seven feasts are prophetic and what the Jews were doing there on top has been looked out and we understand that you know these these seven feasts we are we are right at the end when it comes to time and we won't go into those things but this here speaks of Calvary and speaks to the resurrectionists is in the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and sound to them when ye be coming to the land which I give unto you and reap the harvest their up then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest under the priests and you shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wavered and you shall offer that day when you wave the Sheik and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord now we see they're instructed now to take your field we're part of it comes mature need to cut it down to the priests and he waves that before the Lord on the day after the Sabbath which is would be in our calendar or some day and then it was waived for that the people would be accepted for your acceptance now this is all shadow now and we've seen it in the first when Jesus Jesus he heroes a day after the Sabbath and he was he was lifted up he was our sin offering and he was he was he took his own blood up to the presence of God for us to be accepted and that life now was waved over the people a mint and that was done because God was showing up this is he was the first he was the first one from the dead he was he was the first fruit of the New Testament church and he was now waved he was lifted up he was cut down and lifted up before the people so we could be accepted and only that not only that we would be accepted but God was saying this life that you've seen it and and my son and me is going to be come down unto you and that same life is going to be short and it's going to grow into you you're going to become what you're beholding what you're looking at amen as your first brains in the field had eyes and could look and what's the priest way better feel great they would be beholding something being waved and they would be looking at it saying we're gonna because there's a life of us now and that life must bring forth after what it's meant to be and that means we're going to become that that wave offering this being ways amen amen because to follow something you have to look at what you're following you understand so now there has to be we have to actually look at you know what do you see when you see the message I see the resurrected Jesus Christ that's what I see and so I'm following I'm be holding that and there's now an expectation because you become what you follow I meant you become what you look at there's a if you're looking at the gods with sports or reading some magazine or doing doing anything in the world you become you see people they the very spirit of the thing they're looking at anoints them and they become what they look at every every facet of the offensive its popular culture of its port of us about some great thing of learning or whatever it is they become that they embody the thing that they're following a me and that's just as you know that is just a perverted thing of the Christian now following be holding a resurrected life Alleluia so now Rebecca because we know Rebecca you know on her journey with Eleazar going to become one with Isaac she would have changed over that journey no doubt I mean it would have been a molding and shaping it up you know the very words coming out of that servants mouth would have impacted her life and changed and changed her life so then finally when the head quit because remember the man is the head the woman is the body who understand and so now when when when the head Isaac was coming out to the field to meet the body and he came a union now they just they just blended together as one amen because she became she became her I mean in that union now she became her and she wasn't Rebecca anymore she was Isaac she was mrs. isaac alleluia I mean because she was those words that she was hearing her faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God it's a principle I need I feel like I don't have much faith here the work Amy I feel I I don't feel very strong on my walk put on a message maybe I mean read the work faint cometh by hearing and that is you know it's a simple principle it's like I'm hungry cook some food yeah if you don't cook the food you don't get fed I mean faith cometh by hearing tonnelle chic she here in the woods of that messenger now thanks for getting to rise and her character and everything she was was being molded on that journey now that when when when when Isaac came out they became one and so now Christ was that wave sheaf that was waived on the day of Pentecost and that same life that was waved over the people now when went into those ones and up go in the upper room because they were part of the harvest as well I mean they were green as well hallelujah they weren't another specie they were they were part of that God reach that first part of that God race that God would bring forth out of every kindred nation and time they were part of it amen to that same life that was waived our wedding to them and then now we have come we have come from from that first Pentecost and we've come all the way down and through this this Pentecost and a true Pentecost is now a uniting of God and man because that's what happened all the first Pentecost that has must happen in this season as well with God and man have become one and so brother burn he would he would begin to speak a sermon and he would he would entitle at the right it is the rising of the sun and this is very important because it's more than just ate a Easter service but he would begin to lay out now where we are in time because they profit can see where we are he would he go he said in your earlier messages it's like a you know it's like with me when you're in America where they where the president signed the Emancipation Proclamation at all / to go free on a certain day and he would say the younger ones because as soon as they saw the sunlight that's when that day dawn and as soon as the day dawn they were free and so the older ones and you may be the you're the little ones they can climb up the mountain or up the hill to see the sunrise so younger ones who had the strength could climb up there and they could see the Sun rising and the people in the valley they couldn't see it rise but they could see as soon as those race hit their face they could point down and they could scream down to the people in the valley we're free hallelujah we're free and they could proclaim it down to those ones who couldn't see the sunrise yet and then and then so they would relay the message down and those ones who had never seen the sunrise yet because they heard that message they could say we're free hallelujah we're free so and then finally the day dawned and then they experienced what the one on the mountain was talking about it so when brother Brad with Sanders the rising of the Sun some people would say what are you talking about well already had a already had a resurrection but he was declaring this is a new day where people are not bounded ended up Dahmer denominational too many more how do you say it is the rising of the Sun said now now we're free melia he said we're not dead in some too many more but we have come out of the tomb we've come out of the tomb of religion and man's ideas and now we're resurrected were a resurrected people and a lot of people didn't really understand what he was talking about but that's because he was up on the mountain and then finally the Rays of that Sun shined upon their faces and then they began to understood where resurrected people mmm arisen we once did in trespasses and sins but now we're alive forevermore hallelujah and then he would say now in the sermon he would go he would go to Leviticus 23 and he would begin to speak about the wave sheaf offering and he would he would declare now because a type we understand is more than just finding a story and fitting something to a story and saying isn't that neat but a type is declaring now this is what's going on and so he would he would begin to say that I'll just read it he says if there would be this is paragraph 2026 if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the Sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is saturday but did you notice in this memorial you speaking of the wave sheaf now did you notice in this memorial to wave it on the first day of the week the sheet which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripens you cut down this sheet and take it to the priests and let him take it and wave it before Lord for your exception that you are accepted you you have come with your sheep and he's to waive it before the Lord not on the Sabbath the seventh day but on the first day which we call Sunday issue ND of course that's a Roman word which they called it the sunday for the Sun gods but how it has changed it's not the issue anymore turds it's a iso nday sunday that that corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seat and that's the first of the seed of those that slip waved upon the first day of the week on Sunday he raised up waved goodbye and ascended up on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first court of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat by God's quickening power God quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheath that's why they had to wave that sheet for it was the first one that comes to maturity and it waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come and it was a sign and today because he was the first son of God to come to full maturity to being God it was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people he says oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first the first one although he'd been typed in many times and we'll see later that he was typed but this is really this is really the first heard of them that slipped his waved over the promise see there was promised to life his waved at the day of Pentecost where there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was of a Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come to be waived again we realize in the last day now he's jumping 2000 years now he's jumping into today according to Luke 17 and the ESO in someday again and the day that the sonf man will be revealed or waved over the people again so you're saying no isn't is going to be another demonstration of the life of Christ and that's going to be raised waved over the people remember what you look at what you admirers what you follow and that's why it was waived that's why was waived upon the sir then elect people could look at it and they could begin to follow it begin to admire and as they're doing that they would become it alleluia I mean they would become it now now who is this son of man he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and of all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the Word of God by the Word of God by science by wonders we see today that the Book of Luke here we just quoted look seventeenth chapter 30th verse and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waived over the people that the dead to did traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and giving us life allu you as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slip and the bride coming of Christ hello we are either Bride of Christ they knew amen the bride come here crisis this is where crop does where God is veiled amen when Moses that I'm outsider he going to say this the Moses coming up because Christ was in Moses amen that's wherever God has well that's why it's a this was the bride coming I mean where deity and humanity have been united again in this in time lemme season the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will be a sheath waves again in the last days he'll be a mature saying is is going to be a mature life waved again is he saying the bride coming of Christ is going to be a sheath waved again and he says oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one to come to mature the first one that proved their wuzzle was a wheat and proved it was a sheath hallelujah then he says I'm sure you see what I'm talking about me what he's talking about his own his own life and I'm ministry yeah this is this really i'm sure you see what I'm talking about because he's saying about looks have any 30 the Son of Man being revealed and he quoted it over and over again and they didn't just talk about it and it was demonstrated in front of thousands of people here and then see saying no he's saying when that she stirs waved again and he's basically declaring the sheath is being waived there's a mature life being wave amen within those who are elect to see it looked at it did you look at it one day one day it found you and waved over you amen and then you begin to behold something does well in church tradition more than maybe what you're growing up and me and you begin to follow you heard a voice they come follow me Luanne and she went with him and she followed him and all the way to Isaac baby amen and then as as as she was following him she became not Eleazar amen but the voice that was coming out of Eleazar was embodied in Isaac worry you understand all those words that came out of the messenger United her other with horizon okay well and then to now William we have had an eleazar call Morgan as I'm just trying to maybe magnify what do you see when you put on the tape amen I see him oh I see the resurrected what I see you mature ones been raised up and been waved over the word sorry Oh so finish reading this I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride age from a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because i love you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back and was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word was well made manifest and I say he's to be waived get in the last day now for instance you say now wait a minute brother branham I know at church well I do to see he did anything change the subject a little bit but he's declaring see if we really know what do we following you really know what you're following do you really know what you're becoming right Amen is it just a different list of doctrines or is it just a supernatural ministry SP OTT that's it is those things but it's beyond that amen it is it is Christ Jesus our Lord being manifested and flesh again big waves in front of the people amen and the people that will hold it now I'll be coming it he say well I don't feel a great deal going on just take your life back whenever you from everywhere you first heard the le aids are cool and then and then and then go through memories late to where you are now maybe something's happened yes and eternal things been going on we've been hello you're very important things been going on I mean think the major sign of the end time is being looked out on you herb writers make yourself ready alleluia I meant that this one has been waived amen that we can actually see who we're following amen if you go if you can't really behold you know i read that that would follow me still company I mean to go along with alou you and if you know the only way you can go along with them is to see him amen not just to hear about him but to see him and if you've seen him then then you follow allu you hey they saw Jesus Jesus it come follow me they went to followed him and then is out walking with him they became her we're now it wasn't just him doing all the gear romance back like this man but then you have a man like Peter stand all day of Pentecost points back into the scripture this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel identify where they are and he would you know that he would begin to expound things that they had no idea what was going on the man who wants a coward and swore and tried to kill a god the sword he stood there in boldness I mean with a real sword in his mouth yeah one in his hand but in his mouth yeah you begin to preach to them and liver her to Peter amen amen he was becoming and then him and Jonna going past the gate beautiful no doubt teachers we've passed him many times and then the other guy was the guy was wanting arms and then Peter and John said look on us look on this light amen look odd look on this this is being waived I'm a result of the sheath being way he said look on us and he wasn't the humanity the life in them was being expressed I said silver and gold have my number such as I have amen healing power to to raise up a crippled man we made made a resurrection power where someone crippled sitting by denominational church can get up and walk our God one of them to walk another luhya and he said look on us he lifted and and they grabbed him by the hands and lifted him up and the guy left and praise the Lord why he say be saying look on this life aiming and the god beheld them expecting that they had get something something natural they had more than just a natural thing amen amen gave him really what he needed amen to get him out of that situation so now they became they became what Jesus did they became and now that same life was living out of them because they were following the master you understand and they are beholding him and as they beheld him they would change from glory to glory yeah and it's the same thing with us you behold this word that's been opened they may see Jesus in his program blue amen this is not abstract this is reality we can see your characters being molded and shaped over time and the things you once battled you've overcome and your nature's being changed and you can see you can see yourself you've become more like him what's happening you'll be your you're beholding a resurrected one and full maturity and you're becoming that you're becoming it may be the very image of him alleluia amen Rebecca had no idea where she was a book you're ultimately going to become all she heard about your marriage this guy I'll go amen comment on that journey now she was beholding and she has following well they're just physically following a man on a camel I mean but she was being United with her Isaac by what he was speaking she was being multi of a husband and wife compliments with us everything he is she becomes that's why the woman takes on the men's thing because she loses her identity and receives his identity right amen see everything he is in nature and character what he loves what he doesn't love all those things she begins to embody those things you understand and that is why we'd Peter when he would begin to speaking about the Statue of the perfect man being built up into this image of God or how do you do that you know him the Holy Ghost you have the virtuous yeah because he's not to burst you understand but well then how do you you're going to behold him just look at him listen to the message amen read it study it look into it meditate chew it over yeah amen absorbent and you'll be coming I mean you become the resurrected work now and that's how you must follow following jesus said unless you're willing to forsake all you cannot be my disciple you cannot be a Christian basically and Rebecca had to be willing to say just for sake a role button' leave the well that senior leave a water box and all those things of this is where i love this is my family willing to forsake at all and follow this man amen and unless we're willing because we are sheep we are live but it depends whose voice you want to lead you because you will become your Shepherd amen and here's our great ship but you understand but it depends what you want to become it's also what has what has trap your grab your heart what do you admire I mean there's many say well I'm following Jesus but they admire something else and that means they're not following him what they really should amen so we really want to follow him we want to we want to become him now this smell so everything that was demonstrated in that prophet now that life you read you know when you read your brother Barry peace he's preaching on the identified masterpiece of God and he speaks about the patriarchs and Josephine every Theo like Abraham Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph he talks about the mall and then then Joseph was perfect he says it was the fusion out after the patriarchs down into the tribes so I was invited in one man there was like cut-up is used out so now everything you see in brother barons ministry the fullness I had the fullness and the age was embodied in that man so if raising the dead power power of creation the other truth of the word you coming to adoption all these things that you know everything you saw in his life you know being taken beyond the qunut time wall all these things pillar of fire being there and all your all these everything's done all of that now because people say is God doing anything today absolutely if you took if you took the testimony of all believers around the world and brought it all together you'd say absolutely guys doing a lot but it's now diffused out through a mini membered body you see see everything that was in the form of the ages of the problem everything was demonstrated in her and now those same ones that be held both of the man but be held that that resurrected life in her thank God that was vowel in him now they they became what they are looking at and it's everything I was done in his life now now operate down through the church that's why I said you know there's a gift us come on brother nimble of yo of prophesying all these things they said another one there was a little boy playing now fixing our cow saying whatever it was it was a lead going through a puddle of me and the boy was electrocuted and he died and they pray for me to go he's range from life if you go back to life all these different things whilst happening things having a brother browser history now happening among the believers amen okc because without diffusing out through everyone because they were becoming what they were holding right it's just like you take you take David's mighty men they went to be king I mean but they knew that that anointed man was coming into power with an anointed man we understand this Christ Jesus but in Europe they knew that he was coming into power they knew he was going to become king and that same anointing that fell upon him that gave him the line gave him the beer gave him Goliath he put him he put that John in the same category as those animals God gave me the line God gave me the beer he'll be the same as then there's a monoid you that came upon that little boy with a slug job to kill that giant now came to have opposed mighty men and they did in sports like henan does the same anointing came upon them because they were following David they were beholding David essaouira they certain aunt admire a meant the same thing the same thing today we've seen we've seen an anointed one amen and we behold that anointed one and we're following that anointed one we mean I meant anything so that same like that was in there as it annoyed that anointed what is now coming to us so the same overcoming life that was in him is enough I meant that same overcoming life girls on him to to overcome every situation I mean is enough Alleluia that's why when the believer deals in a situation and they can look beyond themselves and see really what's going on that's what my friend can do I mean you could really see took a more from face value and really see what was going on see the bigger picture so can the believer look beyond what they see with their eyes and see well this person's like this maybe cuz they had a bad day and this person's like this because it listen all these different and they can really step into what really what God would have them do amen why cuz that same life isn't us because we are we are following and then we are beholding someone is someone is really will be caught up with someone amen and we won and we become you know what you're thrilled with why your entire or what you love is what you become that's why as I said I'd son it's a love affair between us and our Isaac Liu you amen and then I think you know I'm just going to leave a dig so I know it's probably a bit late but you have to really I pray when you look at this message it's more than just suman's to you amen this is more than stories to you but the whole thing is a love letter yeah what do you mean he blasts people and he preaches against all these things he says if it if your kids on the roadside or he's or someone's in a boat they're going down the stream and they're going to go to a waterfall do you not say hey Johnny you want to come to the side you know you really you really get out there and you if you love them you'll get them if you can amen and that's why he would he would call black black and white white because he has drawing yah it says in the scripture that god looked down a plumb line yeah I mean when he builds his building we just be sex it straight and then so we can now know this is right and this is wrong all good yes I don't want to work out I'm a sheep I need to know yes and no good food I mean then we can just move on you know kids love boundaries amen they do look if you apply it the right way and love they like boundaries I met and they ain't my little one back there she wants to understand you know she says talk to me daddy talk to me mummy yeah when you really have to explain it to her well this is why we're doing this and this isn't we're going to do this in all this she's happy but if you don't fully explain say just because it's go she fusses and cries in all these things because he doesn't understand amen that's why God had to lay down the message like you did so we can understand God likes us he doesn't like this he likes us you know he lays it out concrete solid black and white you understand hey she's at rest annalise's arrest when you slide out honey this is what we're doing right now it doesn't matter if she's tired or happy or sad when he was just just laid out this is like good and she's happy then she can move on with whatever we're doing amen that's why God had to laid out we have some musicians and that's fine I'm not the thomas but anyway that's why that's why this mission was laid out like it is what do you what do you follow him amen are you following a following him
