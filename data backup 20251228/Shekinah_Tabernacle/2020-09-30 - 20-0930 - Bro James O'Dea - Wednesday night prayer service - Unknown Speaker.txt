========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do good evening science welcome to the house of the lord it is a wednesday prayer meeting old-fashioned way amen um yeah so let's leave all our burdens out there by the door for now and all the things of the week and leave it at jesus's feet and welcome i mean to come and join us because there's a lot to keep us busy but there's a lot to be thankful for now i just had a thought today we um and and me and brother either one was speaking about it is you say sometimes you're working and you go what if somebody that was in a wheelchair that couldn't walk who couldn't move was sitting right next to me and i was working how desperately that person would want to work with me so though i complain i'm working there's people that would gladly do your work because they don't have what you have and sometimes we get so sidetracked with what we do and how we busy and and how important we are in our stuff and we forget that these people that literally will give their legs and hands to do what we can do so we are we can always be thankful and we always can thank him for what he's done for us and do for us every day and so when we come here we really want to come and say lord i know i'm not perfect but you'll get me there you know you'll make me perfect so we'll just wait for everyone to come in and then we'll power in a word of prayer but yeah sometimes you think it goes really bad you know everything's just going bad and everything's wrong and then you walk past someone and they they're in a much better state than you or real worst state than you and you're looking at them and you go oh lord sorry i'm actually i'm really thankful for what i have and you keep walking on and you need those moments because it's god just humbling you again and saying hey you know we all have to walk so let's let's just always say thank you to him a thankful art god sees that and he loves it because he gives so much for us so if we're always thankful god will always give you but if we get the greedy and selfish and sidetracked he's gonna he's gonna bring a trial just to get your attention to get us back there right amen but brother james is preaching tonight not me i just thought i'd say that [Laughter] amen um so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and we welcome our lord in our gracious heavenly father father we are so insignificant lord things we do that's that's so of importance every day lord is is actually not that important lord but you are important and what you do in our lives are important to us lord and we just didn't stumble across this gospel lord but we believe by faith that you led us into this place lord where the vindicated prophet came down lord and he spoke to us lord and he said these are elias a call there is a king calling you and he wants a bride and if you could just humble yourself and you can just believe my word and believe the prophet i send and see the signs and just know that it is me that you will bring us into that rest father we don't have to worry about where we work and what we do and how good we are for how long enough we are lord but that we know that you are leading the way as the captain of the host lord a lot of battles has been fought lord and a lot of scars and and a lot of deep hurts maybe happen in our lives lord but you can heal all our diseases lord you can take away all our fears and you can give us all our peace and all our joy lord so we just come to you humbly tonight and say lord we have heard that eliezer call lord we have heard you call our name that was written on the lamb's book of life lord lord even before the foundation of the world lord you already knew we would be right here lord and and it's sometimes so hard to understand but we just want to come and say lord we believe we receive and we just hear lord because nobody else lord has the words of eternal life but you so lord please may you speak may you speak to our hearts tonight

sure this evening it's great to be in the house of the lord and it's great to be in this presence and i really enjoyed the songs amen i just had a little thought tonight and brother ben had asked me to preach for a prayer meeting i didn't really know what to if we were having one like we normally do or he said what do you want us i like this you know i like sitting in the circle and but i hadn't really prepared my message message that way so i'm still going to read from my notes a little bit but i really feel the lord's given me a thought for tonight and just as a as a minister you know there's just when you when you just things happen around you and something pops up and you go man i just know the lord's in that channel and just brother a man sharing before and i thought you know lord wants to talk to he wants to talk to me that maybe he wants to talk to you as well just in a simple thought so have you got your bibles this evening i want to read from hebrews 12. hebrews 12 we're gonna read five to seventeen i've titled the sermon tonight i'll speak more about it soon but i've titled this message behind the scenes behind the scenes hebrews 12 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you enjoy chastening god dealeth with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement wherefore all are partakers than your bosses but not sons furthermore we have had we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for verily for a few days chastised us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening of the presence seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward that yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which exercise thereby therefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make strike the paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out that way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men in holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god bless any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold is birthright for ye know how afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected but he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears and you know sometimes when you are getting chastised it's easy to get really upset and you know but the lord's trying to deal with us and and there is a danger there where you know laissez saw it he he gave and he gave up his birthright just for a more solid bread and i was just thinking that just a quick thought so one more scripture there i want to read remember that time brother branham was he was in the service and the lord was dealing with a girl and she was rebuking him she was hating him for rebuking the way that she was dressing and she didn't repent of her sins that night and later on she said brother branham seen her and and she said ever since then i've just gone so cold i've just she said i could watch my mother burn in hell and it wouldn't worry me at all because she had turned down even though the lord was dealing with her something going on behind the scenes and i just want you to go back up to verse 1 in the same chapter just read here we're forcing we also i can pass about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which thus so easily beset us and let us run with patience that race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith i mean let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord we just come to you humbly tonight lord and father we know that you deal with us lord in ways that you can get through and speak to us father lord i just pray that you just sensitize our ears to your word tonight lord and just help us just to speak in faith father we love you and thank you and commit our way to you in jesus name amen amen can take seats you know sometimes walking as a christian can be hard you know i think andy had said it about his friend that he had been been talking talking to and getting baptized you know it's like you would think oh now my travels are going to end but you know you come to find all your troubles begin you know or because the pressure comes on you know the devil doesn't want you to be free he doesn't want you in that freedom and you know and then there's days where you've committed your life to the lord and then but you just don't even feel like a christian you know it's just you feel like man i'm just not good enough but but everyone goes through it it's like these cycles that you go through and and everyone does go through it and sometimes it just seems like everything's falling apart you know just everything goes wrong man you're like why did this happen to me like why didn't it happen it always happens to me and it just seems like well just one thing after another or two things have happened now where's the third you know like it's coming and i remember we had that once they were like oh what's the next thing that's going to go wrong and it's like the fridge blow up or fragile washing machine or something appear to be right and and but to our thinking right to our carnival thinking like man that's just unfair it's just unfair but you know it's not that's just our way of seeing it it's unfair we're like why did god do that why why would if he loves his children why would he do that why would he take my loved one you know these questions that we would but we have to continue to look to jesus because jesus because he's the author but he's also the finisher and if we can just look to that promise you know we can see a little bit deeper than what we're just seeing in front of us there's always something deeper going on because when we use these senses that you know there's different dimensions around us and i think the first three dimensions were light matter and time that elements that make up the world around us but then we know that brother branham talked about there being a fourth dimension and those radio waves that travel through here and so right now there's images that are traveling through and this this these scenes and maybe some of those scenes are a really evil really horrible things that would just be flowing through here but you can't see them but they're here they're radio waves because your phone right now has the capability of picking up that image and displaying something totally evil in front of you so those pictures are traveling through but you can't see them they're behind the scenes of what these sensors are picking up but you have to have a receiver you know as soon as you've got that receiver you can pick that up and turn it into an image amen it's the same with sounds you know though when you speak your voice goes out and it travels on a wave and that it doesn't stop it just keeps traveling and traveling and traveling and things that were spoken years and years ago that that's still traveling though it might be so minute we might not ever have a measurement to read that but it's still there it's still traveling and it can be like in your christian walk though you don't see these things that are there you don't see these natural things but there's things going on behind the scenes of your life that sometimes you don't see and it's unfair why would god do this but they're happening for a reason to bring you up to a place in christ so god's saying why let your hands hang down just because this is happening you've got you've got an attitude you can take to this trial you face don't let your hands hang down you might end up staying that way and so a few weeks ago i was with brother isaac as he was filming this short film and i was just going behind following and filming these things for behind the scenes and as whenever i do something i doesn't matter what it is if it's filming behind the scenes or it's going and doing something else i always say lord what's the what can i take out of this experience what lesson can you show me out of this experience and as i was sitting there i was like man there's so much going on right now that like i actually didn't really know what happened you know you you don't see what it takes to make that film and maybe you don't see what it's taken to make brother impo the way that he is the character that he has you see brother impo and you see the way as your man he's a lovely brother but you don't see the things that he's been through to get him to that position and so as i started thinking about this film i thought you know before there could even be a film right they had to be a director with a script before any of the actors knew anything about the movie or anything about the script there had to be a director that had a plan and wrote it out it's going to be this way because i've got a vision up this is what i want to see at the end and just imagine god he wanted to see this bride spotless and white right and so he had this plan now i've got to write a script so that at the end it all comes out to look like this god had a script for us and so now he puts everything in place so that he can bring that script to a reality at the end right and i was thinking as i looked around you know when people watch this movie they're gonna have no idea the battle that that guy that was recording the sound the whole day had with a great big stream raging behind you know and he's trying to deal with that and us i think i said to him how are you going to deal with the noise in this in this stream you know and he was explaining that but i thought the people don't realize that you know they don't see that they're like man the sound this is incredible but they don't see what it took to get that and as things started to go on you know i was looking watching the sound going the next minute you'd hear this quad bike start up on the neighbor's property and you can hold man that must be so frustrating hey isaac's just got action and i hear this driving up the thing everyone's like all right wait wait it's like okay then he goes faster like action and then i go oh no here's andy starting up the car oh the driveway you know you don't see that i was thinking about i was watching the the lighting team you know because you just see oh man that person's face is just glowing you know it's just glowing but you don't what you don't see is there's a guy holding a shade up over here and he's going like this and we're like you know we need to put some light over here and reflect that on the face you know i didn't even really think about these things before i had seen this happen you know maybe i sort of knew that that did take place but i don't see it as sort of beyond what i seem to see that end result and you know sometimes the sun just had to shine in the right place the sunlight had to be right on the right place of someone to get them to glow that way and it can be like that with the lord you know the sunlight's got to be just in the right place for you to have this glow you know that people can see i thought you know the other thing that i really thought is man you don't see the amount of effort that it takes for this assistant director which is sister shannon to go around and actually make things happen because you know all the directors thinking i want this shot you know i've got to get this shot we've got to be down here in line let's not quite get it there and it's just the director's going hold on we've got a plan you know we've actually got us gotta make this happen you know and so she's going around making things happen and i kind of thought you know it's a bit like the holy spirit really because god's directed this great plan he's got the script and he has the vision at the end but now things have to start to happen so he himself come down in his holy spirit right and begins to start moving and and this has got to happen here and this has got to happen and maybe you don't even realize it maybe he saved your life many times and you didn't even know but he had to bring up to this finished position and yeah i mean this is just this is incredible lord i really can see how you deal with your bride you know and i have found over the years it's a great blessing when you can get to a position in your christian walk where you can start to hear his voice when you can say lord why are you doing this and he just speaks softly to you and starts to lead you and say lord i can okay yes i hear that you know rather than just being in doubt all the time but you know it does take some like i've learned right you know there's times where i've had things happen and i've said that's the lord and it wasn't of the lord you know there's no point in trying to make an excuse for it but then there's times when he said stuff and it's like man that was of the lord and then so you begin to get sensitive to know what's what what's god speaking to me and what's my emotions speaking to me you know we're not maybe excuse the expression but we're not playing a game of poker in life right we're not just playing the odds like what's the chances of this happen when something happens in your life well there was a good chance that that might happen but that's not how god works you know he has a plan and when things start to happen you have to say lord why is why is this happening you know you're doing this for a reason and i i used to get road rage you know if maybe even in my mature years as a christian and you know someone was slowing me down you're driving her if i just want to get home and now someone gets in front of you and they just go like 40 and a 50 or something like man it's 50k through here you can do 59 you know and just start getting really frustrated you know and but now i i go lord you know like actually maybe you're slowing me down purposefully because if i was two minutes ahead in my journey i would have been t-boned at an intersection or you just you just don't know so now even though sometimes i like get up there and like and then i go yes lord back off a little bit you know and slow down but he does that and embarrassing enough as it is to say but there's been that many times when i've been driving maybe going a little bit too fast and someone's pulled out in front of me and i've had to slow down a little bit and then you go past the speed camera van or something come in like the foolishness and then but the lord has everything in control you know there are times where he just lets us get burnt because we needed to get burnt you know praise god just the same right amen but when the pressure comes on you know the devil starts to preach to you you know the devil's a preacher too just as the minister deals with you the devil starts to preach with you in those trials and things come but you just have to say no devil boo devil the lord's showing me something the lord's gonna do something here just don't listen to the devil you know though it seems like oh hell's coming against you and everyone hates you and your friends leave just get out devil i'm just gonna keep trusting god i'm just gonna keep walking with god because that's what it takes and don't get mad if mad at god if he doesn't give you an answer while you're in the trial but he's the finisher of your faith so if he's planted a seed in you then he will bring that seed up to harvest it's just the law of how he's created this universe but the best way to let that seed grow is to let it see the sunlight you know that seed can't see sunlight it doesn't grow so when you start getting beaten down you know beating down into the ground and you just go man i just so hard to get out of this rut but as soon as it can just look towards that sun it can begin to grow but as long as the dark clouds are hanging over it you know they just can't grow i was thinking about a story when the lord was just dealing me with this and that brother branham had talked about him rather than me trying to paraphrase it i just wanted to to read it from how he had written it and so it's a bit of a reading but i really enjoy this the story just the lesson that it is in it and it's in well he preached talks about it in a couple places but in 1963 god doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him and one day i come home about four years ago five something like that and this young girl which was eight years old when she was in the cradle role i don't quite know what that means how he sees that but she had been married and had two children and she was laying in the hospital out here at the point of death she was about four months five for the baby and the baby had died and they couldn't operate because she had uremit and they couldn't operate so i had to let the mother die so he can't operate you see the baby would kill her like that so they had to she was just dying that's all it was wasn't no chance for her and i went to see her she had sent for me and i went to the hospital and there she was under the oxygen tent and i raised up the little flat i talked to her a little bit and i said you remember me she said sure brother bill i remember you i said how was it do you understand how sick you are she said i do see that's why i sent for you i said well how was it with you and the lord she said brother bill i'm not ready to go well we got down and prayed and her mother and husband and many of them in the room and her mother and husband started crying and then i asked her and she got right with god paid her vows and come back and made the promise as if and have she been forgiven how she loved him how sorry for her sins the way she had lived and went on with repentance and crying after a while i got up and went out of the building and the next morning they called me up to come back out there and come to find out that they come in that morning for a test to see how the uremic condition had advanced and found out she didn't have a speck of it it was all gone every bit of the uremic poisoning had left it the doctors were so excited till they said my why this we ought that something very strange said will get already and said have it still that way in the morning said we'll keep giving her the penicillin or whatever they was giving her keeping the infections down said we'll operate and take the dead baby out before it sit in something else if she's all right then well two or three times that day they tested her again and that night late they tested her nothing wrong perfectly all right they prepped her took her out from under the oxygen teen everything was fine they was going to operate on her the next morning and take the baby well i went out there and because that this was done i never knew it i never knew the lord told me nothing about it you could ask the people if you wish so they she so that he never he never said he would do it but oh my to see such a thing her husband being a sinner come over said brother branham i want to give my life to the lord jesus i said all right just kneel down here and take hold of your wife's hand and then you walk the straight life together the mother come back she said brother branham you know here's me and my children said we've all been in and out and in and out and around the tabernacle and things we sit and listen that you preach and we'll go up to the older and come back said i'm backslid too brother brennan she said i want to come back to the lord jesus for his goodness to my child well you see that's very nice but you don't come to the lord jesus because of that along towards midnight 12 o'clock her mother dozed off to sleep and she said called her mother said mother and she said yes honey what do you want she said you know i'm so happy she said i'm so glad of you being happy said i'm at peace with god and said oh how fine it is and a few minutes she called back again and she said mother yes she said i'm going home and she said i know you are she said yes yes sweetheart sid the doctor will take the baby tomorrow and then in about a day or two when your incisions heal up you get away from here you're going back to be happy again you're in your hobby and the little children and be a christian and live for god she said mother i mean i'm going to my heavenly home she said sure honey at the end of the journey said she said this is the end of the journey oh she said now what's the matter so this is the end of the journey said yes mother within a few minutes i'll be gone well she thought she had a nervous condition in derelict so she called the nurse the nurse taped taken her respiration everything was normal and within five minutes she was gone she was dead and when i come home in a week or two after that i think brother graham preached the girl's funeral and i come back and media told me that the girl had died that night i couldn't couldn't believe i went to see the mother yeah yeah and i don't know what caused me to do it but i said lord god you owe me an understanding see after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the lord you've done all these things for him and all like that and then take this girl's life like that i said you owe me an understanding when you tell god something like that he'll leave you sitting alone he don't owe me nothing i'm in debt to him well he just let me port it out for a few days you know and after about three or four months one day and i was down on the creek bank the lord spoke to me in a vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but i had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and why you went out there then i got down and cried i said lord jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant i should have never said that lord and i had went back down to that lady she lived over here market street and i went over to her and said i want to ask you a question she said sure brother bill i said is it true this girl almost drowned she said that's right brother branham said her husband and they had to get her out of the creek they had to use artificial respiration and put her put on pressure and they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her said she had a skirt on they were having a picnic she was out there and stepped in some mud slipped over and in her head and strangled in the water they didn't notice her and directly they seen her coming up and going down and they run in and got her and brought her out said she almost died she said i said that was her time to go see god knows what god knows what he's doing now the lord probably would have told me that if i hadn't have taken the attitude that i did so something's happening if he hadn't have taken the attitude the lord probably would have told him he took the wrong attitude towards something that was happening behind the scenes lord you owe me to tell me about it he don't owe you nothing i stood in a meeting one night and heard an evangelist praying for a sick person said god i command you to heal this person who command god see it isn't even intelligent because god he does what he wants to do can the clay say to the potter why did you make me this see certainly not but the prophet if the prophet will keep so still then seek the lord for an answer then there's an answer there see the reason i said this is because when i hear this i think about the attitude it's the attitude lord you owe me and you know sometimes maybe you haven't but sometimes i've been angry at the at god for the things that we've gone through and the attitude that you take towards that will determine the outcome i wasn't planning on saying this but when we first become christians it was hard you know like we didn't have any of the things we have now we were broke i went filed for no asset procedure bankruptcy basically and we got married you know so we started out with nothing and i had a bad job that sometimes i wouldn't even get paid for like two or three weeks as a boss didn't really have the money and so things were hard and there was a time a point that i come to where we were paying our ties and it was like i pay my tithes and i had no money for food and the only money we had would give us gas to get to church and and i was crying out like lord you why would you do this you know like the only money i can't even feed my wife i've just got married i'm paying my tithes and that money that 50 bucks or whatever it was then would have been the money we needed for food and the devil was preaching to me you know as i was saying before he starts preaching you know why would you want to serve a god like that anyway you know and i just said i i remember just saying no this is what the word of god says this is what i'm going to do and he just kept meeting the needs you know we had a friend there who will become a friend over time and that one night he'd come and just knocked on the door and he had bags full of groceries and he was near just as broke as us and he just said i just felt that god told me to come and give you this and just a few hours before we were praying lord we've got no food like we need to eat we've got no food and then some bags of food come and arrive on the door but i believe that was the attitude by saying i'm not going to let the devil preach the lord will have his way amen and it's attitude you can take it's going to have a great effect on the outcome maybe it won't come right away maybe you do all the right things and it won't come right away but when it does come you'll come out with such a character right amen will make you stronger and whenever you get a powerful testimony you can look back on it and you can see the lesson in it maybe you can help someone else to go through the trial that they're going through by the lessons that you learn and i believe we're coming so so close now to this end time so close to the lord just coming and then just taking us away you know this harvest and so he's got to get if we're going to step out of this body right and step into a glorified body man you just can't step out a dirty man and step in a clean man you know this character of this man has to change first till it's able to step in to that body amen i've heard the sound of it going you know like brother ben's been preaching that further sound over going and he's it's been rustling you know he's been rustling me so we can expect to be getting a transformer we can expect more trials because he's got to get this field right just need to look beyond that sense that we see and just say lord let me look beyond let me look beyond this trial i was thinking about um when the sirians were looking for elisha the prophet and he elisha had been revealing the king's thoughts in his bed chamber right the king would say we're going to go down and take the king of israel and elisha the prophet would see those words and he would tell the king of israel to move and so he said now the assyrian wanted to find elijah and in second kings 6 15. it said and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold a host can pass the city both of horses and chariots and a servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots and fire around about elisha yes you know it can be like that here tonight you know how old saying look what the cat dragged in you know and i don't want to say that any cats have walked in here but when this old grumpy man comes walking into church after a bad day you know there's things that we can drag with us you know because if we come with an attitude and you know that's there's spirits that follow that you know and they don't just go oh look it's church tonight we'll just wait out here till he comes out you know they come and sit down and while the preacher's saying man don't like his preaching you know all that sort of carry on but you know i just wonder if sometimes it could just if we could you know brother branham would go to a meeting and those places like not when he went to a church but we'd he'd go to an auditorium somewhere and places where other things happen and he'd walk in there and he could see spirits around and there were people that had gifts where they could see in the spiritual realm and they'd see spirits evil spirits around those places but i just wonder if we could open our eyes and see into that realm maybe there's you know a couple of evil spirits that would hang around but how much more host of angels that would be around you know there's a power that's far greater than any demon power amen amen so i i don't think we should let ourselves get beaten up you know lord i know you're here i know your spirits here in the scripture where where's that scripture at the start we're forcing we also i can pass about with such a greater cloud of witness you know we're compassed about there's people here that are carrying a spirit that can maybe help pray with you and break through something that's been afflicting you it's not like there's not a witness of the power of god amen right amen let's just look past this curtain of time you know look past what we're going through look past pain and hardship it's only for a good you know look past feeling alone we're not alone amen you know i want to have character no matter what it takes right we want to have character and i was saying a couple of the bros the other week maybe it's brother ben how we went to the supermarket and um you know with the covered regulations under level two and they've got a person standing at the door and they're letting they'll stand there and you'll be waiting in line and they look at you and they're like and let you in and you go oh you know you know like and it's just they've got this person off a checkout right and they've put them on door as security and put them in this position of authority to regulate who can come in and who can go out and this person's not trained to be in a position of authority they're just a checkout person you know and so now you take a person without the character to have without the training that it takes to have authority to operate that position and place in there and they get an attitude right they got a bad attitude because they've just been given this position of authority i was like i'm going to tell you what to do you're not allowed to come in here on how you can come in that's right you know as power without character you can see it in the natural realm amen i say help us lord because i want to have character genuine character imagine how powerful a church with genuine character can be amen amen i just got one more scripture i want to read well actually i just want to go back to part of that scripture that i read hebrews 12 verse 9 and where it said furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us right our parents they corrected us and we gave them reverence right so they smacked us and we still gave our fathers reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection to the father of spirits and live you know how much more to him for they your parents for they verily for a few days chastised us after their own pleasure so your parent chastise you for their pleasure to get what they wanted but look how different god is this is a real father but he for our prophet i mean he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness amen the trials we go through and are not for god's pleasure they're not for just because he wants to beat you down you know it's not therefore our prophet that we can be partakers of his holiness amen i just want to i had asked brother isaac if he could sing a song and brother amman and it's just a song that we're not when i'm feeling a bit beaten down by the devil it's a song i always put on usually on the way home from work and listen to and sister lutavo was playing it the other morning i was like man i really enjoy that song so just to be something different i asked the guys if they can sing this before i'll probably turn it over to brother ed to read out the prayer requests we've had and we pray so if we can sing the harvest [Music] [Music] and coldness was sleeping into it still the hands of the laborers [Music] see [Music] to their places [Music] and the seeds was to kiss his face [Music] as the shoes [Music] and all the fears [Music] bring out your signals [Music] is [Music] faces [Music] and all the presses growing [Music] ladies [Music] is [Music] in and the fears [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] is uh
