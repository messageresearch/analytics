========================================

[Music] for [Music] [Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to church this morning amen it's good to be here I always like coming to church Sunday or Wednesday I I always enjoy being in the presence of God and being refreshed in the Holy Ghost amen the first song we're going to sing is a song called lead me to the Rock I remember staying at uh we were at the noes Place actually and Brother Andy and the Cliffords were there too and I think Andy had gone um down um brother maru's little track at the back of his house where he used to walk his dogs um around all through there that was before he was warned this was Andy went through there for some quiet time before Maru warned him not to walk through there for quiet time because that's where he takes his dogs every morning to do their business all through the whole area so Andy did complain about standing on smelly things as he walked through the this little Bush but anyway I digress from the story but Andy still managed to praise the Lord and get inspiration in that uh area and he came back with the words to the song Lead Me To The Rock and he he' had a bit of a tune so he and I um we sat down at maru's lounge and we pretty well strung the song together with the words he had and the Little tune he had in his mind and we we um strung the song together and it's pretty well as it is now as we sing it so let's um let's stand this morning we're going to sing lead me to the rock this morning let's just open in prayer Lord Jesus it's it's wonderful to be here this morning Lord that we can come to that rock Lord that's higher than

to me and you know this is what was spoken and there's a deacon speaking to someone outside and what he talked to someone about I was preaching about right after that so yes what you know so God's good you know he's has a mind and he's mindful of every situation so thank you for your prayers and it's good to be home amen so let's um let's go to the scripture I have um I'd like to read one scripture actually I've got a few on the slides but we're going to go to uh Proverbs um 18 and verse 10 and was going to read one verse and just like brother Bram said it's not the amount that you read though the more you read sure it's powerful but one verse can change the whole world could change your world amen amen so um yeah amen we know the word of God is very powerful and amen so uh Proverbs 18 And1 sorry I don't have it on the slid show here but uh it says here um the name of the Lord is a strong tower power the righteous runneth into it and is safe amen so let's um let's bow heads in a word of Prayer of course we want to especially want to remember all my Robin at this time and and bromin and the family is all my tiny has gone to be the Lord so amen let's just lift these ones before our Lord in prayer if you have a need just want to slip your hand up to the Lord amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful that Lord you are greater bigger stronger than any enemy we could ever face thank you dear God that you've already overcome all things Lord Lord when you conquered you conquered everything Lord that day on Calvary and dear God as we bow our heads in our hearts we want to just want to ask Lord as we uh approach you this morning may you just be well we know you're with Omar Robin but Lord I pray you comfort her be with Brahman be with the family Lord God is is um on Martin's gone to be with you father I pray you'd Comfort Lord the family give strength Lord Jesus and may be with them Lord in a very real way very personal way Grant it father we also want to thank you as we read your great Eternal Word we're asking you come and anoint it Lord to every heart not just speaker but hear a dear God may it be a flame of fire in our lives and may you come and walk among us For Your Glory touch each life here those who may be sick and body or or whatever is going on in our lives may you raise us up be with us Lord uh guide us bring us in a closer walk with you grant it Lord we thank you be with all those who couldn't be here today as well be their portion in Jesus Christ's name we submit our lives and the service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you so you can have your seats this morning I got a few things I kind of kind of like a scrambled EGS so you know there's a few thoughts I just pray the Lord will weave it all together but I want to talk about God being a a comforter but then where do you get your comfort from and and uh and where are you driving there's kind of three very different kind of things here but um you know we read here uh David would say the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe we live in a day where where the world we need comfort we need a place of safety a place of security a place where we can let off the pressure because you see anyone who gets into anything in any kind of a way they they go into it to let off the pressure someone will engross themselves in their work because they're letting off the pressure maybe at home or their own lives and someone will get into a hobby in a great way because they're letting off the pressure they're looking for a place of comfort people get into gaming they get into movies they get into you know cosplay and all these kind of fantasy things because they're trying to let off the pressure of the pressures of their own life because we know humanly we cannot deal with this world we cannot COPE in this neurotic Age The Prophet says we're not fit to live in this world we're not you know even now even the amount of information we receive in a day uh people used to say it would be a say a newspaper's worth of information but now because of smartphones the internet all those things the the the average person receives 30 newspapers of information today and it's actually information overload and so we need a place to let off the pressure amen we need a place of comfort amen that is actually a satisfying lasting Eternal Comfort not something that's just a moment that comes and goes and you know people they go watch their favorite shows they'll binge binge watch things and I remember doing that back in the day when that was actually a thing back when you know in the Stone Age when I used to be you know people would binge watch things what but what but why they're looking for Comfort they're looking looking for satisfaction they're looking for something that will calm their nerves that will kind of just just unret some tension that's what they're looking for but the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run runthe so there is a place of rest there's a place of comfort that we can go into this morning and not just come in and out but we can dwell there forever amen so as as um let's just read here just read another Psalm here you know it's amazing David if you look at the life of David he would he he needed a lot of comfort in his life he did not have a flowery bed of ease he did not have it easy he went through a great his life was a great time of transition where where where yo Saul was the first king of Israel had but we know how he ended up but now David would take the throne and and and and Israel would go through a time of transition from from from just having part of the land to securing the entire Promised Land but then also he would go through a great transition in his life cuz he went from a Shepherd boy he wasn't born in the palace you know look at this great changes he went through he went from a Shepherd boy that even his own father didn't see the Potentials in him his brothers sure didn't see the Potentials in him you know he was just a Shepherd boy and and and the reason I say they didn't see the Potentials in him is because when Samuel came to his house to anoint the king he wasn't invited he wasn't even considered right so so he went from a Shepherd boy that was that was not considered not even you know he wasn't even put in the he wasn't even in the running human ly but God had him in the running before the foundation of the world so God knew he was going to be king so he went from there then he went into the palace it looked like he could literally just step on the throne but then he had to go through a great transition time of being on the run because God needed to pour into him his word that we could draw strength from so you got to look at now maybe I'm just going to jump to this and I'll come back to it but but I just want to keep this picture in your mind now this car is not parked on the sidewalk it's driving okay where are you driving today your Christian walk liberal and legal is the sidewalk is actually a ditch I didn't have a picture of a ditch I could put a car in a ditch but I wanted something that's moving cuz we're all going in a direction and we all think we're on the road we do I mean let's be honest I think I'm right because the Bible says every man is right in his own eyes and my own eyes I'm right I mean let's be let's be truthful well we should be always truthful but you know what I mean we think think we are on the road down going down the King's Highway I'm right but what is your how is your walk affecting others see David David when he was walking with God wasn't on the sidewalk he was going up the King's Highway and his life influenced others because other men that were you know it says there you know when when when David went on the run and he went to the caves of abdull and said all that were in debt distress and discontented gather them M elves to David so they came into David's path well how did that affect them they became David's Mighty Men you see the anointing that was on him went upon them you see so it wasn't so he didn't run them over they became like him amen now if we are honest now this might be a slow kind of a service but I pray God would just let's just have a conversation yes you know you got to think about it would you want to be influenced by your own life if you were not you that's a good question don't you think would you want to be influenced if you weren't you would you want you to be your friend would you be happy to be around you would you be pleased to be in your company would you feel better being in your company or after you're in your own company I yeah this is not a DI I just want to ask you these questions how would you be positively impacted by your own life or would you be run over would you have to dive out of the way that here comes brother or sister so and so sure come on how's your driving if you could really you know you say well there's always something I want to work on absolutely God needs it but my question is in your current state don't don't put it way off in the future somewhere yes God's still working on me we're all work in progress okay we're all working progress we haven't made it yet we know we've made it when these bodies are changed we understand that right but would you want to hang around you now I'm not trying to put someone in some oh no one loves me or I don't even no would you want to be around you okay if the answer is yes praise God if the answer is no you say Lord change me amen that I exert a positive influence put me on the road Lord correct me you know there's um I don't know if that's no it's not a Tesla but oh maybe who cares anyway just say it can auto drive right the technology gets good enough that thing can drive I remember being where Christine and I were in Brisbane were in um Jeff and BET's Tesla and he said look I can show you it drives itself we're going on the motorway the thing was driving itself in order to be in the we've we've always had cloud computing right we've always had a server we've always had a hive mind or however you want to put it it's always been here but the problem is our Hardware gets get was born broken but then God is the actually the IT guy that works now if anyone's in it here praise God God bless you but you know it's more than a turning off and on again but God actually does a proper job right put it that way you see but we need to if we're we we need to look at how our lives are impacting each other and ourselves because iron can only sharpen iron if the Iron's in the right position amen like at work and cover your ears honey bear but at work they've got these automatic sharpeners you pull the knife through you've got to set the blade right before you do it if you don't set it right then the blade will be oh boy you've got a serrated knife when you didn't start with a serrated knife you know it's terrible it's a real train wreck because because the knife isn't sit in the sharpner right now the expert here would say no it's never going to sharpen it right and true but what I'm trying to say is if your life is not set right you're going to sharpen each other wrong right if you're now no one thinks they're liberal or legal everyone thinks you're down the middle right let's be I think I'm I think I'm fine I think I'm right I think you know I think I'm right down the middle but am I David said cleanse me of my secret faults Lord oh yes Lord right so we all have secret faults there's things that in our life there's blind spots that we are not aware that we have but when we allow the light of God to shine upon us if we are genuinely sincere and we genuinely want to know God will show us but if we don't really want to know he won't show us but I prayed I wanted to know but you didn't but what see God doesn't hear this he hears this and when this means business he means business but if this don't mean business you can you can pray you can fast you can do all you want outwardly it looks all very well but if this doesn't mean business you're going to hit something on the sidewalk amen okay so let's just keep that in mind amen praise the Lord now so David David went through this time of transition as I said he didn't um his mighty men didn't get run over by him he they became like him the anointing upon him that was on him went upon them right but then when David and his Humanity got off the path and he took bash Sheba killed Uriah and all those things that was a train wreck why what happened he he lost connection with his Shepherd his source of comfort was forgotten he let the pressures of Life take him off the path you see cuz there is he is the Lord is a strong tower he doesn't move a tower doesn't move but we move remember Israel God never left Israel Israel left God right and this Christian world today has left God they're crying out God why why why and he say well read my word and you'll see come back to me come back come home come back to the Strong Tower it's great this place of Refuge it's worth it amen so you see David when he was in his Humanity he didn't let the card his source of comfort didn't keep him on the path but his Humanity took him off and he started running people over and Nathan came to him and gave him the parable of the shepher you know the two um one had one sheep one had a whole bunch you know all those things and and Nathan said because of the because of this the sword will never leave your house you're forgiven but the sword will never leave your house so unfortunately his life because of his position and even as an individual even you know as mothers fathers whatever our lives have impact right I think it's one in Newton's law every action has a opposite reaction right so so however so if I crash my car it's going to have impact on me it's going to have impact on whoever I run into even if I hit a lamp post that thing's still going to get fixed there's still damage right so we all we we can never um get rid of you know this world does not want responsibility for its actions this world does not want responsibility that's why they get vaccines for so people can live all kind of different Lifestyles you know they have all different things people have now to try and mitigate responsibility but God still holds everyone accountable and God will hold everyone accountable so we've got to realize how we drive is going to impact somewh it's going to it it impacted David and imp so it didn't just you know so we want to Lord may we just be down the middle amen all right so we'll come back to that but you see he left his source of comfort his Strong Tower and he started self-driving all right so now he says to the chief musician upon um niggan however you say that a Psalm of David Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock that's higher than I for thou Hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I'll abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covet of thy Wings CA see this was David this was David's heart and God took him through incredible things to show us that truly the Lord is a strong tower he is a City of Refuge that it's not in you know people have it in you know peaceful times a everything's fine I'm in my City of Refuge no it's when Trouble Comes what is our comfort coming what are we drawing strength from amen what are we drawing strength from you see many people they take comfort in many different things people take comfort in being young right I'm young I've got years ahead of me I've got my whole life in front of me so they take comfort sure things may be hard right now but I'm young I've got years ahead of me people take comfort in that people take comfort in money they draw strength from their money well I've got this paid off I've got all this in the bank I've got all these things so therefore they they they think they've got Comfort right people people take comfort in their position well I'm the head of this or own this or you know this is my job title this is my job description so they take comfort in those things right they take people take comfort in their intelligence I'm smart I can do it they're taking comfort see they're relying see what are we relying on that's our comfort right or people take as I've said before they take comfort in their hobby or in entertainment people take comfort in being part of a group just like brother Jimmy was saying on Wednesday he was so interested in what his friends thought of him that was his comfort what do my peers think of me they'll leave you as you heard this is all sand I'm talking about sand just comes and goes all these things there's nothing stable in these things being part of a group you know people can take comfort well I come to Shak Tabernacle there'll come a day this place won't be here could happen right where's your comfort then is it now then would you just have comfort in the good old days no your comfort must be in Christ he is your comfort right so just being part of a group it's not going to it's not going to hold you when you're alone right see amen what your friends think of you being in company you know all those things they are they are sources of comfort now David's Comfort was the Lord amen now we understand that that Joshua would would would place I don't know if I don't have the list here but but Moses instructed him or the Lord told him that that there would be six Cities of Refuge in the promised land so there was six places of comfort that people could go to just say they killed someone accidentally you know and they could flee into these places that the Avenger of blood could not harm them when they were inside and so when they're inside they fled there and they could plead their cause and then people could people in that place had to let them dwell among them so that person when they're outside the city had no Comfort they had no security they knew the enemy could get them he had legal rights to do so but then when as soon as they stepped in the gate they had Comfort right because the enemy couldn't get them they were safe in that place so their their comfort maybe maybe if they are fast and they're running to the city they could think well I have comfort in my speed maybe they're long-distance Runner I've got comfort that I'm a longdistance runner or maybe they had a horse I've got comfort in my horse right but all those things now I may be laboring this but I want you to think about what's your comfort in yeah where are you drawing strength from today amen now but then as soon as they got into the city that City wasn't based on their ability or what they possessed the the merits of the city was in the city alone right now Christ is the seventh City of Refuge right so it's not in our ability that we draw comfort from well people draw Comfort well I was raised in a Christian home well I was baptized all those things are good well I go to a good church that is wonderful I'm so happy for you well I'm I yeah I've heard the message of the hour praise God I'm glad God has sent you the light of the age you across your path but the comfort is to know him as life amen to know him as life see not to know about him not to be associated with him but to know him as life amen that's the real source of comfort amen now praise the Lord now if we ever come to Christ we can really let off the pressure amen okay well I don't know what's happening but it's not going up there now but if you ever come to Christ you can let off the pressure cause oh here we are because it's all over then just settle in it's God's provided place of safety where God said the name of the Lord is the mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe in a time of sickness when sickness strikes and the doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it don't build up pressure let off the pressure call your pastor let him anoint you with uh in oil uh and pray over prayer of faith he'll save the sick let off the precious SE is our re Refuge while you're in this Refuge you've got a right to do anything that's in the Refuge and Christ is our refuge and everything we have need of is in him amen and sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure you say well I wonder brother Bram you don't wonder you just let the pressure off commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up pressure let off pressure why because he should be your comfort amen that the word of God is our strength and our comfort praise the Lord now I'm just going to come back to this a bit again have I broken something this must be childproof anyway can you go to the car picture I don't know what I've done oh here we go okay now brother Braham tells us very clearly now I just want to go into our walk okay now everyone thinks you're in the middle of the road as I said this morning now the Lord Jesus has never given a complex to anyone okay the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't give complexes it doesn't cause trouble in a negative way to the individual right no the Lord Jesus has never done anyone any harm amen not a single person has been harmed by him okay amen no one has ever that's truly come in contact with him has any resentful feelings towards him right but it's religion that kills it's religion that harms religion is of the devil if you take that as a sound by whatever you want to do but religion now walking with the Lord true Christianity is not religion right but a lot of what religion is is is is is pretending to be Christianity right because the both can look very similar so for example brother brah would say I think it's in God of this evil age he said he said paralleling Cain and Abel's worship with God Abel was worshiping by Revelation Cain was worshiping by intellectual understanding he said both of them Spirits is in the Tabernacle this morning amen so outwardly it would look very similar people would dress the same they'd act the same they'd proba say Amen at the same time they'd have the same kind of songs but one is religion the other is actually Christianity okay so we must never get confused by the two though both though the both are very much the same now religion has been the worst sidewalk driver in history right it is purposely because it's the enemy perverting what God has created God created us to walk with him the devil perverted it that we would walk with a religion two very different things right so now religion is the sidewalk driver it is actually set up too if there was a person on that sidewalk and that was religion it would speed up and hit that person oh I've got another one you know and sadly that's why this world has been hardened against the word of God is because of religion and what people have done in the name of religion you look at you look at um um Judas for example now it's amazing Jesus allowed him to be the treasure knowing he was a devil but yet if you take him and the you it's amazing how the world always puts up if someone is a Christian and they've done a crime they always put there a Christian in the newspapers when they put the what they've done they never say this atheist did this or this or this person or this agnostic did this today no this person belongs to this church and they did this why because well one that person needs a real experience number one but two the devil does that to paint a bad picture of what we believe sure and there's been real train wrecks that have happened in the name of the message I I we can't defend those things you know we can't hey we can't say that those things are acceptable no a lot of evil has been done but what is it it's unconverted people people driving a religious car right people who are driving on the sidewalk you know even even the Apostle Paul says in the book of Acts he tells the people um he says he says that after my departing Grievous wolves among you will rise up rending the flock he says I have warned you for three years day and night with tears that this would happen could you imagine no doubt those men who heard the Apostle Paul say that and this was the last time they would have seen him alive and they embraced him and cried and the Bible says they s's neck and they were sad when he left but he said among you no I'm not pointing at you but I'm saying he would be pointing like at them right okay are we all with me okay yes you know but among you some of you are going to be like this you're not going to be driving down the road and helping people your life is going to be negatively running people over in the name of the Lord cuz it's amazing when human leadership's taken out of the way as brother Johnny demoff said at our first Camp the hearts of all men are made manifest right so what's truly in people comes out when leadership is taken out of the way like the're saying is when the cats away the mice do play right so now sadly this has been the case down Through the Ages now does this um does this mean what we believe is wrong absolutely not unfortunately where the truth is the devil wants to try and either discredit it you know disprove it or try explain it away he always does those things that's his that that's the way he does things so a so a religious person will be on the sidewalk now the and what it is is so it's not the Lord Jesus that causes people to run people over in the name of Christianity no no no no no it's see see it's amazing and it's not even really the devil that does it it's their own person it's an unconverted person sometimes we give the devil too much credit oh the devil made me do that really and he's thinking well you're chalking that one under my name he doesn't care you know because if he can get you to blame him instead of you looking at yourself in the light of God's word and actually letting God change you then he's got you how he wants you right but if we really say Lord search my heart amen you see Lord change me like David Nathan went in front of him to correct them saying hey you're the man in the parable David the one you wanted to have killed you caused it you're the guy and what did he say Lord create in me a clean heart oh Lord in other words Lord put me back in the middle of the road Lord Jesus amen so so you know so someone who is liberal or someone who is legal they cause Carnage but yet they think they're in the middle of the road it's amazing how someone see if we could if see we can't see this whole picture here right but what if in front of so this is I guess this is our car right we're on the road this guy's parked facing the other way I don't know where he's going because it's a oneway street okay spiritually speaking okay are are you with me now we can't see this whole picture right so what if to our right just out of the shot there's just a massive traffic jam four lanes wide you ain't moving nowhere you can't even get a bicycle between the cars so this guy would be reasoning hey man I'm on the sidewalk because of all this is going on I need to travel both think about themselves right but there' be reasoning no doubt in this guy's mind where I'm driving is correct because of what's going on you see and this is the big danger is when something comes in people humanly pull one way or the other based on you could say their default setting right so if someone is someone is liberal they'll say well it doesn't you know love will cover it who cares I'm fine I'm driving right like you know like um aen took the Babylonian garment in the gold wedge right he thought hey I've been fighting for this this is mine who cares what Joshua MOS you God told us through Joshua I'm just going on they have to deal with it I'm just going through something we've got to be very aware how we impact one another yes amen right and so and so they will reason that way now a a um a legalistic person will drive over people on the sidewalk and they'll say well that person wasn't SE that person wasn't really a Christian and if they really were they would have overcome that and I have a right to drive here because I'm in the message and I'm I'm I'm living the word out and and well then then how do they impact people negatively attitudes comments that P that sister's dress is too tight it's too short this is this and mine's long and no we're not here to wear burkers okay as long as it's below the knee and you have a bit of a sleeve praise God that's what the problem said you know some questions he got I think he kind of bulked say why are people asking me these things where's the personal relationship leading where's the Holy Ghost leading these people you know but you see someone who's legalistic just wants a tick boox what do I have to do then I'm in you have to fall in love with Jesus Christ you got to fall in love with his word and walk with him right are we all together amen so so both of these things will cause people to get run over you know brother BR makes a statement that you know our attitudes and things we do can knock people out of their healing and the and the legal ones say well that's the Liberals causing trouble in the church that's why people get knock no it's the attitude of the legalistic is just as bad it's just as damaging as someone who's liberal saying well it doesn't really matter and you know God is such a good god he's a very good God he cares but do you care I think if we had his heart this this whole world would be transformed if we thought like he did if we acted like he did B see who are driving on the sidewalk think they're acting like him God give us the mind of Christ amen amen you see and what happens is people driving on the sidewalk causes people to develop complexes what wouldn't you get a bit of a complex if you're going to just come out of this house you may be going to walk walk down the street to the dairy saying and this car just goes right past you and you nearly get run over wouldn't that Dev bit of a fear in you bit of a complex you can't the same anymore you've got to you know because you nearly got run over think about it you know you're just minding your own business you've walked down this driveway many times before and suddenly this big white car just goes right past you and you got to like go this and then the trauma sets in what a complex sets in because of how someone else was driving if they were just driving just a little bit on the road there would never been the problem right and so what happens is we can if we're driving on the sidewalk we can cause complexes in one another sure I'm just letting it soak in a bit so we got to think about it how is my life impacting others are they better off because I've been around them or are they more negative are they more sarcastic are they more condescending you know do they love the Lord less now I don't know if everyone's going to go around with a survey with everyone can you fill the survey out I need to know but think about how is your how is your how is your walk affecting your children right now parents can have a perfect walk doesn't mean there won't be trouble in the home we know that right but do they see in our lives a sincere love for God do they I well of course they do because I'm right no no do do they see it is there actually a genuine or is it just going through the motions kind of a you know it's one thing I've got to break out of constantly just going through the motions this cancer start sign it's a thing I'm Just Born This Way sure but I'm more than a conqueror there is nothing God can't change am amen well I'm Moody I'm all this just come into the City of Refuge yes sir enjoy it's enjoy it everything it is it's a great place right well I just can't overcome me no but the Holy Ghost can right brother Ram says that the Holy Ghost takes all the counts out of a person that's what he does he's the can't remover hallelujah amen brother Arman wouldn't that be a great thing in your carpet cleaning business all those stains there there wouldn't be one Gone Gone why because he's the can't remover right but it's reasoning that makes us think the counts must remain so keeps us on the sidewalk I yeah I trust we're all happy today and together and thinking about these things amen so now we can never see an a legalistic person will have a cold and different nature towards someone else who's not driving driving the same way they're driving or their skirts too too short or it's too long or it's too puffy or it's this well they're this way see people driving on the sidewalk compare themselves people draw comfort from comparing their own lives with others well I'm driving a better car or I've got a better job my family's more together I have this I I'm glad I'm not that family and God has ordained their walk just like he's ordained your walk right and God's proving himself in their lives just as much as I trust he's proving himself in your life amen we all have different walks God's not a cookie cutter amen yeah and I'm thankful that all of our testimonies are not the same I'm thankful our lives are not equally all the same I'm glad this is not some communistic idea that everyone must be the same no we must of course be changed to match the word but our walk and what he's taken us from what we go through it's all tailor made that he can prove himself but someone who's on the sidewalk the Lord's like why are you driving over there come back onto the road you know stop dodging people on the sidewalk and well had had he Dodge people on the sidewalk you keep clashing with everyone that's how you know you're on the sidewalk who's ever driven down a road when there's no traffic and you got to dodge people no but then you look to your left or right and there's heaps of people walking on the sidewalk imagine driving there you'd be toting you get frustrated people get frustrated on the sidewalk you know road rage happens if you're trying to drive in the wrong spot even if you get stuck in the mud road rage can happen right you can be just off you can be just off the road then you can be stuck even on Long Grass that's slippery you can be stuck when I went with christe and I went up to Oakland you know brother John was taking us around and we had to go get the keys for the church anyway we were we were just off the uh kind of long kind of driveway go brother Andrew Donaldson's house and he pulls his uh van off onto this grass we were stuck man I was I was jumping on the back of the van this just before church was saying jumping on the back of the van trying to put some weight I thought Quinn you've abandoned me you know I I can't yeah I wasn't strong enough you H fat enough to anyway so I got to work on that maybe but anyway we got another car and we got to church but it was just it was literally and it looked fine grass nice green grass beautiful soon as we hit that thing man we were done it can look so reasonable to drive on the sidewalk because of what other people are doing I'm going to prove them this is a traffic jam pered I'm going to prove them and drive this way do what I want you get frustrated because you'll be hitting people or they'll be ducking out of you and they'll give you funny looks why did they say that why did they mention that why are they why are they talking about these things that's it's like someone's driving you know you never you never get normal looks if you're driving in the wrong spot especially in New Zealand we very much stay in the lane right stay in the lane right we're very much just we just do this kind of thing so you get funnier looks probably here than maybe in other parts of the world but even in other parts of the world well actually in every part of the world if you're slowly driving you're about to hit a pedestrian they'll be looking at you funny first it'll be whoa what's going on second it'll be why are you driving here especially when you look you know when you look someone in the eye when you're driving they like nearly hit you and stuff and you see them and they see you right and they pretend not to see you but but they see you it's the same thing in the Christian walk you nearly hit someone cuz you're in the wrong spot you pretend oh I'm just going on I'm serving God no you're driving in the wrong spot I'm probably laboring this but I really I just trust it really soaks in real super deep you know that we must be careful where we're driving see religion gives complex says the blood of Jesus Christ has never given no one a complex you get love amen Amen brother Bram says when a man said he could cast out he said I stood a few weeks ago where there was a big tent erected not slamming uh God forgive where a man said he can cast out evil spirits which I have no doubt by that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love amen right so if you're on the sidewalk I'll say you're actually that's cruel indifference I'm doing what I want I don't care what the rules say I don't care what other people are doing I don't care who comes out that driveway I'm driving I'm serving God they can do what they want oh no no no no if you really have a genuine Love in Your Heart you'll be actually genuinely concerned about everyone around you amen right amen amen you're hitting gaps in an intersection is because you're frustrated if you have genuine Love in Your Heart praise God I'm in the car longer Lord hallelujah let's have a conversation how we do yeah and you have a prayer meeting in your car who who enjoys that or you put on a song you're talking to whoever you're driving with you get it's being stuck in traffic is quality time you may not think that but it's actually quality time why because you're there one-on-one with God or whoever you're driving with or whatever's going on you can enjoy you know it's quality time well I don't perceive it that way well maybe let's just let our perceptions change a bit just like every day is a gift Monday is still as just as great as a Friday because it's a gift of God praise the Lord I trying to anyway Hallelujah but you see the Christian always looks at the Unseen things every Redemptive blessing of God is unseen here's the whole armor of of the Christian love joy Faith longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience it's all unseen forces that works in the heart of a Believer am mean that's right we look at things we do not see if we if we are the children of Abraham then we don't walk by sight we walk by faith for Abraham walked by faith and called those things which were not as though they were because God said so so now to drive to drive on the sidewalk you are driving by sight amen you're walking by sight so how people treat you you will treat them not by faith not by looking beyond their fault and maybe seeing their need you know someone I've never seen a happy person who's injured never never seen a happy even a drunk person who's injured becomes very unhappy right so they start maybe crying they start expressing themselves differently to when they're not injured who's with who's ever seen someone who's cut themselves really bad or maybe not so bad you know or something's happen maybe maybe got a big bruise they fell they something happened who's ever seen they don't react the same way to before it happened right I know well that's obvious yeah yes but what about in the spiritual now what about in the spiritual someone's maybe been injured maybe the devil's fighting them maybe maybe something's going on in their Spirit you can't see but they're reacting because of something that's going on within them now they're a Believer you're a Believer but they've been wounded by something right do we just if they were physically if we could physically see spiritual wounds I think we would treat one another with a far greater care like if we saw someone maybe maybe spiritually they're an ICU right now maybe they've lost a limb maybe blood and arteries going and their blood is just spurting across imagine if that was what we could see spiritual wounds we would attend to that person we'd start praying we'd show them care we'd show them consideration the first question would be like well well well I mean if someone's badly injured but you know of course you don't ask are you okay because you can see they're not okay but a child comes they're crying like William hurts himself on that starts crying well the first thing are you okay you picked them up you give them some comfort right then you look at what's wrong you assess it and all those things and you know why but you start administering Comfort now if you're on the sidewalk you can't give Comfort on the sidewalk spiritually speaking because you're doing your own thing they shouldn't have been there it's their fault and sometimes it is our fault it's human error sure we're human by the way news flash everyone we you're human okay but you see someone who's actually on the road can actually administer Comfort why because it's the love of God keeps you down the middle amen right if you have the love of God in your heart then you can administer comfort then the comforter that comes into your life can be expressed out of your life so what if we saw each other spiritually I mean physically as we would be spiritually I think we would actually have a lot more we'll probably have a lot of prayer meetings we would show a lot more care and consideration oh well that's them and then no no they just lost an arm a big dog just ripped off a part of they're missing some limbs they need serious help you're not going to push someone down that's that's being taken whenever I see an ambulance I think Lord help that person Lord help the ambulance staff Lord may they get to hospital give them another chance Lord you know but we should have to me we should have the same kind of attitude towards someone who's spiritually unwell shouldn't be well oh they deserve oh look at what well well it's because where they're walking they deserve that no we shouldn't have that attitude right yeah amen I'll just amen cuz I believe that we should care for one another right so Lord give us spiritual Eyes Lord that we can see each other if we're doing well praise God you look healthy you've been eating some good healthy vegetables absolutely I've been drinking fresh water I'm not dehydrated by the salt water of the world I am hydr you know so if someone's looking well doing well spiritually praise God we should be happy for them but if they are wounded or whatever Lord how can we administer Lord let us get the first aid kit Lord because remember God heals by by love by music by Miracles by Care by understanding the prophet says he he gives comfort in many different ways but can we perceive it's Comfort coming our way see if you get wheed into a hospital you have comfort knowing that they can help you yeah right people don't go to hospitals so they don't have any comfort knowing that those people can help them right I know this is I'm probably being captain and obvious today okay probably being very obvious about but but you know you have comfort knowing they can help you amen then how much more now when we come in these doors or we or we contact one another should we not have comfort that the person I'm talking to knows the comforter they know the Supreme one amen that can bring Comfort bring healing bring peace they can they can actually bandage me up amen they can can do we not isn't that why isn't that why people put prayer requests on Amen do we not have comfort knowing god I believe you and I know you hear my prayers but I'm asking them to pray for me as well because I believe you hear their prayers so I have com see if I had no comfort in in in in knowing if I had no confidence or comfort in you that you could contact God I wouldn't ask you I mean it's that simple right I mean but because I know I have confidence in all of you and I can take comfort that that you're my brothers and sisters you love me you have care for me you can enter into my burdens and you can pray with me amen but someone who's on the road here oh no on the sidewalk they won't be able to pray with the same way because they're standing or driving or walking in the wrong place right but someone who's on the road on the King's Highway they can really pray the Right Way am amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah now this is from marriage and divorce not not that we speaking about that subject but listen to me this encapsulates the whole thing just like today there are two great schools of Doctrine in the church one of them is Calvinism the other is Armenian ISM one of them is legalist the other is Grace and we find and we come to find out that the people who believe in grace the Calvinists they say bless God it don't hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to drink I can do these things I've got eternal security then you find out the other side on the legalist said oh I would like to ball him out I'd like to show him a piece of my mind but I'm a Christian I have to keep still so legally or By Their Own Strength they're feeling things they're thinking things but they can't say it because it's wrong outwardly they may look right but inwardly no that's worse but then actually the well he calls it Grace I'm going to call it liberal they are just as bad because both actually are selfish in their nature right just like I said the car on the sidewalk both are selfish in their nature because one says well I'll look bad if I say it and the other says I don't care what people think I'm going to do it anyway what they're driving on the sidewalk amen you find them on two different roads and neither one of them is right now it's hard to say that but it is the truth see the person who oh anyway we we find ourselves on two different roads one is going one way and one the other now let's see what the truth is now listen and see if this sounds sensible to you for instance if I get ready to go overseas I take my take my own family I'll call my wife up to me and I'll say well I'm going overseas dear now here's the legalist side now my wife I'm going to lay the law down to you if you flirt with any man while I'm gone when I come back you're a divorce woman I don't want you making eyes I don't want you flirting you understand that I'm your husband if you do it I'm going to put you away when I come back then she reaches me and gets me by the tie and say my good man I want to tell you something see see that if you make eyes at any woman or take any woman out or flirt with any woman you're going to be a divorced man when you come back now wouldn't that be a happy home oh my it's a house not a home um that's legalist all right now now the other side is now if I go overseas and I make a mistake go over and say now look I'll I'll take this woman out oh it's all right with my wife she don't care my wife say I'll go out with this man it'll be all right with Bill he don't care if I don't care then there's something wrong with me I don't love that woman right and if she don't care there is something wrong with her she's my wife I don't want other man fooling with her she is my wife now the other side that if I go over see and I make a mistake go over and say now look wait sorry have I got this the same here yeah I think it's sorry um all right she don't care I think I've got this quote wrong oh now the correct way of it is oh wait no no the other side of it is now that if I go overseas and make a mistake go over and say now look I'll take this woman out oh it's all right with my wife uh she don't care my wife says I'll go out with this man it's all right with Bill he don't care if I don't care there's something wrong with me I love that woman right and if she don't care there's something wrong with her she's my wife I don't want any man fooling with her she's my wife now the correct way of it is is that both of them has got a truth but not exact the truth the sidewalk is kind of the road but not at the same time it's right by the road it's p of the road it's all those things but it's not the road right now when I go overseas to make it right my little family gathers around and we pray one with another um um with one another and I commit them to God they commit me to God and when we do and I go overseas now I know she loves me I have confidence in her and I love her she's got confidence in me and as long as I love her like that she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out as long as she loves me right why there is no need of me thinking about any other man going out with her because she is my wife and I believe her that's the right way see genuine love and confidence in one another right and when you have genuine love and confidence in our Lord Jesus Christ where does he where does he place you in the middle of the road you're not on the sidewalk because you are mindful that your actions affect others right you're not selfish you you are mindful you love everybody you love him and it keeps you on the road amen amen praise the Lord now let's just go here a bit we have a great comforter right and our comfort does not just lay on this side of the veil okay but our comfort really lays up yonder because remember our comfort like I read that list before about our being young uh being popular be your position your intelligence hobby entertainment part of a group all those things that's all shifting sand right but if he is truly your comforter that is a rock that cannot move right it's an eternal source of comfort amen so now our comfort doesn't just lay here in terms of him his Spirit working with us him dwelling in us but we have a great comfort knowing where we're going amen right because every other Comfort is the here and now right but our comfort is not just the here and now but it's in the future too right CU it's an eternal Comfort right amen like the Apostle Paul he had great comfort saying he knew his head was going to be cut off but he said I have a crown of life waiting for me right his comfort wasn't in anything of this Earth cuz remember he got to a place I think he wrote to Titus or Timothy Winter's coming I need my coat he was in prison he was cold he was destitute all the Comforts of life that he would have experienced being a Pharisee was gone and that wasn't because God was mad with him no God was pleased with him right but God wanted to show the Apostle Paul I am your comfort what you read David writing about Apostle Paul you're going to experience and then you can demonstrate it amen to the people you preach to because remember the gospel does not come in word only but a power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost right and that power and demonstration is not just Supernatural Miracles that's part of it but that power and demonstration is when the Apostle Paul came he said I didn't come to you with man's wise words but the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost so what is he saying he's basically saying I haven't come to you with an intellectual understanding I've come with you re with a revelation I mean because the comfort is within me then I can impart this Revelation to you and you can walk on the same road with me so you can experience what I'm preaching about so it was an experience then it became a manifestation right I mean so the people saw what hey this guy what he's talking about it's not Theory it's a practical application right and if you can see your life cuz sometimes let's be honest let's go back to that picture we're all going to drive on the sidewalk I'm sorry but you're going to you're going to pull over you're going to drive cuz we're in these bodies it's the grace of God that brings us back onto the road thank you my Lord right but we should be shocked man I don't drive a you know all you guys who do like civil stuff and you drive trucks and big Utes and stuff there would have been a time maybe when you kind of gently went over the curb maybe but then it's like hey B you just you're just driving like you stole it you know we should never be like that in our Christian walk it should be a shock when we're on the we're on one side of the other when we actually feel ourselves in our spirit go onto the sidewalk it should be shocking where we you where once it's the love of God in your heart and you're so thankful you're saved and the next minute you're comparing yourself with others and how you dress with others and what they're doing with you what you're doing with others what's happened you've actually gone over the curb and you're on the sidewalk but when those thoughts come and you feel a cold indifference liberalism has a cold indifference too because it doesn't care about what's going on both are selfish but when that feeling comes in there should be a shock right but the thing is the longer you drive in a place the more you get used to it so we should never ever allow it to be well praise God I'm on the side I'm just m I'm just naturally more legalistic so I'm just going to this is I'm right this is just how I natur God made a variety of people this is just how I am but without the love of God if you truly have the love of God you won't stay that way or liberal well I'm just naturally just like this and this is my personality and this is you know and God his grace is so great I can do you know then you're on the side walk because I'm sure you've all experienced it when you first meet the Lord you don't want to harm him you don't want to hurt him you don't want to bring her reproach right isn't that right you don't want to you don't want to be a bill board advertising false religion you want to be a living billboard advertising Jesus saves Jesus is real his word is true this thing works amen I've tasted I've seen that the Lord is good and and that's the kind of billb we want to be but then what happens things can happen in life and because of this thing that there is going to be changed soon praise God we can end up on the sidewalk I say let him let him turn the sering we put you back on the road am Hallelujah right but the longer we go on the road the more used to it people can be I mean sorry on the sidewalk we get more used to driving there so may it always be a shock when you go over the curb right he say Lord I don't want to be driving here I don't want to hit anyone Lord I don't want to cause trouble around me because of where I'm driving where I'm walking my attitude towards others Lord put me back on the road amen praise the Lord so now so the Apostle Paul it was an experience right he said now if we did not he says for if Christ had was not raised your faith is in vain and ye are yet in your sins then we also which have fallen asleep in Christ have perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are all men most miserable so he's B saying if if this is all we have this is all our comfort we are the most miserable but he's basically saying we are not that way if you keep reading through no we are the most joyful most comforted people in the history of the world in 2024 you want to see people with comfort you want to see people with a stability in their life you want to see a people where their source of strength is not a hobby it's not a TV show it's not what's trending on Tik Tok no it is the Lord Jesus Christ they have a real source of comfort I'm looking at a whole bunch of them right here I mean when you really boil it down you say what is my source of comfort what is my strong tower Lord It's You amen it's your presence Lord It's Your word Lord where I can come into your presence Lord and you can bring me back on the road and I can Rejoice amen and I can let off the pressure no matter what's going on in life you say well I'm tired I'm strung out I'm worn out let off the pressure amen just let off the pressure you may be feeling tired in your body but let your spirit soar in the presence of God and give him praise this morning amen why because we have we have a comfort that cannot be taken from us amen the OST Paul and and and I'm just going to close with this scripture what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us so basically if God before me who can take him away from me who can who can separate me from my comfort he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall uh he not with him also freely uh give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth amen who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as is is written for thy sakes we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so the Apostle Paul was fully persuaded nothing could separate him from his comforter nothing could take him from his source of comfort and source of strength nothing could separate him amen and that's why he could let off the pressure that's why he could praise God in every situation because his comfort wasn't based on his location you take us we so we're a capital city you take the capital city of the Ukraine people living on the same planet in two different locations some people are comforted that we live on the back end of the Pacific and others are not comforted because the Russians are at the door their comfort is based on if they're not a believer that is their location but the believer their comfort is based on their location there in Christ am you see amen so how about you and I friends is he your source of comfort amen everything else will be gone it won't be a lasting Comfort but let me tell you he since 2007 he's my source of comfort he's my strong tower he's my refuge he's everything I have need of is him when I when pressure builds up I realize one thing Lord I'm sorry I haven't gone to your presence let off the pressure if I feel discomforted in myself I say Lord I'm sorry I'm not drawing strength from you my comfort amen and when you do that it pays off it's the greatest place to be and he goes with you wherever you go Hal hallelujah amen so friends I trust you have this Comfort let's have the musicians please uh this morning and we're just going to sing a few songs and I trust he's your rock in a weary land amen he's your shelter hallelujah amen and if he's not I say give him a go and not just a trial run just give everything to him he's worth it you want real Comfort your friends can't comfort you like he can this world can't comfort you like he can nothing can comfort you like he can don't let the devil lie you and say well what about this person what about this what about this he's lying cuz he's not allowed in this Comfort amen he's not allowed in the City of Refuge amen amen let's stand let's stand uh I want to sing that song that we um finished on why shall I worry when Giants come calling my name I have a source of comfort he's the and he's not just with me he's in me amen I have a rock to stand upon amen so let's just sing this then we'll pray then I'll I'll turn the service over to you

you forgive us Lord father may you create in us a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit within us Lord and dear God I pray that that that that truly you the God of All Comfort would live in our lives like never before that father that those who need care those that need help those that need strengthening patching up whatever it is father that you could administer your comfort through us to
