========================================

[Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to church how are you all this morning good it's good it's good to see you where are all the people that were here it feels like I've got an empty spot here where's sister Robin she here no sister where are all your friends Sister Louise where are they you're a very likable person I don't know why this would [Music] happen I think Christians are likable people you know whether people admit it or not people enjoy positive people you you know and being in the presence of positive people that make them feel good and Christians have that way about them if they're a True Believer because you you genuinely love other people and you only want the best for them so that will be what you how you interact will be based on that so that'll make people feel good you know and it'll be positive so and people always like that and um amen I think we're for a good time this morning I was reading Ecclesiastes this morning and um [Music] chapter 9 just talks about you know he says whether you're a righteous person or unrighteous you you get dealt the same hand you just get dealt bad things now and then doesn't matter what sort of life you live you will just get dealt with a certain thing and and he's going um Solomon's going through all these things but then he said you know but at the end of the day you're alive so uh like a living dog is better than a dead lion he's like you're alive at the end of it all you're still alive and and then he said so just let your garments always be white and anoint your head with oil and whatsoever your hand finds to do do it with all your might you know you're alive just go for it so we're all alive this morning there's nothing in the grave we're we're alive so this morning we found our hand here that what we find that we're about to do is praise the Lord so let's do it with all our might this morning and enter in and just have a good time in the Lord let's stand and just commit the service to the Lord this morning hely father we're grateful for this opportunity Lord that we can worship you we find Lord that our hand finds this to do this morning so we we want to play with all our might we want

worshippers is what we do hallelujah amen it's like to welcome Naomi God bless you great to have you here amen Elaine amen Joshua God bless bless you amen great to have you here this morning amen welcome amen God bless you let's just turn our Bibles to we're going to go to John uh chapter 4 and we're going to read from verse verse 10 here amen oh we're here wonderful we talk about living water today I trust you're drinking and joy Jo and your cup overflows you're drinking from the sorcerer amen amen John 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he wouldest have given thee Li and he would give thee Living Water just we're conscious of whose presence were in this morning cuz he said we two or three gathered in my name there I am yes in the midst thereof amen so we're really conscious of this one who says you know we can get living water from him the the woman sath unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw withth and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle absolutely Jesus answered and said unto her um whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman s saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious father truly we do want more lord it's our hearts cry Lord to have more of you to be in your presence dear God to hear your word that you would break the bread of life to us once again and as we bow our heads and our hearts in your presence we're asking that you would come come on the scene Lord touch every life Lord Jesus meet every situation we're so thankful Lord that you are truly the same yesterday today and forever so dear God we commit the service into your hands Lord those who may be watching by the way the streaming be there portion too Lord have your way touch every life Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask the things for your glory amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to talk about living water where Christine I was talking about it this week and I started looking into it and it's a wonderful thing all the way through the scripture so you know this this living water you know it's you it's um so I'm just trying to orientate myself here a little bit but you see this this living water that Jesus was talking about we know he's talking about the spirit of God that would come within man but we know man has always thirsted you know uh as as David would say in Psalms 42 he says to the chief musician uh mashkel for the um for the sons of Kora as the heart panteth after the water Brook so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God so David had a longing that really expresses the longing of every True Believer or actually every man woman and child called upon the Earth we are built to thirst whether you like it or not people people have a thirst in their lives and they'll try and satisfy it with fame or woman or money or popularity entertainment movies music whatever social media uh you know they will they will try and meet that thirst but I'm so thankful that this morning we have our satisfying portion of the of the true thirst quencher amen and it's not Powerade it's not Coke no sugar diet vanilla whatever whatever this is real this is a real drink right amen that can that can thirst that I mean that can meet The Thirst of your thirsting soul now I appreciate the fact we have this true lifegiving water this morning amen that that we don't drink from a a a man-made tank or a man-made well like you know like the woman at the well all she knew was a man-made well sure it was a Jacob a Believer who dug that well and he had a need to dig that well but it was a man-made well and Jesus was saying to her listen listen listen you don't this is not the well you really need amen you need a different kind of a resource you need a different kind of source of water and this water is going to satisfy your needs see she had a thirst for love she was looking for love in all the wrong places that's why she was married so many times and the last time she's just living with the God didn't even go through the motions of a wedding and you know but but she was thirsting but the but but but the source that she was trying to drink from did not meet that thirst amen but then when Jesus came her way and revealed himself to her amen she left that water pot she left that thing that thought that would meet her need amen and she ran to the city saying come see a man who's quenched my thirst come see a man who's met my longings amen come see a man who's met my desire amen and it changed her entire life because she be to be drinking from a different kind of a well aren't you glad we have that well today amen that well is Jesus Christ aren't you thankful that you know we don't drink from a man-made divis scheme as the Bible says we do not follow kindly devis fables of man amen this was not hatched up in Jeffersonville it wasn't hatched up in some Bible School amen but God birth his well he produced his word amen and we can drink from that well amen now I love this meaning of of of the word living I just put it all in there but I you it means to you because it's not dead water Jesus did not say I'm going to give you stagnated water or dead water or or Still Water there's no life in no it's living water I mean there's a life force in this water amen it's you know it's so it means to live to breathe to be among the living not lifeless not dead am mean to enjoy real life amen this what this living water does you can enjoy real life we don't live in a fantasy world we don't live in an alternative reality we live in the true reality amen we know who God is we know who the devil is we know what God's plan is we know what the devil's schemes are we're living in reality we don't have blinkers on of entertainment try and just whistle like brother Ram say you know you know this modern day it's like a it's like a kid going through a graveyard just whistling pretending they're not scared that's why there's all the comedies and different you know fantasy Realms and different things people living because it's like a boy going through a graveyard whistling at night pretending he's not scared so they're trying to trying to divert their attention to something else to try and satisfy that you to try and appease that fear they'll never do it they'll keep whistling through the graveyard but we don't need to whistle through a graveyard and and pretend we're not scared because the believer is not scared we don't need to be scared why cuz greater is he that's in you that's he that's within the world Amen so we don't have some so we can enjoy real life amen hallelujah hallelujah amen to have true life and be worthy of the name to be active blessed endless in the kingdom of God to live to P life in the manner of the living and acting it's of morals or character now I like this living water having vital power in itself and exerting the same power upon the soul am me that's why brother R says you can impart eternal life to someone me why the Living Water that's within you Christ himself Waters forth amen then that power doesn't just come on someone's body and they're healed though that's wonderful or upon their spirit and they're delivered but it comes into their soul and changes their nature from unbelief into Faith amen from Lost to found amen transforms them amen that's what the power that's within you this artisian well of the Holy Ghost that's within each and every one of us amen has the power within itself to exert it's a vital power in itself it exerts the same power upon the soul Hallelujah that's why we don't try this is not psychology we don't try and change people's thinking I mean because someone else will come along and change their thinking a different way this is not what Christianity is Christianity is a birth it's a life it's a transforming power I mean doesn't just change the thinging changes the heart the nature of man Hallelujah so we have this lifegiving water right now amen prise the Lord I'm thankful for that aren't you Hallelujah now we take water for granted in this well especially this part of the country we take water for granted right we get a lot of rain here if you go over the wire WP or you go up the East Coast you know it gets very dry they they they appreciate rain growing up in gizan we appreciated when the rain would come we had family who had farms and things and they had trouble with droughts and things but you know when you don't when you have water you can take it for granted when you don't have water you really appreciate it I remember being in pulani there we're in this hotel me and Brother Andy and you know all the AC units were on one circuit so as soon as Ian turned them on those died and the pumps died then you are really you know you thought you took for granted you turn a tap on this water when the pumps everything die you really value the water you have hallelujah amen now we don't have a power cut today in the Church of the Living God I mean we don't have a you know we you know it's like when Moses smoke the rock spoke to the rock you know it wasn't just a little trickle that came out of that rock no it was a gusher came out of that rock because it watered a million people and their cattle you know their livestock everything from One Source came out there abundance of water amen and this is what we have we have an abundance of water of the Holy Ghost this morning but we should never take it for granted amen we should appreciate every drop we should rejoice in every time it pours amen every time the Lord gives you a refreshing drink amen maybe you come come the morning thirsty troubl in your mind you know all kinds of things going but you just drink from him you get satisfied you get refreshed you get cooled down amen hallelujah what we should we should rejoice in every drop now praise the Lord hallelujah amen now there is power within this Fountain Hallelujah see in this life you've never seen I've never seen nothing so quenching as to be in the mountains and find as I preached on the other night that stream bubbling up it's lifegiving resource you'd be tired and thirsty fall down by the good stream way down where germs can't go way down hundreds of feet in the earth it's bubbling forth pure genuine lifegiving water we appreciate that now that's little how the Earth has so many streams with a refreshing water when you're thirsting and dying you get a good cold drink from that it'll help you to live but look where this one comes from from the Throne of God now he's talking about the Book of Revelation how under the throne there's those found there's a rivers of living water come from the Throne of God so we're not drinking from a natural stream I probably may sound redundant this morning but we're not drinking from a natural stream and when you open the word in faith and you read it you hear the message you hear a good anointed song you're not feeding from a natural source but you're feeding from a supernatural Source amen it's coming from the Throne of God God is pouring out virtue and strength and refreshment and and peace and joy amen out of this great Fountain Hallelujah into the lives of you and I now but we've got to realize that everyone actually has has a fountain it's not all the same water it can be good water it can be bad water just like James would say here behold we put bits in the hores mouths and they may obey us and we turn out their whole body behold also the ships um which though they be so great and are driven with with Fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small Helm with a server the governor listeth now you need a router on a boat here's another sailing story you know there was a there's this you you push the Ruder in and there's this clip that holds it in now one time we didn't have that clip in so you put the Ruder in but then because of things boyant it actually lifted out of its sockets and started floating away you try and sail a boat without a rudder it's like democracy all sales are no rud can go everywhere right so you know it seems like such a small thing but it's such has has so much power over the direction of the boat no even so the tongue is a little member this thing's a you know this thing's a muscle the tongue is a muscle the more you exercise it the stronger it gets but it depends what you're exercising it to amen it both HTH great things how many great things have you heard in your life great Promises of politicians great generals great whatever great Kings they promise the world and they can can supply nothing you know it's amazing how you know you know there's going to be election Cycles in America and different things and you know those politicians will stand up they'll give great rallies thousands of people will come and listen to them and those people really realize eventually you see enough elections you realize those guys are lying to you they're giving you all the promises Under the Sun they can't deliver none of them but yet people lap it up they drink it up they say you they get all rallied and excited and all these things see it is a little member but it boasteth great things now behold how great a matter this little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and both and hath been tamed of mankind that's quite a statement I thought there's a lot of animals out there in different things they've all been tamed but this thing has not been tamed that's why you need a greater one to come in and tame this tongue amen but the tongue can no man tame it's an unruly evil full of deadly poison wherewith bless we God even the father and wherewith curse We Men which are made after the multitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not so to be amen do the fountain send forth of the same place Sweet Water and bitter the answer is no I mean can the Fig Tree my brethren be Olive berries um either a Vine figs so can no Fountain both yields salt water and fresh so we all have a fountain in US amen we're born with a salty Fountain this is not the Bible salty of be salty this is not what I'm talking about here this is a poisonous Fountain am mean this is this is a this is a polluted Fountain amen that speaks forth amen speaks forth G and and gossip and hypocrisy and trouble and strife and envy and all these things it speaks these things and it doesn't it doesn't give satisfaction it doesn't give help you know there used to be back in the day there'd be all these gossip mags people just lap up and it was a friend of a friend of someone heard something about this person it's a big front page thing on these things people would lap it up you know they know this thing's not true they know the next Edition is it's going to be 180° a different way but people are feeding on this nonsense you know but what is it it's a fountain of polluted water speaking now how much more is that around the world than everything now the problem with a water that is salty is that eventually if you drink salt water you'll go insane now there's a saying when it comes to the ocean water water everywhere not a drop to drink it looks fine it could be the right temperature no floaties don't have to filter nothing you know it's it's pure there's no no no man-made contaminants nothing in there but if you drink that that's being the ocean you'll go mad cuz it say says salt water has has a a lot of salt in it so in spite of the fact you're drinking water the net effect is you actually you actually dehydrate you one of the signs of extreme dehydration is delirium and loss of cognitive function as the brain dehydrates it just cannot function so the more people drink salt water the crazier they get the brain they get Delirious they begin to see things that aren't really there they begin to be troubled they can't act normal they can't act sober they can't act normal they can't cognitive function they can't do the things they used to do why because they're drinking from the wrong Fountain amen and this world has been drinking from a wrong Fountain where people are being so caught up in things that aren't real aren't true sure all the feelings and emotions are there like someone who's delious generally they they they they really believe what they're in they really believe what they're seeing what they're experiencing what they're feeling what they're hearing but the reality of the situation is that thing is not there why they are Delirious amen so this so if we drink from a fountain that is salty amen we our brain will spiritual brain will shut down spiritually we won't behave how we should amen the things that we once were rejoicing in you see someone who's you know I'm sure you've seen movies or whatever people are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and one of the people just starts drinking salt water cuz they're so thirsty and of course they go crazy there's a bunch of craziness goes on the raft and drama and all these things and that's what happens is someone's so thirsty they're Longing To to to meet that desire in their life so they'll find something that's man-made something that's not of God and they'll drink from that and the biggest problem is where people have a hurt or or pain they will drink from that hurt or pain that is the worst kind of a saltwater drink you can have amen it's amazing when you think about you know I went on BBC the other day there was an article about about Taylor Swift and her her latest album and and and asked the question what are her songs about so I thought well what are her songs about and her songs are breakup songs they are about broken relationships funny feelings of going back to places you once lived but this person's there and this happened there and all these things all of her songs are breakup songs and I think apparently all of her albums are this way so what is it now she's had these bad experiences these salty experiences but now she's singing because it's a fountain within her that is pouring forth into the world and I was thinking what on Earth do people even like kids 10 years old have have with breakup songs they've never been in those experiences they know nothing of relationships they know nothing of dating they know nothing of courtship nothing of marriage nothing of they children but yet that Fountain is pouring into them so her pain of her experience of her life is coming into them and they're drinking from this thing what on Earth do you think that's doing to them it's dehydrating them it's troubling them that same trouble I remember when I was in the world you watch movies and and you know certain directors they would make certain kind of films they may be different in genre or different in the characters and everything but you always left with a funny feeling that's right why because that director is projecting to you that Fountain that's within them it doesn't give you peace doesn't give you Joy doesn't give you any happiness it makes you that why cuz you're because because of drinking that thing in into your spirit you're feeling the same way as that director and it's the same thing with people that you what you're listen to that kind of music like Taylor Swift whatever more but the thing is it's a it's an older one perverting the younger it's it's the older perverting the innocent so it's it's it's getting because people see the fame and the Glamour and all the all the money and all these things and they say I want to be like that but it's someone who's Delirious spiritually is now watering people who are actually not delirious but they get people get dehydrated spiritually their their Spirit gets who's with me this morning amen cuz you got to realize there's a spirit behind all these things I mean it's not because I don't like your music you know well I wouldn't like it in the world anyway but you see it's not because of a taste I'm saying these things I'm saying these things cuz it has an impact amen but so we should not drink of the things of the world and and become Delirious that we can't function in this world don't pull back on me just say Amen okay me because you got to realize there spiritual things now stagnant water kills amen this is stagnant water who would drink from that kind of water I don't see anyone lining up and say oh yum hope I get a cup full of the goobies you know I love those things between my teeth isn't that wonderful no no one's going to want to do that but yet people will will will drink up things spiritually because of pain with within their within their lives they will nurse and you know the reason why I think Taylor Swift is so popular is people have all those same kind of experiences they have the breakups and the pain and the hurt and the and the and the regret of their past so now she's feeding that that spirit in her is feeding and those things and it kind of feeds back and forth that's why you got to be careful what are you feeding on is it a pain in you drinking is it a pain or a hurt or this happen and this and why did this happen in trouble are you drinking in those are you feeding that thing because you got to realize that we are not ordained to feed pain amen no we have there's a bom and Gilead I mean there is a supernatural healing power am mean they can take the pain and turn it into a praise am mean it can take the disappointment give it and and and make a Hallelujah out of it amen cuz God can turn pain a bitter water into a Sweet Water amen Moses you the children of Israel they just had the great victory of the Red Sea they're walking three days through the desert man you'd be thirsty oh yeah you'd have your children saying Mama I'm thirsty Papa I'm thirsty and all these things and trouble and then finally they find this water and maybe they start running cuz they're excited there's water they begin to drink it and it's a bitter water and they say yeah they get mad at Moses and all these things and Moses is Guided by God see that tree on the bank cut it down put it in the put it in the pool it become Sweet Water amen so a bitter experience became sweet so they could have sat there and they could have just nursed that bitter experience and say why wo was me why' this happen this is wrong this should never if God is God if he really loved me this would never have happened or they could have cut that tree down put it in the experience and it would become a sweet experience well you say well how can it become sweet I don't know but take it to Calvary and let God do it for you amen I don't know the answer but God knows the answer amen you say well no I want to hold on to this pain you know pain invites the spirit amen hurt brings a you it's like a bruised cell in a body amen like that's how cancer gets in the prophecy is a cell gets bruised then a demon steps into that cell and begins to spread that cell and it becomes a Cancer and you know the strange thing is the body naturally cannot fight cancer doesn't identify it as the enemy so and that but sadly the reason that people die is because that cancer overwhelms the system the body can't operate more and it and it passes away but you see something's got to come and identify that thing as the enemy then the immune system within the body can fight the thing that's why there's chemotherapy and different things amen so that so so many things people can be feeding on and they don't realize that their spirit's being bruised and there's now A Life coming to that Spirit doesn't mean they're possessed it just means they're troubled there's a there's something coming to their system am me but they don't know it's the enemy they think it's they think they justify their position because of hurt well if you were there and this happened to you you would feel the same way probably but you go to Calvary you let God take it you get you let him heal you wash it out of you amen but the devil wants you to keep that thing because hey this happened to you and this is real sure I'm not I'm not downplaying anything that's happened to anybody I'm not the worst of thing I'm not down I'm not downplaying nothing right but don't hold on to that thing don't nurse that thing don't get used to the feeling that that memory gives you I mean you should be so offended at that thing that the devil's trespassing into your spirit say Satan get away in the name of Jesus Christ I may feel this way but this is not my identity this is this thing does not define me I mean many nations are founded on a you know Israel always goes back to 1948 or whenever the nation was founded you know and the wars they fought that's why they say never again they have their systems and their missiles and all these things because they say this is how we are founded this is how we're going to stay America has the Fourth of July cuz they remember you know you know the overthrow of the British and all these things we know that country slided from their Foundation but they used to be this is how we are this is how we were this is how we remain see and the thing is we must go back to our founding time well when was your founding time well before the foundation of the world am mean the lamb was slain my name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life amen and that's my identity that's the reason I am who I am amen that's my Foundation amen so I think we should stay with that Foundation amen if the Lord Jesus would die for you and I amen if he purchase our Redemption that should be the thing that defines us nothing else that's right hallelujah amen you take Israel you take America they've got they've had a lot of things in their history but they go back to that founding thing we've had a lot of things in our history and our Christian walk in our life but what's our founding thing what defines you does your pain Define you or does your identity in him does the power of the blood Define you what defines you this morning Hallelujah Lord amen the Lord Jesus defines me he's my identity that's my founding this is when this nation was founded the kingdom of God was founded before the foundation of the world and God has transmitted that Revelation down to the hearts of you and I that we realize we came from God we're going back to God and nothing is going to stop us am me we're not going to drink from stagnated water no more we're going to drink from The Well of Living Water and if the devil tries to put this poison down your throat you have right to say Satan take it away in the name of Jesus Christ I ain't drinking this nonsense no more Lord I ain't going to be dehydrated no more amen I'm not going to be drinking from The Salty Sea no more amen see it depends what you you're drinking this world has become drunk it says in Revelations that this see with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication this world's drunk it can't walk straight it Teeters left at teeter's right oh we're concer we're rightwing we're leftwing we're all kind of wing and teetering like this back and forth oh this happens knej reaction this happens knej reaction this happens you know it's teetering this whole world is drunk this whole world is drunk on entertainment all kinds of things but there's a people who are drunk on something different I mean there's a people who have drunk on something different and it's not this cup that they're drinking from they're drinking from the cup of blessing they're drinking from the cup of the Lord Jesus amen we're not drinking from this cup amen if you are caught up if your whole life is captivated because of social media you've just got to you got to meet that need you oh there's something in you you've got to have it I remember having those kind of things when I used to drink in the world naturally I got to have it the weekend's coming well we don't need to wait for the weekend Monday Monday jug day why but there's something you got to have it got trying to satisfy thirst trying to drown sorrow drown discontentment drown pain but then I found it different that actually that fountain found me ien I've began to drink from that Fountain Hallelujah and I wasn't trying to drown away pain I was just say it's just Joy unspeakable full of Glory I wasn't trying to drown you know unhappiness and pain and hurt no this drun this what we drink from doesn't suppress regret it doesn't suppress guilt it doesn't suppress pain it liberates us from all those things Hallelujah it takes it all away amen praise the Lord hallelujah but what we've got to do is we got to keep in mind that the Lord is coming to take us home Hallelujah it could be today it could be tomorrow well what if it's not today could be tomorrow what if it's not tomorrow could be the next day I'm going to keep looking for them am amen I'm a day closer than I was this time yesterday to his coming amen hallelujah oh that's Pie in the Sky people have been looking for that for Generations but there'll come a day we're living in the Rapture cycle now anyway I I don't know if you've been clued up on that amen but we're living in a Resurrection season but you see you see it's when when when people lose their sight of the reason they're there we're here that God can express himself to this Dying World we're here that his work can put on flesh we're here that he can be glorified we're here that he can be worshiped he's looking for a place of worship he's not looking for Four Walls of a building he's looking for a human soul he's looking for a place of his rest amen a place where he can receive joy and love and adoration you know we get the opportunity to love on God Amen to pour out our love and affection on him day by day week by week Hallelujah amen that's why we're built isn't that wonderful I'm I'm glad I'm not just a serap from saying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty with no relationship just almost just robotic I'm glad I'm not that way I'm glad there's a real love amen a real Joy why because he first loved me he purchased my salvation on calvary's tree amen amen but you see it says here um uh Jesus giving this Parable here he says and the Lord said who is it then that is faithful and a wise Steward of whom the Lord shall make rule over his household to give him their portion of meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing so that's why it's so important just live the sweet humble Christian Life whatever you're called to do in this world just live it with all your heart love him with all that within you then you'll be found doing amen amen I mean it's sorry it's simple but it is simple the gospel simple Walking with God is simple amen so whatever he's called you to do you just do it with all your heart love him with all that with all that is within you amen then you are you shall be found doing amen of a truth I say unto you he that will make him ruler over all that he hath but if that servant say in his heart it's not even out loud my Lord delayeth is coming have a secret meeting inside he's not coming yet I've got time I can go do and shall begin to beat the man's servants and maidens and to drink eat and drink and be drunken so what happens is people lose their sight they lose that Joy of their salvation they lose the reality that I was once lost and now I'm found they forget when God found them God's done so much for us children hasn't he hasn't he done so much for us he's poured out his anointing again and again he's answered prayer again and again and again in spite of our feelings our ups our Downs our troubles our fussing our fighting our stewing our all the he still spoils us he's done so much right now you you about all he's done if we had time we actually went seat by seat and you and and God brought to remembrance everything he's done for you we'd be here till the Rapture and maybe after the Millennium we'd be here a very long time amen so we must never ever forget those things but this is what happens when people when they forget those things then they begin to go to other sources what they begin to beat the men servants and the maidens they begin to cause trouble around them and to eat and drink and to be drunken but drunken with what because if you're drunk on the Holy Ghost you're not going to beat your brother or sister you're not going to cause you're only going to cause trouble to the devil's Kingdom right you're not going to cause trouble within right so they so these ones are drunken just like what we read about in Revelation 17 there they are drunk they get drunk with the people of the Earth from the cup of the so we don't want to drink from the wrong Fountain am mean you look at you look at how this you know what does this cause you say what does this cause well the Apostle Paul would Define it very well in second Timothy I trust you don't mind all the reading today he says this know also then the last days perilous time shall come we're living here they're not shall they've arrived okay you've been living in this probably your entire life all of us for men shall be lovers of their own selves see a Delirious person thinks they're awesome I'm just going to let that stick a Delirious person thinks they're always right a Delirious person thinks they can do no wrong a Delirious person points the finger at someone else I say Adam when he fell became delirious right before before he fell the his last his last act as a as a position Son of God was to to try and save Eve and then his first act as a fallen man was to blame Eve and blame God see that that is that is insanity see he says the woman you gave me God you actually you have set me up to fail God you've hatched this thing I've done nothing wrong I'm the innocent party you should be apologizing to me God look what you've arranged how how many people do that I'm not looking at anyone particular but how many people do that right they they say this is God's fault I'm going to be mad at him I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to give him the cold shoulder don't waste the time I'd rather spend the time worshiping God I'd rather spend the time praising God you say well you feel bad feel negative we don't worship our feelings amen this world is based on emotion living the now and living the moment and catching the you know trying to seek that high and all those things we don't live by our feelings we live by Revelation praise the Lord amen amen cover boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despises of those that are not dehydrated amen that have a sound mind traitors heady High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so he's talking about Christians here having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away what is that power they're denying the power that that power the power that the Lord can change them don't deny God can't help you don't deny God can't deliver you don't deny that your case is too hard God says is there anything too hard for me let's just let's just ask a question this may sound ridiculous but listen are you four days dead in the grave is your body decomposing yes sir no no you're here you're alive so no one's in lazarus's position this morning yeah but yet the resurrection and the life went by his way and said Lazarus come forth and the state he was in is not the state he stayed in so is anything too hard for God let's just just really just put it in perspective no nothing is too hard for God you say it's been too long too far whatever Moses was 40 years backsliding and God found him and do you know what was planted in his life before he went 40 years his mother telling him he's a promised child he's going to be the deliver he is the answer to the prophecy given to Abraham amen that God is going to bring the children of Israel out he's the answer to it so that was planted in his heart when he was a young boy because remember his mother raised him in Pharaoh's Palace amen as as the wetness when he was 40 years old he backslid ran away those things never left him yeah and God seeson God came and quickened that promise he quickened the seeds his mother saw into his life amen so never say anything's too hard for God he ran for 40 years and God got a hold of him amen so let's not let's not put any parameters saying it's too far gone nothing's too far gone amen but you see now whenever there's whenever there's a a a spill of stagnated fountain water where to get get the right team in to clean it up now this is not so years ago at work someone dropped a bottle of concentrated hydrochloric acid and it wasn't even in the building that that was in a hallway which was separated from a door from the rest of the building we had to evacuate that thing for 4 hours the whole building cuz of one bottle of acid was was spilled s sat in the sunshine for 4 hours until until the right people turned up and and dealt with that spill amen so so to me the key of the whole thing is that if there stagnated water being poured out leave that leave that situation leave that conversation and go to the prince of the in for a while amen and basking his goodness his word because that will start to cleanse the effects of it out of your life amen and then the holy call the call the Lord on the scene cuz he's the Hazmat man amen and he will CL that spill up Hallelujah and then you can walk on and and continue your life I hope that's all right well there's a lot of science things coming in well I'm sorry but you know hey I got a you know we're in the sunshine it was good but just get out in the sun again don't just sit there with all the fumes and all the trouble and all the problems no go out into the go out into the go out into the sunshine hallelujah hallelujah now it's amazing here in Jeremiah now you look at this this is the effect of drinking from drinking from the wrong Source he says have a nation changed their gods now just think about Jeremiah here Jeremiah is a prophet that God has sent to Israel because Israel's going to be carried away into captivity by the Babylonians the countdown was on and God sent him there to to swing to actually give Israel an opportunity to repent and come back to him but the very reason they ended up in that in that catastrophe was because they changed their gods to something that wasn't even a God that's what they've done see have a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their Glory from that which does not profit has this world helped anyone I'm talking about spiritually now has it helped anyone no no so so they've swapped and and and and this is what they've done they they they went from serving the lord uh the Lord Jehovah I say the Lord Jesus that was God in the Old Testament right the one who brought them out of Egypt the one who brought the plagues in Egypt the one who parted the Red Sea the one who brought them through the Wilderness the one who brought down the walls of Jericho the one who gave them the promised land the one who anointed David to kill Goliath the one who anointed the Mighty Men to do the mighty things they did the one who anointed Solomon to build the temple the one who anointed elah on Mount Carmel the one who did many mighty Works Hallelujah but yet they swapped him for a God that wasn't a God so they went from a fountain let's just but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit be astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate sayith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out systems broken systems which can hold no water so what's happened they have they they're basically drinking salt water again if I put it that way they went from this Fountain of Living Water that brought them Deliverance brought them healing brought them salvation you know answered their prayers you know did many mighty things and yet they hued out their own systems now a broken system here can't hold water it leaks it's a man-made tank it's not a god-given living water now I just thought of this so so this is here when when when I was in the Solomon Islands you can see this tank down the tank down the bottom here it's not assistant in the terms of a Bible one hun out of stone in the ground but it's a it's a man-made tank and a lot of those tanks were leaking cuz the Taps weren't properly put and they weren't sealed so the thing would be be leaking water you see here the um the the downpipe just goes into basically a hole in the top and it's got this uh Mish screen over it that's not even very small Mish now over those over those um roofs rats would run every night you hear them scur I've never seen so many rats in my life as I saw in that one trip at least about maybe two three every two or three minutes you you see rats running around inside and scarring jumping from roof to roof so here's these rats running on this roof and they and they do their business up there where's it going to end up in the tank you know leaves fall there where do they end up in the tank right even with that mesh there you know so they were drinking instead of drinking from the that they had in the place they had these man-made tanks we don't want to drink from a man-made tank because a man-made tank can bring disease I mean bugs can grow in there maybe there's mosquitoes growing in there all those kind of things see so we don't want to drink from that kind of thing it brings disease and sickness and trouble but you see we are not ordained to drink from a man-made tank amen but we have this Fountain of Living Water now you think about when the Lord Jesus would so I've been so much on the negative I don't mean to be he said Jesus would say the last day of the feast he says he says he that believeth on me if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water for this he spake he of the spirit which they which believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so those so he's saying come unto me and then out of you will come these fountains this River of of rivers multiple rivers of Living Water and to me it's the same because that rock that followed Israel in the wilderness that Moses smok the water came out that rock was Christ now that c now that rock comes into you and I I mean so the same volume of water that came out of there in the Old Testament as a shadow comes out of you and the reality amen that when people come into your presence amen you're not giving them stagnated water they don't become more dehydrated they don't become more Delirious they don't become more troubled no they they have a lifegiving resource they're drinking from amen it gives them a satisfi it gives them a peace it gives them a stability who's ever been so dehydrated man you just got to get a drink then you drink that drink and you're like oh I feel so much better I can think straight that headache goes that trouble goes why CU you're drinking from water that can help you Hallelujah and then so now spiritually now you got to realize this thing's in you if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is in you I mean you have you have the you have the thing that can meet every need in this world is within you amen if there's fire what puts out fire amen water amen so there's trouble there's a fire Cooks up in the family fussing fighting trouble whatever more there's a fountain of Living Water that's on tap amen amen hallelujah that you can let flow out of your life amen to put out the fires of unbelief and pressure and trouble and depression and Spirits coming all these things because remember this Fountain within us has a force behind it amen it's not something that you've got to suck out it's not saying you going to pump out am mean no it's pushing out am mean there's there's a force within us that pushes this water out amen and if there's a force pushing this water out it doesn't matter what the devil tries to pour in no the water that's pushing out of you is far greater Hallelujah am mean then that's what that is like you see this here there's this acid on the ground what is this guy doing he's got a Fountain of Living Water he's got this fire hose he's trying to use it who's with me today amen so instead of that acid being in trouble and all this is this could get real bad he's got this hose that's tapped into the main line Hallelujah he just opens that valve and starts hosing the thing down and then and then that acid doesn't just get diluted it gets washed away amen it's the same thing with you and our friends the devil can try and bring in an acid into your life into trouble all these things some potential very explosive event but you're tapped into the main line the main Line's in you Hallelujah amen so you can you can with prayer and supplication and genuine love amen let that Fountain flow out of your life amen cuz the devil wants us to shut down he wants us to think the problem's too big I can't cope I'm too stressed I can't do it no and then what does that do that tries to block up what's within you but there comes a point where the pressure who's ever seen like a damn burst who's ever seen there pressure builds up there's a crack right but there's such a force of that water behind that wall it just goes sh the devil can try and damn you up Hallelujah but we ain't Beaver making damn kind of people amen no no no we are water free flowing kind of people amen so the devil can try and put up a dam in your spirit trying to trouble you oh no you can't get rid of me this is too big this is too much of a problem but no there's a force within you am mean that that thing's got to give way Hallelujah so maybe just let it give away this morning in the name of Jesus Christ I mean don't let that wall of that feeling that resentment that pain down anyone say no I remember that time where that joy unspeakable full of Glory was flowing I remember the peace of God flooded my soul I remember that time when Jesus found me and he asked my prayer and gave me a real experience at the altar where the Holy Ghost F fell upon me and changed my life just go to think on those things and that Dam will just burst into a billion pieces and the water will flow again that's right Hallelujah I'm glad we have this Fountain you think about you know people are troubled people have needs people are sick people are troubled in their mind we have the water that can cure them that's right am mean we have the thing that can fix the world Amen why cuz we have this Fountain of Living Water amen you say well I'm unworthy to hold it but God put it in you amen God said now this is one of my Fountain Outlets amen that that are walking on two feet amen hallelujah amen what so what do we have we have a Fountain of Living Water amen it's artisian water it's not it's not Cy water me it's not a manmade tank that's dead and stagnated no it's bubbling up I mean Joy who seen a fountain bubble Hallelujah like brother he says you know went went by a went by a um you know stream it's bubbling he said well if the you the stream could talk he says you know Mr stream why do you bubble is it because the deer drinks from you the stream would say no is it because the beaver or the beer or whatever no is it cuz I drink from you maybe no why are you bubbling cuz there's a force Within Me bubbling I can't help but bubble huah it should be the same thing with you and I friends amen when we realize we are the Revival amen We Are The Awakening of the Bride is happening within us amen this morning amen it's not an event in the future no it is here amen God Has Come unto us and said listen you're my woman you're my bride you're part of me I've redeemed you by my blood amen you're not the devil's property you don't have to put up with him don't put up with those feelings that negativity that resentment that pain that hurt that depression those things are not yours amen no we have a Fountain of Living Well I've got joy like a fountain I got joy like a fountain I've got joy like a fountain in my soul Who's got that this morning H I got peace like a river Joy like a fountain love for my savior in my soul hallelujah amen see it's so I think it's so important that we that we begin to sing our experience amen just like Taylor Swift sings her experience we should sing our experience amen the Lord is my savior amen he redeem me amen when the when when when the lamb took the book Hallelujah they sung a new song they sung a new experience I mean they weren't singing the song of well where's the Redeemer and how's this going to end up and how's God going to finish the plan all these things they weren't singing that song see see John was weeping he was singing a song of mourning because he saw no man was found worthy to take the book amen all the prophets were there we were all there symbolically we're yeah we were there right cuz all the redeemed are there right none of us are worthy to to finish God's Plan of Redemption so he had a song of mourning and maybe this morning you're singing a song of mourning that doesn't mean you're not a Believer John was a Believer he he was the Beloved disciple are you with me this morning amen he and and and where he was currently living was a snake infested prison Island he was on pet M isn't amazing God will put you in a terrible place to reveal his his plan to you amen so there he is he's the Beloved disciple he but but he's singing a song of mourning but then when he saw the lamb take the book and mean he saw no no weep not John in other words John change your song I'm going to show you something that will cause you to Bubble again I will cause you something to bring joy again I'll CA I'll show you something that will cause you to sing a new song and he looked and he saw he said the lion of the tribe of Juda has prevailed amen but when he looked and saw he didn't see the lion he saw the lamb amen they're the same person but he didn't see someone that's going to bring judgment upon him no he saw his sacrifice he saw his husband he saw his King He Saw His Redeemer amen step forth Hallelujah and he begin to what they sing a new song Amen so I pray this morning let us sing a new song this morning am mean let us sing a new experience I me it's no longer mourning and sadness and pain and sorrow and regret no my redeemer has stepped forth this morning I me my redeemer has taken the book My Redeemer has placed his hand upon my life and said you are mine child you belong to me you don't belong to nothing else you are mine Hallelujah let us sing that kind of experience out May our life sing that song wherever we go through hard times we're still singing that song I know my redeemer lives now I know my redeemer lives amen you know through through hard times through sad times I known whom I have believed amen hallelujah that we can go rejoicing amen irrespective cuz remember we do not we should not worship our circumstance no we should worship him let him be our defining one in our lives amen let's have the musicians please this morning amen but I think we should go from mourning into dancing amen go from trouble into peace am mean go from hurt into healed amen just let God just let God do it you say well I've been damned up so long I can't remember just go back to that moment where he found you go back to that moment you just let that Aran well begin to pour forth amen amen but I'll say this now if your life is producing if your life around you hope I say this right may we only give out a fountain of fresh water not a salty one around us that makes people Delirious no our Liv should project a peace people should love to be around amen us man I want to go see brother s let's go see
