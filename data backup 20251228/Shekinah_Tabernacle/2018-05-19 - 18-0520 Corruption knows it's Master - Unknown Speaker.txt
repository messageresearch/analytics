quite apprehensive about the whole thing and and it was it turned out to be really good attended out to be to be nice and seeing seeing not in the world and not seeing everything that's wrong but seeing all the other things but the one thing that had happened and it was really it was actually quite amazing I was and when I still think about it just how good the Lord is that God is good and he keeps us safe and sound and the one died the first day that Tuesday morning we the main they were in the conference and in the the ladies decide it will go to the to one of the malls but then it happened that everybody split up and each was to they own and it was a bit of a mission getting on buses it's not as easy as it's here but yeah so I we went to them I went to the mall and I had a bit of a look around and got a few things and then I got on another bus I went on the northbound bus to the mall so my comments st. said okay so I need to take the southbound bus back but that wasn't the case I needed to take the northbound bus but okay so I got on the southbound bus so I'm sitting and I winked I said right at the back of the bus and I was so I'm trying to figure out where do I need to get off because also you can't ask the bus driver it was one of those big massive double buses but the bus driver was behind he wasn't a little enclosure so he can't really talk to him either okay so I got on the bus and I set and I saw as the door closed I saw okay so there is an indication of where I should get on and get off and I kind of figured out and I'm now here's me sitting on nervous I know I can't call hike because he's in the conference and as I'm sitting right at the back it was only me and then at one of the other stops there was a few guys that came on but it was it probably probably nothing would have happened but the way I felt in the way I experienced it was really I felt quite intimidating because it wasn't a few gangster guys and I was the only woman I was the only girl sitting there and the one tried to talk to me and I was like I'm all nervous I didn't really want to talk and I started I said and and as fear started groping my heart I was really starting to get so scared within myself because the girls and ladies would would probably feel the same being the only girl in all these strange men it's weird it doesn't feel you feel a bit intimidated but I come sitting and I'm as the fear just started to grab my heart this one gangster this one guy because they were they talk and it was foul language it was really it wasn't a nice situation and as he went and he gripped the pole of the bus on his arm was tattooed Matthew 28:20 I am with you always and as I read that it was like I knew that the Lord is they protected me regardless probably I would have gotten off the bus I would have been fine I would have been but just that fear gripped my heart and the Lord saw it right there and he stopped it and it was just it was amazing even in Vegas he can do that [Applause] than that true yes it is anymore testimony testimony time no yes you may but I was doing mom dad's tax inside and not see if I hear dad's down in the she'd he said all tweets he's fixing some bikes so I thought okay then that's fine because I kind of had to keep an eye on where it is and the next minute dad comes in and he's rubbing his chest like what's happened here and he said all right I see does Jordan because he's had a mammogram and ultrasound just recently some swelling that's going on in and I said as they're honoring you do you need to take a pen at all you all right a nude women he says I've just had a fall and I went what anyway he had taken a letter out of his sheet a great little long letter and he got it up somehow with any less than eighty percent of his heart and he never carries that letter I do but anyway he got up to the tree and there was a tree behind the garage and he had extended it and he climbed the ladder with an electric chainsaw and it chopped a branch and the letter had gone one way and he'd gone the other way but he doesn't remember he remembers waking up on the ground with the chainsaw any cheese I still read and I said well I'm see rid of the momento but you know recently what you he has captured through yes Amen you know he see yes this is my finger was still in the trigger and I was like oh praise the Lord but you know he said oh I realized you know I shouldn't have fired done it and Isis will okay it's a little bit late but it's you know believed you think that you shouldn't have done that now and I'm you know really pleased that God is in our house you know it's not up to me to keep a watch on your time because I care about your Prius I think thank you so much in your Prius in here just keeping constant because yeah it is some things are going downhill yeah and you know that's just of the world but I know that it generally mum and dad we're going to be all together I told Edie sister Robbins one um the Lord is our protector and our guide and for that I'm so thankful and before being a Christian I never knew the Lord so we did pray but we never prayed for protection and that's something that's become a part of our praises protection and then the Lord really does listen to those priests so he came to church two weeks ago to Keane and some of you love her - taste the money oh really and I gave the boys a packet of chips and sent them to the mother's room so they can sit in each one I'm busy cleaning and while I'm cleaning and not vacuuming thankfully I hear this air coming from the back and I'm like that does not sound good and so I start walking and I hear it going on and evasions like DM Liam cuz I media in front and I run to the back and I'm like Liam what's wrong and he's just going hey hey not like you have something stuck in your throat and he's just nodding his head away and so I'm I try to teach me first date a while back and this is where I'm also grateful that the law doesn't punish you when you don't listen so you try to teach me and I was just like yeah yeah the boys are fine I'm fine don't really need to know completely switched off and so I did the first thing my mommy taught me which was you stick your finger in a throat and you try and dislodge whatever's in the throat and I managed to completely put the chip in his a way that he couldn't get any ear at all and I tried a second time with a finger and nothing came out and the whole time I'm standing and I'm just thinking what did I mine say what did he say my price has gone blank I just couldn't remember anything and so I'm hitting him on his back because I know that's one of them but nothing's happening and the time that it took for his lips to start going blue was amazing it was seconds and I'm just saying then I'm just thinking I'm alone a church I have nobody what am I gonna do if we don't get this there's launched and I'm hitting him on the back and I'm just like what did I might say and I couldn't remember and I just grabbed him around the middle I just pushed it it came out thankful cause I might see if there was no any dislikes that would have done anything and I didn't know to do CPR and my son would have died that day I'm so thankful that the Lord then punish me for that listing and that he looks after my children every day and keeps him safe and he renew the love inside me kept my family to realize how precious life is on this earth so I just wanna say thank you God for your hand in my life [Applause] amen I greet you in the wonderful name for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's good to be home family you don't know how privileged we are to be one with the Lord to be found in his presence to have the freedom that we have here in New Zealand to be joined to be gathered in his name no pressure no oppression nothing I come from India being the tune of weeks and I bring you greetings from the pastor's that I met the lovely people but so oppressed so pressured by the Hindu spirit around him we've got the freedom we can sing on the top of our voices we can shout out to the Lord they can't do that they only got certain places that they can go to and they don't have that freedom and liberty that we have so keep them in your prayers there's two places that I met they two lovely men of God pastor Shinde Steven Shinde and pastor Jack Rodriguez they have their hearts all out for the Lord and for their people they're doing a wonderful job there in India or Mumbai there's about 28 churches in that area itself but because of the distance that they have to travel therefore there's so many churches so lots of churches are broken off from the main church and but when they have a gathering when they have a fellowship time when they have shared meetings everyone makes it the duty to get there so what I learnt there was the unity and the love that they have no matter we go to a church in Taranaki or to Auckland or to Christchurch when there's something happening when does a visiting minister when these praise and worship you know everyone comes together and that was wonderful to see wonderful to see the unity and I hope that can be something for us here in New Zealand as well you know stand by the pastor stand by the the other churches and stand as one so yes please pray for India and I'm glad to be back amen this thought occurred to me earlier as well when I was looking at that young man over there you know he walks us into this into this life he walks us through that door when we open up our eyes you know and it doesn't matter how lonely if you feel in your life when you close your eyes on this earth you will walk you out that door game you won't walk through that door line he walks you through that door amen and our thoughts with you guys as well in this time and with let's stand up [Music] everywhere I learned darkness was mild everywhere I turn [Music] but one day [Music] more these days

Lord who's thankful for the musicians amen amen praise the Lord isn't he wonderful if you want to turn in your Bibles while we're standing hallelujah to to Leviticus chapter 16 and as a privilege to be here amen and you know that I've personally gone under the knife of the divine physician and so you know this is the first time I preached since I you know to you guys anyway I've preached a lot and in the world and missions and things but here and so it's kind of almost like a debut for me I don't know how to explain it but it's really something precious amen and I'm just so thankful to the Lord hallelujah amen so I want to speak this morning on corruption knows its master who's thankful that even corruption knows its master Alleluia I will explain that if you don't know what that means soon amen but it's a good thing it's a very good thing amen hallelujah amen so let's just read from here I'm gonna put that in Spanish for the Spanish speakers so it says here and Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself and he shall take a sensor full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord and his hands full of sweet and since beaten small and bring it within the veil and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he died not so this was a very serious time you know these priests did not go into that place willy-nilly they were very serious and they were well prepared amen very serious you know and they were fear there was a fear of God because if they did something wrong they would die and I don't know in history sees it or not but they probably was a few high priests that did something wrong and they tied a little rope around him and pulled him out if he didn't come out after a certain amount of time so it was a very serious occasion this is the atonement sacrifice that was made once a year and he now I want emphasis on this but here and he shall take the blood off the Bullock which is a cow and well I think it's a cow anyway and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat Eastwood Eastwood physik that that's all symbolic spread at Eastwood and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen corruption knows its master it's actually a very powerful statement that was made by the prophet and he particularly made that statement when speaking about the story of Lazarus when Lazarus was raised up from the dead and he was am here was a man that had been dead for four days and after four days of being dead the body starts to decay and the nose starts to fallen and thinks that's a degrade and Jesus the fullness of the word the Son of God spoke a word saying come forth and when he spoke that word that power of that word went from here and this dimension went way out into the regions of Abraham's bosom where Lazarus had sold had left and gone to and it called him back but not only did it call his soul back into this dimension but it also took the corruption of the flesh the body that had already started rotting and stinking and it made it completely brand new again and that is the master of over corruption even corruption knows the master and when the master speaks there is nothing no power no corruption no rottenness no degradation no complex no spiritual fissure or rip in your spirit or anything that can resist the power of that voice and when that voice speaks everything in your life knows its master amen and we're completely dependent on him and that passage of Scripture that we just read that passage of Scripture I just read it's about the Feast of the atonement so once a year the high priest and the Old Testament had to take to her there was quite a process but you know just to brief you on that process he he had to kill Bullock and take the blood of that sacrifice and here as the high priest went beyond the veil and he took some coals and he took some incense and he and he popped and when he went in he had to put the incense on and the smell and the cloud that because the hot coals and incense went on had to basically put a big cloud inside the holy of holies so that he didn't die because there was a certain process and God was showing many types and things in there which we're not going to go into today but this one thing that he went in there and he took the blood of this sacrificed animal that took the place of Israel sins and he flipped it seven times on the mercy seat Eastwood because it was showing the sign and I will show I'll just basically tell you now that is symbolic of when Jesus went into the Holy of Holies once for all when he ascended up into heaven he was the high priest and it was his own blood the blood of God that was taken up into the hot real holy of Holy's now the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament was a shadow was a pattern that Moses saw but Jesus it was just a pattern a shadow of what the reality was the reality is that Jesus took his blood up into heaven and to the real Holy of Holies before the throne of the Almighty and he and for seven church ages for seven ages for two thousand years he was in that place and he sprinkled his blood his blood was on the mercy seat for seven church ages and the blood was sprinkled hitting Eastwood because the gospel is just like the Sun and it goes from west to east and it travels it's traveled around the earth that's headed east all the way around the earth the gospel for seven church ages and has gone around the earth and come right back and now it's heading east again that's the the West has been you know it's been saturated with the gospel yes there will be handfuls of purpose there's still people to come in there's still mercy but the predominant move of the gospel is really hitting the east and it's knocking on the doors of Jerusalem and Greece and these places that were first there it was the first places that it was it's returning back east again and we know that the days of the Gentiles mercy we are all Gentiles here there's no Jews here right no there may be but we are all Gentiles will come under a Gentile covenant so therefore the day of Gentile mercy is almost at its int we're in a gleaning time there is the mercy of God as going back to the Jews but for seven ages the blood of the of God himself the high priest himself God playing the part of the high priest and his great plan of redemption as in that Holy of Holies and he sprinkled blood on the mercy seat for seven ages Eastwood now I want to read this because I'm going to show you a pretty awesome type to tie in that story to the events that have happened today now yes the amazing thing is you know and been preached the sermon last Sunday and I this was already pre-prepared and everything you know the sermon so I might think I you know and he's just following along from brother Ben and just taking his notes and just you know you know I'll just make sure that I just carry on the foot but actually it was God God gave me all these thoughts before and I was sitting there going this was amazing this is amazing you know like it was just like everything that he preached it was like many the the same very same vain he inspired me to minister about today with the events of today just to give us an awareness and I know that we've probably heard some of these things before all if not all of these things before but you know as Peter said just bring these things to your remembrance because it's always good to have these things refreshed in our minds and while they looks now this is the Apostles you know this is the this is Acts chapter one and annex chapter one the Apostles that Jesus that just basically said his goodbyes and he's about to give been taken up into heaven and now after he's taken up they're all standing there looking up you know and it says here and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel white clothes which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven so here you and you've probably heard this but I'm going to say it again here is very an our generation we have seen the return in like manner and who knows what that is it's that's it happened in 1963 in a prophets ministry just before the seal was opened to reveal the person of Jesus Christ to the bride there he's come through he shows himself when seven angels lift the prophet went up into the sky and formed a cloud and the very high priest himself now after spending two thousand years sprinkling his blood on the mercy seat for seven ages and the gospel going around the earth he comes back out after his work has finished now it doesn't mean that Mercy's over because he is the seat of mercy he is the mercy of God he is mercy he is the very seat he's the place where mercy is issued from because he is the Christ the Son of God the propitiation for essence a piece of geography a piece of slab of gold that we may think is in heaven is not our mercy it was symbolic of a place where mirth where God met the people but where do we meet crock God through whom have we been reconciled to the Father through the seat of mercy which as a person which is Jesus Christ and yes the priesthood was a shadow could not perfectly tell the story that's why they had a high priest which was a man that had light passions was where and failed and did those things he had to go in once a year and the head there was a there was a mercy seat between the cherubims it was a place where God could come but it was not a perfect as the book of Hebrews is it was not perfect in every way there had to be something better come and the better was Christ himself who would and became who would be the very seat of mercy so here we have the high priest who went up and the Apostles were looking in and here God is showing us a story that in like manner he would return again and we saw and have witnessed the high priest himself step out from the veil of man's traditions step out from the veil of man's intellect step out from the veil that had imprisoned in hell back mercy and have not have mercy how back truth held back the people from really having an episodic experience having the full experience of what Calvary purchased and that's what Satan did is he dumbed down the truths little by little until that there was hardly anything there and you have a Catholic Church you have Roman Catholicism and that's all that was left almost and the underground church and the people that stood for what they could was persecuted and beaten down and it was as brother Branham calls it a stump that a bride tree the tree of God's church had become done to a stump but God said I would restore amen and the only way to restore it back as that he would come himself amen that he himself would descend and he would reveal himself amen but he didn't do it straightaway he God used a process where he he prepared the ground he sent Luther he sent he he freed the people from trying to earn their salvation we cannot earn our salvation and he freed the people because Roman Catholicism based basically put it that you have to do so many things and penance and follow the priest to have salvation even not even know if you've got it completely and look God said Luther to free the people by a justification by faith that you could believe and receive your salvation and then he furthered it along with in the move and the time of John Wesley and the Methodist movement and cleaned the people's lives by the power of his blood by the power of His Holy Spirit he cleaned the people's lives and then in the time of the Pentecostal outpouring Azusa Street when the gifts were restored he started bringing power back to the church bringing these operations to help the church back but he wasn't finished he was preparing the ground he was preparing the people that so they that the bride could receive the person yes it was the person all the way through Christ was that he revealed himself in part so he only gave a portion of himself he only revealed a portion of himself but then in the end time the high priest breaks the veil of men's traditions and he steps out and he reveals himself and like manner as they had seen him go and a cloud appeared over Sunset mountain and went from there single sunset mountain and went froze ona right down the east coast and it was seen by many millions and it was witnessed because you see Jesus said there would be signs in the heaven and the end times and this was a sign that the high priest had returned and not just the high priest remember God plays roles he has he has certain roles that he plays in one of the roles is the white wood judge and this what when when brother Branham didn't know what all men he just thought that was a cloud and he thought it was amazing and then the Lord said turn it to the right anti-clockwise or clockwise can't remember Matt Turner and he saw the white winged judge we see the Hoffman's head of Christ and we see the white wig on him and that's to show that the judge has come the king has come to place judgment judgment on those that reject and also a judgment on those that receive and he judges mercy any judges condemnation there is a definitive ministry that would come in the end time to bring a definitive prophesy a sure word that we could hang our lives upon amen because now it's not we're not just tossed about by every wind of doctrine we're not looking at the fashions of Christianity and seeing the new man of the hour that has some funny idea that may be slightly different from what it's been and it changes and it changes and it changes what we're having entered into is a personal relationship with the revealed high priest who's the person has come and the that's why the more you look into the word the more that he shows you it becomes richer and deeper and more clear amen and your life becomes more holy more like him not because you have to because that's happening to you you're under an anointing to bring you to perfection you're under an anointing to make you ready for a rapture and it's not something you've earned you can't earn it it's not something that you can study out and completely it's something that he gives you it's something that he reveals to you and unfolds to you personally in your walk with him amen and that's why you know my prayer I said let's enjoy our life with the Lord don't get wound up and flustered that you haven't prayed enough or that you when you do pray on just not been in turn because I'm only gonna have 10 minutes and dinner you're just gonna you know get flustered you don't want to do that you want even if it's two minutes enjoy it have a look have a good time of the Lord for two minutes amen enjoy your relationship with them you know that if you enjoy the two minutes eventually you'll enjoy an hour and not because you have to or you you will just because when you're relaxed and when you're enjoying the presence of God you can actually grow and you can do things that help you you know but when you're all tense and you get flustered I'm preaching to myself just as good man because I'm a zealous person and zealous people you know they can struggle with these things but we all struggle with the same things you know well and it's if we get all tense we it's very hard for us to enjoy it and then you just don't want to do it anymore the devil just get sins that's working and you miss out and then you start getting carnally minded and you start thinking carnal thoughts and carnal out the carnal mind is enmity with against God it's very difficult but the good thing is if we can just rest and relax and allow God and enjoy our relationship enjoy our time amen enjoy the sermon amen just just don't worry about time amen and now I'm not saying that because I'm going to preach for three hours amen but we have into the eternity hallelujah so the high priest has returned from his seven ages of blood sprinkling and you so I basically given you a bit of a background on this type here because it is actually quite significant to us because we are a privileged people in this hour sorry I should have put that in Spanish Bernie's not here he can see it as he watching oh good I should put that on for him um so the it's quite amazing John's song service was perfectly you know matching so I want to talk a little bit about the Jew beliee as well because the you know I read that first passage of Scripture that I've read there is about the atonement the Feast of the atonement and the once a year the high priests had to go and he made an atonement sacrifice for the people without that Israel had no fellowship with God they had there was no fellowship without that atonement it was a vitally important for Israel that the high priest would make that one sacrifice per year oh that's you know there's there was hundreds of other sacrifices and other offerings and everything but this one central atonement sacrifice was very vital for Israel's fellowship with God and without that they did not have God amongst them there was no fellowship without the shedding of this blood that's why we realized that when Christ ascended up and his blood went on this mercy was sprinkled over the mercy seat for seven ages that is of vital importance that that happened because the blood that paid the sin the blood that was spilled a human's blood that was spilled was perfect blood it answered the call for men to pay his penalty it answered it and and and because of that the fellowship was restored amen hallelujah and so I want to just just so you can you know we know about the seven feasts bin's preached on the seven feasts and typed in with Christ and they are all pointing towards Christ and I'm not going to go into all of them I don't understand it all completely I mean I can I have my thoughts but to really grasp the whole thing I don't fully understand every part of it so the parts that I do understand I will share so the feasts are now down I'm only going to do the last one two three four four because these ones I really understand I can see it I can just see it clearly of the fulfillment of certain events that have happened in our day match the feasts there so the feast of Pentecost the Pentecost the feast was the time of the harvest it was fifty days after the Passover and we know that the the the fulfillment of the Old Testament was that Jesus was the Passover lamb 2,000 years ago the lamb was sacrificed by the priests the priests sacrificed the Lamb of God and that they became that he became the Passover lamb and then he he went down into hell and he took the keys off Satan and he came back up amen and then he and then he ascended up and fifty days later typing the feast the Spirit of God was poured out on the people and the feast of Pentecost was made with bread they had living in it and that was a symbol of the church that was the bread of God and the church has living inside them you know we have we have old natures and we're in a battle we're in the land we're in the promised land and yet we're fighting enemies still it's still things happening they're still victories to be won it's not we're not in a perfect environment yet amen as much as our Solars and our future as sealed to a perfect environment we are still in the battle we're still fighting we're still pressing in with all of our hearts pressing the battle amen so the Feast of Pentecost happened 50 days after the Passover and so the Feast of Pentecost the Pentecostal outpouring of the Spirit happened in 1906 and the gifts were restored then after the feast of Pentecost there was the Feast of Trumpets I'm sorry if I'm going too fast of all of us but for the interest of time so the Feast of Trumpets the purpose of that Feast of Trumpets that came after the feast of Pentecost was to gather Azrael it was to gather them together and so two of these trumpets the seven trumpets of God and the Feast of Trumpets in our day we have the fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet was World War one and World War two there was three woes and those were the two first woes and they were this first trumpet and the sixth trumpet so that places it clearly one of the clearest pieces of scripture to place the in time so now we have an accurate time measurement from the Feast of Trumpets which the fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet who was the very center of attention of those two things the Jews what happened after World War two the Jews went home the Jews were in their land again their Feast of Trumpets called Israel - the atonement in the atonement now because remember Israel Israel doesn't come to the atonement the full atonement until before us we come in first the Gentiles come in first because they had their chance 2,000 years ago when Jesus ministered and the Apostles ministered and then the mercy left the Jews and came to the Gentiles so now the atonement the the the high priest himself 2,000 years ago went up and entered into the Holy of Holies and for seven ages he sprinkled his blood over the mercy seat and then in 1963 he came back out of that Holy of Holies to reveal himself to his bride to prepare her so that he might present her to himself in Ephesians 5 it says that we would be washed by the water of the word and that he who has revealed himself and come down in the last days to reveal himself to present the bride back to himself an eternity and I'll show you that duality for this atonement here because you see there was an atonement yearly in Israel every year the priest winter and and he made this atonement but then every fourteen ninth years so seven years there was sip every sip yeah it's seven years there was a there was a certain feast there was a certain celebration but then in the 49th year which was seven lots of seven there was a Jubilee and that Jubilee when that happened the the atonement sacrifice was the same but then when the atonement was made there was a Jubilee trumpet that sounded after the high priest came out from behind the veil so the high priest came out after seven Church ages and when he came out it wasn't just another atonement now this was an atonement that also had another attachment if I want to use our daily days language had an attachment with the atonement sacrifice when the atonement himself was revealed the high priest was revealed this the jubilee trumpet was also accompanied now the jubilee trumpet and the atonement happened on the tenth day of the seventh month and I want to ask you a question what are the numbers is 10 7 revelation 10 7 what was that in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished what's he sounding he's sounding a jubilee trumpet to sit the bride free amen to sit her completely free from everything that is not of God everything and that's why we are on a journey that we are being completely set free of everything that's why we have trials that's why things come into our life that we don't want to happen but then in the end of it all we've realized man that was so good that there happen it might have been embarrassing to us or it might have been hurt it might have hurt us initially but it was the master swordsman it was the king and the divine physician and the scalpel of his word to perform an intricate operation on the heart because the jubilee trumpet has sounded because the high priest has revealed himself and our day amen to come in the person of Jesus Christ and then obviously you have the Feast of Tabernacles which is the seventh feast and that feast is the type of the Millennium so the returned in 63 that cloud took him up the cloud revealed his return the white work judge appears through revelation 10 7 and now I want to go to for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep that preventers we shall not precede them we shall not bow before them they're going to come first and then we're going to come up together for the Lord Himself now here is the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout Amen with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air but I thought the Lord Himself descended with a shout so here we had the Lord with us already and yet he's going to take us up to where to meet the Lord in the air so there is a dual revelation of God here there is a revelation where he has come yes he symbolically showed himself physically in a cloud but yet it was a spiritual revelation of the high priest it wasn't a physical corporal coming it was a spiritual reveal of Christ Himself who would come and reveal himself through the office of a prophet who would speak the word and lay out the seed through the jubilee trumpet saying freedom and he would preach a message that would give you your inheritance and seed for amen and then the Prophet would be taken away but the high priest would remain the the full complete Ministry of Christ would remain among the people to take what that seventh angel jubilee trumpet sounded and make it live and take what was in seed form and anoint of fivefold ministry to preach the seed form and open it and reveal it further and further and further that's why you will see the fivefold ministry has has grown it hasn't just been the same the understanding the revelation the personality of the fivefold ministry has become more like Christ because Christ is in those gifts operating those gifts operating in the people so that he himself would present her up in eternity back to himself again here you find the difference between time and eternity this is where Trinitarians get it all funny and mixed up they think that is two people but it's one person who reveals himself spiritually on the earth and time and yet he's still up there and he can communicate with that is eternal part of himself as much as we don't understand how that all works and we can't comprehend their that is what is going on there this is what's happening and this is exactly what we're reading here that the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with a message with a message to and a trumpet to shout to sit Rahab free to sin a bride free who was in corruption because he is the master over corruption and he this whole purpose for him to come this whole purpose because before he came the Pentecostal church the pinnacle of the revelation the pinnacle or the kiss restored was full of corruption full of even though they're in the perfect will of God in their day it was still full of corruption it was a lot of corruption in there amen if I may say this and I might get in trouble for this I hope not but if I may say this that even when the message first came the bribe was full of corruption and actually I can say this still my new forms of corruption inside but that's getting dealt with because the master over corruption is here to take those tiny little things that are so small and sometimes the smallest things are actually bigger things whether it's negative or positive you think you know and we we we look at our situation we look at the move of God and you know may God help me to just show you this is a magnificent event that's taking place and it seems so humble it seems so small we think it's going to be this prestigious thing that one of the greatest events Somoza sublime events in history it's taking place right now you know the one who hung on Calvary the one that purchased it all has returned to bring the people and prepare it and to take her into the sky and it's so humble and it's so small seemingly but the things that are so seemingly small can be massive can be major that's why the Bible says it's not despised the day of small things because when were in eternity when were in heaven we'll realize how major some of these things and we might think of a little decision that we've made or something that we've done and it just seems like it's just so insignificant but when you get there you're gonna realize how massive and how amazing how monumental and momentous these little things that God might just give you a little inspiration go do this and you go and do it and you don't feel nothing and then there's this butterfly effect that's changed the whole person's life just be obedient you know when God tells you to do something or he gives you an inspiration you might not think of it being very much just follow that voice follow Christ follow him he won't lead you astray Alleluia so here we have the two mentions of the Lord the spiritual revelation on the earth and the physical revelation and the ear because when we after all the corruption is dealt with all those little corrupt abilities inside after all that's been dealt with and we're ready and we and we and the dead in Christ rise up and together we are caught up into the into the air and we see him because we're in a glorified body we will be able to see the corporal body of Christ you know and we'll be able to enter into that realm of heaven and see these things clearly I'll give that for Billy so then as I a 38 16 to 17 it says because our deliverance from the pit of corruption Oh Lord by these things men live and in all these things as the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live behold for peace I had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption Oh hallelujah amen Oh what will we do about that love Alleluia that just makes me feel very thankful and so like you know you just feel helpless in a sense like you're just absolutely a hundred percent completely dependent on His mercy on his love towards you Amen you know it's at the Pharisees you had not the love of God in you that's why you can't receive me but there is a love that God has and he's placed it inside of us and that's why you can see him that's why when he does something you're seeing it because the love of God is in you Alleluia you're being connected to the very revelation of who he is what he's doing now the word corruption for thora as in the Greek decay that is ruin spontaneous or afflict inflicted literally or figuratively corruption destroy perish and in corruption our fourth hacia ather sia in corrupt in corruptibility generally unending existence figuratively genuineness immortality and corruption and sincerity real sincerity you know sincerity is you becoming dead to yourself completely and the very origin of your makeup the very that who you really are as expressed in your life now when I say who you really are not talking about your old nature now I'm talking about the one that was in God before the foundation of the world so we came from God and we're going back to God and because we came from God in the going back to God we that sincerity that God brings us to the true sincerity means that we our life becomes a clear representation of that now God we're born in corruption we've come into the world speaking lies and and we and all of these things but inside of us as a seed of and corruption inside of us is the love of God inside of us is that true person and when Christ comes and reveals himself to us what has whole intention is to is to speak over our lives and take us from a state of and corruption and bring us up a state of corruption and bring us up into a state of and corruption he wants to reveal himself in this in time personally to each one of us so that we can see a true man a true image of purity a true image lived before us so that we in our conscious and subconscious mind can behold that image behold that life it's not just an intellectual thing you can read the scriptures on an intellectual level and you might get good things and you might understand doctrines but there's a deeper level of reading the scripture and it is not an intellectual level it's a subconscious spiritual level that when you read a scripture there is an image there is a life from Genesis to Revelation there is a life that has been opened in the end time before it was open these were just stories these were just history it was even Christ was a historical idea - the denominational and to the classical understanding it was all a bit intellectual but then when it all came open and life now and this is what we're privileged to see this is the face of God it's his life that's his face shining like the sun shining on you in me so that now we reread the Bible we're not just reading stories where beholding a life an anointed eternal life that never ends and it's a power of an endless life in Christ that we behold and as we see that life on a deep on the deepest level of our existence we are being changed from glory to glory we are beholding an image and actually we are fearing an image we are carrying an image and that image is the image that we are beholding because the word is open the Bible is open the lives are open why are we seeing the lives of all these Old Testament characters it seems to be every story just starts to pour out a revelation of our hour and what we what's happening and tells us what's going to happen in the future and tells us all these things why is because their life came open and we're not just beholding the story anymore the revelation of a life has happened and it's changing us it's giving us rapturing faith because it's not only now what we're not just we're not just hid reading about stories now where there is a rapturing faith in the life that they are but who wrote the Bible God wrote the Bible but these people when you think meant ok so God you know he he orchestrated all their lives and he he sent our Ruth you must do this and you have to do that and then when you go there you must say all this and this is your lines you know and you have to do it all just like this because I'm writing a Bible here this is the Bible you know this is prophecy this is this is going to be accurate so you think now and now you know in an intellectual way you that's the only way you could do that but God and his manifold grace and understanding with never interfering with free will he all these lives all these people wrote intricate prophecy and accurate prophecies with their lives and their lives become the Bible the actions the reactions the decisions the successes the failures every part of their lives becomes the Bible and then and and you know and the time of Daniel Daniel starts breaking into the revelation of all this and gosse's seal it up to the time of the end seal it up Daniel because it's not the time for this to be known but then in the time of the end here comes the high priest himself after the earth has been filled with the smoke he'll had broken up in Revelation 9 and all the smoke and everything was all confused God Himself comes down the high priest has revealed from out of the veil of men's traditions men's traditions ahead it all sorted out like the Pharisees all sorted out this is how it's all going to be in the church was all structured and order and the Pentecostal church was denominating and it was all going its own way and then God comes amen and then the high priest comes amen not just comes to you know as a show not just to come to increase faith but to come with an open book come to with and it says his face was shining like the Sun how do we see that how does that come to us yes we can have a personal revelation and see a vision of Christ that's amazing and praise the Lord if that's the way he speaks to you but not everybody has that no and not everyone you know that's not a common thing but the common thing that everybody has as they have a Bible and now that Bible is not sealed anymore amen God did not say seal it up anymore amen he says time to open amen and he opened it and all the lives now all those lives are now opened up and what are you beholding you'll be holding his face shining like a Sun and that's why you're going from glory to glory that's why you're under the influence of the Jubilee hallelujah you didn't just walk free when you heard that Jubilee you walking free you're always free you keep walking free I sing that song in my mind I walked free meaning I just keep walking free I'm just free amen because I'm under the influence of freedom I'm under the influence of the Liberty of God's Holy Spirit hallelujah because this is why he's coming this time amen and now the whole purpose you know sorry the main purpose not the hope if it's the main purpose is how you look at it is for this message for the Ministry of William Branham yes there was doctrinal stuff and everything like that and all the teaching and stuff but the main purpose was an introduction it was an introduction it came to introduce someone a man liked on the Baptist he introduced a lamb of God behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world and here in a meantime another of men anointed of the spiritual larger spirit Elijah behold the lamb of God which hung on Calvary which purchased you he's come to claim you now he's come to take you up he's come to prepare you he's come to reveal himself to you he's come with a jubilee trumpet to set you free from your old life - no matter how corrupt it's been no matter how hard it's been no matter how many hard trials no matter how much you've been crushed down to even a stub he's come to bring you back amen he's come to restore you completely hallelujah he's come to annihilate your old past amen right yes for thou has done love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou has cast all my sins behind my back and you're so glad about that all my sins not the sum of them not just the ones that weren't so bad in your thinking but all of them amen this is the immutable Council of God and he swore by an oath that it would happen Amen hallelujah amen amen so in corruption sincerity hallelu genuineness immortality there's a genuineness in their endless life and that life has been on display to you so when you read the Bible you know you can read it please study it out through notes and do however you want to study it out and an intellectual if you want to do that's fine but there's another level that you can just enjoy just enjoy this level realize that when you're reading it now and this haven't helped me so much when you know the Lord showed me this and that I could read it and not get pressure to try and see something not get pressure to try and figure it out or see the type but just read it and go you know what that's open now I the lives are open and I'm just going to let the Bible bless me I'm going to let the life that's on display let that power of an endless life that face that shone like the Sun let it germinate the seeds in my life there's a power and he the person who is here who has opened at all who was standing there saying come and eat from my hand it's open here eat the book eat the word become part of the word that one you know just just just have that just enjoy it be in an atmosphere even if it's just five minutes enjoy it you'll get far more out of it than an hour of stress an hour of trying to study it out like you know we study in university and college and movie and we've got to really fire up the intellect you know and think you don't have to do that if you there's nothing wrong with doing that you're allowed to do that but that there is you know you you don't have to you know and you can enjoy both sides and I enjoy both sides you know sometimes I like to you know I can see something and I just write it all down and kind of lay it all out how at all I think it goes and this in in a lot of the times I just sit there and I just go Lord you know see it you said that if I look at hold the image of your life I'm going to be changed and so I just read the Gospels and I and I don't try and figure a real piece it together or see it how it's typed in our day or typed in the past I just want to read it and enjoy how you reacted to this and how you when they said this you did this and when that situation arose this is how you handled it and it's like a deep change inside me because it's open and it's not just open to a prophet it's not just it's open to Paul amen it's open for us to receive it's open because he has called John and rather been preached on it last week John types the bride put yourself in John's shoes John heard a voice which speaketh from heaven saying go and take the book out of the hands and eat it at a hence of the one that standing upon the sea and upon you so take the book out of the hands of the Lord Himself this is our relationship we we don't you know we don't put brother Branham in front of our relationship you know with Christ now people think that when they look out what Kahana they think that he's like this you know his message the truth that he preached the introduction we couldn't have that without that that's all part of it but the the very relationship the very that our whole life as as we've been introduced if we if we haven't been introduced and all we see as a messenger then that's exactly what they're people you know think about it you know they think oh you're in a cult and you're doing these things because you're following us man and there are people that would be in that situation where all they see is a messenger but they haven't actually been introduced to the one he came to introduce but we have been introduced amen the purpose of the of the elijah ministry was to introduce the Lamb of God amen introduced the one who created the earth the one who spoken the planets came in amen the one who spoke to Abraham the one that spoke to all the prophets are revealed and so for all those the one that hung on Calvary as our friend we've been introduced to him he's come out of history he's no longer yes he is the history he's it's his story you know that he's and he's the future but we've been introduced to the person to him the present you know the Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and this is maybe a slightly different angle on the scripture that I believe this is the right angle and Georgia be happy because you know George is very you know particular about these things and it's he says to the Pharisees you search the Scriptures and earn them you think you have eternal life and you don't come to me what he says he sang to them you're searching the letter and you're getting so involved in the letter and you figured it all out and you sink your eternal life as and you're studying of this letter and you're not even coming you don't come to me brother branham mentioned many times on his message to know him as life he never said but he didn't say no and don't study the word and don't have that basis in your life he's but-but-but the purpose the revelation of the word of him he is the word he is the full revelation of it Amen hallelujah glory amen it's all in Spanish now 1 Corinthians 15 verse 47 to 49 oh sorry 51 to 53 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality amen so there's two like events taking place it is and there's corruption putting on in corruption and then there's mortal putting on immortality so this so there's a spiritual change that's happening now where the corruptible is putting on in corruption because you're holding an image you're seeing a life expressed in the Bible and in reality because the Bible the message everything that's been happened and being spoken today has to put on flesh excuse me so you're seeing it we're now beholding that and and and we're going from glory to glory to glory because we're beholding him and his fullness amen and that word born is to have a burden to wear as clothing or a constant accompaniment it's for real to have a burden that is by analogy to wear as clothing or a constant accompaniment the image you're putting on an image this is taking place now this is the this the image is the very complete view it's the very image that you've beheld all your life and maybe you know we didn't start off on a good note you know our parents lived a certain image in front of us they were a certain way our nation presented a certain culture to us Hollywood just came in a cancer and just filled us with an image that if we watch TV you know and and and and you beheld the stuff and you became that's who you think you are the image is who you think you are it's who you are deep it's a deep I don't even know how to you know what I mean it's and and and whatever you beheld is what you became and then and you can see now many people even Christianity christened them if they'd not be holding this image of the Bible of the word the full revelation of Jesus Christ the one that's got the open book that's coming has face shining like the Sun to combat that to smoke out of the pit that one if they're not holding their watch what we have images look at the image of their lives it's the images Hollywood the images heavy metal the images rap music it's in the churches it's everywhere it's through the world because they were holding an image that's who they are but we are beholding a different image we are beholding an eternal image we are beholding a heavily culture and we are becoming like that because we're looking at that we're seeing that we're hearing that it's going into all our senses our five senses are getting you know the eardrums are vibrating with the vibration of heavenly culture heavenly language amen we're hearing this stuff and it's on a deeper level we don't might not understand everything will follow everything but there's a heavenly language coming in and it's going into our spirit it's seeping into our heart and it's infiltrating every part of our life amen it's getting down deep into the nitty gritty stuff and changing us and helping us and raising up a standard and it's causing a revolution to take place within our lives that's why we're going through the trial that's why we're having a hard time because these things have to be filtered out pushed out that's why we get sick because we need to find out who's the rahova Ruffo you know who's our healer and and maybe that we start to contemplate things a bit more when we get sick or when we go through something we started look and think on things and we've been we see in the word and we find something in there and it opens up to us and and and we behold that life that's on display and their image we start to carry and no longer do we carry an image of this earth no longer do we carry an image of Hollywood an image that Satan has constructed to pull humans from the economy of God but we're beholding an image and we're wearing a new image hallelujah and WIC corruption is going to put on incorruption and it's putting it on it says put off the old man in his works and put me on Jesus Christ where that image behold that image hallelujah Amy yep that's right and in 1 Corinthians 15 47 to 49 it says the first man is of the earth earthy swim Adam the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly 2 Corinthians 3:16 - 18 it says nevertheless now this is a key here and I've underlined this I think so nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord this is like you know when it shall turn to the Lord there's a time you know where you know man kind of had a bit of control here and they were figuring it all out then one day God comes on the scene you know one day the high priest is revealed again and one day he sticks out from behind the veil and mentions this is time shall be no law I'm not going to delay this anymore I'm going to come and I'm going to go right into the fire that these people are in and I'm going to save them from the fire I'm gonna save them from Babylon I'm gonna save them from all the corruption that's ruled Azzam and they're going to be immune from it so that they can fellowship with me in the middle of it all and that's exactly a situation we are in perfect fellowship with Christ now people will lie to you all day long trying to pull you out of it but you are in perfect fellowship and if you do so wrong you just repent and you're still in perfect fellowship you don't have to grovel back or try and earn your way back you're back the moment you repeat in the moment you make it right just make it right you don't have to spend time and make it all up on a figlio human level we do that you know we have to you know get it's a process but for God it's not a process because the power of that blood as enough for perfect fellowship amen hallelujah so and it say here and that there's going to come a time now where he says it's going to turn back to the Lord he's going to turn back and I believe they were in that season where it's tuned to the Lord and that he is dealing personally now in a complete way he's not holding anything back of himself he's giving all of himself he has come and his fullness of his presence to reveal himself to you when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away amen and we know that the veil has been taken away and we're now seeing his face and that face is shining like the Sun yes yes the schmuck came up out of the pit and has blocked the Sun off to the world but then you know what the Lord said see I'm just going to come personally to my bride then Satan's not going to block my face amen Satan knew that one day it will turn to the Lord and so you know what he did he got permission somehow and he got the pit to open up and they're all spewed out after world war two during and around that time how opened up on the earth around that era and that's why you see the full advancement of science and the full advancement of technology and TVs and the things that Satan can use to to destroy humanity communication was really something that has really you know it's been a hindrance to the two faiths because Satan is now able to easily convey his message across the earth very quickly like the speed of light the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord that's not by something that you earn or something that you you achieve it's not our achievement it's his achievement it's achieved it's finished he spoke and he said it's they're going to be delayed no longer I'm here and I'm bringing you up to your heavenly position or just humble yourself humble yourself under the mighty hand of God he shall exalt you in due time now now the bride is humble and she doesn't want to just make herself anything but you see you the position you started life in and the position that God has ordained for you as an exultation your exalted to a position your exalted to an office to a calling to your position as an eternal part of God because you were a nurse thinking before the world even began you were part of us thinking and then you came on the earth and then finally he can exalt you up to that position that he saw you as before the world even began now you now to get there you can't force his way there David never forced himself on the throne he just worked with the Lord he praised the Lord he went through all the trials it looked like it was completely going the opposite direction he never forced him something never he had many opportunities to take the throne and he never took it without the Lord and his time and that's why he just humbled himself under the mighty hand of God that God would exalt him in due time and put him on the throne at the right season to put him in his position where Israel could be blessed because when he was in his position he may be too early at what the blessing would have missed to earlier this God has a sheet music the great concert oh and there is a season for everything is a season for your victories there's a season for you to come right up on top of all of your old nature completely so don't be discouraged if you feel like you know my old nature gets the better of me too much and I go through it we all go through it with the old nature you think and I just haven't gotten anywhere but you have the honors dealing you know it's all will be the throne in the right time and then the David that you'll come fully into your position completely over all those things it's going to happen amen God swore by an oath by himself then it would happen amen the veil of men's traditional shall be taken away by who by revelation 10 the mighty angel the Lord Himself an angelic form the corruption we were born under as being shaken by the voice that john heard john heard that voice john heard what those seven thunders actually said because remember john types the bride john heard what they after he heard the information the the mystery that they were he heard that and he was about to write it all down and go seize seal it up john seal it and he wrote it in a simple form and and and and and and you have some hearing a thunder and some hearing a voice and then because john heard that and was told to seal it up it's the same for you the john types the bride and and and it's been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom it's been given to you for these things to be revealed to you because in that life as I said before is going to be your rapture and faith is going to be your identity that's why you read all these stories and the characters and everything and you see oh this is my Who I am I am this I was this and I've become this just like Rahab just like roof just like Abigail just like Bathsheba just like all these people in the Bible just like David just like all of these people you can see now it's all opened up it's because John heard the voice and you had just like John but what John was told to seal it up you're also told to seal it up inside you it's sealed and within you and it's a secret Ministry of the Seventh Seal himself which is Christ the return of Christ that high priest that came and availed himself and revealed himself in the cloud and has come down as to come and be intimately involved in our affairs in our lives to bring us up as the seventh seal that's the that's the return of Christ to the earth it's the coming of the Lord and and and before he comes in the corporal he has to come in and bring her bride out of Satan's Eden just like Satan came into God's Eden and took away the Adams bride God comes into Satan's Eden takes away what Lucifer's trying to destroy and take out Jesus bride and restore her back to what she should be and bring her right out of the darkest age that he's ever been the most corruption that has ever been all the CERN everything is all everywhere it's a Babylonian fire burning around every life but because of the fellowship of the one that's come down into the earth the seventh seal himself Christ coming down every time you see Christ coming down into the affairs of people that is a revelation and type of the seventh seal that's why the prophets said this revelation is a secret but he gives you a key there and he says but it's actually revealed in every type of description and in every type of the scripture you'll see God comes out of heaven down into the earth to do something comes down and eat and he comes down to know he comes down to the three and the fire he comes down you know he comes down to change situations of people that believe in him amen he comes down to to interfere with something that's going the wrong direction and it needs to go a certain way then God comes amen hallelujah man was going in a very bad direction and the Pharisees and all of the religions go wrong so God came amen he came down and he purchased our salvation and he took the corruption itself amen and he displayed his mastery over corruption amen you know he displayed that he displayed that was Lazarus and he turned a rotten body into a brand-new body again and he called him back from corruption and that wasn't enough he actually died on Calvary and he took corruption and he pulled and he ripped it out of hell and he took and he went down into corruption itself the very root of corruption down into hell and he destroyed it amen he took the keys he took the control that corruption had over people he took the power of death and he cut severed its time so that we could have life because he is the abolish ur of death he's the abolish ur of corruption he's the abolish ur of decay and for seven church ages people still went down the way of the grave because the fullness that last little but that the Apostles were aiming for and relaxed and that church ended up going underground and then started getting restored to me finally at the end time that last cog which is the fullness of Christ the person the abolish ur of death self would come to a people so that they wouldn't even die ever now that is the fullness of Christ that's the last call this so that a people could be raptured as that revelation of the very person of Christ amen so that all the corruption that would make you die it's going to be dealt with and that's why we're here that's why when we read the Bible just enjoy it because the abolish of corruption is with you and he'll help you read the Bible he will speak to you from those pages amen you don't have to strive and struggle to try and understand it all he will give you understanding because he's the abolish ur of corruption amen he turns corruption into incur up ssin amen so that you can wear the image of his person where his life and we're all a work in progress and those of you that know me well and know that I'm a big work in progress that we're working amen God is working God is moving and we're developing because he is here amen hallelujah I look at my friends and I don't want to compare myself with people but I look at my friends that doing their own thing and they've got their own form of religion in there they are Christians and they all see them there one day I believe a fear if they really trust in Christ but their life is not going the same direction as else their life was getting worse than they're getting worldly and they're drinking and they're doing all the stuff because they're not be holding that cog that we've got that's making us retro ready that fall whatever that last thing is that the Apostles were aiming for where they said now we see darkly but then we'll see him as he is we're seeing him as he is because he stepped forth from behind the veil of mass tradition and corruption knows its master he is he has mastery over it and so all those little corrupt things in our life that make it out make relationships get worse if you spend too much time with somebody you end up becoming better and more character and you become a better person you know you look at people and you look at people that are outside of the economy of what we have and you and you see they you know oftentimes become worse off they become worse people as they get old they get crab it and they get angry and they get like you know and they become cynical and they just become negative people because they're not have the cog they don't have that final masterpiece the stone which the builders rejected the headstone himself he is the one that tends that the corruption to incorruption so we know and this is not in my notes at all but you know the you know how Daniel whenever Kinnear had the dream and he Nebuchadnezzar had the dream and Daniel interprets the dream any any any and basically he sees that big image that beast and it's a Babylon and in Medes and Persians and in the Grecian Empire and then the Roman Empire in symbolic form and then he sees this little stone cut out of the mountains and it grows bigger and bigger and fills the whole earth and then it's mites that image at the feet and the whole image it's blasted that Babylonian satanic Kingdom of Gentile world powers as completely broken by that stone and that's that stone that's that headstone next Christ the fullness of Christ Himself that capstone that was rejected off the temple home Christ that's the very stone the only stone the the key stone to a full complete victory over this that's the key stone for the rapture and that's Christ what is that what happens he comes into this earth he gets cut out without hands and he gets revealed to you it's a stone of Revelation and he comes in and what does he do he starts growing and pushing it pushes out all the corruption pushes out more and more gets bigger and bigger he's bigger you keep feeding on the word like a tree you eat drink more than you need a mint just keep feeding somehow you know enjoy it and just gets bigger and bigger until he fills the whole earth and then he rises up and that Babylonian image that you were born under he strikes it right at the feet and everything that you thought that was your enemy and all that all nature everything just gets destroyed completely destroyed a man can I have the musicians please because he has come amen mastery over corruption Mary we know the story of Lazarus Lazarus you know when Lazarus was dead here you have Mary and she's crying and she's upset and Jesus you know the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the word and he had been revealed in their day and he he had not revealed himself he had not shown himself to Mary at this stage and she was upset and Lazarus is dead but Martha had gone out to meet him and there Martha comes back to Mary and says the master has come and calls for thee and that's the type of us in our day because you see you know brother Branham said that if Jesus didn't put less or us in front of that when he spoke come forth the whole everyone that ever died would have just raised up and you've been every human on the earth now one day because he was just showing that in type but now here in the end time you have the fullness of the word that's been restored and he is in a secret place that wasn't revealed in the scripture where he was but he was just out and he wasn't revealed to the whole all the people but Martha had received the revelation of him Martha knew what was going on and she had come into connection with the resurrection and the life fullness of the resurrection in the life he was and so here she's a type of the church and she's going now to her sister and she's saying the master has come and calls for thee go out to meet him and Mary went out a minimun secret and after she met him then he speaks and their general resurrection that resurrection takes place and so we're arrived at that season where we've been called up the master has come and he calls for you he's calling for you to go out and meet them in your secret place enjoy your relationship with them have fellowship with them don't stress don't get all Restless about it and tight about it just enjoy it because his company is called for thee you might be crying down you know you can see all your people of the past the type of Lazarus they did in the tombs they're really they're gonna be dead the dead in Christ will rise but he's come and he calls for thee because he's about ready to speak and cause a resurrection to take place a man he's about ready brother Branham says this sorry I'm just gonna write these out just so you can realize I just want don't worry about it it's all good he says here these are sermons right these are sermon title and I want to show you that you know brother Branham preached sermons and they were not like my sermons and and our sermons they're you know they're just their expectations and things and going on and there but these are events you know brother Brennan was a prophet and he preached events that were taking place these were prophetic events and so I just want you to read I want to read these titles out just so you can catch you know what was going on you know and he didn't come right out all the time and just say exactly what it was he preached it in a way so that it would could be revealed and so he preached sermons called look away to Jesus the unveiling of God the mighty God unveiled before us Christ revealed in his own word greater than all of them as here what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ raising Christ out of history who is this Melchizedek when their eyes were open they knew him the identified Christ of all ages and recognizing your day and it's message he was speaking of something he because you see God doesn't just you know make things so plain all the time and they're so like it it has to be revealed it can't just be an intellectual and catch it you know he he speaks it in such a way to not put himself in a in a bit in a position you know and so he he just preaches these sermons and thing that you'll catch it and that you're catching these events that are taking place amen he is here the master has come and he calls Mary amen the one that anointed his feet with oil and cried over his feet and washed his feet with you're here Mary he's called for thee go out to meet him amen walk with some children young people he's calling for thee hallelujah he's calling amen let's sing um I should have thought of the
