well drop what did i say in sunday school you might be that little cold that fell out the fire and you feel like you're getting cold and you know a bit separated from the heat and everybody is rejoicing and you might not feel you're rejoicing at all but all you need to do is just ask the lord to pick you up and throw you back in the fire and the only way you do it is by anointing the word

you so much amen let's um just so before we go to the message the portion of the fifth seal we're gonna listen to i just wanted to uh read read it here and just quickly give a quick background because it's difficult to find a portion where brother bram covers everything and i hope you have listened to it all before you've come today so we're going to go to revelation 6 and 9 and we're going to read down to verse 11. i'm just going to give a brief overview um you know i got a i got a whatsapp message couple of photos from my brother moses and from whitbank there in south africa and um he's doing some outreach in a new area he says there's an old brother who just got baptized a few days ago or a week ago saying and he's gone to be with the lord so he says now we so we baptized him now we're going to bury him so i said to him the lord's timing's perfect you know so praise the lord you know even just that brief window hey how great is the grace of the lord amen that that soul he was ready to go meet him amen praise the lord so i trust we're all in that condition we're ready to meet him amen so revelation 6 and 9 it says and when he had opened the fifth seal i heard under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true does that not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for yet a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now just just very quickly uh if you remember from the first four seals there's a beast that says come and see and the fourth seal the voice of the fourth bc come and see says the anointing of the cherubim or the holy ghost which announces or goes to combat the antichrist move but in this fifth seal there's no beast to announce what the seal is so what this represents is actually the gentile time is over so so this is speaking now of actually of the jews right so and we can see it's the jews because there's a cry from these ones from verse 10 i know sorry from verse 9 it says and for the test so the slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held but it does not say that they have the testimony of jesus christ if you go look at revelations one the um john was on the other patmos for the testimony of jesus christ so these ones are there for the because of the testimony i mean for the word of god for the testimony which they held there's no record of them ever being a testimony for the lord jesus this is jews and we can see even in their hearts cry from verse 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth this is crying out for revenge remember that's that's eye for an eye tooth for a tooth this is the this is a jewish way then you know jesus when he's on calvary said father forgive them they don't know what they do and stephen before he gave him the ghost when he's being stoned he says lord laid this not to their charge so this could not be christian martyrs but this is this is jewish people right and robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a year little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren they should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now those ones who still had to be killed speaking of the future it speaks of 144 000 which received the same lord jesus christ we know we go up in the rapture the lord returns to the jews seals them to the kingdom but they give their lives so that's that's it in a very small nutshell but i thought i'd just kind of throw that out there before we listen um but what i like about this just as you want to get the um johnny is it already go is the lord doesn't forget any of his the lord doesn't forget anyone that's that's in his economy and i happen to believe we're all part of his economy our loved ones are part of his economy amen those that are on our hearts want to see meet the lord they're in his economy and god doesn't forget them so we're gonna have confidence lord you're working i heard brother abraham say he said you know you just you just love that person and pray for them until they come into the presence of god oh that's a that's a good way to be so without further ado god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight and we're gonna just listen to a portion here then we're gonna have a time of prayer afterwards hi first souls under the altar now here's where i'm going to get some real disagrees but i just watched just a minute just see i thought that too but it didn't come that way we have i've always thought that these souls under the altar were the the the martyrs of the early church and i'm sure that dr uh smith and everyone says it is see but i thought so myself but when the holy spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't that isn't the soul right i said well i don't know about that well i just admit we'll find out no these are not the souls of the uh of the bride church not at all we thought that was a bride church waiting there souls are in the altar is he crying how long lord how long let me read it again now so we get it right and when you open the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were saying for the word of god and for the testimony which they held the word of god and the testimony which say hell i don't don't move from there just a minute see and they cried how long lord how long see a holy truth does thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes are given to every one of them and it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being opened [Music] see the church is gone it just can't be the soldier the early church right now please if you ever did give this attention now because this is a great conserver controversy so i want you to listen real close now if you got your papers and songs to write with now i want you to notice now these cannot be them souls because the the souls of the of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done a good so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now what for they're gone in the rapture in the fourth chapter of revelations it was taken up now who are these souls that's the next thing who are they that if they're not the early church this is israel that's to be saved as a nation all them that are predestinated that's israel that's israel itself you say oh wait you say they can't oh yes they are to be saved here let's settle this man i got four or five scriptures i'll take one let's take romans just a minute and find out if they are let's take the book of romans and go to the 11th chapter of romans and we'll find out just let's just read it and then we'll have it by herself a romans 11 chapter the 25th and 26th verse now listen to paul here and paul said if anyone else even an angel preached any other gospel what he was to be cursed for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery thus you should be wise in your own conceit the blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulfilling fullness of the gentiles become in the last gentile bride be brought in for the bride the blind has come to israel for that purpose and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion a deliver and shall turn away ungodliness for jacob right now they are israel that's under this altar what israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved you believe that now who blinded them god god blinded his own children all right that's right amen amen no order of jesus standing at the cross them jews howling for his blood as his own kids and he was the scripture that's right amen he was he self the word and here he knowing that those people that gladly received him and that's the reason he blinded them so they wouldn't recognize him he'd come in such a humble way and blinded him to it that they wouldn't receive it see the scripture said they'd do it and he blighted it was blinded jesus hated them even so much as he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they were blind paul said they were blinded for a cause for us amen notice now i want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have them they were given robes white robes each one of them now the saints now have already have one they get it here [Music] but there they were given robes and the saints already had theirs and gone on see see they had had not they see they had not a chance because they were blinded by god their own father so that the grace of god could be fulfilled so the bride could be took from the gentiles is that right let me show you a beautiful type here and joseph joseph the spirit man the eagle he was born among his brothers just like the real churches among the others and he could interpret dreams and see visions and arrest them haiti yeah his father loved him notice then he was out oused by his brother not by his father out by his brethren and was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver thrown into a ditch and supposed to be dead taken up and set at the right hand of pharaoh and because he was ousted by his brethren see he was given a gentile bride [Music] not of his own people through there he bore ephraim and manassas which was added into israel as israel blessing by crossing his hands from the youngest to the oldest to cross the blessings from the jew back or from the jew to the gentile see across his hands to the younger son which is the younger church to come in the the mother church stood in the sun she brought forth this baby and um in order to get him israel crossed his hands and the type and joseph them same children was a gentile mother the bride of israel back there become cross from the old orthodox over to the christian uh way by uh the holy spirit that crossed israel's hands he said god has crossed my hands he had nothing to do with it notice then joseph rejected by his own brethren his own people took a gentile bride just exactly what jesus done rejected by the jews took a gentile bride now let's read something here i got a scripture around acts 15 and all this is just kind of it's what we're supposed to teach it anyhow now i believe i have this right read acts of 15 14 all right i hope this is right now all right simon has declared how god let's start the 13th and after they had helped their peace james answered and i see what had happened that went to the gentiles see and the fuss was on because they were jews see and after they had helped their peace james answered saying man and brother hearken unto me simon that simon peter has declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name see my wife's name was broy when i tucker she's abram jesus takes his church out or his bride out of the gentiles it's a scripture type is like joseph was i noticed this now these souls under the altar uh well uh the this these um souls understanding now that's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful man like eichmann yeah see they're holding right on millions of them but they remain jews now remember what was it they were killed for the word of god's sake not for the testimony of christ did you understand that but remember the church come in also the martyrs of the church was for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ how many was that here all right now but these didn't have the testimony of jesus christ for the word of god and for the testimony which they helped the jews and hitler hated them so tonight sort of stalling all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were jews [Music] but you know martin luther king had that same idea too it's the truth he said all jews should be taken out their antichrist see but he was just under another dispensation didn't see it didn't see the word now the word truth comes forth how you go to ever blind out israel you can't do it oh how could that prophet stand up there and say you look like a unicorn israel one is trying to show him the worst parts of it he said why he said whoever blesses you will be blessed and whoever curses you will be cursed amen that's right how do you go do it one time they thought god would forget when the prophet seen that dark thing coming for the jews that man standing there and the word of god poured to him he said oh lord are you going to forsake your people he said what's that laying there by it says a major stick said how high is it to heaven how deep is the seed he said i can't just another can i neither can i ever forget israel sir he ain't going to forget her he had to blind his own child now think of that blind his own child to give us a chance and we turn it down [Music] now don't that make you feel about so little [Music] you're crawling a concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on and never touch it amen that's right that's pretty small amen oh man yes they helped for the word of god they were jews they had their laws they stayed with it remember last night now they stayed with that and they were jews that had the law and the law was the word of god they stayed right by that's right and for their testimony they held they were martyred and here were souls on the altar after the church had been gone now what they had in their blindness martyred their messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized that they recognized that just gone on they seen them when they come before the altar of god but now the grace of god is to them watch now they could not by no means be saints because it already be rogue but here they are now just souls are the order for the word of god and the testimony of the health of being god's people is jews but now watch the grace of god comes to them and jesus gives them each one a white robe [Music] watch pull over after the church is gone because they were loyal to their cause [Music] and they were blinded and they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly apart that got it ordained from the plate amen and here here john looks over and sees souls on the altar now watch he sees those souls watch what he calls them they cried lord how long watch just a little while longer let's get that israel go down right through the scripture they realized they had murdered their messiah see and they didn't know it then they realized they got they got murdered back to pay for it they're doing the wrong and now look what a thing they had to do see there was guilty of murder so they got murdered they they cried out his blood beyond us that's right that's right and they were blinded now if they hadn't been blinded god said let alone they're not worthy but then if they was blinded by god his grace reached down to them amen talk about amazing grace amen and give each one of them a room because all israel will be saved everyone has his names written that's right jesus give them robes like joseph did to his brethren a tithe look when joseph stood there and when he finally he made himself known there for the altar his own altar his palace is wrong hallelujah he said everybody leave me amen his wife was over in the palace where's the bride and he said to him he said don't you know me oh hey speaking of hebrew now i'm your brother jose oh my they said nah oh you're going to get so wait a minute wait a minute god did that for a purpose had you to throw me out in order to save life [Applause] [Music] don't be angry with yourselves remember joseph said that he said don't be angry with yourself everything's all right now it's all in the word god sent me here ahead of you you know the bible said they'll say to him when they seek us to say uh you're the messiah we know but but what about them scar see he said oh i got him in the house of my friends friends and then when they realized it them had slept 144 000. that bible said that they'll separate one house and the other and take days just to cry and wail and walk up and down the floor how did we do it how did we do it while we crucified our own messiah said crying like a homewood for its only begotten son hallelujah how did we do it them jews are they're the most religious people in the world god's chosen but he blinded them to take us and we turn it down oh help us lord what is the judgment of the gentile church there you are see blinded purposely by god so he could get us a bride for it jesus take him out see four type that everything now you see who the souls are not the mortgage thing they done gone that's right notice they were they've done gone see so these are given rules each one of them and i want you to notice but now god's grace stoops then jesus gives them each a white robe like joseph did his grace to his brother now though they had tried to rid joseph also but his grace reached out down to him oh it's all right that's all right you didn't mean to do that but see that was god doing that see god let you all do that so he could run me out and bring me down here so i can save lives for people be gentiles here where i got my wife from i wouldn't have no wife but if i'd stayed back up paranoid i love my wife she's got me these children here and stuff i i and i now i'm coming to get you all now you all go to heaven good too i'm gonna bring you down here we're all gonna live together [Music] i'm watching what he did the little benjamin which is a type of 144 thousands we'll get later they all you did you just run right quick the benjamin fell on his neck and started hugging his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone by his mother the first church the orthodox church the hundred and forty four thousand were born in his absence while he's awake oh my don't that just do something to you yeah there is so you see who they are no there you go notice now though they had tried to get rid of joseph is grace reached to him though they tried to get rid of jesus he still comes right back around because he's dying and he'll beat you on a white robe he's going to take him around home anyhow doesn't make a bit different because he doesn't say i'll save them all anyhow now verse 10 notice they asked for revenge see now that been the bride it'd been like stephen's father forgiven them but these are jews that's just come in see they asked for revenge notice again see again he said notice it's not he said it's thy brethren the jews the hundred now they wanted revenge they said oh we're going to we want you to revenge us down there he said just a little while now just a little while for notice let me read it here it's in the 10th verse report and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord holy and true does now not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little season see what a little season until their fellow servants see now what is it the prophets now are preaching to israel see thy fellow servants also thy fellow servants yes and also thy brethren that should be killed these once predestinated to be done so see to be killed as they were should be fulfilled see in other words it's pre destinated to them it's the scriptures that they have to do it just rest for a little while now you got your robes you're going home and just sit there a little while i see wait to still live now notice now notice thy brethren thy brethren have yet be killed which means the 144 000 yet to be called in the tribulation 144 000 is called wish we had time we might get it tomorrow night if the lord willing we vote just before we get in on the seal see also now what they have to be martyred by the antichrist that we just come to and notice in his last ride where he breaks that covenant than jews down there in their shields see these jews 144 000 is to be called out by the two witnesses of revelation 11. now remember there was to prophesy you've read that how many's read that sure we all when you're reading the scripture and they prophesy these two witnesses prophesy in the time of daniel's second half of the 70th week that is the last three and a half years remember how we talked to daniel 70 week i said we need it when i got in here i didn't know why but something told me we need it here we are see notice in the time of daniel i remember daniel was told that the messiah would come the prince the messiah rather and he would prophesy israel still had 70 weeks left and in the midst of the 70 weeks the messiah would be cut off and the daily sacrifice taken away is that right but there were still three and a half weeks determined in this block he takes the gentile bride now she goes up and when she goes up two prophets arrives to israel see and those souls that's been martyred now down to your real true jews down through there that had their name on the book that lived the right life and done the right thing lived judaism to the dock they were martyred by eichmann and many others honest people millions of them go down there and then germans shot them to death and murdered them and killed them and hung them on fences and burned them up and cremated them and everything else that bloodless their blood-hearted hungry hitler and stalling and mussolini and all that people hated them jews i think that's one of the one of the things just holding this nation together because they've already respected the jew amen amen give him a please you honor the jew and god are you now there's a bunch of jews renegades just like there's gentiles the same way but the real jew god's put his name on the book before the foundation of the world and here he was murdered down this time and remember think of it now how perfect this is right after that millions of slaughtered jews innocent people by the nations of the world here the scripture says right in this time that there each one under the altar realize what's happened and they're given white robes and they said well why can't we go back to the kingdom right now the jewish kingdoms to be said on the earth you know johnson the kingdom to be said not this is the kingdom of the gospel you see but the kingdom of jews will be preached by these these two prophets so notice the the kingdom of the earth here the kingdom of heaven is preached by the jews to i mean to the gentile the kingdom of your own earth just be set up in the millennium uh after the millennium of the jews now notice notice this now here why they while they are preaching see before these these prophets ever rise on the scene these jews that had to die or eichmann them is each one of them that is predestinated is given by grace a white robe each one of them given a white robe notice now what happens as soon as that takes place i'm watching that clock back and i know we're we're getting late but i don't want to see uh that notion and poor fellow stand there god help you brother and i hope each one of us gives a white robe that day standing changing back and forth with legs are hurting somebody worked all day i know what that is and look here and some of the poor little women stand i noticed some of these man give the women their seats and somebody else give some poor little mother with a baby and i i see all that and i'm sure he does notice but i don't want to keep you too long if i just get you to see the message that's all i want you to do see now notice these jews i have to do this in order to let you see the revelation of this seal see what it is under the altar and who they are notice in the time of daniel now the second half of the seventh week now remember messiah was to be cut off in the midst that's the middle oh what's half of seven how long did christ preach that's right wow but there is determined yet to the people what another three and a half years well during this time well see what happens is the gentile bride is selected in the seventh church he said and goes up and what it does that way all these jews is martyred along there because of blindness laying under the altar god comes over and says you see what it was now i'll give each one of you a robe they said how long lord are we going in now so no no no no your fellow man the jews has got to suffer a little bit yet they got to be martyred like you were smarter the beast has got to get down when he breaks his covenant i noticed and now notice once now just remember these prophets are to prophesy according to revelations 11. you you raise your hands you read it see and they're given power and we're going to find out who they are just in a minute willing i know who these prophets are and now the bible tells it here sure sure see now i notice in the middle of this three and a half weeks now that they're prophesying down here and the revelation sure said and they they prophesy a thousand three hundred and two score days if now the regular jewish calendar the regular time of god's calendar is exactly 30 days in a month the roll encounter what makes it up right the regular calendar is 30 days a month now if you want to take 30 days and add three and a half years to it and see if 30 days you are what you got one thousand three hundred and two hundred three score days one thousand jordan three score days sixty days exactly three and one half years now you see there's no mistake for that right there it is just fits together like uh uh dovetails coming together two prophets preached for three and a half years to the jews and that is called out the 144 thousand and then notice these two prophets are exactly moses and elijah amen now look look they're look at their ministry i watch what these prophets do they have power to smite the earth or the plague as often as they will who did it moses amen they have power to shut the heavens and it rained not the day of their ministry who closed the heavens for three and a half years there you are that's them see it's see the man when he dies he doesn't change his status he doesn't change his makeup see look when when before uh when saul had backslid and there was no prophets in the land he couldn't understand what to do what to do he's up against it he's going to battle he went to the witch of endor now just a blood of bulls and goats she could do this and she called up the spirit of samuel and when samuel come up there he stood and his prophet rome not only that but he's still a prophet hallelujah he said why did you call me out of my wrist he said sin you become an enemy to god he said by this time tomorrow night you're going to fall in the battle this time tomorrow night you're with me that's exactly what happened see not only he was still a prophet that's right and these fellows are still prophets now we're going to get a little deep in that just a few minutes oh my how i love that word no wonder man shall not live by bread alone every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god these two prophets are moses elijah according to their works being re-patterned again that that has always been their ministry now notice just as they did that didn't change them remember these guys never died what's just that now don't confuse before we get away from this don't confuse elijah's fifth time ministry with his fourth time ministry i've been telling you the gentile church is looking for elijah right and here he is over with the jew remember he can't come forward that's that's enemies number he has to be five the first time he come is elijah himself next time he come he was elisha next time he come he was what john the baptist the next time he comes is for the seventh angel and the fifth time he comes he's with moses [Music] yes sir don't confuse me five if you know your your numerals of the bible five is a number of laboring grace and that's what he's done now watch you don't know where it is was jesus a labor of grace j-e-s-u-s by l-a-b-o-r is that right labor for for love for you and if you get 10 how you come by what f-a-i-t-h amen l-a-b-o-r is that right labor is the number grace all right to the believers notice the first elijah that was him the second was elisha the third was john the fourth was the seventh angel or the last messenger to the church according to malachi 4 and revelations 10 7. now the fifth time he is a messenger to the jews to the 144 thousand to the jews at the church is gone i i just feel a little funny look if some thinks i want you to get this now if some still thinks that malachi 4 to restore the people is the same thing he's going to do down there to the jews and think it's all the same let me straighten that out for you see it would be a little bit confusing of course remember in malachi 4 says to return the faith of the fathers or the children back to the father see back to the father now let me show you the difference of the ministry if he comes to return the faith of the children back to the fathers he would deny christ he go back to the law that right the fathers kept the law [Music] when elijah and when he come to fulfill his ministry in malachi 4 see as malachi 4 elijah was by himself but when he come to minister to the jews of revelation 11 he has moses with him [Music] amen [Music] when elisha comes of malachi 4 he's by himself elijah will run not elijah moses elijah will arise but the same inspiration that said elijah will come for the last part of the church age to restore the faith of the children back to the original faith of the father's apostolic faith which you're supposed to go back and the antichrist has got them all pulled out to restore back as all the rest of scripture is blended together see amen he comes by himself but when he comes [Music] and his first ministry couldn't take the jews and put them back to the law because [Music] [Music] so don't have it confused it's not confusing the scripture don't lie [Music] [Applause] out there see that elijah walk out there for that first stage by himself and he's by himself then when i see it come again way over somewhere else there [Music] me so i did notice these men are kept alive by god from their original ministry not christians they're jews crying out for for revenge um yep they're given white robes we receive a white robe now which is baptism the holy ghost why we're robbed in his righteousness now not on that side um praise the lord but it's exciting i mean you just think of someone you know when someone meets a lord it throws my heart you know you think about there's 144 000 jews they're over there i believe now they're crying out to know the same god that we do they don't know exactly who he is his name is jesus but you know but they're going to meet him like we've met him yeah so praise the lord and nothing of this world is going to stop it happening amen no all the devils in hell can't stop it happening because god's in his word it's going to happen amen praise the lord amen praise god yes sir i really like how he brought joseph amen yeah yeah it's amazing to see end time events in the shadow brother phil saying about how joseph uh revealing himself to his brethren before he does his gentile brides in the palace mean so perfect shadow there pointing to this day we'll be in the palace and the wedding supper in the sky then he comes out reveals himself to his brethren and they say where did you get those wounds this is in the house my friends their eyes come open they really realize they crucified the very messiah that was meant to come to them amen praise the lord amen well amen so do we have any
