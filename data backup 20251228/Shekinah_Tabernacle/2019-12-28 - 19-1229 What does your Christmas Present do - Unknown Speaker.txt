a scripture to to Matthew chapter 2 you're gonna read read a portion of Matthew to them also going to go to revelations chapter 1 I'm in Matthew 2 and verse 1 now when Jesus was born and in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews if we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship Him when Herod the King Herod heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes to the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet now Bethlehem in the land of juda not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel they inherit when he privily called the wise men and quiet of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship Him also when they had heard the King they departed lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till they came and stood over where the young child to say till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when they came into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God and a dream they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way I mean let's go to revelations chapter 1 and we're gonna read verses four five and six of Revelations one see see John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from hemorrhages which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ was a faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us notice present tense and has made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen I mean this just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Oh Lord Jesus father we just want to come into your presence Lord and we want to Lord as as look we didn't read it here in John chapter one but it sees that John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day dear God he was in the spirit dear Lord then you showed him things which were to come dear God so long as you Lord and as your prophet said Lord if we want to do anything for you we've got to get into the spirit first dear God Father not in our own carnal ability but law that we get into your spirit dear God so I asked father may we be under the spirit Lord of your great holy presence dear God may we be in the spirit Lord father may you wash us of all our sins forgive us of our sins our trespasses our iniquities dear God Lord may you cleanse us Lord cleanse our hearts dear God or may we all be anointed with your spirit this day father may you grant a dear god I just pray you'll once more step to the pulpit Lord open your word to our hearts dear God or may we walk out of here renewed and strengthened and established Lord and settled and rejoicing and at peace dear God father may you grant it for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name bless bless the service now Lord we surrender into your hands Lord be at those who are away on holiday or second body Lord be their portion be their strength dear God and we want to tell you that we love you we thank you Lord that we can rejoice in the god of our salvation Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats I'm sorry I have I have two titles this morning and as I was kind of joking with brother Armand and brother Andy before it depends how spiritual you are which one you want to take so the first one is do you know what your Christmas present do you know what your Christmas present does and and and if that doesn't sound I'm spiritual enough for you being perfectly loosed by the perfect blood but you know do you know what your Christmas present does you know cuz if you get a Christmas present and you don't know what it does you'll never get the magnitude of what it is you know even if you get something simple like some socks if you don't know what sucks - they're not going to help you I mean or you get something very fancy that's got all the bells and the whistles and the Wi-Fi and the yo if you don't know what it does you're just gonna you're not going to get the point of why it's being sent to you so you've really got to know what your Christmas present does to get the full benefit from it amen and and if you don't know what it really does you won't treasure it you know just imagine if you got some big fancy drone and you didn't even know how to turn this thing on so that's cool but you wouldn't know what it can do so you need to know what it can do so do you know what your Christmas reason does I mean I trust you know that we we know that the true Christmas person that God gave us is eternal life hallelujah so you know we water we we really want to know what it does because you know having eternal life is more than just an abstract idea it's a reality and so brother Brown would say and we have seen in a star in the Eastern have come to worship Him he says vindicated in your own flesh that you are the person that's born of the Holy Spirit wouldn't you love to have that when you love to have that assurance I mean that's been vindicates been proven in your own flesh that you're born of the Holy Ghost wouldn't that be the greatest Christmas present that anybody could get the gift of eternal life God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life I mean you see here and if he really Fe really grafts grass that the Messiah was potentially upon the earth he would have been the first one out the gate of Jerusalem to go to Bethlehem but he's like I'll just go find him tell me if he's there and then I'll go worship Him but you know he didn't grasp what was the Christmas prison that was given you know and and we don't want to fall under the under the under their category now the greatest gift that that we can receive is eternal life and without money or price I mean but it never comes the way man wants it to come when Jesus came the first time they all wanted a messiah the Jews wanted to some great king to rise up and drive the Romans away and should I just go to this thing because it's making noise yep here we are again you know sorry they wanted some great general to to drive the Romans out they wanted some you know master you know there's a lot now you know they wanted some great King to rise up some great military man to to to rise and drive the Romans out of there out of their country that they could be a free people again you know or you know the and and everyone expected him to come a certain way you know the scribes and Pharisees they had it all sorted out in their mind this is how the Messiah will come that's how the forerunner will come and you know you know the had it all planned out but but when Jesus came he came in a totally different way to how they thought yet he came according to the word you know he would be born in Bethlehem as the word said you know so you know he he came exactly as was prophesied but the people had in their mind how he would come and in how he did come was totally different to what they were expecting so they missed it you know so they were wanting some great military genius or some great scholar but God gave them what they needed not what they wanted and what they needed was a babe in a manger that's what they needed they didn't need a great military man they needed a babe in a manger and God always gives us what we need not what we want hallelujah how many times we have a lot of once but the scripture says he'll supply our needs hallelujah I'm glad he knows what we need more than what what we think we know what we need so they didn't know what the Christmas present could do they didn't see the value of the babe in a manger so they didn't receive it or appreciate it that it was eternal life manifested in the flesh I mean so so they didn't receive it or appreciate that it was eternal life offered to them when the word became flesh such the same as people today they don't receive Christ today and appreciate and receive eternal life when the word has become flesh again I mean because the word became flesh and dwelt among us and the word has again became flesh and dwelt in us hallelujah in our own flesh now I want to maybe kind of start a kind of a series and this may I don't know where we'll go but I want to basically essentially take how the devil works from Genesis to Revelation and I'll show how God works from Genesis to Revelation now I'm not going to do this all today we'll be here for a while okay so I'm just giving you like a you know but because we need to know his tactics and we need to know how he works and because if we can identify how he works in every age we can see how he works in this age because we know the devil as a creature of habit so what he did in Genesis he will do today what he did in Moses day he'll do today what he did a near Meyers day he'll do today what he did in David's day he'll do today you know all the way down through and what he did in the book of Acts he'll do today he's the same devil you know brother Bram says that you know men may die but the spirit upon him doesn't die it just comes anoint someone else so so brother Bram sitting here because we got to see what does this Christmas gift do this Christmas gift eternal life has caused us to overcome every work of the devil right to recognize him at his tricks and withstand him and overcome him I mean so so so brother Brahim says in the church age book this is from this is from chapter 1 he says now I see that this book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what he is doing in the churches for those seven ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them now we know that most of the disciples had been martyred by the time by the time John received the revelation on the Isle of Patmos right so they did not receive it you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts they are some ie not at this time going to restore the kingdom of Israel he said us not for you to know the time or the seasons those men were still thinking of Jesus as having an earthly Kingdom but it was not us but it was a spiritual Kingdom he was going to build member he has made us kings and priests as a spiritual Kingdom even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto them but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his me to tour ministry he was able to set forth here and this revelation of himself to John what has glory and presence and the church would mean and do and this revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells how he's going to deal with the devil and cast them into the lake of fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he's always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation and both of these books we find Satan's origin has awful ways and his destruction that's why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him and you can say the same thing he has no part of me I have no part in him why because the perfect blood is perfectly Lewis from all of his all of his plans his devices his shackles the devil would would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy notice what he does he does all he can to destroy the confidence in the word but when the church disbelief Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word the gates of hell could not prevail against her so when you disbelieve Satan and believe the spirits revelation of the word the gates of Hell cannot prevail against you amen now let me know because we have to understand we face a real foe and and he is here to withstand us but greater is in you then he is in the world a means we've got to recognize that we're going to see what this Christmas gift does I mean cuz this Christmas gift is given eternal life and has conquered the devil everyplace anytime anywhere it has subdued the devil it has conquered him bound him up you know defeated him taking the keys of his own house off him I mean and we need to see this live in our life hallelujah and I believe he's among us I mean so I'm not saying if something we need to get we've already got it I mean but you got to recognize what you have I mean now let me because remember it's always your place in the word the devil will fight against he doesn't want you to recognize who you are and because if you recognize who you are what gaited God has made you to be you recognize that then you will exercise the the the office at your in I mean you know imagine if you know President Trump didn't recognize he is president but yet he's president he wouldn't do what he does because he cuz he doesn't believe he's president but the people made him president so therefore he exercises the office of a president he conducts himself well as a president you know he he but but basically he says I'll do what I want a president so so he knows what he's been made and he pushes the boundaries of it as much as he can but thing is if he was afraid to exercise the office of a prison and he wouldn't do the things he does it's the same thing with us we need to recognize what God has made us to be what does what our Christmas gift does a mean is caused us to recognize who we are in Christ hallelujah this is the best this is the best Christmas gift ever its warranty has never voided you don't need new batteries you don't need software updates firmware updates you don't need no kind of updates you can't break it you can't smash it you can't crash it hallelujah it never runs out I met at is perfect in every way I mean but you've got a really treasure what you have hallelujah notice I said what you have you got to know what you have I mean let me so there brother brain continues he says now let me put in a word here from my own ministry if you don't mind we all know that this gift in my life is supernatural it's a gift really spirit is able to discern with a discerning diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I was stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now doesn't the people I'm talking about it's that Satan is gonna hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease we don't want any of those three things I mean but Mima but the devil will try and get in get a hold of our life through sin and difference in disease but it depends what you do with it stomp on box return to sender right that's the best policy that's probably a few years ago now but but but so when I was up in Papua New Guinea I received the courier box that I see it through of all these books and stuff and it was mangled it was still intact but it looked like someone had literally stomped on it and when I when I saw this box I thought that's exactly what we should do with Satan's stuff stop on box we turned this into her you know don't accept anything he sends you it was trash man I mean I mean but the boxes because I'd literally taped it up and up and around and around and the tape hold the box together but it was mangled but anyway that's why I say stop on box return to sender now so see it isn't the people so you but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed to the most peculiar changes come over as the people's countenance Satan is afraid he knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates these meetings so much when pitting wins names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it now what is this it's not the mind-reading it's not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's a revelation by the Holy Ghost that is the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost let me show you know but that's also the the Word of God as a discerner of the thoughts and teams of the hearts Hebrews 4:12 so the same word as in our myths discerning the thoughts intents of the heart so we know the devil hates to be exposed because as soon as you can see him for what he is then you can get rid of them but as soon as you begin to think it's part of you you hold on to it you say well I have this grudge I have this Unforgiven it to have this and listen this if you own the thing you'll never get rid of it but if you recognize it's not me it's actually the work of the devil then you'll expose him and he's gone and then then you can actually cast it out but let me show you another reason why Satan hates the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church so so in you he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and changes not he know a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his ways that means he doesn't change the Satan knows assuredly that the original Church of Pentecost with the power of God marked 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as a zone all houses false it has to be now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless and exposes Satan revealing his works now his works are the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word this is what we have in this day the devil's tried to destroy you but he's also tried to discredit God's Word to you amen right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army so he tries to fight you stop you getting the true revelation of the true church and what she stands for I mean so therefore we should look into how he how he does that amen but also we should look into the true revelation of the true church I mean because you should be able to see the more that the word is preached faith is ministered and you see Bella see this is who I am hallelujah isn't that right you know when when when the people of Israel came out of Egypt to go into the promised land those that receive the word in faith they recognized there were sons of God they had inheritance in the land they already had the adherence they just had to go get it hallelujah so it's the same thing with us we have to recognize who we are now not who we become in but we are sons and daughters of God amen before the world began we were sons and daughters have gone I mean he told Jeremiah before you and your mother's womb I ordained you to be a prophet to the nation's holy so we don't become something were er but then we realized what we are amen so Lord yo I made the Lord show us what we are helllooo because I tell you what if you recognize all of heavens behind you Amen you'll be fearless I mean that you know that you know that your life is in God's hand doesn't what comes of ghosts everything is for a purpose I mean even even even everyday it seems like everyday things is actually God fulfilling his word you know we take when you know why did Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem for Jesus to be born in the natural it was just the emperor of Rome saying I want to tax everyone so look just like a natural thing but it was actually prophecy being fulfilled God used that to cause them to go to Bethlehem because they would never have traveled in that season Amen Mary was about to give birth they wouldn't have traveled down to Bethlehem if it wasn't for the Emperor taxing the people he say was just a natural thing that moved them they know is actually God insuring his word was fulfilled so you're gonna look at everything things didn't see like everyday things natural things are happening but God's great cogs of the Wills of his prophecy are turning to get you to where you need to be oh yeah so we out there yeah we're I'm sure we have such confidence God everything that happens in my life it's your word being fulfilled hallelujah now he knows so amen so let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of revelation of Jesus Christ of the church I mean he knows that Jesus Christ I'm just going to repeat this because I like it he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and changes not see the devil knows this he knows that a whole lot more than who 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he's just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows us surely that the original church at Pentecost were the power of God mark 16 in action as the true church that Jesus claims as a zone all houses false and it has to be so with a dynamic power of the Holy Ghost as manifested that's the true Church of God now remember this but be Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen but the book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and to file up making it lukewarm formal and powerless and exposes Satan the revealing of his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word that's why the message is trying to be discredited the Word of God that's why the Bible's try to be discredited you can go through you know there's multiple websites they basically say the Bible's made-up it's not real it's just man's ideas man's true but but we know it's not I mean it's God is to finally reveal to you that this is the Word of God I mean that's you know then you can stand upon it I mean I don't believe the Bible because of tradition I believe it because the God of the Bible became real to me and vindicated this is his word amen and that that has to be to all of us we need to pray God make it reveal it to my soul that this is your word because if I know this is your word it's not man's ideas I can stand upon it holy because if we know this is God's Word and he is eternal we won't change our thinking based on society will keep our will keep exactly as what God says we'll keep that amen no sorry amen write down the time he's casted like a fire here out standard he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she'll be an invincible army if see that's what the devil fights us he doesn't want us to get that true revelation of the true church and what she is the Word made flesh in this hour amen if they get a true revelation of the two spirits and this is why I want a beginner and and I won't start it now but I but I want to start a just a journey from Genesis or even before Genesis there's a war in heaven he brings Satan and you know that you're the two vines brother Aaron preached came out of Eden and now they're here and but it's not just it's not just when we look at it I won't just be on a national level or a church level it's an individual level and a family level I mean because the devil fights every layer you know he fights the church he fights the church age he fights a church he fights a family he fights an individual so we need to know so if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her who once Satan to be powerless before you he will be definitely thought at today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it worth true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so we need to pray and lord give me prevailing revelation give me a revelation of your word hallelujah though that because it's by revelation we will overcome you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book that we are studying as an actual as the actual revelation of Jesus Amen himself in the church and his works in future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't just take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real and it's going to take an operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people so you saying because the book of Revelation is the bride's book amen that's why you know it takes more than just a natural study takes the author to come and reveal it to us I mean it will take one with prophetic insight I'll say actually the bride has prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from God the bride can hear from God it will require supernatural instruction we have received supernatural instruction in this hour not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the Spirit or never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know as I have already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures that is it that is even placed exactly right and the Canon of Scripture at the end now we can know now you can know sorry why it says that anyone who reads or hears it is blessed and is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil quite a statement and you can see why why they who add or take from it will be cursed it would be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy as that simple there is nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word that's the most powerful thing the prevailing power as the revelation of the word why is it prevailing because it shows you who you are and if you realize who you are then you will stand the devil you won't be swayed by him because you know who God has made you to be amen now even you know so we want the prevail power of Revelation in our lives that's why brother Aaron said pray for revelation more than anything Lord reveal your word to me make it plain make it make it true make it alive hallelujah you know that's that's how we need to be now he says in crisis Amisha God reveal this is the new birth as Christ as a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together with a revelation is perfect in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he says oh if the church only knew its position at will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is that's why we need to say Lord show me what I am and you reveal to me Who I am in you more than hid knowledge but revelation of my soul that I will know my position see so so so brother Branham is saying that the church doesn't need to get it to a position based on this quote but it needs to know its position so we need to know who we are in him I mean already right so you know see see see it's see it's when God reveals you that he's your father I mean more than a preacher telling you more than more than more than even even the mission when God comes in behind it and says that you're my child I mean that's God revealing to you hallelujah that is the revelation of the new birth cause you because we are born from above where we cry Abba Father my father my father hallelujah I mean so it's the same thing as when when Adam came to Eve and yo soso Eve was just taken out of Adam and then Adam said to Eve you are now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so it was Adam telling Eve this is who you are your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life you're part of me you came out of me it's the same thing with the word in this day it comes you this message come students is God's issue your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life power my power you are you came out of me just like as Jesus is I came from God and I go back to God now the bride can say I can from God and I'd go back from God and I was in the mind of God I manifested upon the earth and then I'm gonna go back to God hallelujah and and if you have that revelation in your soul I mean it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do against you you'll be able to withstand it because you recognize that this life this is not the end this is just a small brother man calls that a hickey on eternity a little bump you know this is what this is what this time is but in eternity is gonna roll on and I'll roll on with it hallelujah amen so yo who wants the rapture to go with in Lord show us who we are on you I mean but that's the thing that's why there's so many voices in this day to get our attention because the devil is trying to distract us I mean with everything but hearing God's voice that we know who we are in him because when the church knows its position in the rapture we'll go when she knows what she is we said Lord cleanse our mind cleanse our thinking that we know who we are anew I mean this is not some concept I'm talking about this is reality amen see so he said if they get a true revelation and of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's bro discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her Amy I just took that out of what we just read so it once Satan to be powerless before us doesn't mean he'll try yo that doesn't mean he'll quit but he needs to be powerless before us that we will never be overcome by him but he'll be overcome by us I mean so these two spirits have been at work since before before time began I mean when when when when Satan and Nikoli I mean I mean iniquity was found in his heart he says I'll be like the Most High I mean so and there was war in heaven amen and Michael and his angels fought those now Revelation chapter 12 there's war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven so there was a war and the devil lost in heaven hallelujah and then now this ant this battle has now come down upon the earth now every now we know God changes his form right so the outward appearance of God changes so in the beginning he was the logos I mean you know he appeared to Abraham as as Melchizedek right Amen theophany form is a pillow fight of Moses here's a cloud by day pillar of fire by night I mean he was veiled in the prophets then he became the fullness of Godhead bodily and his son he went back to pillar of fire again and now he's failed in his people and the fellow fire has appeared again in this last day verse the same God all the way down through now so the same God that defeated Satan in heaven I mean has actually come down to the earth to pursue his enemy to the earth I mean so now up in heaven this is Michael and his angels fought this was Christ in angelic form and and and when when the devil and his angels were were fighting against them no doubt he saw a certain look in Michaels eyes Amen when he fought him because you know when you see someone's eyes you see their life Amen you see you see you know if someone's glazed over or someone's like this you know their eyes change but when they're focused you see a certain fire a certain zeal a certain you know is that love will hate you whatever it you see a life so that same life now so God cast as devil you know cast the devil down to the earth and we read in revelations chapter 9 that that angel fell that star fell so Satan fell to the earth he he didn't come down to the earth he fell why because he was he was defeated in heaven and then he was cast down to the earth even Jesus said I beheld Satan falling like lightning to the earth so he fell I mean but then when we come to revelations chapter 10 it says that mighty angel came down and when someone comes down they actually choose now I'm coming I'm not pushed I'm not falling I've come down why has he come down to pursuers enemy hallelujah true together his bride to himself at the same time continue the war that he won in heaven now he's going to win upon the earth I mean so now every time you know when we go through the scripture now there's always a clash between God and Satan now when we come to Moses and Pharaoh brother Ram says in the contest I believe it was he said that God was in Moses because he said to Moses and and xs3 and voices i've heard the cries of my people I have come down to deliver them and I'm sending you well it's happening now God was veiled and Moses but then now Satan was veiled in Pharoah so now when Pharaoh and Moses met together no doubt when the devil looked out of pharaoh's eyes and looked into Moses eyes he says I've seen this look before I've seen this look before when Moses came into the throne room and said let my people go they weren't Moses people they were God's people God was speaking first person through a man it was God using human lips saying let my people go and so Satan said I have seen this look before and then he tried to destroy Moses even before he came because he knew that the seed of the woman was going to bruise the head of the seed of the serpent deal it's going to come a serpent bruza I mean so that's why before Moses came he tried to kill all the boy babies in the Nile this is what our Christmas prison does amen I'm just going through a quick overview of the scripture to say this is what our Christmas prison has done to those who have received it in their day hallelujah if it did that in that day it'll do it in this day I mean you gonna see what you have I mean so so he tried to destroy he tried to destroy that serpent bruised it coming I mean but he he ended up raising that serpent brucer in his palace Moses was raised up in Pharaoh's Palace hallelujah and then so finally finally Moses comes to age he realizes who he is you know sure he has that you know he tries to do it on his own strength he fails miserably kills one Egyptian but then he meets the pillow fire in the burning bush and now God has veiled and the prophet he comes down into comes down into Egypt and now the serpent bruiser is going to say well if you will not let my people go I'm going to plague your kingdom until you have to let them go hallelujah so the plagues came death came and then finally Pharaoh said get your people and get out hallelujah why because the devil when he looked into Moses I said I've seen this person before and then he tried to now and then now when every prophet when they came to the earth God was veiled in that prophet in their day and there's always a clash between their Antichrist spirit and God spurn amen and then no doubt you know the devil you know when he looked in Elijah's eyes he says I've seen this look before and an Ezekiel and Isaiah and Jeremiah and yo and then it went from even Moses to Joshua that same one that was with Moses was with Joshua hallelujah but the devil couldn't stop nothing I mean they took their land how their God conquered I mean God conquered he says you go I'll fight the battle but you've got to go but so God gave him the land supernaturally that was God's Christmas present conquering hallelujah and then there was the forerunner you know about Lord the first time and in that same God and the fullness not just in part in the prophets but the fullness of God had Bodley came into a man Christ Jesus amen and then the devil tried to tempt him in the wilderness and he looked in his eyes he says I've seen I've seen this look before not in part now this isn't fullness oh my I've seen this look the same one that kicked me out of heaven and I've fallen down the same one has pursued me to the earth so he says now I'm just gonna try and kill him so you know they they they planned all their strategies how they're going to take take Jesus and crucify him but they couldn't do it in their own ability they needed someone of the inner circle to actually cause Jesus to be betrayed you know the devil only does us a what if he only just helps us you maybe never thought about this before you take Adam and Eve in the garden before there was sin and God has all these attributes in him to be a deliverer a savior a healer a redeemer a guide a comforter a sacrifice a high priest and advocate you know all those things are in him but he can't express the fullness of himself to Adam and Eve without suddenly being there because they never they don't need a Savior they don't need a healer they don't need a redeemer they don't need a comforter they don't need a guide they've never been lost you've never being sick they've never been you know they don't need an advocate why all as well right they don't need a sacrifice why they sacrifice for so there's a big part of God he could express to his children and then so what happened he had an agent there that actually unleashed the fullness of God upon Adam and Eve which was the serpent so the devil doesn't get no credit he actually is just a tool in God's hand I'm it's enough because if you think about it we can worship God in a far greater measure today then Adam and Eve could do before the fall because we know him as Savior we know him as Redeemer he's been my comforter he's been my guide he's my advocate he's on my side I mean he's my high priest he's my blood he's Mike he's my he's my peace he's my all and all they did enormous that but I know I'm like that and every time God reveals himself to us we can worship Him and Agreda way what do you mean by that who's so if you've never been sick you can't worship God as your healer you can know he's a healer but when he heals you then you can worship saying lord you're my healer you're wonderful if you've never been saved before you can never worship Him as Savior yet you may know in your mind he is a savior but when he saves you then you can worship Him and a far greater way than before hallelujah if you've never been lost in a trial and it comes and as your guide takes you to the trial then you can worship Him as your guide if you've never been troubled before you can't worship Him as confident cuz you'd never need it comforting hallelujah so we can worship God at now now this is just me and fellowship but we can worship God in a far greater way now than they could because we know all all the goddess oh yeah I mean so so judas iscariot so well I've already just given the answer but Judas caused the resurrection it was Judas it wasn't Jesus it wasn't the disciples it wasn't even the high priest it was Judas that actually gave them the ability he went to them said I know where you can get him with us not a big crowd you just took quietly you know bringing a few people you know he's a little guy anyway you know his his other disciples they're not fighters you know you know you just come him by night I know where he goes in secret I can show you where you can get him won't be a big scene just do it huh shush you know it was Judas that caused the resurrection it was Judas that actually caused the blood of God to be shed so it was actually Judas that actually caused me to receive eternal life if I can go to that extreme it was Judas they did it so the devil gets no credit I mean here's the son of perdition right but it was actually Judas so you can actually say thank you Judas for doing what you did because without you doing what you did I wouldn't have eternal life amen so the devil gets no credit so we think that you know people your spirits are against us and things are happening actually no God allows it that he wants to reveal more of himself to us hallelujah so it's actually you know the devil thinks he's got us in a corner no that's when God comes on the scene holy so he sees now and then he thinks finally the devil thinks finally you know because Jesus is on the cross and he thinks finally that one that I've seen before I've got him and he goes down to his lazy boy or whatever he sits down in hell he thinks finally all is done but he's wrong because in an unseen realm in paradise one just went into the door that was just before just before Jesus came in there's a knock on the door ones under expectation Adams been waiting Abel's been waiting all the believers down through the ages been waiting in Paradise under the blood of a lamb I mean waiting for the perfect lamb to come then finally one steps in the door who are you your prophet did you do this so that no what's your name thief on the cross thief on the cross what did you do well and he begins to tell his testimony of his life and you know you know it's amazing how the thief had to end up as the thief on the cross so God actually allowed him to have a broken life and and whatever crime he did whatever made him that way to end up on the cross God allowed it God allowed that I mean we think things are going sideways God's allowed it so here he was he says you know I was going to be crucified there was me and this other thief and and and and but it was a different kind of day there's such a howling mob and that crying for this blood of this Jesus of Nazareth and and he didn't he didn't even answer his accusers they put a crown of thorns on his head he was marred more than any other man and we followed him that day up Calvary up the hill we'll be crucified we're terrified they finally they pinned us to the cross with nails and we're hanging there and we both made fun of them we both said if you really be the Christ get us and you off the cross but then I had another look and I looked into someone's eyes that I'd never seen look like that before I said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and he said these words today you'll be with me in paradise now I'm in paradise but where is he and then there's another knock on the door hallelujah and then he steps in and then Adam leaves they look at the seed of the woman Daniel says yo that was yet this is the Ancient of Days Ezekiel says this is the wheel within the wheel Moses see there's the yo you're the one I saw Joseph sees is the captain of the hosts of the Lord hallelujah John the Baptist says this is him I baptized them here he is holy and that Jesus is okay children let's ascend up high Holly now on his side is the keys of hell death and the grave and before he even beat out paradise he's the devil sitting in his lazyboy you know down and down in hell thinking finally it's done i've got rid of him done I finally got him and then the door swings open and he comes the one he saw on the earth he says finally I've got you you know the devil sees the saint oh I thought I had you when I had Abel I thought I had you when I had Moses but finally you're here and Jesus says Satan shut up I'm me I'm the you know I'm the Almighty conquering son of God my blood is on the cross I purchased though there are depths of the whole world I'm in charge now boy give me those keys yes he took the keys of Hell death and the grave off him kick them back into hell then ascend it up and then maybe the devil thought finally it's done maybe I could just yo finally it's over now he's gone I'm glad that's over but there but God hasn't done God's not done you know I see this in South Africa I hope it doesn't come out the wrong way but you know devil means it tormentor devil means tormentor now the believer is the devil's tormentor so we are a devil - the devil you with me we are the devil's devil because because if God has a people upon the earth that actually has claims to the earth and the devil can't take fully over he can't yo-yo you know if there's a dispute and and and who this earth belongs to I mean it can only be dispute if there's a living witness upon the earth this is actually God has given this to us so so the devil knows he's got to wipe out the seat of God and if he can achieve that then it's rightfully his but here we are here we are upon the earth now the devil thought that that finally has his tormentor was dead on Calvary and then he had gone but then they came the day of Pentecost amen when when that same God now came in 12th and a hundred and twenty and brother Bram said that when when when when Peter and John were walking by the gate beautiful there was that lame man and then they and then they picked him up and he received strength and went walking leaping into the church amen he said that's what actually rap full up saying now I've got trouble why because that same one was now in 120 anymore after that and then so now the devil comes down and he anoints thee you know you know the high priest and the Sanhedrin had time to try and put pressure upon them do not preach in his name anymore but then he looked into their eyes and he recognizes I've seen this look before now these people did not have this look a few days before this I mean Peter James and John they didn't have this look because God wasn't veiled in them I mean before the day of Pentecost and so because you know you got to look at where wherever the life of God is that's where the devil fights you you go through the Gospels it says that they wanted to stone Jesus they were to throw him down a cliff and no they wanted to kill him why didn't that say they wanted to throw the disciples down the cliff or stone them they were there with him it's because the devil was trying to destroy the life of God that was there but then when that same life came into the disciples then the devil turned his guns against the disciples right so now so so Peter who is accounted neither the Lord three times cursed during it now he had received that overcoming power in his life and then when the devil looked into us his eyes he says now I've got trouble because I've seen this look before hallelujah hallelujah amen and then we can bring it all the way down to this day because I'm gonna I'm just gonna skip seven Church ages but that same God has fully restored his bride and then when the devil looks into your eyes he says now I've really got trouble because I've seen this look before and here we are at the if we live as a tormentor Satan I mean because there's a people upon the earth that don't want his tricks they don't want his devices they won't be a slave I mean to - to anything he has they're not interested in them not because they're taught that but only but because there's a there's not a thirst a desire for any of us things hallelujah now the reason that is so is because as we read in in Revelations 1 he has made us kings and priests to God now if he has made us kings and priests and we have been lifted up into a Dominion right a king has a Dominion now now so God's plan so God's plan is to open the spiritual eyes of people that his word is true that is the same today to quicken them to the promise of their age to reveal to them their position in Christ and for them to exercise their god-given Authority amen so so even Hebrews 11:6 ears for heat so there's the second part of verse 4 he that cometh to God must believe that he is and as a reward of them that diligently seek Him I mean so we are called though if God has quickened us to the promise of the age and he has then we have to hold on to every promise and buck and back up from none of it I mean to every promise in the scripture every promise in the message we have to lay claim on it and don't back up irrespective of conditioner respective what's going on never ever back up for a promise of God never ever compromised on a promise of God never ever try to make peace with the devil say no God this is my word this is my promise I'm going to take it I mean just as just as the Philippian jailer was told he says believe he was told believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house so he is told now if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the same faith that saved you will actually cause your family to be safe hallelujah so that so as brother Graham sees in the tocut message believe all the loot Lord Jesus Christ for your house amen so don't don't back up on it I mean if the flippy and jailer can believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for his own salvation and as house of salvation then we have the same faith we had the same god-given right holy soso if that is the case we should never back up on it one iota I mean so in other words jail of the faith you have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved will save you and will also save your house so the same faith you have to receive salvation for yourself use that same faith on your household that they'll get saved as well now there has to come a time in our walk when we thank God for our salvation I mean we're going to say thank you lord thank you Lord Jesus that you saved me thank you you've healed me thank you have cleansed me thank youvery thank you've made me a new creature you go to thanking him right because remember it's already done right Jesus has already shed his blood the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so it's already a finished work so what we need to do is start thanking God and faith for the salvation of your family thank God thank the Lord that the same blood he shed on the cross for you is for them as well it's the same sacrifice that worked on you it'll work on them so if that's the case then we should not never ever back up on any promise of God but we have a god-given Authority and we need to exercise that authority I mean and that's a respective of what you see how long time has nothing that God is eternal I mean we need to stand on God God's Word hallelujah told me in the day remember our life torments them you don't have to go and attack them you just you just live a consecrated life to God that is a torment brother Bram says when the weakest of Christians on the east in the kingdom of Hell shakes hallelujah earthquakes are fun when it's not when it's not on you only I mean so we should you know we're going to realize the power we have God has given us a meant so jesus said to to Pilate in John chapter 18 member we've been we've been made kings and priests to God now we know Jesus was born to be a king but it was not first over an earthly earthly Kingdom but it was our spiritual Kingdom now he will be king in the Millenium physically but right now it's over a spiritual Kingdom he says in John 18:36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight then I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence so saying my kingdom isn't as in a physical Kingdom it's a spiritual Kingdom and then Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then and jesus answered thou sayest I am to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice who showed his voice on this day amen Jesus sososo Jesus saying my kingdom is not earthly but it's spiritual now so if his kingdom is spiritual and the scripture of cities made us kings and priests as well in his kingdom then we then we are spiritual kings over a spiritual Kingdom amen so so he has taken us and he says he has made us kings and priests unto God and his father I mean so so I want to just focus on that he has made us kings now if we are kings then we have Dominion we have a rulership I mean I just want to sow so that and it's exactly the same Dominion he has we have he said and so those in the church age book in he has made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasizes one of them he hath made us he has made me to be a spiritual King amen salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he brought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings if we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when we sit when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us enter into the kingdom into the dear son right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil this is what our Christmas present does I mean showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it as Christ and us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen so season Romans 8 he says that for we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear that's not the spirit we have received but we have received the spirit of adoption and that word adoption and the Greek means the placing as a son whereby we cry Abba Father so my father my father I'm in the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also be glorified together so we are we are now joint heirs with Christ you say this may be very elementary this is very essential we need to recognize who we are I mean and it's all in our position so if we are joint heirs with Christ everything he has dominion over we have the same Dominion because we joint heirs with him now I was having fellowship with brother nd knee and he told me to read Colossians 2 so I did what I was told and says and ye he says and ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving but where at least any man sport a spore spoiled you and that would spoil means to lead your way as booty so like a prisoner of war don't let any man take you as a prisoner of war I mean through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ in Christ as the word for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power and whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ that's why the things we wants to do we can't do because being cut away I mean the Spirit of God has circumcised those things from our I buried with him in Baptism wherein ye also risen with him through the faith of the operation now that word operation means the efficiency the energy the strong effectual working of God I mean who has race and from the dead so so we have been risen through the faith of the operation or the strong effectual working of God hallelujah who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses just say that say that all trespasses he has forgiven all trespasses hallelujah oh yeah what does all mean that that's the entirety that's not a section that's not that's not God does never leave a part of our trespasses just for later to use as leverage against you that's not how God works amen he's cleansed it all from us blotting out I love this blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly openly triumphant triumphing over them in it hallelujah so he's saying that we're risen we're joint is I mean that he is the head over all principality and power and we're risen with them to that person see we need to recognize see we're not on our way to that position but the bride is in that position I mean it's already now we're in that position doesn't matter how you feel about it see the devil will always try and make you think you're a servant he'll always try and make you think you're seeing class citizen that you're not worthy I mean just like the prodigal son he he came to himself in the Pigpen the angel the Lord came and actually brought him back to his right mind after he selfishly said I want to do my things my way and spoiled his inheritance but then when he came to himself he realized that his father's servants loved better than then how he was but then he said I'm not worried that we call the Sun no more I'll just be a servant why because his own past was condemning him what he came from was condemning him in his mind so he thought because I've done it and zero I can even be restored to full sonship again but the father never had in his mind that he's going to keep his son a servant he wandered his son restored back to his rightful position in the family and it's that's why when the father saw the Sun coming afar off he rejoiced he didn't say now where have you been he wasn't it shouldn't that he was just happy his son had returned to him I was the same thing with you and I God just wants us to come back Amen he's not doesn't worry where we've been the blood takes care of that I mean his perfect blood is perfectly loose to us I mean from everything we've ever done hallelujah and then so and then so now the father did not interrogate the son he just said to a servant get the best robe get the ring put it on kill the fatted calf my son has returned worry I meant see see that was the father's mind I want my son restored to where he should be but the son thought I could never be a son again because I have wasted my life it's the same thing with us we always think there's no way I can be the Bride of Christ I can be where he is because of what I have done no we our thinking needs to change to match God's thinking if God's thinking is she's going to be restored made in my image send the spotless nothing held against her you never did in the first place you're justified then if that's how God is thought of me I mean that's how I'm going to believe that's what I am and if I believe that then therefore I can exercise my god-given office hallelujah so amen so so we need to recognize and I trust that we do that he has placed us in heavenly places now in the book of Ephesians when yo the book of Ephesians speaks much of of our position in Christ Christ's position and God you know Christ's position and then also our position in Christ and then because of our position we can withstand the devil because the God has fully equipped us to stand in this evil day now he says in Ephesians 1 in 19 he says and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us would who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ which when he raised him up from the dead and set him at zone right hand in the heavenly places so Christ was wrestled from the dead and he was placed at the right hand of God which is the which is the power your place of power and authority as the right hand in heavenly places and then now the Apostle Paul says where this is far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come so Christ is sit at the right hand of God far above everything that can be named amen every sickness every disease every spirit every temptation whatever you can name he's far above that Amen it has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all now we know that the body of Christ is not a headless body right if a body is alive and functioning where the head as the body is also you don't see my head floating here say hello and then walk in it and then float out know where my head goes my body goes with because it's attached right and we know that the blood of Jesus Christ has attached the head to the body I mean the word has attached the head to the body so we are no longer a headless church I mean but brother and says in Christ the mystery of God revealed the hid chippers here Christ the revealed Word is here hallelujah the headship over the body so now if the head has seated far above all principality and power and Dominion and every name that can be named then the body is there also amen so and and he says as an Ephesians two and four but God who is rich in mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so so because of what the Lord has done for us he has caused the bride because we've been quickened by the word of the state where was dead in trespasses and sins but we are now quickened by the word by the Spirit of God then he has caused us to be risen up to sit with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so that's why I said with as the body is also so now if Christ is far above all Dominion principality power everything that can be named we have to you are seated far above whatever the enemy is trying to against you I mean above this world system above every spirit of the devil above the devil himself held into the great you're seated far above I'm in all the works of the devil you are hallelu you are you are not under the devils feet you're far above and he's under your feet hallelujah that's what God has made you to be see see you got to recognize know the Holy Ghost stood means the boss he's in charge he conquered hell death and the grave member the Holy Ghost and you has already overcome every spirit that can be named he conquered hell death and the grave as I said you know that same one that that bet took the keys off Satan inside that day is now in his people so the Holy Ghost in you has already overcome every temptation already overcome every spirit every doubt every worry or frustrations the Holy Ghost in you has already overcome it Amen hallelujah so now we are now far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in which is to come I'm showing you what your Christmas present does because it's more than just eternal life but it's gotten out what is the power of eternal life there would be seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that all the works the devil would be under our feet even our own humanity Amy it would be subject to the Holy Ghost within us to the Word of God he says an expectation he says he says now you say just wait till some well it could be the millennium where we don't need any healings and things that's the next age to be issued in but now we're in the Holy Ghost age now we are the sons of God now we're seated together in heavenly places not we will be we are now this afternoon I'll say this morning right here now sons and daughters of God seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus there we are all things are possible then because of where God has placed us now Amen sir now also I do finished with this thought from from revelations one and five you know we need to recognize that when when when the Lord lays claim on us the devil has no part in the conversation no more right we have no relationship with Satan we don't need to fear him we don't need to fear any of his works you know nothing he can do against us can actually harm us because we are not under his Dominion no more men we're not partly under God's Dominion then Satan's Dominion oh when the Lord you know when when the book came open on this day it showed us with you know when the seals came off the book the lamb stepped forth that is to show us our inheritance right and our inheritance brother Brahim said now i'm not going to call you church no more I'm gonna call you bride now a bride does not belong to two heads right a bride has one husband Amen the Lambs wife only has one husband which is the word right so therefore we're under one hitch if were not under - I mean so now the devil has to recognize now if we're under the headship of the word then the devil has to you know he's got to mind what we say he's gonna listen to what we say and he has no right to dictate to us what we do because he's not in charge of me the Lord is in charge of me I mean so now the only way the devil can ever have had you're being charging us in any way as if he has claims on us right by our past things we do right but the blood has perfectly loosed us from everything the devil could try and claim upon us we've been washed of it so I'm just gonna go through this a bit and then we can look at our Christmas prison a bit more approve you know yeah with a lot more appreciation so so revelations one in five he says and from Jesus Christ is the faithful witness the first / God of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our own sins in his own blood now he says in Hebrews two and nine I'm just gonna read this he says he says but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for this cause he's not ashamed to call them brethren see he's not ashamed to call you brethren family God's not ashamed of you he doesn't you know you know whenever someone's you know he's not afraid to off you know if someone's coming up here to put you away in the corner so no one sees who you are no God chose you off he showed off job to Satan have you considered my servant job he's perfect there's none like him in all the earth and job and Joe Bull he had was the blood of the Lamb he didn't know anything about life hereafter you know anything he said your tree you know yeah you know a plant dies comes back to life again tree the same he saw death barrel resurrection of nature bee sees a man dies where does he go see all he had was the blood of the Lamb but God said he's perfect because he takes me at my word that's why he's perfect amen and and he's obedient to the word that that's been given and so God actually pointed out job to Satan Satan didn't didn't consider him a perfect man until God said look he's a perfect man and so now God has a test testimony service with the devil from time to time and he points you out have you considered my bride hey yeah he's proud he's proud of you they're perfect made in my image this is the apex of my creation this is the new creation upon the earth not a patched up creation but a new creation how they there's none like them in all the earth hallelujah see God was proud of you amen isn't he wonderful now hallelujah so so he's not a shame as this one hello thank you so I didn't turn that off Ruben need like a million microphones around here and obviously by the end of the service wine he'll still be going so he's not ashamed to call us brother but praise the Lord for the sound team Amy and again I'll put my trust in him again I behold I am the children which God hath given me for as much sin as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage so he says I'm going to deliver them who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage so now the Lord came that we don't need to fear nothing maybe because why do people you know people carry on a word because they have a fear when I die what's going to happen is everything fine am I going to be okay at the river but this misses the book came open to show us if we came from God we're going back to God also the shah's salvation is not the blood plus right it's not it's not Calvary plus it's blood alone I mean so we have a perfect lamb we have a perfect Christmas present amen and it's perfectly taking care of everything that we do not have when we go to cross that veil and go to the Eternity I mean some now but but the Lord has to reveal that to you that now you know that all fear is taken away well what if what if no no that's why you know nothing to my hands I bring simply to the cross I cling there's nothing we have to present us Lord just now be covered in your blood hallelujah that that would I come up into glory it won't be me it'll be your sacrifice Amen so now we had no longer need to be in fear were being delivered from fear and because it be yeah because he sees here because of fear they were subject to bondage all their lifetime they're in slavery because of fear of death but the Lord has taken all fear away because the blood has taken it away I mean so now we're no longer in bondage but we're free men and woman I mean we're are free people today hallelujah soso if we were free people were no longer under the bondage of the devil Orson he has no claim over us whatsoever we're free hallelujah amen now he sees in the church age book again you can see where I've been look it's wonderful revelations 105 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he says the word washed is actually loose loosed us from our sins in his own blood isn't that wonderful but are you spiritually minded did you catch it it's his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins it is not human blood it was the blood of God amen Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called the blood of the Lord and the blood of Christ not three persons but one person there is that revelation again one god the omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself a body by means of the virgin birth and wealth and and wealth at that it might be the blood of God that could free us loose us entirely from our sins and presenta spotless before himself with exceeding great joy would you like an Old Testament Tyrese's look let's go back to the Garden of Eden when the first news came to glory that the son Adam had been lost at God send an angel did he send a son that he sent another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem his lost son hallelujah God did not entrust his plan of salvation to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself we were saved by the blood of God the eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the Vail with it consider this sense it is the blood of God it is a perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power of bondage and the defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete hallelujah there is now therefore no condemnation who can layer saw lay anything to the charge of God's elect this God that justifies us which declares us righteous who is he that condemneth that us Christ that died Romans 8:33 34 there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed there's now no condemnation how can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free guiltless don't listen to men listen to the word you are loosed by the blood now don't get tied down by traditions and creeds and organisations don't get led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus Saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loose by his own blood if you still hold your faith to creeds and denominations that certainly by the evidence that you've lost your faith in the word so he says that we are completely loosed from all sin and condemnation and guilt hallelujah now the scripture and and I'm just gonna finish with this that you know Hebrews 12 that that yeah now come on to Mountain Zion into the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem into the and to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly in Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling are you going to give me that or no okay that speakers better things than that of angel I'm sorry than that of Abel so we have come to this position now to that now I'm not going to go through all the now we've come to the General Assembly and the Church of the firstborn now we know God has no grandchildren all of us all of us sons and daughters he considers firstborn sons and sons and daughters now in the law everything that's firstborn had to be redeemed he was actually in the law it didn't matter if you're a donkey didn't matter if you're a sheep whatever it was but you actually there was a there was in the law the firstborn had to be redeemed by sacrifice so even now ourselves when we are here upon the earth God had to make a sacrifice in order that we would be redeemed because he cannot break his own law hallelujah so now thanks be to God now because of who we are had to make a sacrifice why I'm saying this is that God is already taking care of everything I mean there's no loopholes is no there's no wriggle room for the devil to get in God has taken care of everything for your earthly journey I mean and for you to recognize who you were that you exercise your god-given Authority in your possession Amy because remember if you're afraid people are afraid to god-given rights because they are worried that that that the devil can get ahold of them because of through through something right thing we get worried because of what the deal will may try and do but we're gonna have to have confidence no the blood has loosed me I'm free the devil has no claims on me no more has no gods bride errs without spot or wrinkle amen and and it's it's how God looks at you what matters you know there was a time when when when when when Israel was journeying to the promised land and they going through my web and Moab knew they couldn't fight Israel with natural armies they hired a prophet called Balaam and that tried to get Balaam to get in touch with God to curse Israel they knew this is how they're gonna win and then so they got Balaam and Balaam Balaam he was a he he had a gift of a prophet right here's a true you know the VESA was false but the gift was true actually says that the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied and he did it three times and then one of the times I'm the king of Moab see to see to Balaam I'll come take you around the back parts of Israel so all the week but although we're all the sinners all the terrible things happening because the king of Moab said surely if the Prophet sees everything everything that Israel's doing then God will curse them and ensure it so he shows in the back parts of of Israel and then and then the Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and what does God say I see no iniquity in Jacob this is God's testimony of Israel sure they had their sin they had their trouble they had their worries and all these things but because they are walking by the blood of the Lamb I mean when God looked down upon them he didn't see their sin and iniquity he saw that there was no iniquity in them because of the blood hallelujah so sure we have our problems and whatever is going on because the blood is applied we have a pure word which gives us the access to the fullness of the blood I mean when God looks down he says I see no iniquity in them amen so if God does not see iniquity in us then we have confidence with God we can go before them and get what we have need off amen so what is your Christmas present dude that's what my Christmas that's a part of what my Christmas present does amen so I trust that something else it would be a blessing but you know we need to we need just have confidence Lord you taking care of it all engines lose you we're saved by grace our walkers by grace let's divine a divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection the life he if he moved up I call you remember this message is a bridegroom call it's not just a general book call groom call it's a marriage call right if something in your soul has responded to it Amy what's happening God's become one with you how lujah and we know the very reason that this word this eternal word has got ahold of us as because we have a theophany in heaven waiting for us I meant this Christmas prisoners to align us with our theophany I mean so it's not a haphazard am I going to make it no if you got representation in heaven I mean then you're gonna make it cuz you've got a body to step into and the reason that you've been called upon the earth is because you have that body hallelujah so God's taking care whoa but but this thing you know there's so many things going on spirits fighting and all these things don't worry about it keeping them pray amen take your god-given Authority take your god-given rights exercise it don't be afraid of nothing the host should encamp against me in this thing I'll be confident the one thing I've decided the Lord roll by Biden is Tabernacle in the house of Lord forever though war should rise against me whatever it is don't worry about it stand on God's given word he'll see you through remember he knows what you have need of he knows how to get you to where you need to be remember Esther was a dainty queen God knew how she was she was never gonna be there being in Israel with appearance living in the promised land God allowed the nation to be carried off into idolatry God allowed her parents to die God allowed them to be carried and her to become the queen many times you say why is my life come out this way God knows why God knows why the path you've you've you've taken and many times we think we're just stumbling along but our whole life has been guided we have to have confidence Lord you got me here you'll
