amen he says when i psalms 8 3 david says when i consider thy heavens the works of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him amen for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thou has made it him to have dominion over the works of thy hands that has put all things under his feet amen do you believe that this morning amen all things that includes any trial that includes any physical ailment any mental illness any wiles of satan everything is under your feet if we can only grasp that this morning understand that amen that's sincere victory amen regardless of what the devil does to you or has done to you he's under your feet this morning

praise the lord hallelujah thank you musicians amen thank you brother jeremy amen god bless you all great to have everyone here today hallelujah amen praise the lord hallelujah let's go to the let's just turn to the scripture um just a reminder we have the youth service at 3 p.m today but everyone's welcome so we're going to go to first kings 18 and then we're going to go to exodus 30 and i pray this kind of just all all ties together uh first kings 18 and um we're going to go from verse 17. probably a quite a familiar piece of scripture i trust everyone you know we were driving where did we go we're going to go get us the 18 happy birthday 18 year old sash for tiana yesterday and armando ed asked me what's the title of your sermon and i said i'm not sure yet they said why not i thought boy that's a message of the vital so i kind of incorporated this but yeah we'll see how we go but you know we should be sure god is god amen so first kings 18 and from verse 17 down to verse 24 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou in thy father's house and that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and has not and has followed balaam now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal 450 and the prophets of the groves 400 which eat at jezebel's table so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel and elijah came unto all and came unto all the people and said how long holt here between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but balaam's prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks let them choose one bullet for themselves and cut it in pieces lay it on wood and put no fire under it and i'll dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under it and call you on the name of your gods and i'll call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken they weren't sure but why not amen well we're going to go to exodus uh chapter 30 and we're going to read from verse 11 here um uh uh chapter 30 and from from verse 11 of of exodus i'm glad people ask because that means they want to know especially just people going you're just you know not listening or not wanting so i'm yeah praise the lord i'm glad i'm in a company of people who we all want more of god don't we in our lives amen so exodus 30 and verse 11 and the lord spake unto moses saying when thou take us to some of the children of israel after their number then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the lord when thou numbers them that there be no plague among them when thou numbers them this shall they give everyone that passeth among them that are numbered half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary a shekel is 20 gunas and and half shekel shall be the offering of the lord everyone that passes among them that are numbered from 20 years old and above shall give an offering unto the lord the rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel when they give an offering unto the lord to make in a tall atonement for your souls so this price that was paid was tied into their atonement i mean let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a need you'll lift it to the lord amen let's yo he's a personal god so let's talk to him let's let's come before him and ask him to come to where we are this morning gracious heavenly father lord we are so thankful that nothing compares to the promise we have in you you're the great almighty god you're the creator of heavens and earth and lord you fill all time and space but yet lord you became the lowest of the low oh lord you became the poorest of the poor lord you took on human battles you took on human frailty to understand what was like to be a to be a human but also to ransom us to redeem us back to yourself so i just want to pray lord may you receive all honor glory and praise lord oh i wish we had more words to express our love and our thanksgiving unto you lord what you've done for us dear god i pray you just meet every need this morning may touch every life anoint every soul lord maybe walk out of these doors changed transformed and renewed lord by your presence lord may you grant it lord we've read just from the pages of your word we're just asking once again may you the great author come and make it live lord in our lives grant it for your glory we just want to lift up those who are sick and body who are not here be their portion lord we especially want to remember dimitri down in christchurch at this time lord i pray you touch his body and lord may he use this sickness to bring his heart back to you lord for your glory lord for the salvation of the family may you grant it lord we commit them into your hands we thank you lord any other needs lord may you meet them for your glory we love you and just want to commit the service into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seeds this morning so as i said i want to speak on i'm not sure yet and then the answer question should be why not you know people may say that they are believers but their lives show they're not sure yet we should be real sure you know as as abraham would come to a spot he became fully persuaded that the lord was more than able to to give him the promised son so he wasn't sure he was real sure he was fully persuaded now when he was fully persuaded he wasn't talked into it because if someone can talk you into the message someone can talk you out of the message but if the lord reveals it to you you become fully persuaded that no one can talk you out of it because it was the lord that brought you in and if the lord brought you in man cannot take you out i mean so it's amazing when you think of what god would you know had done during the you know you know in the history of israel but they came to a spot where they forgot really the mighty power of god you know i'm so thankful that you know um you know that god still answers though you know because he wants every generation to have their own revival he wants every generation every generation has a chance at the word that the world would put on flesh in their lives and live every generation does not just the older generation not just our grandparents generation but our generation and when i say our generation i say every man woman and child in this building this generation but elijah you know god had to call them to what we call a mount carmel showdown in order to reveal himself and you know what happens is when people are between two opinions is it it actually produces spiritual amnesia the prophet tells us that people actually forget who they are when they're between two opinions you know it's always the opinion is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever is he not you know is this mess is true or is it not well i've heard this person say this i've heard this person say this and being between those two opinions causes a person to forget who they are but elijah wasn't in that state the rest of israel may have been we know there were seven thousand who had not bowed you know you know bowed down to baal but you know elijah was fully persuaded that god was god but the thing is you know whenever you meet the lord you can't keep it to yourself you've got to tell us you want other people to become fully persuaded you don't want them to be not sure yet you want them to be sure that god is god amen so he called them to mount carmel and he said why staggy between two opinions if god is really god give all you are to him serve him with all your energy all your strength all of your love all of your affection should be poured upon him he's worth it all if baal is god give him all your love all your affection all that you are serve him but make up your mind that's what you got to do as well make up your mind as god god was baal god which one's god find out who is god and serve that god hallelujah and then he said you know what i love he says now the real god will answer by fire now baal baal was the god of fire they believed he was the god of the rain and it was head of drought one man said there will be no rain or due till i call for it hallelujah and it didn't there was no reign of jew until he called for it amen so he was a god of of rain and there was no rain and they believed he was god of fire so they believed well fire's gonna fall we're gonna fix this problem they were the problem by being between two opinions they were the problem amen but god is the answer to every problem hallelujah so so here they were and he said the god that answers by fire he is god hallelujah and we know the rest of the story the offering was prepared he rebuilt the altar of the lord you know we should just be you know we have so many testimonies in our midst who's been saved stand up have you been saved stand up if you've got the holy ghost standing have you been healed look around everyone there's a lot of testimony right here if god is god serve him holy we've seen his god alive today not yesterday not someone else's story i'm so glad everyone who's standing you can say it's not my neighbor's story that brought me in god brought me in god save me god redeem me tell this if god is god serve him hallelujah amen and i can say god you could may have your seats if you so desire but you know we just it's got to take stock sometimes is god alive does this message produce jesus christ and the people is the word put on flesh again it has amen it's a living god it's not a historical god amen jesus christ is alive today why are you trying to drill these things because you know everything god was he poured into you all there wasn't god has poured into christ all those important and the christ is poured into you hallelujah so we have we have everything we have need of we have glory we don't need to go get it it's here hallelujah amen you know brother brown would say um if i can find it here he says the reason he says in the prince of god unrecognized he said but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if i can only touch his garmency and when that genuine faith in god became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her uh your faith has saved you what did faith other other standing there might have been sicker than she but you see she recognizes presence she knowed that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight i'll say this morning people if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how how do you recognize his presence is when the promised word of this age is made manifest hallelujah and you know not the promised word of moses age or any other ages the promised word of this age now we know very you know it's beyond a shadow of a doubt the lord's restored all things the books come open the mighty angel has descended amen we've received malachi 4. hallelujah revelations 10 7 the son of man has been revealed in our midst today i mean in a body of people highly so that is the promised word of today i mean so we we are here you know you know i believe that we're in another season where god's pouring his spirit out more and more hallelujah because he wants to prepare us for a rapture i mean where the dynamics comes into full manifestation the moving of his holy ghost comes into its full power once again hallelujah so i believe that's where we are living right now but the reason he's moving i mean it's because he wants to release to us our desires that we have in him i mean so we have a desire for the holy ghost we have a desire for more of god desire for healing desire for deliverance desire for salvation of our families or ourselves well he's moving because he wants to release that desire to us hallelujah that's why it's so important to reach out and touch the lord as he passes by i mean don't take it for granted we're just having church again thank god we're having church again thank god we're not in some lockdown where we can't gather no more and we're just looking over a screen and you know there's some countries in the world they're still in lockdown they're still in lockdown for over a year now they can't gather like this they can't have camp they can't have church like this but we can hallelujah amen so we should never take it for granted hallelujah so elijah made the challenge but the reason he made the challenge is god told him go make the challenge hardly because he knew because when he prayed after the wood was prepared the altar was prepared the sacrifice all the water on and everything he says lord i have done this all according to your word so the lord already showed him what to do he wasn't guessing when he stood up there and made the challenge god already told him by vision go do this and he saw the vision unfold hallelujah and then he called said lord that you that the people know that thou art god and now has turned their hearts back again other than the fire fell hallelujah and then the people's amnesia was broken they realized the lord he is god has not balaam and what these priests have been telling us in their arguments they're debating their political pressure that they use but they realize that the god that's answered by fire he's a true and living god hallelujah and they gave themselves back to that god hallelujah so you know we could just look at it as a you know ask you all just well stand up if you've got a testimony well these people are sure you may say i'm not sure yet well why not god's done too much that may be a wrong way to say it but he's gone he's done so much he's he's done so much in this generation i'm not talking about even when brother brown was i'm talking about right now he has done so much proved himself alive hallelujah by many many infallible or uninfallible proofs or however you say it you know i say things around the wrong way half the time but you know what i mean amen amen now we should be real sure that he is the our our redeemer now we read that scripture in exodus 30 because there was a reason when jesus went into the temple he got angry at the at the money changes and those that sell the sold the sacrifices now when it speaks we read here that there would be a um they had to pay a redemption money and it had to be half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary so what had to happen is as you know you know a shekel was a weight of of of of money and different countries had a different shekel so the syrians would have their own shekel egypt would have a shekel it's like a dollar there's australian dollar new zealand dollar american dollar you know whatever but you have to when you go to that certain country you have to get your money traded or swapped to use that money in the country i could have a million or a billion us dollars but it had to be changed into new zealand dollars to be used here right or if i go there advice you know anyway so this the shekel of the sanctuary what would happen is people would travel with shekels from another country but in order to pay this for the atonement for their soul they had to get their money exchanged otherwise they couldn't use their money in the temple so there had to be a currency that was there that the people could use in order to pay this atonement for their soul now we know all these things point to our lord jesus christ right there is a you know this god would show these things in shadow revealing you know our redemption to us because this would be in it this this money even though the blood was given all those different things they had to make this pay this pay this uh price in order to make an atonement for their souls now we know when jesus was standing on the earth they challenged him and they asked him tell us therefore who think what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not and jesus it says perceive their wickedness and said why attempt ye me ye hypocrites and then he got given a piece of tribute money and he held it up and said whose inscription is on this whose image is on this coin and they could easily identify caesar's inscription on the coin but here was the image of the invisible god made flesh among them here was you could say the shekel of the sanctuary was standing in flesh not just for one person but for the people of the whole earth and they could easily identify the man-made shekel but what about the god-made shekel what about what about the tribute money or the or the or the shekel of the sanctuary that was made flesh the real one what the shadow was pointing to was now reality they couldn't see past the veil they couldn't they you see many times we've got to look past one another and see the word well look past our humanity look past our faults or you know our our sticky nature will look past those things and see god made flesh i mean so they couldn't you know it took god supernaturally to reveal to peter james and john this was more than a man from galilee a more a man from nazareth than more than a prophet more than a good person more than a philosopher this was god hallelujah so so the scribes and pharisees could easily identify the money but they couldn't identify the one who could actually redeem them oh my lord jesus i pray that we can look beyond oh it's just ink on paper is it oh it's just a message is it really it's just sermons is it really or is it just a prophet's ministry is it is it only that or is it god revealed in this hour oh we're just having church are we really just having church what does that mean oh we're just here on a sunday morning because this is what we do is it is it really that or we've come to come in contact with the supernatural god having to meet our needs and change our hearts to be made more like him hallelujah amen now they had to exchange this money to be for the um shekel of the sanctuary now we know god you know brother brown uses these scriptures many times you'd say in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and he'd linked that that's you know john 1 1 and 114 and he'd link that together many times so he says now here's the invisible god and he's become flesh now that those two scriptures covered thousands of years where god would be invisible then he became visible in the logos yeah the pillar fire he condescended down through the prophets through the kings different ones till finally the fullness of god here bodily wasn't a man but here it was because a spirit cannot die a spirit cannot bleed a spirit cannot make an atonement it has to become flesh so so this shekel money you could say all this payment had to become flesh in order to make the ransom payment for you and i it wasn't just you know it wasn't just a spirit saying for something else you know brother and would say in a few places he says and jesus said when he was here on earth i do nothing of myself it's not me it's my father and he dwelleth in me see now the bible said that god the father was in christ the son reconciling the world to himself see so he was no more a man he was a god man he was not um he was the god man so not a god man he was the god man he was god made flesh to take away sin that's the only way it could be god had to suffer god couldn't suffer the penalty of his own judgment unless he was made flesh because god is immortal he's a spirit jesus said in saint john uh saint john the fourth chapter god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth and a spirit could not suffer death that this could not suffer death that the spirit had pronounced and the spirit did not send a prophet to take its place the spirit did not send a man to take its place the spirit came itself and flesh to take the place of it that's right god taken the place of a sinner and died in its dead and if i pronounce penalty upon everyone in here if they looked at that light and somebody looked and i didn't want them to die and i wanted to redeem them i could not ask my good brother good friend brother moore to take the place i could not ask brother joseph to take their place i could i would be unjust if i asked my boy sitting here billy paul to take the place the only way i can justly do it that's take the place myself that's the only way i can do it and justify and god is just so god came down and formed a body built it himself a tabernacle and they made him but how be it the most high dwelleth not in tabernacles made by hands but a body thou has prepared me that's right god made um god made the own body that he dwelt in and that body was his own son christ jesus god dwelt in christ reconciling the world to himself no man has seen the father at any time but the only begotten of the um the only begotten of the son has declared him that's right that's wonderful so the spirit could not die he had to become flesh in order to pay the ransom so so this shekel of the of the sanctuary there had to be a there had to be a change of that money in order for it to actually be used for a red um for for the redemption of the people it's the same thing where god had to become flesh for you and i you know i know we're looking at easter next weekend but you know i trust these things mean something to you where he had to become our redeemer he had to make that payment you know we had a debt we could not pay he had a debt he did not owe hallelujah but he came and purchased our salvation amen brother brown would say this he'd say now he'd say this in job 55 he says when god looked i says yonder i see adam and eve the first little sweethearts there in the garden of eden i see adam back there when he put his arms around his little sweetheart to walk out with her for god had condemned them and he started out with his arms around his darling adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter if she had to go to torment he'd go with her when god looked down and seen that love of a human being it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself that's right he said i'll come and go too and said i'll put enmity between her seed and the serpent sea so he's uh so so he didn't just kick them out of the garden and just watch them walk off he says i'm going to come with you i'm going to come with you through this through these ages amen until finally i'm made flesh i'm going to fix all this problem listen closely four thousand years later yonder and the city of jerusalem let's change our scenes and look there come down the streets of jerusalem bumpity bumpity bump out of the gates um out of the gates of damascus yonder out of the out of the damascus gate goes towards golgotha a little fallow with a crown on of little thorns on his head and a cross over his shoulder looked all over his back there's just little red spots what are they look back yondu and adam was leaving with his sweetheart going out under condemnation with a shadow a shadow of redemption somewhere because there was blood running over them somewhere there was a shadow he knew it i hear something going what was it it's old bloody sheepskin beating up and down on his legs speaking of some time there's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever and we only reach that shore by face decree knowing that someday they'll go back into eden again i just want let's just let's just let's just stop why does the lord why is he alive the reason we feel his presence the reason he's quickened his word to us the reason that he turned our hearts to walk with him it's because there's a heaven to go to all it is is heaven reaching down into this world into this realm trying to get a hold of you to take you back up to where it's from hallelujah we're heaven actually brother brown says heaven actually expanded out upon the earth that redemption expanded out to come upon the earth to get you and i oh that's why when we feel his presence that sweet feeling comes over us we just love him more what's that heaven calling to you you're theophany actually calling you you've got a home to go to hallelujah you know i was i was rejoicing so much last night i think we are there brother on this brother nene talking about home yes you know brother anis will give you the testimony of his dad and you know what happened before he went to be with the lord it was real special but you know there's something about home when you think about home home is where you belong home is where you're from it's not a house it's not a place you dwell like like i was thinking even myself my home wellington is not my home i live here but this is not my home i could even say new zealand i live here but it's not my home this is not my final resting place i'm just passing through but i'm on where you going i'm on my way home we can even ask abraham if i could maybe put those words in his mouth abraham where are you going do you live here look you got all these cattle and sheep and tents and people and things is this your home no i'm passing through where you're going abraham to a city whose milk maker and builder is god because he he met the king of that city and and so he could say i'm going home where is that home you're going back to the uh the chaldees you're going here no no i'm going home where is that home can i come with you you can okay where are we traveling how many days journey well it's just from here that next dimension is about here hallelujah but that's where home is amen i trust i trust there's something in your soul this is not my home i'm just passing through heaven's my home i've heard from my heavenly home and it's been calling me more and more every day come home it's time to go it's time to come home hallelujah we're living in that season where we're going home amen you may think that's a crazy talk no it's not crazy talk it's reality harley abraham was fully persuaded he wasn't not sure am i going to have isaac is this going to happen how is this going to no he became fully persuaded he wasn't between two opinions he came to a spot where god was able to perform that which he had promised hallelujah and he just went rejoicing hallelujah what do you think of that four-letter word home are you on your way home when i talk about home i'm not talking about physical address i'm talking about heaven do you know that's where your home is i trust that you know not because maybe mom and dad say oh i'm saying it no yes something's quicker than your soul i'm going home we're gonna go home soon hallelujah so the lord went with them amen there's a lamb beyond the river so brother graham said he even said he saw them walk out of the garden where was he when he saw that you know you know he would say many times the people you know like one example i see you're on the operating table i see that some doctors have got your stomach or something in their hands they're looking at it they shake their head they put it back in where was he when he saw that he went back in time he was standing there seeing the whole thing unfold and when he saw the lord go up calvary he saw it he says when i see this he sees it in vision form when he's preaching hallelujah so it's more than just stories he's actually saying no i see this is how it takes place this is really you know how well because he's singing in visual form god is transporting him back there he says in one place i'm standing in two worlds so he's standing on the platform talking to someone but he's actually in a eternal realm seeing what has been seen what is and seeing what will be and that same god is here he knows all about our lives he knows everything about our lives he knows our motives our objectives what we're thinking even right now he knows all about us amen so i just say lord have your way in my life amen and now i see him going yonder now the second adam going up the hill the little spots on his back they get bigger and bigger and bigger as he walks on what was it after a while they go into one spot i hear something beating again what is it there goes the second adam no more than jehovah himself who come down was made flesh well i said that's a shekel of the sanctuary right there i mean even to go to hell for a sweetheart to redeem her back to uh uh to the one christ to redeem his bride hallelujah i seen it in adam yonder he came down was made flesh conforts with us that he might marry the human race to himself there he is going yonder to calvary and as he's moving up the hill and poor his little shoulder rubbing the old bee of death humming around him it ain't going to be long till i get him buzzing around and around after a while it had to sting him but friend you know if a bee ever stings anybody deeply he can't sting no more he pulls a stinger out so he hasn't got no more stinger and i tell you that's the reason god was made flesh here on earth in order to hold the stinger of death our death has no more sting the bee can buzz and swarm but he can't sting oh death where is our victory grave where is thy victory amen but christ the kinsmen redeemer has made a way of escape for every believer on this earth today the be might hum the be might buzz the bee might try and make you afraid but i can point you yonder to calvary where god himself was made flesh when he held the stinger of death he took my place as a sinner and paid the price and he laid out the welcome mat to me to come home whosoever will let him come and drink from the fountains of waters of life freely he that comes in comes i'll no wise cast out hallelujah that's our god amen he was the image of the invisible god as i said they couldn't look beyond the flesh to see that it was god made flesh hallelujah amen but we can not because of history but because we see god that same god has risen out of history hallelujah now he would come into the temple and he would make a scourge of ropes and he would drive out the sheep and the ox and poured out the change's money and overthrew the tables why because instead of something being a sacred piece of worship it turned into a money-making racket and then the disciples saw all this and they remembered that the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up so the zeal for his father's house eat him up so much that he he did all what we'd call scenes of great violence but he wanted to purify the temple that would be a place not of money-making or transactions but a place of worship amen and it should be the same thing with you and i i mean the lord sometimes needs to make a scourge of ropes and go through our life and drive out all these things that just make religion just a just a way of life instead of actually a living god amen brother ram says that you know that you know that god takes a d9 d5 bulldozer down your tin can alley and just and just pushes all out of the way i'm in your alley of sin and everything in your life hallelujah amen hallelujah now to be pardoned no there's a reason he did this he wanted to live in people this may be very elementary but this is here we are in elementary god wanted to live in people he never wanted to just have a religion he didn't want religious people cain was very religious but that's not what god wanted i mean he wants people that he can live in there's this whole purpose of of of of being our atonement amen that we would receive the atonement would be become one with him now to be pardoned it's not just a mental change of thinking he says here in all things and i think it's an important thing that's pardoned i love that word pardoned actually the word means a release from guilt and what an experience that is to everyone who has had an experience of it to be released from guilt who's been released from guilt hallelujah not trying to turn away through some form of psychology turn away but be pardoned that means it's put away there's no more to it it's forgotten to turn away from anything you could turn back to it like sins at one time were covered but now they're not covered they're divorced they're completely gone put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to never be remembered no more he says i like that i mean this is not just we turn from something and we have to in our own ability keep from it that's not how this works i mean but to be pardoned you me it means to be released from guilt you're actually released from the thing when you receive the part and the atoning blood i mean the part and it actually turns you from it that you're actually released something that held you bound i mean you're no longer bound by it you cannot be bound by because you've been released from it hallelujah so that's why we can walk in liberty today it's not us trying to keep ourselves not us just seven steps if i do this every day i'll overcome no if the overcomer comes into you you'll overcome all things i mean because because he's already overcome all things he overcame cancer overcame all sickness all temptation all trials all hardship all all peer pressure pressure of the day everything he overcame all those things and if he has already overcome it and he's in you you've already overcome when you recognize the one and you has already overcome it then you will overcome it many times when two armies go to war they think can we win but if one side says absolutely we can win they go to war hallelujah they're not afraid can we can we beat this other nation yes we can we're going in hallelujah and i'm not talking about national battle i'm talking about battles against demon powers right now i mean that we're called out our weapons are our warfare or not carnal it's not through human reasoning it's not through political agenda trying to sway people's emotions it's not that kind of thing it's mighty through god through the pulling down of strongholds hallelujah so we go sometimes we think well can we win absolutely we can win do we have the best equipment absolutely do we have the best rugged training absolutely hallelujah so we shouldn't shrink back from any challenge our god is able and if he's able let's press the battle let's not give one place to the devil say well i guess i've got to live with this problem no hallelujah we don't have to put up with nothing amen hallelujah and so i think that's what pardon me means is completely erased not just turn aside and give something a try we don't want to give something a try you know when elijah's on mount carmel he's not just saying boys i'm just going to give this a try i'm here to show you god is god hallelujah so i just give him a try jesus christ is alive today but don't just well if it works out you know if this works out for me you know that's the problem with human love many people get together because it works out for them that's not love that's just convenience that's relationship builds a bonkin you're built upon convenience and a lot of people come to god that way well everything's going fine if this works out for me god i'll you know i'll serve you but when things get a bit shaky well i'm just gonna you know you're gonna i don't know about this no that's not it you sell out lock stock and barrel all that you are jumping boots and all here i am lord for good times for bad times and sickness and health good and bad whatever it may be lord i'm just here [Music] hallelujah there's a reason i'm saying all this and and we will get to it okay because we don't walk by the five senses amen but it's a race that's gone not turn aside uh we have like through pardon we are released not by psycholo not by psychology we are not released by a creed we're not released by emotion but we are released through the power of calvary that means there's a power in this day that's been released to release us we are pardoned free oh it means to be free a burden off your shoulders out of your heart a free person that's what it means to be pardoned who's been pardoned hallelujah amen we've been released through the power of calvary you know that's what this message has come to do this is why there's the fire manifestations of the spoken word and the prophets ministry because god wanted to show this is what my blood achieved this is what my word actually does it doesn't just make another religious movement god's on the show this is me living hallelujah and he did it because he wanted to show you and i that same life you see and you hear should be in you amen that's why that's why when brother brown preaches the rising of the sun i probably said this a lot but it means a lot to me to me he's not he's not just kind of pulling out from the scripture oh this is a nice easter text no he's making a declaration this is a new day this can be a new day for you but this is a different season you know we've had the darkness and you know you're the gloom of denomination but now a new day has risen hallelujah a new season has come you know i love it when he says in restoration of the bride tree he says he says when jesus was in the tomb dead that was luther and then when the tomb came open there was a rumor yeah you know different things that was like pentecost but then on the third day when he walked in their mitts walked into the room where he was i mean i mean where they were proved himself alive he wasn't a rumor no more he says he's alive today he says this is this day amen where he's no longer a rumor is he alive well i hear these people say this and this apologetics ministry says this and this says this no it's more than that it's god comes out of history to you and chose you personally i'm alive amen touch yes like he said to thomas put your hands on my side touch my hands and my feet and that and that word touch means verify by contact and we've come into contact with something we've come into contact with the jesus of the bible i mean who's alive forevermore but he wants you to know that because if you know that it makes a stability in your life you're not tossed to and through doesn't matter what's going on in life you can say i know the anchor holds i know i'm anchored beyond the veil so it doesn't matter what comes what goes i'm gonna walk on with you lord amen hallelujah so he preaches it's the rising of the sun and you go to leviticus there where the where the priest you know would be the first part of the harvest because we know if you look at a field of wheat or any any harvest for that matter it's not the same you know you know the harvest doesn't come to harvest condition at the same time some of the field can still be green a bird this can be ready here this is not ready but so what happened is that a portion of the harvestable wheat would be cut down and it was given to the priest a wave before the lord and thanksgiving and what the thanksgiving was is god it was thanksgiving to god god the rest of the seed in the field will come forth with the same life with the same maturity because it is the same life it's not a different seed it's the same seed same life and the same potentials hallelujah you take an apple seed you put it in the ground you get an apple tree and you eat the apple you take that seed you put it in the ground it grows a tree you get another apple you don't get a pumpkin you don't get a watermelon you don't get a tangerine you get another apple so if that seed was planted jesus said unless you know the greeks and stuff they said sirs we would see jesus and they saw a man may be sitting there and they couldn't quite you know see him for who he was but he would say to them well unless a seed die it doesn't die it abides alone but if it does die it'll bring forth much fruit so he's actually giving him the answer this is how you'll see me when i'm dead but i resurrected my same life comes into you you'll see me alive you'll see jesus hallelujah and we see jesus today amen so so so that part of the wheat field was way before the lord and it was the life of christ was waved on pentecost over a people and god was declaring this first fruit you see it will be reproduced in a people and there were 120 in the upper room it was waved over and what did it do it didn't make a just a religious movement it made a living people full of the living god living church of the living god filled with his goodness with his presence hallelujah and brother it says that same thing is repeated at the end time because there's two there's two harvests amen in the you know in the scripture the barley and the wheat harvest two different times i mean so the second one that same life has been waved over you and i it's been waved over the earth and god's rejoicing saying there's there's seed in the field hallelujah who was who was not alive when the prophet was alive so who is all born after 1965 we're in the field hallelujah i love it when brother cadre brought up at camp he said why why did they have to spend 40 years in the wilderness because rahab wasn't alive when they came out of egypt i mean she had to be in her place so there had to be a waiting period why because god's child had to come to birth had to come to her position for her to receive the spies hallelujah to come under a short token hallelujah and that's why we're still here upon the earth there's still seed that must come to life there's still seed in the field amen that must come to life and either the same life that you saw in the prophet is in the bride you know brother brown would would come to genesis 18 many times and he would speak of it we said you know god was made flesh and the two angels with him came down and spoke to abraham on the plains of memory and then so he would dramatize it many times because because go because sarah was in the tent behind where god was sitting and god was speaking to abraham and and and he would he would just ask where is sarah thy wife because according to time of life you have the promised son they were in their 90s she laughed within her heart saying how can i pleasure with my lord you know this is impossible how's this going to happen and then the lord just you know perceived what she was thinking and said why did sarah laugh you know and said now that was jesus christ yesterday there and in the new testament he did it as well he's the same today he says now i'll turn my back he says someone back here such and such and such accurate what's he trying to do he's trying to get the people to see where in genesis 18. before the burning of the world there's a people who've been called out they're not even tangled up inside him like lot was but they've been called out by a word amen the scripture says come out of her my people be not partaker of her plagues we've heard a voice i said come here i am here i am hallelujah thank you lord we came out but then brother brown doesn't just leave it there was god because many times what i mean by that is many times people just say yes that was god manifested in flesh and the prophets identifying his own ministry there so that's just that's just for him he says in christ and mr god revealed what did they recognize that if he could ever heal or redeem or save or set free before he could do he could do the same thing for them and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and as the days of lot when a modern billy graham and old roberts went down to sodom and preached to them sodomites and blinded their eyes see with the gospel one angel stayed back a messenger with abraham and the elected group and what kind of sign did he do see and what did abraham call him elohim that's a self-existing one god manifested in flesh jesus showing that he himself god in him would be manifested in his bride in the last days so it's not just even in the prophet he says in his bride and the who's the bride of christ i believe i'm looking at at a portion of her from around the world so saying that elohim all that god was would be manifested in a people today so now it's not just in a prophet's ministry just like he even said the ministry the son of man is in people and human beings so it's not just in one man it's in us the minister the son of man continues on through the bride just like how brother brown would say that i'll ride this trail again that's god speaking first person saying i'm gonna i'm gonna do the same thing again but not through the prophet but through the people it's god speaking through that's god speaking first person through a man you say does he do that well david will be caught up in the spirit he'd say my god my god why is that forsaken me my bones they stare at me they you know they you know they you know the balls of basham have compassed about me all the you know they pierced my hands and my feet now if we went back there maybe we'd see david sitting by a window playing his heart caught up in the spirit and he'd be crying out my god my god why is that forsaken me and we'd look at him say you're not forsaken david the crown's on your head the kingdom's under your feet we all love you you're not forsaken but god was speaking first person through him because he was looking at calvary as if he was literally on the cross god can speak first person through a man hallelujah so now he says the elohim would be would be manifested god will be manifested in flesh now if you think about this our god is present in us now he said i'd never leave him or forsake thee now if god is in us everything we have need of is in him and we have it available right so now if god was ever jehovah jireh the lord will provide himself a sacrifice he's still jehovah jireh today amen if he is ever jehovah wrath of the lord mahila he still heal healer today right and he's not somewhere up in the heavens someplace only but he's even present in this room just now amen he's not and he's not just present here but if you have the baptism of the holy ghost he's in you hello so if he ever was jehovah jiren now if we look at jehovah jireh when abraham took isaac up the mountain to to sacrifice him and then and then even isaac didn't know that he was a sacrifice but he was carrying the wood they had the flame or whatever you know he goes up the hill and you know and he's and he's looking at at his father and he says father here's the word you know this is probably where we're going but where's the sacrifice and he said the lord himself will provide a sacrifice and then so when abraham was just about to draw the knife and you know plunge it into the neck or the heart of isaac you know his hand was stayed and and and he was told don't sacrifice him and then he looked over and he saw a ram was caught in a thicket now the question was where did that ram come from why didn't he see it when they were walking up the hill that's because god provided the ram when the ram was needed because when when when when god saw that abraham was willing to give his only son when he was willing to go all the way god provided really what abraham needed i mean so that that that ram appeared there when it wasn't there before hallelujah so god can make things appear where they don't seem to be there hallelujah so you say well i'm sick and body well he can he he can just make healing appear we need salvation he can make it appear hallelujah deliverance he can make it appear where it seems where is it where how's this going to come i don't know he's still jehovah gyra hallelujah he's still jehovah gyra right now you need a revival he'll provide you a revival hallelujah you need encouragement stability joy he'll provide those things hallelujah i mean he says in abraham 55. he says now up on the mountain there he took his own son tied his hands behind him laid him upon the altar reached down pulled out the knife pulled the little fellow's throat back he raised up his hand to stab his own son to death and about that time the holy ghost caught his hand said abraham stay your hand don't be scared to walk right down to the last row of life with him god will be there on the scene he's jehovah jireh god will provide a sacrifice he will make a provision amen and about that time he heard something bleat and there was a little ram hooked in the wilderness by his horns where did that ram come from they were hundreds of miles from civilization they were way up on a mountain where there's no water how'd that ram get there he's still jehovah gyra no matter what the circumstances is he can provide the sacrifice at any time i mean no matter what the circumstances in he's jehovah jireh now look it wasn't a vision he walked over he picked up the ram he laid it out there and stabbed it with a knife and blood came out of it it wasn't a vision he saw it it was actually a ram it was christ the lamb of god slammed from the foundations of the world hallelujah there he was christ it wasn't a vision that lamb was spoke into existence in the last minute and went out of existence in another minute the same way that god made himself manifested in the flesh before abraham and went out of existence in another minute he's the same god that someday these these atoms of yours will break and go out life will go out of this body and he will speak and bring it back into existence someday in the resurrection he's jehovah jireh how did he do it i don't know that's his business but he said he would do it and i believe him jehovah jireh the lord will provide himself a sacrifice no matter what it is the lord the lamb was there he provided a lamb when it needed a lamb when you're sick and you need healing he'll provide for you if you need salvation he provides for you if you need a revival he will provide for you if the meal barrel is empty he'll provide it for you amen if you're all down-hearted and drooped over god will provide for you for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastiser of peace was upon him and with his stripes were healed amen the lord's provided sacrifice the laws provided lamb amen so he's still jehovah gyra this morning oh he's still jehovah rapha this morning he's still our shield he's still out banner amen he's still the lord's present jehovah shammer hallelujah amen you know how powerful a testimony is a testimony can spark many more of the same you know there was a there was a woman and and i mentioned her in a quote earlier before but you know she she had the blood issue for many years but she looked beyond jesus the man and so she could get healing she somehow saw that he was jehovah rapha and she was determined if i could just touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole there are many other people around them but she went with one purpose you know if we just go with one purpose to the lord hallelujah we said lord i have this need hallelujah we can get it we can actually get it i mean that's just not empty words you can actually get it she really got what she needed amen when she touched the hem of his garment amen and when she touched it she was made perfectly whole now this began to spread hallelujah that was in matthew 9. now matthew 14 it says we and when they were gone over they came to the land of guinness um genocide if that's how you say it and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all the country roundabout and brought unto him all that were diseased and they besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touch were made perfectly whole why is it because i heard a testimony of one woman and they realized if he's jehovah rapha there he's still the same jehovah rapha here he didn't suddenly stop becoming our healer there just because that woman touched him you know he's an inexhaustible fountain you can't we can't drain him with his goodness of his power to heal the power to save the power to redeem aiming the power to deliver he never gets empty on that says hold on boys i need to plug in and recharge a bit no no he's inexhaustible so they knew if he could heal there then he'll heal here and they brought their sickness and they just touched him of his garment so the same testimony she had they all had hallelujah why because a testimony sparks many more of the same hallelujah you know he would he would cast seven devils out of mary magdalene and brother brown would say in a few places it was like pride and envy and different things that people don't even know they have and they were cast out of her and then there was another woman who was stirred up that heard that testimony and she was a woman that that that hung around a place where jesus was invited and jesus was invited to a feast to be made fun of by by by um simon the pharisee as we all know she wasn't even invited to the feast but something when she heard that testimony something anchored in her heart if he can forgive her and i'm a harlot too i can be forgiven hallelujah and then so she would say here i mean i mean there's brother-in-law testimony upon the sea here he set in here that night that day and this little woman said if that's who i think it is that's that man i believe he's a prophet and he was the one who forgave mary magdalene that woman just as bad as me forgave her sins down the city she went and into an old ally upper creaky steps an old check reached down there pulled out a little money she collected on her ill way of living she pulled this out this money bag she said i can't do it he's a prophet and he'd know how i got this money but it's all i can do that's all i've got i must see him i'm a sinner i must ask him to forgive me hello she went and she got when i got the alabaster box somehow she got past the foot wash flunky past the guards past the waiters and they went right down to where jesus was and she didn't even ask permission but she took the alabaster box she broke it she poured it out i mean they should be gonna weep away amen hallelujah wash washes wash his feet with her tears and dry it with her hair and everything why because she heard a testimony that another prostitute was forgiven and she was the same kind of woman and she knew if i can just get to him i must ask him to forgive me amen harlow what to do it sparked a testimony amen our god is still god our jesus is still jesus amen he has not changed at all he cannot change it's one thing god cannot change he can't lie and he can't change so if so if someone was forgiven that way or healed that way we can be healed the same way hallelujah but we have to be able to look to the unseen brotherhood says look at the unseen when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god and he knows that he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise so we catch a vision of the unseen who's who who's caught a vision of the unseen when you see when brother brown preaches the opening of the word it's more than just symbols you'll look past the symbol and see christ i mean where where he brother even said that the opening the seals reveals christ and you catch a glimpse we're in the second part of redemption we're in the season of the body change hallelujah we've been called to a body change so now what are we doing we're looking to the unseen and what does that do it puts us stability who has a greater stability in their life now i'm not talking about who has less trouble because anyone you know is like why do we love going on holiday because there's no trouble there's no burden of bills no worry about that you just you're on holiday and you're and your world is kind of shrugged down into this little thing that you just enjoy anyone can have a anyone can have a stable life in a holiday so i'm not talking about the removal of trouble but i'm talking about who who's actually more stable now on their walk in their life since they came to the lord why is that because it's because you've caught a vision of the invisible god so now you're not following what the five senses declare or how you feel but now you're following a sure word of promise you're following the lord himself i mean so now we have a stability that stabilizes the man's thinking and it stabilizes our actions hallelujah i'm sure we can all attest to that amen you know brother aaron makes a statement in the great great warrior joshua he says what am i trying to do trying to get you to see where you're at do we know where we're at oh we're in 2021 now i'm not talking about that do you know where you're at in christ we're now seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus our sins are dead in the red sea our task masters have been drowned amen the enemy's defeated the whole land is open before us you know the devil actually quakes has lost you know morale is shot in hell when they came to jericho you know the report that this you know rahab began to testify of the condition of the armies in jericho and she did not say how thick the walls are how sharp their shields are oh shove their shelter how sharp their swords are and how ready they are outwardly they may look very drilled and prepared soldiers but she would actually testify that the hearts of all the men have melted because of you because of you you are the one who's caused the morale to be shot in the city hallelujah it's not anything else it's because of you and i don't know how big those spies were it's irrelevant i mean they could have been the smallest man of the smallest tribe if you're from israel but they were shaking just because of their presence hallelujah do you know the morale and hell is shot do you know you know you know you know he can boast all he wants you know how many times you know how many times he would have hated it where he would come into a meeting he says i'm gonna i'm gonna tear this meeting up i'm gonna get my revenge on this little prophet of god and then and then brother brown would would remind the devil night after night prayer line after prayer line satan you're nothing but a bluff turn these people loose in the name of jesus christ and he had to let them go why because his bluff was called you've got to call the devil's hand i mean you as you say devil you may be pretending you know what pope i trust no one knows what poker face is but you know what poker faces they you can have all these dud cards but a good poker player will never in their expression reveal what's in their hand they'll look the same if they've won or they've lost or and they'll try and bluff the other players to make foolish things you know if you know that's what poker faces i'm glad some people look at me saying i don't know what that means and now i do but the devil has a real mean poker face because he's nothing but a bluff hallelujah he has a losing hand but you've got to call his hand say satan my lord defeated you that down calvary he's you're still defeated today i'm here to call your hand oh the prophet can do that but i can't who said he had to be redeemed like you had to be redeemed he had to be saved the same way you had to be saved he received revelation the same way you receive revelation hallelujah amen so the morale and hell is shot it's gone the devil's nothing but a bluff he knows he has but a short time says my mother just try and wreck the place as much as i can and he wrecks and he wrecks and he wrecks and he wrecks becomes a child of god and the wrecking ball just doesn't swing it may try hallelujah there's something in us that's unmovable it's unshakable sure our emotions get all wild and worried but we have a rock that we can go to i mean there's something in us that we just can't actually you know i was thinking about this imagine if they confiscated all their all of our bibles all our message books we had no way they can't take what's out of our heart i mean they can't take what's in our heart so they could take away our church they i'm not saying they will but they could take away our church they could take away our bibles everything but the bible's in here the word is in here it's not in here it's down in here that's why people can walk with god without a bible or anything but they can still walk victorious so there's something in us that's unshakable hallelujah hallelujah amen so the morale and hell is shot now why was it shot well let's say jericho hell same thing yeah i'll just parallel out that well if that's okay but the morale and jericho were so shot because of them but why what made them special god made them special hallelujah the praise of god was over them as they walked through the wilderness and that same god came with them into the promised land hallelujah and when they're about to face jericho the angel lord came down the captain of the host of the lord with a sword drawn as he and joshua asked him are you for us or against us he says no i'm not for you i'm not against you i've come to take over this battle as the same thing with you and i you know the lord we think things are just happening on earth and and things are idle in heaven no things are happening in heaven you know it says in the book of daniel that michael the great prince will stand up for his people in a time of trouble we're living in a time of trouble but you know the lord has risen in this day i mean to fix us fix things for us to leave yes hallelujah so the morale and jericho was shot because of them because the god they served hallelujah and didn't matter the boasting of the people of jericho that fell down flat hallelujah that same god is with us today very same one not a different one same one hallelujah you ever seen something fall down with the shout out you ever seen some walls fall down with the shout out hallelujah you have a time of prayer you're at camp some obstacle you're facing i can't get over it i can't get through it i can't get under it who's had that is like a blockage and the devil fights you in your mind troubles you and your spirit but then you somehow the lord and the sovereignty just comes down it's nothing you work out he just comes down are you going to shout and praise god what happens the walls fall down flat hallelujah hallelujah hey man hey we had you know i probably shared this testimony too many times but i'll share it one more time you know the first house we lived in here freckleton grove and you know and in low hut there's a demon spirit in that house we felt that i felt a genuine oppression whenever i came into view of that house when i left it went to work it lifted and we started fighting and we never fight there was trouble you know and you know there was there was a real oppression in that house and we came to a spot we realized actually this is the devil in this house and we prayed but there was one time when we prayed it wasn't something that we worked up but the lord just came down and we started shouting and rejoicing and that spirit went out why it went out with a shout out hallelujah hallelujah you know our god still does those kind of things amen he says here what am i trying to do so i'm going back to that verse i mean i mean i mean back to this quote what am i trying to do trying to get to see where you're at if you only get your eyes open and look just look yonder where you're standing why sickness would melt away from you like a snowball on a hot stove in the summertime diseases and so forth because christ promised it it's his promise to me that's an astounding statement we just really see where we're standing now i'm not talking about these four walls our position in christ the great captain of the host of the lord is present i mean with us now look when this angel was whirling above them in a sign of a pillar of fire then it was in the night time in the daytime it looked like a white cloud circling over them that's the children of israel as they journeyed and when they come under this he said now i'm going to send him before you now i give you palestine all of it's yours just go possess it that's all you have to do well here they started god bless them and giving them great big joys and great big revivals and so forth as they went and they come right up there and because they'd seen it was all possessed all over with a great big opposition they were scared god said how long will i suffer with you since moses step out of the way i'll slay every one of them after i perform these now if that ain't a picture of the pentecostal church today said as many miracles as i performed here before them and showed in the face of the unbeliever that i called them and i perform these miracles and yet they don't believe me what a rebuke to the church as many things that i've done i've healed the sick the lame the blind i've raised the dead i perform miracles i've done everything all across the country and yet they don't believe me i give them the holy holy spirit brought them into the covenant what did he what did he do israel sure right through the red sea and the baptism on out give them joy happiness before miracles fed them yet they disbelieved and he said there's just there's something just a little bit beyond oh we're satisfied to belong to church as long as we've got a church as a writer i suppose here come joshua back and caleb said the land is real here's the evidence praise be to god here's the evidence that god promises true we give evidence here to prove it that's why i say in the beginning if you met the lord stand up you've been healed there's evidence that the land is real it's not psychology it's not a nice idea amen but we have a true and living god in our midst here to release to you your desires you have in him hallelujah so ask the question if you say you're not sure yet why not but if you are sure aren't you glad are you glad he's made you sure he's so real he just wants you to be i'm with you doesn't matter what you're facing the the voice the other troubles you may hear in your head i'll see you through i'll conquer every devil in your life hallelujah
