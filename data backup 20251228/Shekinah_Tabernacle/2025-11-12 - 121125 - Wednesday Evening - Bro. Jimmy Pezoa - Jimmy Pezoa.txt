Almighty God, we want to give you thanks for this day, Lord. Thank you for all your blessings, Father. Thank you for this beautiful day. We want to ask you, Lord, to be in this meeting, Father. We want to give you thanks for everything what you have done in our lives Lord for changing us Lord. Giving [music] us your spirit so we can live. Want to ask you to be with me tonight Lord. Help me. Let me be a [music] blessing for you people. I ask you this Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Thank you Mrs. Jones. Amen. How are you? God, God bless you, saints. Can we all sit together? We are like quite spread apart, but we are not that many tonight. So, can we sit just in the front row so I can look everyone? Hey, sorry for taking those attributions. [clears throat] So, um, the thought that the Lord gave me, he gave me the thought, I'll say probably like a month ago. So, I put my I have like a picture of me and Stephanie in my Bible and I put [clears throat] it in the book. So, at camp, I open my my Bible and I saw my face and the name of the book. The name of the book is Jonah. So I said Jonah and I saw my face. I was like please Lord I don't want to be Jonah. Not not this Jonah. This Jonah is a example for the youth. I mean the Jonah from the Bible. So let's read first um just the book of Jonah says now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amiti saying arise go to Nineve the great city and cry against it for the wickedness is come up before me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarses from the presence of the Lord and went down to Hopa or Chopa. I don't know how you pronounce that thing. Chopa and he found a ship going to Tashes. So he paid the fear thereof and went down into it to go with them unto Tashes from the presence of the Lord. You can have your seats tonight. So we have this prophet. Jonah was a prophet of God. But he was disobedient. The Lord told him to do something, but he didn't want to go to to Nineveh because they were enemies. Nineve was a capital of the Assyrian Empire. So they've always been in conflict. So what I think that's very like caught my attention was that Jonah he preferred to stop his fellowship with God then to go and talk to these people that were the enemies. We have the picture here. That's Joer Nineve where he was supposed to go, but he decided to go to Tarses, which is Spain, but the Lord didn't want him to go there. Amen. So, if I can put a title for today, I will put like, do you want to buy a ticket to Tarses? I love you all the youth here. I love you everyone here. You are my family. But I think I I really want to talk about this. This is a big part of my testimony. So we have here Jonah. The Jonah he was disobedient. He didn't want to go. He didn't want he preferred just to stop the fellowship with God. He he said I'm not going there. I this is it. So there's a couple of um verses here about um obedience. Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me, he will keep my words and my father will love him and we and we will come unto him and may go aboud with him. That's when you are obedient to the word, not just listening. When you're obedient. And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe, and to do all his commandments, which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth. That's only going to happen if you're obedient to him. My son, keep thy father's commandments and forsake not the law of thy mother. So you kids, are you obedient to your parents, right? When they tell you to unload the dishwasher or load the dishwasher to unfold the clothes, you fold the clothes, put it in the washing basket. Do you do those things, right? I expected so many events in that part. If we carry on with the story of Jonah says, "But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the those are we that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it off them but Jonah was gone down into the side of the ship and he lay and was fast slip. What an attitude e what a wrong attitude. We will see here like how Jonah's decision was involving a lot of people. All those Mariners sailors, it's easy for me to say, they they didn't have to do anything with it. They were just in the ship. But because of Jonah's um choice, they were all in that big tempest. So, be careful with your actions because they can involve a lot of people. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So the ship master came to him and said unto him, "What man is thou, oh sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God. If so be that God will think upon us that we perish not." That that verse is just amazing because we have this all these men that were crying out for their God. So they didn't believe in the God of Jonah, but they they were trying to they were helping Jonah to get back to God to put back that relationship that he didn't want to. But Jonah, he didn't want that. And they said everyone to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the Lord fell upon Jonah. Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us? What is thine occupation? And when comest thou? What is thy country? And of what people are thou? And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. He didn't answer like with a really nice answer. He just said, "I'm a Hebrew and I'm a and this is my God." But he didn't fear the Lord. Otherwise, he would have act on God's word. He wouldn't like go to Nineveh. He didn't want to. He didn't fear the Lord. He was disobedient. Then were the man accidentally afraid and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the man knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them. So now when these guys they hear that he was a servant of the living God, they were all afraid because I can imagine like back in the days when someone said like, "Oh, I'm a Hebrew." They all knew the Lord of the Hebrews. They all knew the God of the Hebrews, the one that split the sea. The mighty God. And now they were in a big in a big big storm. I I'm lost here. Where was where was I reading? Then said they unto him, "What shall we do unto thee that the sea may come unto us? For the sea ro and was temp tempestuous. He said unto them, "Take me up and cast me forth into the sea. So shall the sea become unto you. For I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you." He could have prayed. He could have turned his heart to the Lord. But he would rather to die than to go and preach in Nineveh. He didn't want to go, man. That's like he didn't want to go. He just he didn't want to follow what God was telling him to do. Nevertheless, the man rode hard to bring him to bring it to the land, but they could not, for the sea wroth, and was temptation against them. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee. Let us not perish for this man's life and lay not upon us innocent blood. For thou our Lord has done as it pleasantly. And so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her um raging. So we have all these guys that they were involved in a situation that they didn't even deserve it just because one person was being disobedient. What I wanted to say here it's like we have to make a sure that we are doing what the Lord want us to do otherwise our whole family can be involved in a really bad situation just because of us. Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offer a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows. Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. Now Jonah was in a very dark place. Jonah was in a place and some people they draw pictures and put like Jonah was like this really big fish and they he had all this room to even to light a fire and just to sit down. I think that Jonah was just very tied into this big fish. And I know that some people, scientists, they say that that's impossible. There's no fish that they can swallow a man and a man can survive three days. And this is when the message is just so cool. Sorry if I expressed that word, but it is written there that the Lord prepare a fish to swallow Jonah. That fish was prepared for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I asked the AI to create a picture of Jonah and the whale. So that look very cool. [clears throat] Didn't mess around. So, I can say like in my own my I'm going to give a testimony at the end, but I've been in that place. I grew up in a church. So, I know what it feels like to grow up being young and praise the Lord and lift up your hands and cry and be in a meeting. But I also went into my teenager days and that's what everything fall apart for me. I've been inside of the fish, I've also been out of the fish. This is um Jonah when he's praying inside of the fish belly. He says, "The waters compass me about even to the soul. The deep closed me round about the wheat with wrap about my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with her b was above from was above me forever. Yet hast thou brought me up to life from corruption. Oh Lord my God. When my soul fainted within me, I remember the Lord and my prayer came into came in unto thee into thy holy temple. They that observe laying vanities forsake their own mercy. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thankgiving. I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord. And the Lord spoke unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. So after being in that really dark place, the Lord ordained the fish to release him. So he was finally in Nineveh. Now, that's a name. That guy is Deon. That's the Lord. That's the god of the Assyrians, the people from Nineveh. Have fish, half human. Now look, the man the Lord creates this big fish to swallow Jonah. And now he go to the coast and Jonah is released. So imagine the people that was at the cost that they saw this big fish throwing up a prophet for them. Of course they all understood the message, right? But now we can see what happened to this guy too. 1 Samuel verse 5 says, "And the this is in the future. Okay. And the Philistians took the ark of God and brought it to Abenezer unto Ashtod. When the Philistians took the ark of God, they brought it unto the house of Dean and set it by Dean. And when they Ashod arose early on the moral, behold, Dean was fallen up his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Deon and set him in his place again. And when they arose early on the morning in the moral morning, behold, Deon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. And the head of Dean, and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold, only the stump of Dean was left him. That's what happened to that God in the future. He will just destroy. Everything has to bow to God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's go now. Let's go back to um to the people in Nineveh. After Jonath preached, the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaim a fast and put up the sacklo from the greatest of them even to the least of them. Who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not? And God saw their works that they turn from their evil way. And God repented of the evil and that he had said to the wool do upon them he did not he did it not. They repent and the Lord forgive them. Now do you think that Jonah was happy or was he angry after the people of God heard his message? That's going to be your homework. I'm going to leave it there. Now, this is what I I want to actually preach. [clears throat] So, when you are young, you can have friends that doesn't really matter if they're not Christian cuz you're just kids. You just want to play with the ball. You just want to run and I don't know hide and seek. You can all be friends. You mo most of the time the parents are supervising what the kids are doing. So there's not much as a problem if the kids have friends like that. The problem start when in the teenager years when everyone wants to be someone and you want to be someone and you want to impress people and when you want to impress the wrong kind of friends that you have that's the age that everything just start to change in your body. Some of you, you grow up. I I didn't. But some of you start to grow up and have another desires and stuff. That's when boys start to like girls and girls start to like boys and you know all this stuff. And if you have friends like that, even if you go to school, they can ask you like, "What do you do on the weekend?" Oh, but I went to church. Oh, no. We went to this party. This person got drunk and this other guy got punched. This is so much fun going to the parties. Now, if you if you're not planted, that's going to start pulling you. That's going to start pulling you. And I'm going to say this a couple of times. It's like, do you want to buy a ticket to Tash? Do you want to live the fellowship that you have with God so you can go and have friends? So you can have so you can go and impress your friends. Is that what you really want to do? I hope you are not. But I felt moved to to say the things. Now the world they offer you lights and fireworks and everything. big parties. So much fun. They're just nonsense. What happened the day after? &gt;&gt; But they don't tell you that. Then you can see all the edge of beers and drinks and stuff and they saw all these people just having fun. And have you actually seen how someone that's drunk looks like? There's nothing there. That's just an illusion. &gt;&gt; I have a quote here was listening this message says, "And do you know my little sister that potentially an adultery when a man kisses you, he has potentially committed adultery with you, you should never let him kiss you until you are married. For the glands, both male and female glands is in the lips." Do you understand? when the male and female glands come together. Um, let it be where they may be have potentially committed adultery. And you shouldn't let that boy kisses you until that veil is raised on your face and you are his wife. Don't do that. It committing adultery. It's mixing male and female glands. Some of you, you you are in an age that I know that it's it's hard. You start liking people. There nothing wrong with that. But if you act like that, that's what your prophet is saying. That's what the Lord put in his mouth to say. So be careful because that's going to bring consequences. That's what happened to me. I was in the world. I had girlfriends. So, my first kiss was not with my lovely wife. That's such a big bond that you can have with someone. And I didn't have it cuz I was just being silly in that illusion. Now some of it's just hard for me just to preach this way. I'm so sorry but how a very wise man said I'm just delivering the message. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whoever a man seweth that shall he also reap. You can come to church, but you can, this is for the ladies. You You can wear your pants when you're at the library. You can do all your things hiding from your parents, hiding from people from church. But God can see everything. So why are you hiding? God can see everything what you doing. When your door is closed, when no one is looking at you, he can see everything. You cannot mock him. Now, there's a study that says, but research suggests a significant number of adolescents stop being Christian with studies showing 66 to 75 or young people leave the church after high school. This phenomenon phen I don't know how to say the word often called the youth exodus is most pronounced when young people transition to college. So this this study they're saying there's a lot of young people that they just stop being Christians when they're like in the in those teenager years because it's hard. But I'm here to tell you this is not worth it at all. You are like family to me. You I you have no idea how much you encourage me, especially the little ones, man. Every time that I see you here in church, &gt;&gt; man, please just don't buy that ticket to churches. And now I was going down the streets one time in Los Angeles, California, and I seen a very odd person acting odd. And he was walking down the street, not picking, but he was just merely like taking an afternoon stroll. And I went to the other side of the street to see what he was doing. Everybody was turning around laughing at him. Because of his particularity, I noticed he had a sign hanging on the front of him. And I thought I'll I'll see what everybody is laughing about this odd particular man. And so he was I noticed him as the people look at him they laugh at him and but he seems to have a different kind of a smile a smile of contentment. The other smile that the people were giving him was more like ridicul ridic [laughter] ridiculing him. But he seems to be satisfied in what he was doing. Well, there's a whole of a lot to think about. When a man is satisfied in what he's doing, he's right. Though he be an oddball, oddball just means like a weird person to somebody else. If he's satisfied, that's what he's doing. He's right. Then let him stay with it. And as I come close to to the little man, I notice on across his chairs here on a plague on a board was wrote, "I am a fool." At the bottom he had for Christ. I am a fool in great letters down at the bottom said, "For Christ." And everybody was laughing at her at this. And as the little man praised on down through the crowd of of years and carrying on, I turned to look what what was on his back. And there was a great big question mark on his back. And down at the bottom said, now whose fool are you? Lord, he had something there. You see, but it seemed to be satisfied that he could be a fool for Christ. That's what Paul said that he had become a fool. A fool for Christ. Now don't expect that you can be a Christian person and be also very popular because the world the world don't want Christ. That's not what if you in the balance. If you put that in the balance and if you're a Christian that's not you are weird if you're Christian you because you don't drink because you don't use drugs because you don't go to parties because you don't have a girlfriend until you are married. You're weird. Who's this guy? He might be gay. He's not doing the things that we all are doing that we are so proud of us. Be a fool for Christ. Now I want to just share this because it might be good for someone. Now you know that I grew up and there's a Pentecostal church. My parents used to take me four times per week. We used to go Thursday, Tuesday, Saturday, and the whole Sunday. That was church for me. And I remember being a little kid saying to my mom, "Can't we not be normal?" I used to play with my friends Saturday night, like evening, and now it's like around 6 6 7 6 7:00 and we had to go to church. But I was playing with my friends and my mom was like, "Come on, Jimmy. Time to go to church." Man, I didn't want to go to church. If you want me to be honest, I didn't want to go to church. I I wanted to be normal. I remember there was a TV show like wrestlings and stuff was all where Saturday at 7:00. I have no idea how many times I pretend to be sick just to be just to be able to see these guys and speeders fighting. How dumb, man. But also remember going to church when I was a little bit younger than that and there was this brother from church. His name was Francisco and he man he he was such a big influence for me. I remember I used to sit by him. I used to sit by the wall so the other kids that were not going to be able to see me and he used to tell me you just praise the Lord lift up your hand I'm always being emotional you you know me lift up my hands and cry and but one time he just left church I don't actually know what happened to him but that big influence good influence was taken away from me and I was just left alone there. Now, I didn't want to be the weird guy that just always crying when there's some songs being singing. I didn't want to be that guy. I'm just being honest. So, I just stopped. And from that time on, my life was just down and down and down and down. By the time that I was a teenager, you know, started going out with girls and stuff, I didn't do drugs until I was like 19 or something. But there was this separation of me and God. I always thought that I was just I've gone way too far. There's no God. He can't take me back. I'm I'm I've committed sin. I'm done. I ended up going to the uni and then when the things they really went wrong for me start doing drugs. I was alone living in another city. So my parents they were not there. Everything everything where you can imagine imagine I did it was just just destruction was just horrible. I remember one time I was in in the house of a friend and um her mom was kind of like kind of like a witch. She had this weird kind of gift that she was able to kind of like a fortunate teller or something. But she had a gift. Now there's gift among people. That's that's what brother Brennan says. She was looking at all of us. We were all drunk and high and stuff. And she looked at me. She she talked to everyone, told them everyone's life. Everyone was just shocked. She comes to me and she says, "Do you believe in God?" And I said, "Yes." And she said to me, "You are running away from him. And one day you are your life, everything where you have been doing here is going to be your testimony. and you're going to be preaching. But she didn't say it in a nice way. She wanted to make fun of me. From that that time on for all my friends, I was the pastor, but they used to make fun of me. Pastor Jimmy, where's Pastor Jimmy? He's just drunk over there. Where Pastor Jimmy? He's just sleeping. I don't know. Over there. Where's Pastor Jimmy? Smoking weed there in the corner. They used to make fun of me when she told me that me and a friend we we went to buy more drinks and I was shaking, man. I was so shocked cuz I knew that that was true. I knew that the Lord wanted me back. But same as Jonah, I was like, "No, man. I've gone too far. There's no way that he can take me back. After a couple of a couple of months later, everything just went really really wrong. Like the uni studies, my life, my friends, everything. I I thought to put end to my life because I was just this is it just going to disappear. But I in one moment I text my brother. I text Pedro. I said to him, "Pedrick, can you help me? I need to start again." He said to me, "Are you sure that you can stop drinking and being silly and stuff?" Cuz he was a Christian home. He was a Christian here in New Zealand. I was just doing so bad. So, he was kind of scared that I was going to come here and probably ended up in jail, you know. But the Lord moved him and he sent me the ticket and with the ticket probably I share this thing a couple of times but man just beautiful with the ticket there was a booklet wasn't that one was God hiding in simplicity when I saw that the booklet man I took it I said This is for me, but he send it for my mom. That booklet was not for me. But when I saw it, I was like, man, this is for me. From that moment, just changed my life. [clears throat] remember being on the plane and cry for like 13 hours, a whole flight. I was just Lord, you have you are giving me a new chance. I can start all over again. So if someone tells me that this is a lie, I can tell you with my life, my testimony, this is true. &gt;&gt; The message works. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus works and he's still working today. And if if you're watching meeting just to find mistakes, the biggest mistake is your attitude because you are trying to find mistakes. But these works &gt;&gt; have worked in my life. God sent a prophet. You like it or not? Now Psalms 139 says, "Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and know me. Thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising. Thou understand my thought a far off. Thou comp compasses my path and my laying down and art acquainted with all my ways. And there is not a word in my tongue, but oh Lord, thou knowest that knowest it all together. For thou thou hast beset me behind me, and before me, and laid thine hand upon me. [snorts] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whether shall I go from thy spirit, or whether shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascended up into heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thou right hand shall hold me. There's no place that you can escape from the presence of the Lord. I have this question for you. Are you thinking to get a ticket to Taj or do you already have that ticket? You can be sitting here but your soul, your mind can be so far away from God. Do you want to change? Do you want to I forgot the word trade the fellowship that you have with God for a bunch of friends? I used to have friends back back in Chile. How many of them with how many of them I am still in contact? You can ask me that. None. None. So all of that experience being in the world, being with my friends, my homies, being with those guys was for nothing. They don't even know me. They don't know me now. They don't want to know about me. The Lord changed my life. Deliver me. So all the time that I tend to impress people was for no reason. Now if you can get something from my life, just please don't go to the world cuz there's nothing there for you. There's things that you can do there and you are going to regret it for the rest of your life. And because of if you want to go to the world, God can start dealing with you. And by dealing with you, it can affect your whole family because he's trying to call your attention. Something I I don't know. Something can go wrong. Your mom can get sick. Something that's God just telling you something like, "Pay attention. What are you doing? Let's just have the musicians. [applause] So I wanted to pray for for the young ones. So if the young ones can come here and pretty much everyone just come here. Let's just pray one for another. The world is just a evil place and just has an very strong power pulling people. But greater is the one that is in us than the one that is in the world. Just did you sing any song? Father [music] Hallelujah. God changing. Oh, [music] build your things eternal.
