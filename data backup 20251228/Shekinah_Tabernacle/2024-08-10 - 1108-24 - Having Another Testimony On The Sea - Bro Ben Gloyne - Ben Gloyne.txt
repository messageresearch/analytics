[Music] m [Music] good morning how are you today good that's good I'm very good when we serve the Lord we're always good always good amen it's good to be here let's um let's just stand this morning we are we're going to have a wonderful time of um praise and worship and um receiving of the word of God into our hearts this morning and we're going to leave here changed and renewed and refreshed because we we serve a vibrant Living God that whose intentions for us are very good isn't it nice to know that you know when you can have when you have confidence in somebody when you know that their intention for you was good then you can just relax a bit more because you know that the their their intention for yours God I believe that should be our atmosphere amongst us because we should understand that every person in here your intention towards me is good that's why I never really get hitched up of why you can never do any harm to me cuz I never perceive it the wrong way because I always know I've just I've just perceived it the wrong way because your intention for me is good so I've taken things the wrong way isn't that right hey and and more so with the Lord his intention for us is always good Satan's a sneaky rat you know he you know the sneaky salesman where they always trying to trick you I can't stand those people this whole $4.99 thing you know it's out in the open they're trying to trick us you're trying to trick me almost not going to buy it because you're trying to trick me that it's $4 when it's $5 come on man you know it's deceiving and they knowing they they we it's it's knowingly deceitful it's a ploy it's a tactic God doesn't use any of those tactics I'm so glad and he's honest you I'm so glad for truth and I'm so glad for a word in this day that gave us truth you know I was thinking that last night that that brother brandom said look I've got to be honest with you I'm going to tell you the truth you do what you want with it but I'm going to be honest with you he didn't bother telling us something else if the lord gave him something that was the truth he said I'm going to deliver the truth and and what we need is the truth because in this day and age there's so many lies and deceit and the media and all this nonsense it's it's all deceitful and you don't know what to believe anymore you know even what you see you can't believe anymore like the the the video the AI technology videos that are made are just even so-called news articles are not true anymore they it's a fake and it looks absolutely realistic it's hard to know what to believe anymore but I'm so glad that we can we have a truth that amongst all this mess we have a truth of the word of God that we can believe and and be sure this is the truth and the direction I'm going is the truth so that's the god that we come to this morning and to worship the God of all truth amen so let's just pray Lord we thank you Lord that we can come to Lord the Living God this morning Lord and worship you in spirit and in truth this morning Lord and that's what we want Lord we we want to feel the goodness of your spirit Lord but we also want a truth of your word to Anchor

so this song Here is um called from perfect Faith to perfect love it's about the Book of Ruth and uh brother been mentioned last Sunday something about that and it just I don't know I just love The Book of Ruth it shows who we are and all the promises in his word are ours because of what God has done for us his great Redemption plan and it's just reading this morning where the Prophet talks about that that lady she's about 80 years old and um she was poor and she had nothing and she sold her furniture just to get some food and then someone asked her haven't you got any children she says yeah I got a son he's working over in India he's a businessman he says well how come he doesn't support you and she says well he is he's sending me these nice letters and these lovely pictures and the guy says can I have a look at the pictures so she had them all stacked in her Bible and it was money orders from India she had no idea what they were the prophet says it was $10,000 worth of of money and she just didn't realize so it's the same for us all the promises and the word are there we just have to recognize them and then we can use them [Music] into your presence Lord time after time I've come and through your word that I've heard came and transformed me and Lord my desires have turned Heavenly I'm longing to be like you in your very image and un likeness Lord I want to stand from perfect Faith to perfect love Lord my soul is coming up for this sister day and the hour of my translation you said fear not to me all I require that you will do unto me oh Lord I believe I'm coming to Perfection who am I dear Lord that thou take knowledge of me this Moab St has surely found favor with thee Lord you look beyond my Falls and you saw that I was in need the price of redemption you willingly paid to redeem me from perfect Faith to perfect love Lord my soul is coming up for this is the day and the hour of my translation you said fear not to me all I require that you will do unto me oh Lord I believe I'm coming to perfection oh cover me dear Lord with thy great love thou art my kinsman redeemer you are The Great I Am amen Lord sorry I am a virtuous woman your bride at your side I've come into Union with you Lord and I found full Redemption perfect Fai to perfect love Lord my soul is coming up for this is the day and the hour of my translation you that fear not to me all I require that you will do unto me oh Lord I believe I'm coming to Perfection you said fear not to me all I require that you will do unto me oh Lord I believe I'm coming to [Music] [Applause] Perfection amen praise the Lord thank you sister Belinda I like the music that comes out of you amen okay so we just going to um do so so this one uh this this song it seems to be that um for the camp we have put the pressure on us to write and perform an original song each Camp yep come up here little Tabo um I want to share something just before we do this song because we're we're going to teach you this we'll play the song as an item and then we'll sing all together after that as like a congregational song and then we call up brother Ben after that um this may be uh a little bit different but um the the song came in a unusual sort of way and that it came reasonably easy for me to sort of pin it together could I have brother um Kubin can you go stand next to uh Vanessa for a second and stand up as well Vanessa so put you on this is I'm just going to put you on the spot for a bit usually songs most of the time I not all the time but most of the time you go through something and then you pin an experience that you've been through that's how that's how I've always done songwriting you way you sort of pin something that you've you go through some trial or some up or down and you sort of capture it in a in a tune and bring it out but the other week I think Ben was preaching something and I was just sitting on the chair over here and and this bit of inspiration came and it was like I don't want to pin something for myself but I want to pin something for somebody else I just want to have get something for somebody else somehow I don't know I just wanted to capture something in some way and I was sitting like this I guess like that and I looked over this way and that's where the the moodley sit over there and it kind of something just went and a little spark went off and and and then I then the song sort of came reasonably easier than what most songs do it sort of just every time I picked up the guitar it would just a more would come and then I'd sit in church another bit would come and it was it wasn't there wasn't any effort so I feel like it was I'm not going to say it is but I kind of feel maybe if something was inspired I don't know what inspiration is but that maybe that was it the reason why I've got them to stand up was because I I don't I I feel like it was maybe given to them to them maybe share with us if I could put it that way so is it was a we bit too Supernatural for my general undertaking of how I do things you know I usually fumble around so so I kind of yeah maybe I'm going under limb but I just feel like there was something Supernatural happened and this is this is your song it was it was I feel like it was sort of given to you now we all will partake of it because we like music's like they put it in the public domain we all we all we we all take our little bit of it you know but there's an inspiration behind something and I feel like it was sort of I just managed to capture it and I here is here and pass it over that's kind of was what I so this will always be so take this I think as from the Lord for you and and uh and and and take the words yourself there for you to speak out okay so so this is this is what I wanted to say before we do the song okay so yeah thank you uh let's um where's can you come up here okay so we just sing this through once and then we will get you to stand we'll do it after that

amen our God is more than enough amen hallelujah amen let's read from John 6 and we're going to read from 16 down to verse 21 hallelujah amen praise God I'm glad this message works amen this message works it's just as powerful as today when it was first spoken amen let's read from John 6:16 and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over toward uh toward uh over the seaside towards capernium and it was now dark and Jesus was not come to them and the Sea arose by the reason of a great wind that blew so when they had rode about 5 and 20 or 30 furlongs they saw Jesus walking on the and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid but he saith unto them it is I Be not Afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land where they went hallelujah amen let's let's pray together this morning thank you Lord amen let's pray you know the spirit of the Lord comes when We Gather when we read his word because he wants our desires to be manifested in our lives he comes to release brother B says release our desires to us amen if those desires are according to the word of God Amen how could he say no amen God will answer in this season amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you dear God for the Revelation the song that we just sung dear God thank you Father it's more

where we stand Lord undefiled sinless perfect under your blood father and we know that the word of the Lord is in our hands father the sword your sword is in our hands father so now dear God as we approach your great word this morning as we have read your word we're asking you the great author of the word would come manifest your word in our midst may you meet every need father touch every soul lord may you take the service Under Your Divine control For Your Glory father we commit Our Lives into your hands the service just all that we are Lord be merciful to us we pray how we need you every hour Lord and father we also especially want to remember those who are not here today who are sick and body maybe traveling we don't know be their abundant portion father Grant it Lord For Your Glory may you receive all honor glory and praise Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so um I don't know if I have much today but we'll just start and stop and you know but we I want to speak about having another testimony on the sea yeah brother bar preached a sermon called the testimony on the sea he preached a few others saying it is I be not afraid but he says in one place we need another testimony on the sea I think it's very important that we can can step back into the scripture and we can because you know the the uh the Journey of the Apostles the Journey of the Believers is our journey amen it was it was it was uh revealing our journey with the Lord and now you know must have been quite a must have been quite a uh a day you know we're just going to step back into that boat cuz it's your boat that's right it's your boat we're going to step into that boat it must have been quiet a day you know they the sun had begin to set and you know the uh incredible things that happened is you know they were they were no doubt they turning the boat round they getting get ready to travel and you know Jesus actually con strain them go across the other side I need to go up to the mountain to pray so we got to remember in this journey God sent us right and God is sending us to a destination that we're going to get to and remember this boat that we're in is not traveling to the other side of the Sea of Galilee this ship is going to glory amen right so so so where this this boat you're in I trust you're in it today is is actually going to transcend Dimensions going to go from this world to the next World now must have been incredible as I saying an incredible day you know they had seen the master their lord Jesus our lord Jesus do incredible things he would he would uh he would take a boy's lunch it says that he took a lad's lunch of Loaves and Fishes maybe that boy skipped school that day I don't know maybe he was walking down to school and he's dragging his feet saying man I don't want to go and some of us can relate to that and you know how they don't want to go to school and then and then then maybe heard the noise of a crowd coming from the other side of the hill and you know of course you know things spark our interest so he started following the the people and you know he you know he found himself in a multitude of people and there was a man like he'd never seen before I mean standing there and preaching words he'd never heard before and you know then there was a discussion came up after many sick were healed and God done many things that you know there's now a discussion between the Lord and his disciples we need to feed these people and you know the Disciples of course always looking at Natural Things are saying we don't you know how much money we don't have the money to do it how's it's ever going to be done and but then but then this lad was kind of drawn into the drawn into the um discussion yeah and he just raised up and said I've got my lunch I got my school lunch you know and it's amazing what you can give God what you give God God just multiplies God takes it far greater than you can ever fathom cuz he thought man I could maybe share this with Johnny and Jimmy and whoever there at school but you know he didn't realize God would take that lunch that he placed in the hands of the master and and and the Lord would take the bread and he he he'd break it off and bless it and then the peace would just just appear again he'd break it off break it off and break it off and break it off and he' take the fish and bless it and break it off and it was cooked fish and the Creator himself was creating bread and and and and fish for thousands of people amen so those things were incredible things they' never seen those kind of things been done before and as they would you know they would they would climb into the um you know the fishing boat of course some of the some of the disciples were fishermen they had they had been raised on the sea so they knew how boats worked and they knew how to step and just right not to capsize the thing but others like Matthew and different ones they were like a fish out of water in that boat so maybe they needed help steadying to get into the boat and you know but finally they all sit down and they begin to maybe get the OES out and you know there's nothing quite like you know I've not done much wrong in my life but it's satisfying when it works who's ever rode a boat before right and you get the timing right and it's just and you're going in a straight line and you know it just seems like a nice thing to finally you know get under control and get going and then they get out a certain distance maybe maybe the um you know maybe when you know just by the shoreline there was no wind and you know and then and and then finally they get into the breeze maybe they put the sail up and you know then they start going along and then maybe you know but of course their minds are not on the boat their minds are not on even where they're going their minds are on what they've just experienced behind them and they would have all sat down and they would have begin to speak about testify about what the Lord had just done what they had seen in their day yeah and you know maybe maybe John you know he was the youngest one among them maybe he was just cuz he couldn't help it maybe he just began to speak and he began to testify cuz they were all bubbling over they didn't get in that boat sad they didn't get in that boat disappointed they didn't get in that boat empty they didn't get into that boat unfulfilled no they saw more than they could ever imagine right in front of them they saw you think about maybe John would say Brothers just think about this for a second Brothers God has done nothing for 400 years from the prophet Mal up to John there was 400 years of Silence Brethren all our all our fathers and our grandfathers and our great grandfathers had was a god of history and sure we believed them we believed our priests we believe that all that Moses did and everything and you know but but but but think about it Brothers just think about it I pray the grippers tonight today just think about it just think about it 400 years there hasn't been a scripture fulfilled there hasn't been a move of God anywhere but suddenly aren't we the most privileged people in all the world I mean we're not living in a time of Silence but it's like the B we're living in Bible days again I me it's like the scriptures just come alive and there's been such a rapid fulfillment of Prophecy in our lives and it's not somewhere across the other side of the world somewhere we're living in it hallelujah amen so no doubt he said just think of it Brethren the god that our parents talked about that taught us about the God of Moses that that that met Moses in the burning bush the god that met Joshua the god remember they're all from the Holy Land they've seen these places they didn't just hear about them they lived in those places they could have they probably would have had uh maybe tourist uh ventures of going through the historic journey of Joshua or I don't know um um Elijah or Moses whatever they could have gone and walked his path but just walking a historical path is not enough I mean that didn't satisfy their Burning uh Jewish Hearts amen they needed something real and they had something real amen amen so John maybe said just think about it Brethren the same God that met Moses in the burning bush the same God that met Joshua the same God that Abraham knew the same God that King David sung about because he knew him is no longer a historical figure to us he's no longer a person to debate about he's no longer a person to argue about did he do this didn't he do this did he do this where did he do this no he is alive amen we're walking with him he called us he's talking to us amen isn't that an incredible thing Amen to see all of the promises the Prophecies of the Messiah amen are not just close at hand we're living in them hallelujah amen then may maybe Andrew begin to speak because you know when you begin to speak about these things we always go back where he found us amen maybe Andrew begin to speak after John saying you know I was with John the Baptist you know I heard of the story of this wild man that just came out of the Wilderness eating Locust and honey and different things in a camel skin never had a bath maybe in his life and you know he began to preach the kingdom of God is at hand and to repent and you know something just drew me to his ministry and when I began to hear him it wasn't just cuz he looked different he spoke different I mean he acted different to the clergy he acted different to the to the synagogue and the priest and you know there's just something in his in his voice that gripped me yeah Hallelujah and sure the critics came along too the scribes and Pharisees and he just called them Snakes in the Grass and Generation of Vipers and there's a bit of tension going on but something in me said what he was saying was true sure it's contrary to popular opinion what everyone else says but something in me said this is Isaiah 40:3 in fulfillment this is the voice of one crying in the wilderness this is the Bible amen living again and you think about it I was kind of skep skeptical at first because my parents said don't just jump at anything you careful what you accept but it was more than an argument that I heard when I I when I saw John preaching that day it was God it was God fulfilling his word through the prophet and then there was the moment where he pointed to a man that looked like any other man among us I mean he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I mean the it was an incredible moment to be standing there and say and John was preaching for six months but then finally he wasn't just preaching about the lamb coming he says now he's here now he's here upon the earth now he's here to fulfill his promises amen and then he baptized he baptized him a amen and then and then the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove amen all those things happened it was an incredible meeting and then I began to follow this Lord Jesus hallelujah amen amen it was totally different to what we ever experienced am me then Andrew would have said you know because it's gripped me so much I had to go tell someone so I had my buddy Simon who we know is Peter you know and you know he went to go see him and you know they couldn't expl explained uh you know even even Peter was skeptical but then he began to follow the lord Jesus and then what really then then Peter no doubt would have maybe raised up or maybe just sat there because if you're a Boatman you know how to handle yourself in a boat and he said you know Brethren it was about this spot back over there you know that favorite fishing spot that I have and we always go there normally we catch fish you remember Brothers we were there all night we tried all the tricks of the trade we tried everything we could and there was not a single fish anywhere but then we heard a familiar Voice Hallelujah he said if he CAU anything and you know I was just feeling grumpy cuz you know me I'm Peter I get a bit grumpy sometimes and you know I said we haven't caught anything he says cast your net on the other side and I begin to think at first this man's not a fisherman but something of his voice carried such an authority am mean that when I threw the n on the other side and the other brothers who were there James and John said yeah we were there there was no fish around it's like when we threw the net in as soon as the net got in it's like fish were literally created in the net amen and you know they had never they had never had this kind of a kind of an experience before but Jesus looked at us and they said and and and he said I'll make you fishes of men you think this is a great thing I'm going to take you higher than even what you think about this amen you know Matthew maybe he would rock the boat cuz he's a tax collector he doesn't know how to handle boats for while he knows how to tax them he doesn't know how to sit in them amen so Matthew maybe rocks the boat because you know testimonies are infectious right it creates an atmosphere of Faith you know it creates a reality of God where what God has done becomes alive again to us so these things are important am me so Matthew maybe You' Rock the Boat he'd stand up and get enthused and maybe someone would try hey Sit down you're going to capsize the boat but he didn't care he was just enthused about it and you know he said you know I was just doing my day job you know I was just collecting taxes no one liked me fair enough amen you know no one like me many people have spoken to me before but their their voice always carried a tone of hatred or disdain at the very least but then when I heard this man speak my name amen it had a different ring to it you know what this is like right I mean I'm talking about the disciples but I trust you've had these same kind of experiences when the when the voice behind the voice of the message speaks to your life amen it carries a different ring it carries a different tone than any other voice you'd ever hear in your entire life am mean because we are not caught up with the prophet we caught up with the message that the prophet brought cuz we know the message is Jesus Christ revealed amen so that's why I say when you hear that voice behind the voice amen and he speaks to you as the same as um as as when Matthew was spoken to and Jesus called him by name and that voice was very different to him Philip would have piped up at the stage saying you know he he came looking for me the scripture says he came looking for Phillip he came looking for me I wasn't looking for him but he was looking for me and and he just said come and follow me and something in me just said I'm going to follow him he said he found me to call me amen and he didn't just call me but he called me to follow him and immediately after that I went to find my friend Nathaniel you know God's been searching for you God's been searching for you you may have been raised up in a message Church God's still searching for you if he hasn't found you yet he's here to find you I mean he's here to get your attention get your life transform you change you by the power of his blood amen so so Philip said yes as soon as as soon as the master called me I went to find my friend Nathaniel Nathaniel would have then piped up and said I was even more skeptical I you know because because Philip acted different this time yeah we had had Bible discussions before but this was a different he was he was bouncing on his toes he was like almost agitated with me come and see a man come and see him come and see him he didn't sit down like he normally did and open the scroll they said come on we're going for a walk and I got a bit annoyed at him actually cuz he's trying to push me out the door and he's all excited and you know then I then I begin to question Philip about uh you know this man and Nathaniel would have said I got even more skeptical when when Philip said he came out of Nazareth because he said can anything come out of Nazareth good you know cuz it was such a low down place but then when I came into the presence of this man he was more than a man he looked at me and said behold an Israelite without guile and then and then Nathaniel you know this this really took me back a bit and I thought how do you know me L Rabbi he says before Philip called thee when you were under the Fig Tree I saw you hallelujah amen this changed his life now what about you and I I was sitting under a tree once it wasn't a fig tree amen it was a tree of darkness and death amen but Jesus came and called me and called me out of that hallelujah thank you Lord amen now wouldn't you like to sit with them there this morning because we're in the same boat I mean you hear all their testimonies and it moves you it blesses you but then there's something that you've just got to rise up and you've got to you've got to add your add your bit cuz you know because when Nathaniel said that he came and spoke to him and found him you know I just couldn't hold my peace any longer I'm just I'm putting myself in the boat you join me the water's at the boat's good okay this Journey's worth it amen and you know I'd raise up and I'd say you know I wasn't sitting a fig tree I sitting in great Darkness just floating along with life am mean drunken partyer gamer University student just floating along in life and I tell the disciples I was in Christ Church in New Zealand when he found me maybe that scratch their heads because this part of the world you know in the oldfashioned maps i' say he be monsters or something it was just you know that time I don't think anyone was here even the M people weren here amen so they'd say did he physically how did he physically get there and I'd say well I had the Bible in the message of the hour and because God is his word amen his word coming to me is exactly the same as him physically coming and calling me by name am mean the remember the Centurion had the same kind of Faith because the Centurion called for Jesus he had a sick servant and and the Centurion you know Jesus um was going to come and pray for his servant but the Centurion said I'm not worthy you come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will be well so the Centurion have had a revelation God's word going to meet the need is exactly the same as he himself going laying his hands upon the person and them getting well amen so that's why I say Jesus came he he walked into Christ Church and found me hallelujah amen he transformed my life filled me with the you know filled my love with his uh sorry my heart with his love he changed me amen from a from a child of Darkness to a Child of the Light amen his word became personal alive to me amen and I and Brothers I've seen him fulfill his word I've seen him prove himself to be Messiah over and over and over again hallelujah amen I've seen him I've seen him change lives amen you see what you've seen him do you've seen him do incredible things now but I've seen him do the same things because he said in his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever so therefore he's exactly the same now as he was back then amen I've seen him you know I've seen him go beyond the land language barrier amen I've seen you I've stood I know I've Shar these testimonies with you but we're having testimony on the sea okay we're having testimony on the sea okay this is good to have brother said we need to have it again so let's have it again amen I've seen him I've seen him come down you know I was praying you my parents were living in Papa New Guinea and they said you know you know and I had a burden how can I share this message with people who don't even understand English and I don't understand their languages right then the Lord came down he said not by power or by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord amen so the Lord said you just go and I'll do the rest just like he said to the disciples cross the sea that's right right if God sent you he's going to look after you amen so I went over there I you be to testify to I was asking the Lord and saying Lord how can I share this message with my house uh my parents housemid who's called Ruth she doesn't speak English she just speaks pigeon I don't at that well I wouldn't even try it now really but you know over there anyway the pigeon's very different to the Solomons but you know I would you know and I just speak English to her I don't understand pigeon you know but we can communicate I said Ruth you know you so I pray said Lord how can I share this message with Ruth and he said very simply tell you testimony show the Deep call to the deep and explain brother braham's Ministry from scripture so I did those things yeah and then after that was all done she said you know can you write those scriptures down so I can go study it in the Bible so I printed off a tracked off the internet which is from Brother re s and that explained the ministry of brother Bram and you know well it was in English she you know she can't read English gave it to to her the next day she came back rejoicing praising God cuz she said she opened up that track and she said she could understand every single word and the spirit of God was so strong in her heart convicting her this is the truth right amen so I've seen that I've seen people heal from malaria all kind of different things go on Amen I was the last time I was there in 2019 you know preaching a convention there and I was preaching that this message takes us back to a true Pentecost of Acts chapter 2 amen and while I was preaching those things The Interpreter stopped interpreting for about four or five minutes cuz everyone understood in their own language I didn't understand what was going on I was just preaching away but they were so moved there was you know men there they're like rocks they're like the mountains they come from very stoic and they love the Lord but no emotion you know and then the pastor at you know the end of that service I still didn't know what had happened he got up and he was just weeping over the pulpit so moved he's so blessed because the same God of the Bible is the same God of this message and he still lives today am mean he hasn't changed so Brothers it's incredible thing Hallelujah maybe the boat begin to shake cuz Hey I know how what it's like to be in boats but you you just get excited you know and you're not too worried this boat's going to get to the other side hallelujah amen you I'd say you know we would you know we um we would you know maybe maybe I testify about when Christie and I were in the um Christ Church the first first Christ Church earthquake Where where you know um the place begin to you know the sound came through our house like there was a freight train coming through it very quiet neighborhood and the place began to shake and not gentle but violent and somehow we got from our upstairs uh Loft um bedroom down to the front door we got down there we started praying and the presence of God came down Hallelujah we had a glorious prayer meeting there he keeps us safe in times of trouble amen I wanted to keep my eyes open and look at what's going on but I said no what's the use of observing what's going on why don't I just pray and many times we just want to see what's going on what about prayer what about committing it to the Lord amen amen you know we could and then maybe of course you know coming to Wellington and we begin to talk about you know Brothers God's able to create things amen he's be able to take a Wilderness and make it into an oasis amen he's able to take a desert and make it into a rainforest amen he's able to take something that was dead amen and make it alive again sorry this goes everywhere but I might as well say it like it was am mean so now and then we begin to pray about what to do and I didn't want to be here brothers let's be honest I didn't want to be here Wellington should be the fairy terminal maybe a BP and off we go to fa Fair climbs right but hey I didn't plan this thing God planned this thing amen hallelujah so here we are anyway so you know and then sort of praying about what to do and then and then and then the Lord said start a church now Brothers I may be rocking this boat right now with a test you know having a testimony on the sea but I don't like to rock boats I don't like to offend people but the Lord said do it and I found just like you've beg to trust the voice of God you can trust his voice amen you can trust his leadership and you know his leadership because he caused it to come to pass you don't need to make it to come to pass you don't need to manipulate things to make it happen it just happens I mean if you're surrendered to his leadership it'll happen amen so Brothers I could just Rejoice saying that same God that led Moses that's not too that's not too strong is it the same God that lead Moses leads you why can't I put myself in the picture too amen the same God that L Moses leads me amen the same God that L the prophets leads me Hallelujah cuz he's the same God today Hallelujah so you know begin to share about that then we had our first prayer meeting you know and then we had Tong's interpretation there and the Lord said if you remain humble amen my word will continue to go forth and I will bring my people here and they will find rest for their souls I remember and then and then also remember see that's exciting for me I was there a lot of you weren't there but most of us were there about was it last year or or the year before amen when the Lord came and spoke the same message to us he called us to remain humble because there's people who have not found rest amen he says You must remain humble I'm calling you to humility once again amen because there's people that must find rest they must receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he said at the end of that I have not left hallelujah amen so to me Hallelujah I like that last phrase I have not left see the devil wants to get you to think oh he's left and God says I haven't left I'm the same one in the beginning as the same one right now amen the same one that called us as the same God that's present hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God maybe we could talk about you know the prayer meeting sister Vanessa had a breakthrough in prayer amen one time I trust you hey you testify about these things so sorry I'm just taking license you can we can I can ask forgiveness later all right but then we had prayer minut over here there's this there's the house over there where we used to live and you know we had the prayer meeting and you we were praying and the spirit of God fell down and sister Vanessa had a breakthrough cuz brother Kim wasn't saved yet Hallelujah he was coming to lunch and things that's why fellowship's important friends praise God you have those green leaves of Fellowship you shall friendly have a friendly loving heart to people it brings people under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and then God can begin to work right I mean she was coming to lunches after church and different things but he wasn't saved yet then she had that bre through then she went home and brother kabin said you're not going to church on Sunday I'm going to pick the church to go to and so she calls me up and says yo what must I do you got the Holy Ghost now just just go with your husband be a light and then what about a month later I think brother kabin says we're going to church now they get in the car sister Vanessa is PL praying in her heart Lord where are we going comes to church hasn't left Hallelujah then he had his moment amen hallelujah our god is a redeemer hallelujah amen maybe we could talk about you know remember that you that church of Parkside Road there was holes in the ceiling it was like some some dump you know but God lived you know we don't go by the outside it's nice to have nice inside sure but you know we don't go by the church building we go by the quality of the spirit amen the quality of the word living amen so you know we were there and you know it was it was the one service or the first service where I think brother Isaac had you know they had already start church I get this text from Brother saying oh we're moving down praise God hallelujah God knew we needed you here we need you here amen I believe that amen you know so God was bringing people and then there was a one one Sunday where I think Isaac or Andy weren't at church as me and brother kin and I had this lung infection and I was on the strong antibiotics and it was for some reason decided to attack my right knee I couldn't bend my knee and and then the no de decided to come to church that day Glory Hallelujah amen if only I could take you back to those moments you think man what is attractive here I say God's attractive am the word of God calls the elect of God it may look like a total mess or whatever on the outside it's the polar opposite to maybe what the world calls to be a successful church but if the word of God is there he will gather his elect to him that's why we're here friends hallelujah we're here that the elect of God will find him amen so though so so they came to church and they're still here hallelujah maybe humanly it doesn't make sense but you're still here you're still walking with God hallelujah amen amen and you know maybe my maybe speaking of prayer meetings you know we could you know go back to remember that prayer meeting we had in here and we're all pray well in our hearts we're wondering what can we do for our young people what can we do about our children because we love our children we want them to take this word and just run yes am me to run and and and Conquer hell and walk with God and you know all the Fulfillment of you have a bride's Revival you know because every generation must have its own Revival and you know we had that prayer meeting here and you know there was another tongue's interpretation and God would maybe I don't have the words quite right but you know God would say you know as as as as I was lifted up and Moses lifted up the brass serpent if you lift me up above your children then I am the cure for every snake bite amen he is the cure for every snake bite we have a b and gillad we have that healing virt amen if you lift up this word that he lives in your life above your children above your problems above your situation that doesn't matter what the bites of the enemy have come against you or against your family he is the healing power he is the Redeemer he is the restorer amen he's not just some God of maybe no he's the god that is you remember that oh my I think this boat's going to tip upside down hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen maybe we could maybe we could go back to our first Camp you remember our first camp oh my many people came cuz they want to see what are these young people doing in Wellington a lot of people just came cuz they're curious you remember that camp Hallelujah remember that camp we're in the chapel about a hundred of us we're just amazed that so many people came but one thing that really blew my mind God came there was such an atmosphere there was such an atmosphere at that camp it was electric it was like if it was gas you L A match the whole thing would have gone Kaboom it was so electric amen and people in the back of the chapel they said they heard angels singing behind them we had an angel choir singing joining in the worship amen there was a time when Christine swapped with someone on the piano the piano kept playing between them playing we had phenomenal things but the greatest thing to me that happened at that camp was when people came to that camp and they told God before that camp God if you don't prove this message to be true I'm leaving it and God got a hold of their lives and they Believers to this day amen then then also we could say the stru came about that time and brother Aran came to camp in the slippers hallelujah amen you know and then there was that service where you know everyone's rejoicing the devil tries to put a cage on sister Shantel saying this is not for you you're not one of these and then Arman talks to her and prays prays with her and then I come up later not knowing what's going on I pray the same thing he prays I mean that that cage was broken and it's still broken cuz there nothing but a lie hallelujah amen this is a good boat trip he hallelujah amen now there's many more I can go through but you got to see our God is able amen our God is able you know there's there's countless Camp testimonies we could go through cuz that's cuz God didn't stop coming at the first one he just come more as Camp has gone along we've seen greater things happen since then amen so now how about you know we could we could talk about the time where um you know uh So Christine had the dream before Gabriella was born so she's born 31st of January I can remember birthday around Christmas time Christine had a dream that she was born born still born and there's real evil presence in the room when she woke up and so she told me about this and we prayed of course against it and then that came to the day of delivery we're driving to the hospital and of course we always prayers we're driving to um you know baby's going to be born and and um you know she said you know can we pray again because so in our minds is still this dream and so we prayed against it and then she said can I pray again after that and and then she prayed and she totally forgot about the dream totally forgot about it and then um but then I didn't forget about it right so then Gabriel comes out was caught in the birth canal and all that you came out blue and lifeless push you know they pushed the emergency button and every doctor and and nurse and everything in the hospital was in the room and I literally saw them take her lifeless blue body put it on the examination uh table thing and then she started breathing and just watched pink spread through her body Hallelujah now I would stand up and testify about that because at that time the stugs were going through something with lamb he had these skin lesions which were coming out and nothing the doctors could do would could could stop it and I said when I heard that dream I refused it in the name of the Lord amen and then so they took courage from that and they said well we're going to refuse this sickness amen and they prayed against it and it left hallelujah amen that's why there's power in testimony than you Lord hallelujah and there's you know there is countless things that we could that you know maybe we'll just go aran's appearance you know remember that Aran called called God on a conference on a Saturday night after having a big argument with brother kuus I hope he doesn't mind me saying this they had a big argument because brother kuus knows the Bible he can remember you know unconverted people can Jewel with scripture too but then Arman went outside he said Lord I'm out of my depth I need your Prophet told me I can call you on a conference amen amen and then the next morning we were we were still downstairs at that time I was preaching and I I basically it's as if I was literally standing there writing down their conversation and speaking it back to them Hallelujah in order of everything thank you Lord we know that happens more than we realize amen amen i r with joke oh you've bugged our house and then he began to get paranoid thinking maybe I did the word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart Amen brother Ram says if a man is fully surrendered to the word then the then the word of God can still discern through that vessel he speaks about in Christ of mystery of God revealed amen and we know those things happen all see he's not left he's not left you call God on the scene God will fight your battle he'll use the body to do it amen you're not in this alone friends we're not not rambos by ourselves we're a part of a body and God will use that body and we remember the night before they flew out you know Sister um um wanted to get baptized so we got up to their house there up um what was it Lord Street or what street is it man Mana drive we go up there uh there's the bathtub and you know we have a service there and brother corus says I'm not getting baptized and God had been dealing with him through this whole time he'd come and speak to me frustrated crying saying we God I want God to speak to me I want God to and then he get annoyed and speak to Aran saying where's this phone that you know where's this phone that people pick up and they call called God they talk to Jesus Jesus talks back where's this phone I want this phone cuz everyone's saying God speaks to them and they you know but but where's the phone that I can pick up and then so we're having this um we're just in their lounge and kba brother kba says um flat I'm not getting baptized tonight so that's fine so we're so we're there and I open up the scripture to Romans I begin to speak from Romans chapter 6 and as I'm reading Romans chapter six I see I see a little nearly 2-year-old girl walk up Lilia walk up see God uses the body you're not too young to be used and she begins to walk up now she's been walking around a bit and corus is trying to get her to come sit on his lap you know just to be respectful all these things but she comes up and and I don't know what she's doing but I see her stand there and she's actually looking at him and and she points at the Bible points up at the Bible that I'm reading and looks at him and then walks over picks up a little toy mask and gives it to him and then he breaks down starts crying and he says God just spoke to me through this little girl amen God told me listen obey my word take off the religious mask he got baptized that night too he came out of that he came out of that bathtub now before that he probably never raised his hands in his life he came out of that bathtub raised his hands praising God he became a new man yes hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my this so many we could tell the Sea of Galilee is only so wide but we'll have eternity to speak about all these things maybe we should actually have a testimony meeting and we just go from one to another that'd be really nice I think you know maybe we should have that amen maybe we could talk about Co time our God's good Our God's good all the time he looks after us in every circumstance though the though the world got lock down the word of God ain't bound amen the word of God ain't bound can't be bound by any system of man or any any plan of man of course we followed the rules and all those things but you know there was times when we would have meetings over zoom and it was like we were right here God just stepped into every house and it was a it was it was wonderful now if you didn't have a good co lockdown well I'm sorry but I did I did spiritually I did it was hard to log off and now you're just everyone's gone that was hard it was like such an Abrupt kind of thing but you know we would have times there we would we would have meetings and you know we you know listen to Brother John Andy preach the Youth Without Borders and he'd say the angel of the Lord wants to visit your house you can invite him you can't go to church but he can come to you amen God would come down and his anointing would fall in the house and we would we would you know um have times of prayer after we'd have meetings and you know there was one time we were praying and you the spirit of God came down we had tongu interpretation in the house and you know I was speak speaking to my daughter here Analise and God said I know what you think about when you lay your head upon the pillow at night I am calling you cuz she was wrestling at that time is God calling me or is just because it's church and people talk about baptism and all these things that's why I should get baptized or is God calling me so God came down in his infinite mercy and said I'm calling you amen amen it's not man I know what you think about see God knows what you think about at night wonder he knows what you M over he will answer if he can answer how old were you back then nine nine if he can answer a 9-year-old girl can he answer anyone else amen can he use the body to answer our questions our deep-seated worries and fears and all these things can't God do that and then we had the baptisms there and you know during those times and it was incredible wasn't it hallelujah amen we could you know and then of course I would definitely testify that every visiting Minister that's come to this place has said you are such a wonderful group of people and it's such a privilege to stand here and preach to you that's that's what they tell me there's such a liberty the fellowship is great there's such a love and a warmth there's not not just ministers that tell me this everyone tells me this that visit they are so captivated and Blown Away by the love the hospitality the openness the warmth and we just think this is normal well praise God it should be normal but we should never take it for granted right and then we could maybe we' come down the line to brother Colin hallelujah amen a week before Camp he starts talk where's oh fish is away but you he's talking to fish at work and you know he begins to testify to him not much brother Colin comes to the Wednesday service Wednesday night service before Camp right and then we have discussion out here about you and he's already listening to brother Braham how long were you a Christian for how long you've been a Christian for 30 plus years Who is younger than 30 plus years here so he's been a Believer I can't put my hand up anymore not that I've hit 40 yet but I'm near there yeah but you see he's been a Believer longer than most of us have been alive right but the scripture didn't tie together hey this is all isolated scriptures then he started listening to the message he came to Camp he came to Camp he said I'm only coming for one night I thought you're right we'll see you the whole time I said it's fine you the bed's there for your wife all those things he was there the whole time he said his testimony and and I know he's told you this he said he said the meetings were great but it was The Fellowship between and the testimonies and the life he saw hallelujah hallelujah next week he still I mean he came back and he said this is my church got baptized Christmas Eve glory to God hallelujah amen hallelujah our god saves our God really saves am mean he really does set the captive free amen and you know how and then how how many more could I share we could go on for days praise God right but the reason I do this is because it's like the disciples cuz we're in the boat right but then as we're testifying and having a jubilee time on the boat talking about our lord Jesus done the sun was going down and then finally it begin to get dark and it's when the world life gets a bit dark then the devil begins to spew his poison breath upon the ocean he begins to bring his trouble because we are living in a time of strife and trouble like there's never been it'll only be worse in the Great Tribulation but we but the world is ramp it's getting worse and worse and worse right so now here we are we're on our journey remember Jesus sent us you got to remember this the god that called you will see you through right I just want to labor this point because it's very important because many people they get upset well if God's really with me trouble will never come no trouble will come in this world we we shall have tribulation Jesus said but be of good cheer I have overcome the world right just because there trouble doesn't mean we quit as I said in the beginning a quitter never wins but a winner never quits see it's not him that gets knocked down it's him that gets back up that's right amen you may get knocked down blindsided all kinds of things but just get back up say Lord I'm here I want to walk with you I want to serve you amen hallelujah because we're not here to quit we're here to win amen amen so this God that God that called them was a God that sent them and the god that sent them was going to see them through so he sent them over the sea he constrained them to go across the Bible says in Matthew 14 and then so while this time is going on the devil the devil popped his filthy head out of hell and he looked at that boat rocking along on the Sea of Galilee at this time it wasn't because of storms it was because of a jubilee going on but you see they they were on there and and he said finally I'm going to get even with them I'm I'm going to deal with these disciples I'm going to silence the power of their testimony that they're going to go on a journey now and they ain't going to be testifying of the goodness of God anymore see the devil ain't playing games he's not playing a game of tag he's not playing a game he's here to destroy Rob kill and destroy that's what he's had to do and he's very intentional in how he does it amen so so he begin to blow his poison his poison over the you poison breath over that sea he raised up brother said the devil looked over and said uhuh they've gone off on a tantrum they're just there jumping and up and down shouting having a big time you know what right now is my time I'll to sink them I'll get even with them now so he raised up over the hill and began to blow his poison breath over there upon that Sea of Galilee and then the wind begin to blow the waves begin to LEAP I mean the boat begin to rock and not because of not because of them having a jubilee but because now the the conditions of their Journey had changed it wasn't the beautiful sunset anymore on a calm sea now it was darkness and trouble had been stirred up because the devil was blowing his Winds of strife and trouble upon the sea and he began to blow things like the days of Miracles as passed now in order for something to pass it's all it was there right we could say that summer has passed right because we're no longer in summer anymore and soon we'll say but with a lot more happiness winter has passed right but it was a season but the season changes so now when when the Devil comes and Whispers that the days of Miracles are passed he's not denying that there were day of Miracles oh no he acknowledges them because he knows what it's like to be beaten and thrashed and cast out and dealt with and put in his place am mean but he says that season is no longer here you see you've advanced in your journey a bit it's no longer the Youth of the church anymore but you've become established you've become mature and you you've become set in your ways and you've got you know you're older now and God don't do those things anymore that is the biggest piece of nonsense that anyone could ever tell you amen for for for the devil to come and tell you those things yes there was a great Revival in brother bram's day but you're living in a That season has passed you see we're in a different season now we've just got to hold on to the boat until until we can get across the other side that's the Winds of strife and unbelief being blown onto the sea amen all that has done is to put unbelief in your heart to lower your expectations and lower the actually the reality that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever all those ideas of well God don't do those things anymore who said I gave you testimonies from a span of 17 years well we'll be 17 in in September that's how long I've been a Christian for 17 years September it's been awesome amen hallelujah it's been a and and and I could fill in a lot more gaps I've jumped a lot of things okay those aren't the only things that have happened in that span no way you see but but I but I I trust I proved a little bit to you he's still the Messiah his word is still true am mean he's still the son of man revealing himself he's still that same great Lord Jesus that he was in the beginning he's the same one today am amen so he'll blow that you poison upon us the days of Miracles are past God don't do that anymore you know he he'll say well you know we don't need to focus on the miraculous anymore the moving of the spirit and all we need to do is refine things that is such a bad wind that is such a bad wind because brother rown speaks more about the quickening power at the end of his ministry that he does for most of the start of it the Dynamics coming back into the church again the Dynamics of the moving of the Holy Ghost he he speaks more about that at the end of his ministry than he does at the beginning am mean because he's saying now is the rising of the sun amen we you you the the s o n has risen Christ himself is risen amen he says that the son of man Ministry is in a many membered body now amen it was revealed in Jesus um revealed in brother brown one man Ministry but now it's a bride Ministry around the world that same son of man being revealed made known that same word putting on flesh amen so if he speaks more about the quickening power at the end what is he saying now the quickening power is here amen the quickening power to m to to take this word and make it live amen that that that we don't just stand and quote and argue and fuss and no the word puts on flesh amen it's no longer an argument it's a living word amen just like the disciples before Jesus ever came it was an argument how's the Messiah going to come how's this going to happen what about this prophecy how do you see this how does rabbi so and so see this have you seen this guy's YouTube channel Rabbi so and so saying about modern events and all these things all an argument but then he but then God became flesh and improved his word so it went from an argument to a reality amen and what has this message gone from an argument to a reality amen it went from an argument in the 70s ' 80s whatever more we're living in a different season and me we've come back round again Amen to a time of Revival and renewal and restoration amen it's like hallelujah amen it's like when the you know the um arm company story you know the armac company story right in one of those times when brother R tells it the armac company boy says to says to the girl he's going to marry in a year's time I'm going to come back for you so he's basically saying when you see the season come again I'm coming to get you amen amen what happened when brother brah was here God ped a spirit out the reality of the word the word became manifested there was a love there was a Unity there was a genuine Oneness with the spirit of God right sure there was all the trouble and false you know Antichrist Spirits all these things trying to get in but the bride was solid amen right and then we came down through a it was like Moses calling Israel out of Egypt but then there was a Wilderness experience it's Church splits trouble fussing and fighting but we're not in the wilderness anymore we've come back to the same season when the prophet was here the son of man is very much alive Jesus Christ is very much alive and he's doing the same things he did that you hear on tape he's doing the same things today but not in a onean Ministry it's a bride body around the world Hallelujah so we see the season come back again what does that mean there's going to be a meeting in the air very soon hallelujah amen that's why it doesn't matter what the critics say I'm ready to leave doesn't matter what unbelief says I'm ready to leave doesn't matter what man's opinion on the website say I'm ready to leave amen they turned up too late cuz I met the god of the word amen the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen praise God so the season we live in is a season of The Miraculous we are living in a season of the mechanics and the Dynamics running together am mean we have the mechanics of the word right we have the mechanics of the word we know we know the doctrines of the word we know Church order all these things we have the mechanics right but you need the Dynamics and the mechanics to run together and when you have those running together there's an overcoming Christian am mean there's a church that's on fire for God and in spite of what but anything the devil can do against them they will come out packing the victory remember because the Bible says no weapon formed against them against thee shall prosper right so the storm that the disciples found themselves in if they only went back into Isaiah and said Brethren the storm is bad we're bailing the boat out all this Winds of strife and people maybe maybe the disciples talk about other the economic pressure and what's Rome doing what's all the trouble doing and what's the world doing the economy is going to tank and all these things going on all these things can begin to what tip our boat right wind because now these things got to be tangible things right but then but then you see if only they just went back into the scripture said Brothers Our God told us no weapon formed against us shall prosper this storm ain't going to prosper it's formed we can see it we're in it we're being tossed by it it's getting in our eyes we're getting wet we're getting we're bailing the boat out sure all these things but this ain't going to sink us we ain't going to be sunk by this trouble amen it won't Prosper amen because God has already declared it won't Prosper hallelujah hallelujah and he said that every tongue that rises against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn am mean so when the devil Rises against you in judgment trying to condemn you you got to condemn him why is that I've got a blood Covenant with my God Amen he has he has shed his blood on my behalf he's standing there interceding for me hallelujah amen so we can't ever think that you know we're in a different season now as in a negative way this is a great season to be in amen we we're living in a season where where brother and would say every generation must have its own Revival every generation has its chance at the word amen that the word that that it's not just being raised in a church being a good person but they see the reality of God in their lives I mean where they stand up and they begin to rock the boat testifying of what good what what God did the other week and how real he is and great he is and what he's done in their lives and how he's changed them amen every generation must have its own Revival amen we must be determined Lord we say Lord we want we want the younger generation to have its own Revival amen we want the older generation to have a Revival amen we want every one of us to have a Revival I mean where we're totally abandoned out to the word of God all we do is love him and want him we don't care about anything else am mean that all we want to do is see him live amen we're not worried about politics what about people saying what things of the world going on no we desire that God would live amen amen there's the Winds of questions and questions on the word that would blow across the sea and yeath God said like the serpent said to Eve see the devil always comes with questions and those questions are always negative questions always loaded questions against the word of God and those things are blowing but but but remember friends oh we've Run Okay in spite but remember while this was all going on H hallah see that's not the end of the picture friends because who was walking upon those Winds of strife and those waves here came the Lord Jesus Hallelujah the very great God of Glory see you may be looking at your storm look above the storm am mean don't look at the waves of the wind look above the storm because if you look above the storm you'll see the master amen walking towards you amen wanting to get a hold of you amen but you see the thing is they were afraid of him they thought he was the spirit cuz they because they baby thought how can a man walk on water and that's how we see trouble we say how can God walk over these things and step into this because the waves are too big amen the storm is too great who's ever been there let's be honest I've been there I think how can God ever you know get me out of this trouble how can I ever walk upon this storm it's too great but God just says I'll show you where I can walk amen he walked down to hell he walked up into Glory Hallelujah he can walk on your storm Hallelujah hallelujah amen I believe that Amen to here he came walking on the water amen but then he you know they were afraid but but but he said the great words be not afraid it is I don't be afraid amen Don't Be Afraid what's going on don't be afraid of the storm it is I amen you got to realize this word is him and he's come to step into the boat he didn't wait for the storm to go away it was when the storm was at its worst he says I'm getting in I'm getting in the boat with them hallelujah amen that their testimony meeting is not going to stop amen it's going to continue on but I'm going to add another testimony to their meeting hallelujah amen and Hallelujah Hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen praise God Amen that's what he wants to do friends amen so so then he said be not afraid of is I and then they willingly received him into the boat amen it's a true sign you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you willingly receive the word into your boat amen that is the main sign of it that you can welcome and receive the word and if you want deity in your midst what does brother say welcome and receive the word don't bat it away don't reason it away don't say my problem's too big don't say well that's for someone else that's that's not receiving him say Lord I'm in a big problem but here I am Lazarus was in a tomb 4 days he received the word because Jesus said Lazarus come forth and a part of him said here I am and he came back to life beautiful wonderful now friends think about it our great Lord Jesus got in the boat Hallelujah this changed their whole journey because in the boat was the son of David whose reign will never end and his Dominion will never end he's now in our boat amen he's going to sit on the throne in the Millennium and we're going to sit on his throne too amen the messiah's in the boat who's in your boat today who's who just stepped into your boat today I believe God's been stepping into people's boats today amen amen I believe he's been walking over strife and trouble and stepping into your boat amen who's you know the the one who The Giver of rapturing faith is in the boat amen the one who gives Revival the Revival Giver is in the boat now amen the one who has dominion over all things is in the boat hallelujah amen amen The God Who created all things stepped into the boat amen Hallelujah and now they had a different kind of Revival now they had a different kind of Revival because it wasn't just now now the sea went calm right but now they didn't go calm because a real Revival I'm just going to close with this thought a real Revival brother R said when he stood by Lake Michigan and he saw the waves and the wind churning up and down he said that Lake's having a Revival and all that wind that's blowing over the lake he said he said the same amount of water that was in the lake beforehand is in the same amount that's in afterwards but the wind blowing upon that Lake caused all the trash and all the things of man and all the rubbish and all the nonsense and all the stuff that hinders it gets it washed up on the bank amen for it to stay on the bank amen so they begin to have a Revival cuz the Revival Giver stepped into their boat and they begin to rejoice and all their unbelief and doubt and skepticism got washed out on the bank Hallelujah and that's what we need friends we need an oldfashioned sky blue sin killing St Paul's Revival with the Holy Ghost in it amen that God comes down and washes the trash out washes the skepticism out washes the doubt out washes whatever everyone else is doing let it just be washed out of you amen and let God take over I believe this is where we're living the one who gives the the one who changes the body of the Bride is in your boat amen he say am I going to make the Rapture well the Rapture giv is in the boat if he's in you he's in your boat I mean do I have enough rapturing Faith well if he's in you you have rapturing faith amen well how am I going to get through this problem well the problem solver if he's in you is going to get it remember he says I've overcome the world greater is he that's in you that's he that's in the world so greater as the one that stepped into the boat that was the one in the storm amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God I don't know how to finish this but I think I think we can we can have a we can have a genuine Boat Rock and Jubilee when you think about what God has done hallelujah and he hasn't left amen you may be in the storm of your life let them step in your boat that's just say come into my boat Lord Jesus take over Hallelujah do what you want to do amen because remember he sent you on the sea he knew the storm would come he allowed the storm to come cuz he wanted but he but why he knows all things right but but he knew it would come but he wants to step into the problem and prove himself Messiah see every every problem that comes in life God allows because he wants to prove his word I'm going through something it's another scenario God has ordained to allow that he can prove his word but what if they did not willingly let him come into the boat where would they have ended up glug glug glug we don't want to be in that condition yes because many times people are afraid of God taking over their lives they were afraid of the the one who could save them they were afraid of right so people become afraid of the Holy Ghost cuz they're they're afraid to surrender and let him take over oh what if he does what if he makes me scream or shouting tongues or whatever more he may do that he may not but what well but that means I have to surrender this thing now listen this thing whatever that thing is is lead that causes you to sink there's nothing the devil can give you that's worth holding on to right and the PE and the reason people wrestle with things is because they want to hold on to it something in them wants to hold on to it right or they feel traps they can't expose it expose the devil I ain't no one's human shield sirl I ain't a human shield here friends and neither are you right so let's not let's not be afraid of the one who can come and take over our storm oh but this and this problem this situ this how I was raised forget that stuff he's still walking on the Storm you got to invite him into your boat amen and I would do that with all my heart if I was you hallelujah hallelujah let's have the musicians uh this morning amen I was want to finish there but friends he's walking on the Storm he's walking on the Storm Hallelujah invite him into your boat amen hallelujah I just read this this is the quote um he says here now this a testimony on the sea 1964 but what I'm afraid of you Pentecostals is ecumenical council is going to take you that's the thing it's going to form the mark of the beast you're going to go into it because you're an organization you have to get in or get out that's the thing and any good sensible spiritual person knows that he says we need another upon the sea testimony and the reason we need that is because it brings what God has done and who he is back into our back into reality because if we remember what he's done and what he who he is we won't drift off that's why we got to keep these things alive amen sir amen so let's um let's stand they stand this morning amen you got a you got a song am me sorry to put you on the spot as always but a little bit slow but the Standing on the Promises sure amen but like a you can go it
