========================================

[Music] h [Music] oh here it's my first [Music] time we had the um mechanics we just needed the Dynamics to make it all work and um in the film world when something's not working sometimes it's we we call it an ear Gap when you've got a you've got a this is silly thing to say but yes an air gate when you have a device that's not working and it's The Simple Solution is to plug it in because there's air between two chords so we had a slight ear Gap this morning praise the lord it's good to be here it's good to be in the house of God and to to be able to stand and worship and praise the Lord to be able to come into His presence and just give the Lord Praise You Know regardless of what what we might be going through or any sort of situation I I've been I I keep a lot of the stuff you know that I go through just to myself you just go through it and the Lord leads you through but you know I've had a a very hard challenging year and there's been a lot lot of things you know sometimes when you go through things the Lord sort of gives you an answer delivers you and you you can overcome whatever situation but this one's been a bit different all I've ever got anytime ever is just walk on some days you don't know which way to walk you're like which way there's no I don't even I can't see any sort of Direction I can't even figure out which where to put my foot in what sort of Direction you know but the Lord takes you through things for a reason and it's every time it's just walk on walk on there's never any answer as such as just just walk on you know and I as I recall the armor of God only has armor at the front cuz you just walk on you just walk on and um I was getting a b mopy myy to Shannon the other night you know having a a little wing I don't winge too often but now and then I do and um she sort of tells me off stop [Music] complaining and um I talked to this this guy I deal with him in film a lot he's a film lawyer and he and he and he said he said to me I want to send you this um a film a documentary this guy made and he made it for a certain amount I want to show you the effects on it and see see what you think about it he said it's in a it's in a USB form I'll I'll Courier it to you and I had him cier to the um Factory where we are and after I finished having a little mopy mopy I remembered that this little package was there that this guy had sent and it came in a nice little well I opened up the package and it came in a nice little tin it was like a very professional DV uh USB so you'd open up the tin and it would have it in there nice the US band it was could be played on different devices and that but I opened up the tin and I looked at the name of this thing and I read the tin I thought that's strange and it said march on that happened to be the name of of the documentary cuz it was about the uh soldiers at the military camp in featherston and it was called march on so it's not just walkon anymore it's march on so we' got a new command march on so let's stand this morning and let's regardless of what we might be going through we're going to march on if God is for us who can be against us amen I'm looking forward to worshiping God

Level football player trust me I've learned my lesson you family welcome back your home welcome back we missed you it's good to have family back hey I could also say I know people from overseas uh let's go there to the Book of Revelation we just jump into it I don't want to hold you up today just really want to get there back into the word man I was touched with that song service the Lord is just so good hey Hallelujah you are enough amen and then just a a special shout out there to Brother TZ Brother TZ I love you bro God bless you what an awesome man of God you are enough so today if you just put that first oh no leave the slide for now let's go to Revelation 5 and and here in Revelation 5 what happens is the Lamb steps forth and he's going to take this book of redemption this book where our names are written on the one he paid was such a such a dear price his life blood marted you know everything he took he's coming forth he's going to take this book and we'll just we'll just read a bit there and it says and I saw in the right hand this is John of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside sealed with Seven Seals so he's now going to open this book but he has to first get this book the title deed and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open his book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in the Earth or neither under the Earth was able to open this book neither to look there on and I WEP much because there was no man found worthy to open and to read the book book neither even to look in it so to look there on and one of the elders said to me he says this weip not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David he prevailed to open that book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof hallelujah hallelujah so he's proclaiming this is this is done here is the Lamb stepping forth and I beheld low in the midst of the throne and the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood the lamb that has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto all the Earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken it now this is my verse when he had taken the book The Four Beast of four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having everyone them Harps and golden veils full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints so this glorious event just took place Jesus Christ steps forth he takes the book he's going to open these seals and the the biggest gift Heaven has to offer him is the praise of the Saints hallelujah amen you may be seated may the Lord just have a blessing upon this word I'm just going to pray again say Lord Jesus may you just step out of this book lord and may you step into each one of our home each one of our our personal space Lord deep into our heart Lord that that closet within the closet Lord that that place where we really need you to speak to us father may you just step forth now Lord and speak to anyone and everyone individually and Lord may you be exalted in our midst and may you just bless the reading of your word and what comes off in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so let's put that first one on so my thought was prayer and and I've been thinking about prayer for a long time and and me and brother um Ed was stimulating a little bit about it but prayer is powerful amen prayer is so powerful I I I don't understand I think we we under we don't realize the power of what a Christian has that prayer sometimes it feels you you praying to a ceiling you're not getting anywhere but but just keep praying cuz because it's I'm not going to get ahead of myself but prayer is the anchor is the it's the f ship with God it's the it's the intimate part with God it is where we we we get a one in-one audience with the King it's prayer there's no one else there just you and God it's prayer and see what the devil has done is the devil has robbed your time he's made us busy he gave each one of us a device in our hand he gave us YouTube on the TV he gave us all the likes and flicks and clicks and whatever you may call it he's he's he's taking your time I want to ask a question and this might be a very weird question but I'm going to demonstrate something when last did you just do this when L did you just do this went on the park B somewhere away from everything no device nothing and just went and sat down and just went when loss when L if you just stayed there and just said I'm going to stay up when last did you clear your mind of everything around you I'm not talking meditation we need to meditate upon the word day and night but get the business out of you completely and just sit and just go when last have you seen how busy the devil is keeping us hey he's just keeping us running every day nonstop just run run run run run think think think think thought thought thought thought bubble bubble like like click click flick flick all that he just that's your mind have you ever stopped and and sisters have you ever stopped and not think and got into a nothing box oh boy they can't that's a good place they can't but it's a beautiful place all me knows this it's usually followed with a facial expression like this and your wife comes and goes what are you thinking about nothing what how can you don't cuz then I have to think just nothing so so they call it the man caves and the little places and and the world calls it all these type of things I'm calling when is it your alone time where you where TV is not there social media is not there sounds noise everything just nothing but you and God because remember God is all over us he's around us he's within you so no matter where you sit alone he's there he's always there it's just we get so busy we steep out of the atmosphere of God God is all over us all around us but we step out of that place and we we being LED out of that place and that's where he cuts every Christian's life is that at the prayer line at that prayer that family prayer that time with God because you know what I'm I'm tired I had a rough day and I I worked very hard I just want to sleep so I just quickly kneel there by my bed and I go say Lord thank you for this day you're so great and for all those things to pray for Brother Andy and for this one and that one this one click click click click and that that this that and amen okay and you get in your bed and you I prayed was that praying no so how's your battles you know how's the battles are we standing or are we taking shots are we are we thrown to and fro or or actually do we have stepping out the next morning knowing that you all prayed up knowing that Lord whatever happens in this day you've got it cuz it's prayer oh dear it says now see what pray does prayer is not exactly bringing go God to man it's bringing man up to God see sometimes when we pray we want God to do our will say Lord your will be done your kingdom come you know but it's still hey can you please look after that one and can you do this and this and this and hey today I've got a meeting you need to be with me and then is that how we pray has it has it gone watery or do we actually sit in the morning and we go Lord on our knees saying what is your will for me where you going to say send me today how can I better serve you my king what is in here that is between me and you get it out of the way what is in here that's between me and you get it out of the way CU Lord today when I step out of here I want to know that I'm 100% in thy will not are you in my will you know sometimes you have a decision to make I'm going to keep to it but you've got a very big decision to make and it's a real decision and you need an answer but you need an answer now but but God goes nah you're going to wait because you want your answer and a lot of times we rush God and we get a answer but that's not his answer because we want to fit God into our busy lifestyle God has no time God has all eternity but the thing is his timing is so perfect and one brother T put on that that on his shared his status this morning about prayer I thought no matter how many times I prepared no matter how many lessons we would have had God just goes and says hey there you go please deliver the mail his timing is perfect but see we want to make it our timing that's not what we should do we should pray and say Lord bring me into your presence take me out of this place which is so busy and bring me into your presence that should be your first thing exalt him praise him you know Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name give him praise but then get quiet and say Lord now bring me into your presence and stay there and stay wonderful things will happen to you amen that's right if you had ever a question or ever a doubt those things will go away because you have to stay in that prayer amen first thing the devil did and I just put it there and so don't have to read it all but brother brandom is speaking here in the Samaran church as and he's and he's busy saying that the first thing the devil did is he took the Bible and the praying out of schools so he's teaching you young people when you go to class when last he you young people quick one do you pray when you get to school huh so when you walk into a new class especially maths cuz everybody needs prayer for maths like seriously maths is rough okay you need prayer okay you walk in there I don't see a teacher go first thing in the morning and say they go they call the Roll Roll those Called Up Yonder I'll be there and they go Reuben yes jono yes AB yes mo mo mo yep yep Mo yep Mo yep yep Mo yeah okay and they kick the Box off and then they go okay yes let's open your books and let's go you had homework there's no okay guys while we're here let's just bow our heads oh boy and we start this day right do you think any child in that class will talk back to a teacher if they open up in a word of prayer the atmosphere straight away in that class will change the teacher will be in their position and the kids will be in their position because God is now in his position so now all of a sudden the ranking in that little situation is perfect because God stepped in that place and now every child goes hey I'm actually here for a greater reason not just to get taught at and Shout at and taught and disrupt so he took it out of the schools it's gone don't worry I'm not going to be long today we're just talking about prayer I will definitely not be able to read that but don't worry I got to back up now brother Brenham who believes that brother brandham is the prophet of God Amen okay I just want to establish something he goes and he he visits it visits this um and I think is this he says yeah and remember my brother and sisters you reap what you seow so he says that's a law of God it's just it's like gravity beautiful you jump out of a tree you fall on your face I don't know whoever jumped out of a tree and landed just nowhere and just floated doesn't happen the law of gravity we will defy once we change our bodies but while we're in this body gravity loves your body and it will suck you down okay who ever on the skateboard wheels go you go you don't keep going on you you you face plant man you WIP out and there's no nice way of falling you fall okay so what what he's trying to tell you is there's laws of God and he says you reap what you s so what you what you give is what you get it's the third law of Newton who knows that one you take a tennis ball you throw it hard against the wall what's going to come back Abes you love throwing balls come on what's coming back and usually it's for your face hey yeah then it becomes dodgeball but but because you pick it up and you throw it with a force that same equal force hits that wall and comes straight back at you it's a law you sew you reap I love you I love you too darling you annoy me sorry you reap what you seow true well it's so in your prayer life you want God to step on the scene and come and interceder for you and help you in times but all you're sewing is a quick hey Lord how you doing thank you God bless you by you don't have a deep connection with God you don't spend time and pray and ask and pray and ask you just hey you know I'm just covering my basis cuz I'm a Christian and that's what we do we pray and oh brother Marion has got a prayer request here quickly going to pray for him Lord just pray for Marion and you know we okay yes okay yeah oh another one sister Louis says this for moving and all those things yep okay Lord help them to move I don't want to be that way but that's what we do because we as Christians know prayer is important but we forget the real importance of prayer prayer is interceding prayer is getting into that burden prayer means Marion is my brother here's my whole body the py has got a cut and it's bleeding it's real bad bleeding he's asking for prayer he's hurt the rest of the body when you cut your little pinky it knows about it yeah have you ever hit your shin on the back of a of a car's toeb bar the whole body knows about it your brain your ear loses yeah and this things everything you hit that thing and your whole body goes oh I just got that hurt and it's so sore and it fobs there so the Pain's there the rest of the body goes do not walk into that thing again so next time you walk around the you you're like because now the the body is so in tune to say you don't want that to happen again you want to find furniture in your house switch the lights off your shin will find it that's what it is but when the body hurts the whole body protects it so next time subconsciously you walk around the car and you see the toeo your eyes see it your mind automatically goes nope the rest of the body goes yep yep side step that one isn't that how the prayer in the church should be when one of the members says I'm going through a trial you actually say Lord I want to be that one to say don't don't intercede here brother Isaac's grandma that text come through I'm like Lord this man's got some stuff going on I just want to pray for my brother I don't care where I am I stop right there I don't care who's looking I don't I don't care about those things cuz that doesn't matter the one thing matters now is I read that text I got the time I'm going to pray for my brother whoever looks maybe they can come and pray with me me but brother Isaac is asking for prayer and even if he just say something it is such a part of our body that I want to pray for him I want to pray for his house that's prayer and we go on there and he says you reap what you seow so dear people here in sort so he's talking to a church very small so sorry about it well you can see there he says the best thing to do around you here at Life Tabernacle everywhere else is to keep that oldfashioned prayer meeting going and keep the unity of the spirit I underlined both of them because it's no point I pray for you brother Paul but inside I think oh man he's a muppet but think about it because then my prayer is not really I'm not really feeling you all I'm doing is I'm ticking the box but if I see brother Paul and I don't maybe understand brother Paul and I go yes brother Paul I'm still going to pray for you because you know what you're a redeemed Son of God and you have my prayers and and I will cover you and if there's a guy behind you with a sword that wants to stab you in the back guess what I'll be that guy that takes that spot and say n no not today I'll be that guy that is being in the in the unity of the spirit all in one Accord in one Accord that's when we pray amen he says keep all this worldliness out he says because um no matter how bad it hurts so sometimes children it hurts not to watch YouTube and your favorite Channel but it ain't helping you right I'm looking at you Young Guns I'm looking at your sisters the little ones it ain't helping you it's keeping you busy I'm not saying it's wrong don't get me wrong I'm not just hear me out it fills this space and it diminishes this space and that's all it's good for that's right so he says even if it hurts if you take that iPad and you just want to look at mom goes now and you go it hurts I just have to put it down just do it because you will benefit from it because you are now cutting that anointing on you off and you starting entering to a different realm and now you got time because the first thing my kids don't play games or look at anything on the TV they go I'm bored well all of a sudden now you have time but the the first place before it you didn't have time and now you got loads of time so then I want you to be bored because if you're bored then you might sit down and start talking to him amen that's good you will see your life change you will see the change instantly you won't get your anwers answers instantly cuz God isn't a a instant in and out of season Google got all the answers God he's not that he makes you wait for it he makes you work for it he makes you think about it he makes you meditate upon it he makes you pray for it because he wants you to if you if I just give you everything on a silver platter everything you want Ferrari Porsche soccer balls Cricket balls girls I don't know what you girls like I'm still finding out from Faith but Pony ponies ponies all those things if I just give it to you give it to you give it to you give it to you would you appreciate it no but once work for something hey Reuben work till your feet is sore and then get that reward oh man it goes on your cupboard straight away you're like man I worked for that one because now you worked for it but prayer is the same thing prayer is is is is you work in prayer thoughts come in things go out Brother Andy how many you're brushing your teeth you're starting talking cuz now you can't rebuke Satan I'll never forget that that why when you brush your teeth and I was like brushing my teeth go yeah actually this is true cuz I now I can't just rebuke him now so he waits for me to try to attack me he's always there trying to attack you why don't you get out of his presence into his presence amen okay let's go on so he says keep that oldfashioned Prem meeting going keep the oldfashioned Holy Holy Spirit falling among you keep the world out seal Christ in you are letting down in prayer some way just remember you sow what you reap yeah remember that okay here we go next one let's go to Matthew 21 I've got it up here but open your Bibles so it sounds like you all got Bibles here come good just to see who's rattling the pages who knows where the Book of Matthew is hey Jonah let's go to Matthew 21 ran I've got your Bible today you can have it back now here you go I forgot my Bible at home so I took I took the wrong book I took sister bronn's book that she bought me the nice the the right yeah so I took that one got you and I was like that's not my Bible what it's all right praise the Lord I said ran can you give me your sword I'll just go got a couple of enemies on your behalf as well amen so just get on behind the thought he says now we forget the power of prayer and and here's the story Jesus we we'll go just here from this side he says Jesus answered them saying very very I say unto you if you have faith and no doubt you shall do only um um not only do this which done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say to this mountain be you removed and be cast into the sea it shall be done now a lot of Christians get criticized for this scripture but remember the Lord of Glory just came past and he went to a fig tree and there was no fruit on it yeah come on no fruit nice beautiful tree green leaves look the pot dress the pot act the PO he goes just give me a fruit it's all I want to see is give me some Joy huh on now give me some Joy oh no I'm a CH give me give me some love oh man I just cannot I can that guy is fine and that guy this Brother come on now give me the fruits of the spirit the meekness oh stepped on my toe Temperance see there's no fruits because we looked theart the tree looked like a fig tree and it was so that when the Lord walked to the feig tree he was expecting fruit on that tree and he has no fruit and he says well this fruit shall never bear fruit again walks away and the fruit just goes in front of everyone the tree just dies and the disciples walk and they go hey and I'm going to paraphrase cuz kids I want you to listen just look at that cool guy yes he's always at church always but but man he's just balling out that other guy huh when he turns around and goes oh yeah I just hate being at church but you're always at church you're always so nicely dressed that's boring well where's the fruits bro and then the boys get together cuz remember you think it's just a tree God is trying to teach you something is such a compound meaning in the word if you just spend time in it so I just don't want to be there they always have to make me be there but I dressed apart and when when they they ask me to tell me something they give me always the message answer man I've asked people how are you doing oh praise the Lord I'm doing so fine God is just so good to me okay let's cut through that how you doing actually I'm having a rough week at school isn't that better because what the message done and since I've been in the message is people think that if they give me a quote of brother brandom or they talk to me about some fancy Revelation they just got that I'm going to think they're saved it it's not me that's saving you it's not brother bit saving you your salvation has nothing to do with us we just come and say hey have you considered it's between you and God you cannot fool God you can be as pied as you want you can cannot fool God that's right every man can think you're a total believer you cannot fool God because when you get in your place alone with God you're either going to make him sick cuz you lukewarm and he'll spew you out of his mouth or he's going to come down and he's going to visit you and you're going to be in his presence and you're going to fill yourself up with the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's only those two see the thing is people we we are people Pleasers since we've been little kids we want to please Mom and Dad we want to come and Mommy I done that this and daddy I've done this and aren't you proud of me we want to please that's our nature but see with God it's not like that God wants a relationship he doesn't want you to please him he is pleased because you're there because he more than ever wants to spend time with you it's us cutting the time from him and so what God does is he does send us trials he gives us a little bit of things just to get our knees a bit polished up again and get back on our knees and go oh dear lord yeah okay really I I I messed up you know what's the weakest place to be is on your knees you know I spoke to to and this is such a cool thing it came in Fellowship we were always jumping out of the car me and Ed here's a samurai pulls this massive katana sword W I'm a samurai they go into battle and they and the one goes and he's bleeding and he's lost the battle and that Samurai goes in front of the other Samurai puts down his sword and he kneels and he goes you won and in the old days they would just s him up because that was thing but that was his weaked spot from because from here I can't do nothing I can't just jump up all of a sudden like in the movies and go I'm weak I'm surrendered now think if you approach God that way he says brother brandom say and I want to I want to give you a little bit of neology here and I had this here that's good just let me get it cuz now when it got yes man that is so cool we just don't we don't think about these things e just pray for me where is it I had this little book of prayer man it changed my life he says here the Christian doesn't realize what force he has when he his knees uh when he's on his knees before the almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is amen because that's where you say to God I'm fully surrendered I have nothing that's where you approach him to say you're everything zakus come out from that tree just come stand next to me that's where you know that he's Sovereign and you're not that's when when every mind battle stops battling it's when you just before him go I don't know what to do now Lord you know we should pray lift up holy hands standing and praying and all those things you know it's fine but when you really desperate get on your knees get on your knees it wasn't in my notes he says and all these things whatsoever you are so remember he just spoke about a mountain being moved into the sea guys you got that scripture you think you can speak to a mountain will just drop in the sea he says all things whatever you ask in prayer believing what did he say so there is something to it hey it's not just God you go save that that brother and then yeah well we just stop it there believe speak it Proclaim it confess it find him Lord believe there is a part for the believer to playing cuzz that's why they call us Believers God you have a promise in your Bible I will get healed believe you go I've been in this battle too long believe he didn't say believe and instantly I will come down and change all the scene he said believe he says I will visit you believe here we are but sometimes and this is where it cuts a bit Jesus went into the temple just before that before this and when he got to the temple and they were selling doves and birdies and everything for sacrifice and they were so concentrated on the sacrifice that when the sacrificial lamb came they couldn't see him because they were more worried about the birds and the goats and all the things that had to be sacrificed when the Lamb of God comes in there they don't have the focus on him but they have the focus on the trading and he gets angry and he walks up and he throws these tables and he throws everything out and he says you made this a den of Thieves don't you know that this house my house is a House of Prayer so sometimes it's the same for us if you could think about it applicable and it and it goes there you're God's Temple you are the temple of God he says Heaven is my what heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol or where's the place of my rest where can I put my Holy Spirit within where can I dwell in commune with man you're the temple y so it's good to come into these four walls it's fantastic what do you do when we go out of these four walls where's God's Temple going someday I want him to say Well done my good and faithful servant and he will confess his sins but if I regard iniquity out go to Psalm 66 let's go there I'm going to go there and go there to um I think it was verse 17 I just going to do there he says but if I regard iniquity in my heart then God will not hear my prayer said David what is Iniquity and I'll have to read it there iniquity is something that you know that you're doing that you ought not to do wow but you still won't repent so boys and girls you know you're being naughty brothers and sisters you know you're not in the will of God you know you're being carnal you know you're being arrogant you know you have a a spirit that's pushing back God's spirit you know it God's been dealing with that so long already but you just don't want to get rid of that thing that's iniquity God will not hear your prayer it's it's true this is the prophet of God saying he cannot David said in verse 17 read it he says I cry unto him with my mouth and he was extoled so he cries so much unto the Lord that he's lifting him up he's saying Lord you know notice me okay and he says and with my tongue I lifted him up with my tongue I praised him I worshiped him I cried I did everything he says but I regarded iniquity in my heart and the Lord will not hear me so that regarded if you look at it it means to see to perceive to have a vision of iniquity to look at to regard it says to appear the presence on oneself to be seen or to be visible so iniquity is a very bad thing it cuts God's power of prayer away from your life and sometimes we feel look I'm that guy okay so if you like me or not I'm just going to say it anyways I'm that guy that I don't sugarcoat nothing because I have just come through the same trial brother Isaac where I had to stop and go Lord what's going on here and he goes you're looking at me let's start within here and you get back on your knees and you start getting in here again you say Lord meet me here because this is not making sense this is not making sense meet me in here and change me from here so that I can see your way yeah amen and it's because I had iniquity everybody has it everybody here has sin it's covered by the blood but no one here if you take a stone and the woman is felt before Jesus and CAU her in adultery he said to them he without sin cast the first stone so don't be P don't be big don't be somebody we all make mistakes is are you willing to repent of it are you willing to let that go so that you can go further in your walk with God are you willing because remember he wants to meet you in that prayer closet he wants to meet you he wants to come and and his presence dropped down in the room and and you just say Lord you're here and whatever you say I'll do and if you don't don't say anything I just want to stay here it's awesome times but it feels like you're hitting a brick wall every time you pray like this he says now think Church a church being built on that let the world creep in why certainly it Rose the indignation of a real true servant of God sure it's wrong let's get the thing out of there get away from this old lukewarm halfway little prayer in the morning and prayer at night come on get rid of it and go to bed and get up the next morning no wonder they are getting so worldly no wonder the world is creeping into church because we don't stay in prayer yeah so that doesn't mean stay on your knees the whole day guys we need to work but everywhere you go you talk to God you ask him counsel you know guys that install flaw they are like like there is magicians and astrologist in the Bible but they like the magician part of it you get there and they get to the end and they have to now all of a sudden make everything fit there at the end do you not think they pray before they do that or they walk onto a floor because it is you walk on the floor and they doing all these steps and the first thing they go oh Lord help me and they really mean because it's horrible to do them okay but it's it's it's Boulders you know everything goes according to plan hey Ben you know this this engineer gives you a blueprint and go there you go sister Margie off you go and you're like yeah okay I'll just 100 Year 200 years it's going to fit you gock and he just like you're like but oh dear now you start talking to God because see prayer is being in communion with God the whole day he says there that he prays seven times a day you ought to pray I'll get there he says we don't stay in prayer there is no no more um agonizing there is more no more staying before God there is no more digging out cleaning up we need to we need an oldfashioned Revival amen so prayer is not to get God to do what you want to do prayer is to empty yourself out before God and say search me every day yes you know like are we that prophetic yes we are because the thing is you know it's not your ability you know it's not your wisdom it's all gifts from God it's who you're going to exalt when you use them which kingdom do you represent when you do anything amen which kingdom prayer helps you to realize which kingdom you you fight for so everything has to to work together all the church has to pray remember the shin okay uh all the church has to pray and all the Ley has to pray and all the deacons and trustees and pastors and all together will come into the presence of God like that one great unit so guess what I need you just as much to pray for me as you need me to pray for you amen you know I when I was still in the world uh I only never forget it my brother and his girlfriend they were they were at our house and we had a all fallout cuz remember I I come out of the world so I can tell you these things M if we had a Fallout we had a great Fallout all the neighbors the neighbors neighbors everybody down the street knew the STS were we were we were raising our voices the Mom and Dad sorry it's part of the testimony but I wouldn't talk to my brother normal I would shout at him I would get my point the cross and this day we were fighting and we were having a real bad fight and it went into from the brothers to the mom and dad and the mom and dad they fought very heavily word said things done and she seen this and she stopped and she said you're a bunch of crazy people but I'll pray for you and I thought it was the biggest insult she ever gave me but now I think it was the biggest compliment she could ever give me see the thing is when I was was in the world my mom and dad prayed for me believing that one day I will come to the Lord I didn't care about the Lord I didn't want to serve him I didn't understand him Samson was a story everything in the Bible was just too many reading I just want to fall asleep it's boring that's how my was and a lot of you young people thinking that you're sitting here I know what you're thinking cuz I've been your age I've just recently turned 13 see the lovely thing that the lord gave me is I think like a child so when I'm with jonno I'm the same size as jono same speed not exactly the same strength but I got him okay when it's jonno ab and Reuben and mo then I'm in trouble okay so then I must just run faster than all of them but when I'm with children I think like children so when I come to church sometimes I see the boys and the girls and they're all squiggling and talking to each other leave them alone you you just commune with God because guess what you were also there and church was also boring because you didn't get the Revelation yet and you didn't understand all these things yet so sometimes it is boring but just keep entering in don't give up then amen something will come your way if you expect it to come your way hey Rebecca it's your birthday do you expect present on your birthday really so if it's about 10:00 at night nobody give you a present what do you start doing crying crying cuz I'm looking for a present and then she walks past the cupboard and under the door here and walk and everything cuz there's an expectation but if you come to church that way knowing that if you show up to church it's your birthday there's expectation for you something will come your way it could be one line that changes the whole walk one line yeah say remember to pray Apes but don't just go pray don't say a prayer brother brand said pray a prayer amen okay so here comes our story we're not when I'm watching the time so I'll just talk about Daniel we all still okay good so Daniel King Nebuchadnezzar he's got Babylon he comes and he's takes all the the fine young men to Babylon and the princes and we must know the story of Daniel so I'm not going to go into it but do King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream this dream bothers him very much okay and then he goes to his musicians and astr astrologist and the calans and all those guys gifts gifts they can prophesy you know there was there was uh Jeffers and Jus you know every time Moses did something they I don't know what you call them but they threw the snake down they could do everything that oh man I always get the names what's the names that's it okay so those two so everything Moses did they could copy but there was one thing missing with them God was not with them so everything they could copy they couldn't take away amen so yeah this this Nebuchadnezzar now he calls all these calans and the and the magicians astrologist Sorcerers and they all come before him and he goes you know what I know you guys you guys always interpret once I give you the dream you come and give me this wisdom I want the dream first so if you're so good and you have a special gift you'll give me the Dream I Dreamed and these guys go whoa King come on this is a hard saying man you know no we no other king is asking this he goes yeah but I am asking this and if you can't give it off with your head yeah man this king is angry but see the thing is this King knew this dream was bothering so much he needed that interpretation but he didn't want them to fake him because he wanted to know why is this dream bothering him so he got sincere he got serious with God but see he was looking to all his Pentecostal Brothers I I say that he was looking to all those other people outside which looks like Christians which are very devoted Christians but when it comes to the truth they don't have it yeah that's right and they cannot give it to you because God gives Revelation you send a prophet your way they cannot give you that truth they don't have it that's right it's withheld from them they live in a portion of Truth but they don't have the whole book open but you have it open amen that's why we had a prophet he came and opened the book and he said what God wants you walk on with God don't walk on with brother Brandon brother Brandon brought you into a a a a uniting with God and it's very important to feed off these things but he's actually telling you once you met the Lord Jesus Christ walk on with him cuz he went off the scene now it's you and God now you have the truth if you go and follow him in prayer So Daniel he's the only one that's got the truth if you could say he's the only message believer that knows where he's standing in Babylon do you know where you're standing in Babylon right now yes do you know that this age is engineered to be the final age there's a Rapture happening you're part of it do you actually know it because a lot of other people don't and they sincerely love God but they don't know where where they standing at this very present time and guess what they don't know where God is at this very present time they know the presence of God they know the gifts of God but they don't know God that's right and God ain't speaking to them he's not giving them Revelation he's not opening up all this Mysteries it's baptism fighting here and this fighting there and this dress coat and that this and they're all just fighting but there's no one that goes hey here is the truth you read it yourself that's what why we got the message guys it's to get you back on Solid Ground so you know where you're at so you can know where you're going if you don't know where you're going Marion and you're in the middle of the Bush and you have no Direction where will you end up lost no matter how much you look at the Sun and which way is North and which way is east if you don't know where you are in that big bush you cannot navigate out of it it's impossible impossible that there is my little brother SP praise the Lord so now Daniel is busy at home and he's sitting there at home and here comes uh what was that guy's name here uh let's go to Daniel 6 quickly who can give me his name come who's fastest finger Daniel 6 hold on there was a there was a young man of that Kingdom that came in there started with a a I just can't remember his name um oh no Daniel 6 is Darius we we going have to go to Daniel 2 sorry go back Daniel 2 Guys says give me that name it's the captain that came in and he wanted to I just feel I want to mention his name there's a bit of keeping you all awake as well as well as me here we go here we go arok thank you arok so arok comes in and he goes to the door CU you know when they kill people in their old days they wi Daniel are you here uh can you please come out we just want to chop over your head no Daniel was there maybe in prayer maybe talking to Cedric M abedo or or what was their real names um hananiah and and mishek and Azariah so they were busy having a chat and this guy comes door down yeah where's those wise men cut his head off and then he goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on hold on stop the Lorry hold on hold on hold on what's going on here he goes now King says all of you has to has to die now remember God gave him a gift which was wisdom the sermon he gave him dreams and Visions so so Daniel knows what he has so he says to the guy can you give me time says hold on I go to the king he goes to the king he says King I have no answer yet for you but I can get you the answer just give me time King goes you have time so remember Daniel wants to preserve life not just his own but just preserve life but the truth is with Daniel not with all those other people with Daniel all those I tell you if your life is in Jeopardy doesn't matter if you're astrologer a musician a sorcerer you praying cuz when the king says your head is coming off guess what your head is coming off so no matter where everybody was praying but one had the answer one had the visitation one that was in the current truth established in the Lord Jesus Christ and he walked and he says okay go goes to home opens the door goes hey you know uh what's their names give me their names hananiah Michelle and Azariah so boys come come closer I need you I need you to intreat and desire mercies of the god of Heaven concerning the secret so I need you Brothers to pray with me so we can push through this thing so God can give us the answer he didn't go oh I great Daniel is just going to go hey God you know just give me the answer and I'll sleep tonight I'll have it tomorrow he was so humble a great man goes to his friends and go Dave man I'm in trouble my business is in trouble my house is in trouble I've got things that's wrong in my life I need you to pray for me don't need to worry about the details but it's life and death pray for me when you go home tonight go on your knees pray for me what would happen if we all had that urgency towards each other am what will happen in this place CU we have to realize that sometimes you cannot pray through on your own you need your brothers and sisters to help you push through that thing yes amen but you have to become humble and get on your knees and be fully surrendered to admit defeat when you are being defeated y amen so he does they have oldfashioned prayer meeting next day Daniel walks in and he tells the God after Nebuchadnezzar he goes hey I got it there's your dream Nebuchadnezzar goes your God is the real God okay here comes Darius who knows King Darius he comes after Nebuchadnezzar now Nebuchadnezzar just got the revelation of who God is and true God and he's also he's tried um uh Cedric M and a Ben go in the in the the hot FY furnace and then he even go well your God is the real God as well because they're all the one living God but Darius comes in he doesn't know belar he doesn't know Daniel he has a dream and and and oh not he sorry he he goes and the guys don't like Daniel because Daniel is really cool at this work he's really good and now a new manager comes in I wonder if there's somebody here new manager comes in and all of a sudden this guy everything you've done for all your life is undone in a second and all of a sudden the people that used to be your friends is not your friends anymore see how the World Turns yes it's a Cutthroat world yeah that's right and all that Daniel has done always is now Under Fire and they go hey you he should pray to you King Darius you shouldn't pray to another God you're King make this decree and the King signs that decree and it is done now listen to this then Daniel was preferred above all the the the presidents and princes so he had statue he was preferred awesome guy okay everybody likes you then the king signed this thing now when Daniel knew that it was in writing when he knew the writing was signed he knew that it was done did it stop his prayer meeting with God no no so hey here's my challenge darus is sitting at work or at school right over you by your lunchbox he's looking at you we're not allowed to pray we're not allowed to do whatever Are you ashamed to pray for your food are we ashamed say hold on boys hold on hold on I'm just going to pray for my food you guys goes what does it matter what does it matter no food should be received without it without Thanksgiving for it for it is Sanctified by the word of God and prayer see if you eat it you say Lord Jesus you prepared the food for me now with faith and sanctification this of fa faith and sanctify this food for my strength and of my body so it's not about the food it's about saying thank you the Lord has Sanctified and has when you eating it you're not like the other princes in that Kingdom that took off the king's meat you're like Daniel that says this food I will rather eat this food the spiritual food not about the food it is about the thought behind the food Are you ashamed to pray in front of friends are you what should it matter but we want God to give us this big answers on these big things but we don't pray for food so don't worry I've cut now now we can start being nice he says you may love too uh too much you might talk too much like brother Arman but you can never pray too much amen and you Christians that don't say you that lukewarm condition no more lay everything just get close to God so close to God as you can walk with him talk with him let everything else be secondary your prayer life but your prayer life stay right with him all the time it's the number one thing to do is always pray yeah amen guess what I'm talking about prayer it comes another one get alone go sit on that bench remove yourself from your children you're a good mom you're a good dad take a break if they jump off the table or dining room table gravity socks they will take care of it later when they sleep get away get in your secret place get alone with God Amen get alone with your thoughts he says Get Alone you'll pray different prayer when you're by yourself then when you do when you're in public slip alone all of you go and just have a real secret meeting place where you and the Lord meet several times a day and pray I'm I'm encouraging you this is something that I haven't been doing and I've been reaping the the fruits of my not labor right and you you get so busy I'll give you a bit of a testimony you get so busy that you're spinning you don't know what's left or right and you think you're in the will of God but you're not because you didn't ask the will of God first you're just doing what you think he's leading you into you never stop to ask now and he's actually saying we're going right and you're like Ed I got it right he goes arand we're going right because it is because you're not in communion with him you don't listen to that voice saying don't do this don't don't go there go this way and you really think you're in the will of God but your whole circumstances says you're not the whole Christian Life shouldn't be torture and turmoil it shouldn't be hard it shouldn't be difficult difficult there will be tries and stuff but there must be Joy there must be a mountain experience we grow in The Valleys but we do get to experience mountains and if you're in the valley the whole time you're not listening and praying to God cuz he doesn't want to leave you down there he wants to bring you up into his presence you just need to take the time amen I hope that encourages you you know there is something about getting alone yourself many people never pray until they come to church many people think that it's the only place to pray is church it's not he says but the Bible says for men to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands well I've been in the tall shop once and I've just fell in love with the Lord Jesus and we're just having a jubile remember those days yes man I was so I still in love with the Lord don't get me wrong but it's honeymoon days honeymoon days are different honeymoon days you're like walking on eggshells you know like everything is different there's a bird flying to a a a a window and you're like oh the poor bird now was dumb bird because it's like it's different because you get hard and callous because you get used to it there's no sensitivity but man still there and and I'm one day I'm listening to a sermon and I've got the hit on and I'm listening to a seron I put it down and I'm just so happy and I walk through the shop and I put all the tiles around I just go man just stuff it yes Lord I love you so much and I look around and there's a guy standing I go oh well but it was so much and I drive home and I listen to the song I say Amen you know I say Amen you know and I'm sitting in the in that little green car and the green car is going from side to side and everybody else's music isof my windows are open all the years I say Amen look at me in the eyes I say amen I didn't care amen I was in love my hands was in the air but it was the most wonderful time I was still paid only this much oh boy but I was happy amen I was in contact with God and you know prayer line will come through and there will something be on the prayer line it was such an urgency I'll get my phone and I'll go click I don't have the smart watch yet and I'll I'll go quickly and and you get breaks now and again and I go on the phone I see a WhatsApp oh there's a WhatsApp and it's brothers sisters this one needs praying I look yep now we don't have anybody in the place so I go and I go under by the stairs I just going to kneel down right there by the stairs and so because it's close to the door where they come in and I just kneel cuz you want to hear the sliding door go you know okay there's someone there I go oh Lord be with this one and praise him and there's a restaurant right above me I don't care I'm praying now we're praying and Lord and and just be with him and strengthen door goes say hold on Lord I'll be back now and I'll go and I go help the customer and I'll go back there and I'll go pray again and I just wanted to pray through so that one can be saved or helped or father or mother there was such an urgency for him and things happened things happened I could see the the very sincerity of my heart I could see God just using all those prayers to bring all those things to pass there was times when we were praying for people man almost dying and they just make a turn and I know that was me I know I had I had something to do to put a span you know when a guy rides with a bicycle really fast and you take and that's the Devil he's riding that bicycle really fast and you take a stick and just go in the front wheel and goes gone that's me as much as I can stick a a fork in his his speaker and was spoke I don't know what you call it and get him to fly in full face first on the earth I'll do it and if that was my prayer so be it amen but I had something to do with the devil's demise amen cuz he's my enemy and I hate him amen we're almost closing here we go now you with children okay parents this is a parents moment who's got children who loves them with all your heart pray for them it's the best thing you can do don't worry about their situation don't worry about their salvation don't worry about where they at just pray for them I'm a living testimony that prayer works it doesn't mean you have to be in the perfect place to pray for them it doesn't mean you have to be a Godly saint that never sins it says and does anything wrong it's not your performance it's your prayer no matter how deep you are in the muck and the my cray you pray for them if you know God and don't know God still pray for them pray pray pray if you have the same Faith to believe for your salvation pray for the Salvation of your children that's right don't stop praying I didn't know the Lord I came to the Lord 32 years old praise the Lord some was just very slow okay I was very slow how slow leer but my mom and dad never ceased praying for me ever were they in the message no they prayed a sincere and honest prayer of a fervent righteous man they prayed they prayed they prayed that they see the results straight away nope did they think they were ever going to see the results yes because they believed so when you mothers and sisters and daughters and and even Brothers pray pray believing and expected it might not come now it's coming amen I want you to realize it's coming yes you can train a child so much you can scorn them so much you can fight with them so much you can push them away with your mortal thinking and deeds and reactions so much until you give up and let God take over cuz there can't be any of you there you can train them but when the training stops it's them and God they cannot be you in that relationship that's right amen when they hit 13 age of accountability them and God yes it's not looking like God's talking don't worry you talk to God Amen it's not you is him and God because the moment you hand your child over to God the moment you place him in the hands of the Living God Sovereign God that cannot fail they're coming because now the great Creator stepped on the scene he's just saying Hey sister brother not your time Not Your Divine appointment my Divine appointment and guess what I ain't never late am and I've never lost a battle Hallelujah so believe and he says here but prayer cast evil devil away from a child that's right prayer does it if Little Martha starts stomping a little foot and running out and turning up her little nose and you can beat her until she has no clothes on it's very hard but he's meaning this you can be as angry as you want as a parent he says she'll do it anyhow Bo Fallen nature we still do it my dad says don't go there I'll go yep yep yep yep going there because it was still my choice it's still the child's choice you cannot make your you can't live your Christianity through your child yeah you have to give them to God he says here but you just lay before God and claim that child's soul for God just stay right with it I believe it's the best thing to know yes sir that is the remedy I know is prayer or the best remedy and then he says here if you can believe for yourself you can believe for your house also so your wife your husband your brother your sister your cousin twice removed four time reinstated anyone that is under your umbrella that you cover and prayer God's got you see we don't we don't realize and I'm closing with this musicians you can maybe come up and just come start playing a song for us please brother Isaac I'm not talking about you doing the work I'm talking about you covering them with prayer honest sincere prayer lifting up in the presence of God and see what God will do for you you cuz we forget that God cannot fail God cannot make a promise in the Bible here and not keep it he's not a liar amen 32 years man my mom prayed for me for 32 years she's still praying for me today don't worry he's got it under control but learn when to take the foot off the acceleration and sometimes to get out of the car so that they can experience driving as well you know I I I was the worst trainer of anybody in the car I tried to train someone one day to drive a car I just don't have enough patience almost end up crashing into another car cuz I just got too frustrated and I realized quickly I'm not that guy so if you ever want driving lessons Ruben sorry Mom has to teach you I can't but I realized what was my weakness I realized that when I got in the way of God's work I failed every time every time Prayer Changes Things prayer changes death to life prayer changes sickness to health he changes Sinners to Saints amen amen want to read you another one I believe that Prayer Changes Things I've seen death driven back by prayer and life takes its place go God gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon in the world and that the world is ever known is prayer and what produces faith is prayer prayer of faith shall save the sick so if you don't have faith pray if you want to add to your faith pray amen if you don't think you're going to ever get ill pray don't stop praying pray he says there is no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen that's right there is no greater force upon this Earth man could ever make but prayer is there that's right prayer ain't giving you the answers prayer is putting you in his presence answers will come he said brother brandom said God has never not given me an answer and he's never not answered pray prayer it wasn't always the answer I was looking for he still answered it amen let us all just stand up there quickly amen you young couples that want to get married and all those things I'll give you a couple of ones while we at there a man nowadays get married you young fellows you better pray a long time all the moms are saying amen ask God to give you a companion a young woman on the same way course this time is so uncertain amen a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife and when he chooses your wife or your husband if we were study it over a man should pray earnestly for you could ruin your entire life remember the bow until death do us part if the woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband that's your own fault she didn't pray so you shouldn't do anything until you prayed it through thoroughly through talking to your young men young sisters we didn't cover that but I thought I just fa to to read a little bit of that ministers ministers ought to always be alone by himself even before he preaches even before he prays even before he does anything he needs to get alone with God first humble us Lord yes if you want to be a perfect mute where's that one microphone give me the microphone this microphone has no will of its own it's just a receiver for the mouthpiece of God you want to hear from God be a microphone ain't special nothing special about about this no matter how many effects we put on there just be surrendered and let God speak through you just think about a microphone it's not working cuz it's not switched on but boy when you get in the presence of Lord and we're having old fashioned prayer meeting and the Lord comes down you'll see tongues and interpretation you see God manifesting himself because he's looking for this a surrendered vessel Amen Let Us bow our heads if there's anybody that needs prayer tonight or today close your eyes lift up your hands to him and let's just all pray together I will start us off and you take over you pray to God and you ask him to give you time back and to open up everything all the Joys from heaven and everything that is holding your back just to get that out of your way so you can enter into his presence oh gracious Heavenly Father I've got both my hands up I know I need to pray Lord I know I can pray so much more Lord I know that there is a time lord where weeks go by and I don't even get time to go on my knees father and I think what is wrong and why am I failing and and why can't I get through this battle Lord but oh Father forgive us our iniquities Lord as David said we do not want to regard our iniquities Lord we want it away from us Lord we don't want you to see it we want you to cover it with the blood of the Lamb the shed blood Lord take it away reveal to us the hinderous that's hindering our prayers touching the Hem of your garment Lord if we need Faith give us faith if we need strength and wisdom give us strength and wisdom if we need aone time with you give us aone time lord lord move heavens and earth to get us back on our knees father Lord so that we'll know the power of prayer is real lord and we can call the kingsman Redeemer like brother Isaac preached to to come forth

Christ now we all raise our hands and you can pray now too say Lord Jesus please restore my prayer life Lord Lord please teach me the importance of prayer Lord Lord give me a eyes to see and ears to

experienced it Lord in their lives may that happen in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord may they go upon their knees and just wait and yield and say Lord Jesus please come please come now and fill me up Lord Jesus Oh Lord and may your presence come in that room May doubt and fear and frustations go away in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord May the captives be set free right there Lord

them to cut time of the things of this world to set aside a time a special time a day just to go and seek your face father I pray that you would work on their conscience Lord this world has seared their conscience so much I pray that you will anoint these young people Lord to be those Overcomers that don't look at the vices that don't look at the obvious father but seeking your face in prayer consistently just remember we reap what we sow Lord and we know you're a fear God we ask that we will seow now the words of eternal life in our life the overcoming words the confessions Lord the the
