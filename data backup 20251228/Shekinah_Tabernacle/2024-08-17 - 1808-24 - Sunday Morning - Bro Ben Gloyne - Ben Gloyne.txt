sleep or something can you drive so and tangy I SW and I just started writing some notes down and had to sleep and things and um yeah I put my slideshow on the wrong pal on the wrong presentation but here we are so anyway we're here so um God bless you anyway Luke 4 and6 and uh we're just going to read here down to down to verse 22 here and this is uh the Lord coming to Nazareth uh Nazareth he says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind to sit at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son amen Let's uh let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you have a need just want to raise your hand up to the Lord say Lord Remember Me Do not pass me by amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father truly you're all together wonderful to us Lord thank you you are the light of the world Lord and thank you we lord can come to you and have come to you Lord that we would receive the light of life we praise your Holy Name Lord as we bow our heads in your presence and we thank you for another opportunity to gather Lord in your wonderful all powerful name and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because you said If We Gather in Your Name Lord you'll be there in the midst so father I pray as we have gathered I pray you would touch each life may have your way Lord we need you to come and take over the service so Lord I surrender all that I am into your hands Lord may have preeminence in our midst Lord may you be glorified and father may take your word that we read and may you the great author of the book step forth step forth now and and make it live For Your Glory we love you we thank you Lord we pray you'd be with those who are not here today as well be their abundant portion for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning uh so I want to uh if I could take a bit of a title and you know I probably get in trouble doing these kind of titles I never get to it all but I want to say fulfill your scripture analyze the lamb and take your moment so I'm going to try and get through those things amen so it was a must have been an incredible moment when when the word made flesh opened the written word and identified himself in the scripture must have been an incredible moment we read here that he when he was given to him the book of the um Isaiah he found the place where it was written so he wasn't just finding he wasn't just finding a scripture that was a nice thing to quote but he was identifying the word made flesh was identif if in himself in the written word and he was saying this day is the scripture fulfilled so Jesus knew the scriptures he had come to fulfill right he wasn't he wasn't a stab in the- dark Fly by Night kind of a guy he knew exactly the reason he was upon the earth now we know because of his birth he was born without sin he bypassed the original sin so when he was born he knew who he was he was not born with spiritual Amnesia he never came to a time in his life where where where he realized who he was but he knew who he was when he was the age of 12 and you know his um his uh foster parents or however you want to say it Mary and Joseph they took him to Jerusalem for the feast and you know they they they after the feast they uh went back to Nazareth and they were traveling three days they realized Jesus was not with them and they went back to Jerusalem and you'd think that a 12year old boy or 10 sorry I can't remember the age exactly but you can go read it in the scripture You' think a 12-year-old boy or that kind of age wouldn't be in the wouldn't be in the temple discussing the Bible he'd be looking at the maybe the Roman soldiers and the garrisons I'm just thinking what I would be looking at you know all the all the big fortifications maybe the tomb of David I don't know you'd be looking at those kind of things but he was he was they found him in the temple disc discussing the word with the priest and Mary uh Mary spoke against her own testimony and said you know your father and I have sought you with tears and Jesus said don't you know I must be about my father's business so even as a little boy he knew the purpose that he came to the Earth for now we must fulfill our scripture amen we got scripture to fulfill now and it's not about whether what we think about what everyone else is doing it's what we do that matters amen as as Jesus on the day well after he arose and Peter would ask him the great question about the he said Peter then turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus love following which also leaned on uh his breast at supper and said Lord what will he that uh which is he that betrayeth the so even know was Judas and then Peter um seeing him saith to Jesus Lord what shall this man do isn't this human isn't this human nature what's that person doing why is this person doing this why is this person doing that why is this person doing this thing but what about you what because we're all going to fulfill scripture the world's fulfilling scripture I don't want to fulfill their scripture I want to fulfill the bride's portion of the scripture so but everyone's oh what about this person this hypocrite this person did this this person did that this person but what about you and I that's why Jesus said to him said what if it will uh what he saith unto him if I will that he tar till I come what is it to thee so if it's my will that he fulfills what you think he's going to fulfill what is it to you just follow me amen so I think that should be our our hearts cry or our Drive of our life is if everyone else does whatever they do I'm going to fulfill the scripture I'm going to let God in my life fulfill his word amen if there's one person on the earth that God's going to fulfill his word it's going to be me amen irrespective of what you all do what everyone else does I'm going to follow I'm going to follow the lord he said come follow me so here I am I'm following you Lord I'm I'm following your revealed word of the day amen so so so Jesus knew who he was in the scripture and I believe it behooves us that we identify we allow the Holy Ghost himself the author of the word to identify our lives in the scripture amen that that that we can see the prophecy we're ordained to fulfill because we know that Jesus fulfilled a lot of Prophecy and it wasn't by accident he fulfilled it it was with purpose it was deliberate amen he knew exactly what he needed to fulfill and he surrendered his life to the prophecy that he had to fulfill and I believe we must do the same thing amen because when we can see ourselves in the scripture then that gives us power when God reveals to us who we are in the scripture we can fulfill it amen so let's not be caught up in what everyone else wants to do let's be caught up in what God wants fulfilled as the portion of the Bride amen so now Moses would Moses when he was born we know his his parents it was revealed to them by faith that he was going to be the deliverer so it was it was the Jews all knew that the deliverer was going to come they knew the prophecy given to Abraham that the that the children of Israel would be in Egypt 400 years they'd be afflicted they'd be slaves but they'd come out with a mighty hand right so so the whole Jewish nation was under a burden of the economics and the situation they are in like this whole world is under a burden this world's Fallen apart the prophet said it you can't stop it just walk with God okay we can't stop it we can't reverse it when that when that word was released when he was preaching sermons like the world again is falling apart he wasn't just saying things you know just for the sake of it it was an announcement this is where you're going to walk into and us that weren't alive in that era we were born in a world that's Fallen part that's why it's amazing you think we've got so much good technology the world is so connected but yet everything doesn't work doesn't make sense you know back in the days of pen and paper things seemed to work a lot smoother than today how long do we have to wait for a gp's visit now yet we have all this technology you know all this ability our hospitals are falling apart but yet we have all this better medicine all these things why because God inspired a prophet to say the world has fallen apart right so we shouldn't be be shocked to see this world is falling apart amen but but but we should should be thankful when the world is falling apart God is calling a bride amen he's putting a people upon the Earth that are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is him the prophet said amen says a people made in His image amen so if the word there if the if if the bridegroom could identify himself in the word the bride sure should be able to as well by the same inspiration am mean so so we know Moses's um you know Moses's the Israelites they were all slaves in Egypt so the whole Israelite race you could say was under that oppression but but there was amram and joab bed you brother BR would dramatize it you know you know amram would come back from the fields he was beaten he was a slave like anyone else but he'd go up on his house stop and begin to pray because he knew there was scripture that had to be fulfilled I mean he knew that there' had to come a deliverer and the time was approaching for that deliver to come upon the scene and you know joab would you know said to her husband amram said you know you don't have to pray today just come get some rest you're so exhausted you're so tired but he said but what if no one else is praying about him I want to see I want to fulfill my scripture amen I want to fulfill prophecy and we're being placed as the Covenant Sons and Daughters of Abraham amen that God will fulfill scripture in our lives so it might as well be through US joed amen and then they had the son many other families had Sons but by faith by Revelation they realized this is the one this is the one and they H him for 3 months and they but they came to a place just like anything with God you got to give it to him you got to give it to him amen like he says Jesus says in the Bible he that keeps his life shall lose it but he that loses his life shall keep it what does that mean if you lose your life if you give it to the Lord you'll keep it in the end but if you keep your life and your ideas and what you want to do and your own idea and your plans and your things you you'll lose your life at the end that's right all the plans and schemes of man will come to ashes and and just disgrace and destruction I'd rather walk with God amen amen so they put him in that boat they put him in that little Ark that they made and you know brother BR would say that there was you know God told Gabriel to stand on the top of that boat am mean any Alligators come along here just you just push them on the nose and push them away from that away from that little Ark and you know there are angels lying down the river bank and your God allowed that Ark to get into into some WP pools right but he knew it was had to get to Pharaoh's house it had to get to Pharaoh's daughter because God had ordained that the that that that God was going to use Egypt to raise up a deliverer to destroy Egypt hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I friends we may be raised up in Satan's Eden but God raises up in Satan's Eden to tear down Satan's Eden hallelujah amen so you may get through some whps in life maybe some sticky situations but you got to realize your destination is secure I mean cuz you're not driving the ark God's directing the ark Hallelujah so there Moses was directed There why cuz because his parents wanted the scripture to be fulfilled in their house in their life not just in Israel in their life and it should be the same thing with you and I yes God's going to have a bride don't just put it on some dispensational level around the world which it is but hey say Lord here I am mold me into the image of your word Lord change me mold me that when you see me you see you hallelujah amen hey we got scripture to fulfill friends it's exciting because when you realize this scripture to fulfill then you say Lord I cannot do it Lord you're going to have to get a hold of me you're going to have to change my life Moses thought he could fulfill his scripture because remember when Abraham was told by God you know the prophecy of they're going to be in the land for 100 years all those things God did not say to Abraham that Moses would be the deliverer but when God spoke it to Abraham God knew who was going to be the deliverer right so there's Prophecy in the Bible you say well John the Baptist name was never mentioned but when God said I'll send a message before my face he knew it was John amen you know he knew those things the disciples and the bride of Christ that God prophesied of there' be a people that God will call from the Gentiles for his name sake he had you on his mind when he spoke those things hallelujah amen so just because someone's name's not in the Bible doesn't mean they're not part of the prophecy no you just find yourself lining up with the word god gets a hold of your life amen you just find yourself living it out glory to God what and you begin to realize I've been prophesied of I've been spoken I'd come here and I've been spoken of that I'd arriv I mean when God when brother Braham showed God the preview of the Bride marching up into Glory he saw me I believe that and I'm not marching I'm not being led by a witch going down I'm going up AR raid in his righteousness fine L and clean and white the rushes of saints Made In His Image marching to the step of the Gospel I mean some of us maybe begin to look at the worldly church and get distracted I say stay in line amen the the Christianity of this world will take you down this message will take you up am mean I want to go up I don't want to go down amen I want to ascend in glory amen walk with God know the power of God know the reality of his word Christianity this world could not give that to you but the author of the book amen the mighty Angel himself can give it to you amen so I think just stay in line with this word you'll see it manifest itself hallelujah hallelujah amen like sister Louis suang the song you know God remind me of where I came from I came from a very dark place incredibly dark place of a lost drunk University student doing my own thing floating with the world very dark place but God found me through the message in the Bible didn't even know a church was anywhere God found me God found me I don't want to go back to that place I don't want to be back in that unbelief and that darkness and that chaos and that depression I don't want to go there I want to keep going forward with the Lord but but the reason that we remember those things is because God wants us to stay thankful amen what's the point of doing something for someone and they forget what you've done amen he want he doesn't let us remember those things that we stay in guilt and condemnation no the blood takes care of that but he he allows us to remember those things that we say thank you Lord I'm not that person thank you Lord I become one with you I'm ascending hallelujah hallelujah so I I you I'm so thankful that we don't have to stay in slavery that there's a word for us to fulfill yeah it's very important that we we fulfill our scripture and not what the devil says we are it's very important that because the devil wants an image that he wants to mold you into this world is you know what is this world is a great advertisement the devil's by saying become like me he's got many different things he wants to mold you into but he's saying become like me that's why social media is so prevalent that's why there's such a strong you know anointing but but God rich in Mercy amen but God remember when the enemy comes in like a flood amen God says I'll raise up a standard amen he'll make the promises more real he'll make his anointing more prevalent among us because like brother Braham said God's been here the whole time he's been here the whole time he hasn't left he's been here the whole time but brother brah said his ministry was to declare that he is here amen that the word himself is here upon the Earth and what happens when we read the word we're spiritual blindness we can't see we think Jesus what some story somewhere 2,000 years ago and some tradition that man is used to just control people or something but then when he steps out of the portal of History to us when he steps out of History because we read his word we see he's a present tense God he's been here the whole time just like brother tazwell said a a a revelation is an unveiling it's an unveiling of what's already present right so in Moses was the deliverer but he was hiled up by tradition he was wearing a traditional jacket of I can do it I can do it why cuz he was trained he was trained he was a prince of Egypt he was a he was a God he was a god walking in flesh see the devil will make you something the perverted way of what you meant to be the perverted way of what you meant to be so so Egypt would mold him a certain way you're a God in flesh Moses cuz you're a prince of Egypt but God was saying no no I've got to take this jacket of self-ability off he tried to use that jacket it just made him end up killing one Egyptian and running for his life amen but but but through 40 Years of the Wilderness now it doesn't have to take 40 years to get the jacket off right it can just take a moment but God had to get him ready by high tempered wife in a backside of the desert and trouble and things and God allowed those things to happen to get this jacket off of Moses and finally he came to a place where he came to the burning bush and God began to speak to him that's right and he realized the jacket he was we wearing of self-ability he really saw it for what it was cuz before he thought yep I'm trained I know I know how to fight I can train men I can lead men I can do all these things I can you know I've got a personer I can project my voice I can speak I've got Authority that was him in Egypt killed one man 40 years later down in the wilderness he came to a place said what what a waste of time what a useless waste of space he thought he was but God had to get him there see from to realize his ability actually was useless and and but but he still tried to hide behind his ability I can't speak no one will hear me no one will believe me how do I know all these things you know so he was but God basically said take off your jacket of your self ability take it off and put on my anointed robe put on my anointed robe Moses put on who you're really meant to be I need you to take off the jacket Moses to unveil what's already within you Hallelujah and then what do a what was he an 80y old man one man Invasion went down into Egypt I know I've said it many times before but he was but now he was in position to fulfill his scripture I mean cuz it wasn't him that brought the plagues it was God in him that brought the plagues I mean it wasn't him that opened the Red Sea it was God in him that opened the Red Sea right he was walking in harmony with his scripture that he was meant to fulfill hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God you see Hallelujah God Called Moses right God called you amen God Called Moses god called you the same Pillar of Fire that called Moses called you amen you may not be here to to deliver like Moses did but you're here to fulfill your word hallelujah you're here to fulfill the scripture amen we're not here just to occupy space now you see now now others others would be part of that prophecy they didn't even realize it Joshua and Caleb were slaves too but they but because of Revelation they begin to realize Moses has his part of the scripture I have my part of the scripture amen so just as Moses has his part I have my part the other children of Israel didn't realize they were fulfilling their scripture they begin to complain they begin to look at the sand and the situation and the trouble because they did not have a revelation I'm fulfilling scripture maybe they could say yes God sent a prophet he did but they didn't see their part of that scripture they did not see their part in that part see when you can see your part in the scripture like you can see oh it's easy to see brother braham's part but what about your part behold I send you Malachi for who's the eye God who's you me it's easy to see the Malachi 4 part of brother BR but what about you in that scripture hallelujah what to do to turn your hearts back to the original faith of the fathers amen amen hallelujah I feel I feel like 10t tall right now amen why because this is you got to realize friends it it wasn't you wanting to fulfill scripture just in your own desire you didn't choose you you did not decide one day I'm going to be a believer I'm going to walk with God I'm going to take a Rapture I'm going to be molded in his In His Image I'm going to fulfill prophecy no God said you you I'm going to find you doesn't matter where I find you I'm going to call you out I'm going to make you in my image I'm going to reveal myself to you amen and you are going fulfill scripture because of what I have done in your life Hallelujah so we've got scripture to fulfill let's just jump into a couple of these then we'll go into the other maybe part let's just read this here this is one of my I know it's one of Christine's favorite uh quotes but I like it too this is from the message he swore by himself he says Jesus Christ no matter what if he is in a storm in a gale and uh and the gal's knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm as quiet he as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right am mean whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh have I prayed through I wonder if I fasted enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he knowed what he what his life was to fulfill them that's right he knew his life was to F fulfill the scripture and you're here to fulfill it too amen amen just walk unconscious of fear see we've got to we've got to come to a place and I believe I'm looking at people who have already come to this place God is more than able to do anything we have judged him faithful that he will fulfill his word amen we're not doubting whether he can do it or not we know he can do it amen he has proved himself over and over and over again amen he's a god of his word I can trust him in the good times I can trust him in the bad times I can trust him in the uneasy times and when everything seems foggy and things he's my shepher he's going to see me through amen I don't doubt his ability I don't doubt his word he's more than able to fulfill it amen so we're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious under the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church chur walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God I mean if the neighbor doesn't like you walk with God just keep walking right on with God Enoch one day walked like that amen you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor says you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world he took an oath by by the Covenant that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with God then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you'll go over through Bri patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs down over hillsides up through the mountains over Waters just walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little they'll seem when you get to the end of the way my my just look at them all that's been looked back at your Footprints won't be very much just walk with God I trust you're walking with God more than you're walking with the church am mean because if the church fails you still walk with God Amen I trust it's your your relationship is not based on this church it's based on the word he and you together you two in the boat amen walking together amen Jesus knew for this cause to be the Lamb of God he'd come into the world he knew it amen he'd say to pilate for this cause I was born Amen to this end was born and for this cause have I come into the world he knew his purpose he knew the scriptures he had to fulfill and he had perfect Faith because he understood his position I'm just jumping through a few things but I just want you I'm not so yeah I just want to throw these things out there okay brother Braham said the reason Jesus had perfect Faith now I'll just read this now remember they had the word the word was flesh then and the word told them I'll give you power amen I give you power and they had power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had the faith that he that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you speaking of the boy that you know that had the epileptic spirit that the disciples couldn't cast out he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself this is how he did it it's not because he said he remembered everything no I have no power I can do nothing in myself but he says but the father shows me right why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing what he was in the was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this right what does the message see see this message is an identification message it's a placing message just like when just like when Israel came out of Egypt and they were coming up to the promised land God told through Moses and Joshua ab's portion is here you leave it there Ammon is here leave them you know all these different nations that's their allotment that's their inheritance don't fuss with them just just keep walking past them right your inheritance is in the promised land then the borders are all defined you know all where the tribes would go that was all defined by Joshua and Moses so so you know um Esau's uh uh descendants they had their position Moab or whatever your Lots you all those things you know and brother said they like borderline you know the worldly Church they've got their place but that's not your place right so everyone's position in this day has been identified like Moses and Joshua identified them so God God came came in this day spoke through brother R said this is the bride's portion the fullish Virgin portion is not the same as the bride's portion the church's portion is not the same as the bride's portion this is the world's portion and the devil's got the Lake of Fire I just wanted to say that cuz I like saying it that's his inheritance that's not my inheritance I me my inheritance as streets of gold amen so so he so he allocated God through him said this is your lot this is your lot this is your lot don't fuss with them just keep walking with me amen right so this message now identifies identifies our position and it identifies who we are in the scripture right so you've got to realize brother I'm said that the bridegroom call will come right through this message right it's a call to a union right to become one with Christ so now this message has gripped your life right the voice behind the voice has gripped your life and he has changed you from a child of Darkness to the Child of the Light he's transformed you he's changed you you see his word being fulfilled in your life and all you want to do is live according to his word because you love him what's happened God is showing you your position am mean because if there's something in you says Lord I Want To Live according to your word what is that your the real you is in harmony with the word it's not in harmony with the church it's not in harmony with a bible school it's not in harmony with a nice idea it's in harmony with the word himself just like a husband and a wife are What In Harmony as one amen so the Lord is showing you your position he's showing you what the scripture says you are can can we not have perfect Faith then can we not have perfect faith that God has shown us who we are you know than I love it service after service message after message amen if I hear Brother BR preach on the mark of the beast I say that's not I know that's not my inheritance when I hear something about the tribulation well I'm not going there that's not my allotment God's called me to a Rapture amen if he you know he speaks of the bride of Christ something in me says that's me well did you make yourself something no he called me this is my inheritance I'm just going to enjoy it if you ain't going to enjoy it with me well you should you know we should be happy about this but this should give us as Jesus could identify himself in the word then that then then then we should be able to by the same anointing identify our own self in the word that's why I say never let the devil tell you who you are he's lying to you he'll always tell you you're defeated you're depressed you'll never make it you don't have enough faith you'll never obtain any promises it's never going to be for you he always does he not maybe he just says those things to me how do you you know no he tells us those things he's trying to say this is your inheritance but then God comes along in his word says no don't listen to that voice listen to my voice amen I want to tell you who you are that you can walk in perfect Faith amen that you can fulfill your scriptures now the Apostle Paul was on a journey to Rome he had received a scripture that he would testify in Rome also right the Lord came to him and said you're going to testify in Rome okay he knew he was there to fulfill that scripture right so because it was a revelation to him he knew nothing could stop him testifying in Rome that's right right and we know the journey for him wasn't easy to Rome he was Shipwrecked he was first in a storm for 14 days but he was praying and he said you know he came out on the deck he said he said Brethren let's have something to eat you know be of good cheer the angel of the Lord who I am who I am and who I serve stood with me this night said don't worry Paul no one's going to lose their lives only the ship is going to be lost why because God had given him the scripture you're going to Rome so when trouble strikes your life you got to say Lord you've given me a scripture I'm going in a body change Hallelujah you've given me a scripture that I'm possessing all things that every promise is mine amen and let your life be governed by that and not by what your five senses tell you I mean whatever trouble struck because he was in a real storm okay there was no Coast Guard there was no way to call an SOS and someone come get them they're in a real storm okay it was really quite bad okay but God said you're going to Rome so what did he he went to a source of strength to say Lord you you you've revealed to me this scripture is mine but this trouble's come in Lord he didn't look at the trouble he looked at his source of strength and this I'm going to come into now you got to analyze your lamb because this is what the Apostle Paul did he didn't analyze the storm he didn't analyze the trouble he just he he analyzed his lamb so he wasn't a weather expert on the boat trying to say this is how many knots this is this is this oh here comes this gust and here comes this Sall and here comes this and how big are the waves and you know he didn't he didn't analyze that or the size of the boat and how well it could handle the storm he didn't analyze those things he analyzed the one that gave him the promis amen he gave him the one that said you're going to be a witness in Rome and he judged him faithful isn't our God Faithful amen he's faith and true amen so he judged him faithful so everything else actually went wasn't even background noise because God said you're going to Rome and then finally he makes it on the um on the island he's picking up uh firewood and he goes to you picks up some firew that this deadly snake bites him you know and and what does he do he just shakes it off in the fire because remember he knows he's here to fulfill scripture I mean he may be bitten by something but that thing's not going to paralyze him that thing's not going to kill him why because the Revelation in his heart is greater than the snake bite and we can be bitten by many things right there be malice Strife Double mindness Trouble depression Strife you uneasiness maybe maybe economic problems whatever those things can bite you unexpectedly right but you just got to shake it off in the fire of God's word I said no no this thing ain't going to kill me I'm I'm going to go to Rome I put it in Paul's word no I've got a scripture to fulfill God has revealed to me amen I think we can do that can't you I mean there came a point in your Christian walk where you decided nothing's going to stop youj I trust you've come to that moment right Caleb and Joshua were in that same same thing the desert didn't stop them the deser did did not cause them to be an unbeliever amen amen because they they knew they part of the prophecy of Moses we're going into the promised land right so you got to come to that place in your Christian walk no matter what comes against you I I ain't quitting I'm not leaving this walk I'm following Jesus all the way amen and so the Apostle Paul had this had the same kind of fire burning in his heart why because he judged he judged he judged his lamb pure faithful right Honest true able strong amen more than able to do it more than able to lead him he judg he analyzed his lamb when was the last time you ever analyzed have you have you ever analyzed your lamb we have a perfect lamb Hallelujah perfect pilot would stand there after just a few moments of conversation say I find no fault in this man just a few moments of conversation with the word he said I find no fault in this man Jesus didn't do a whole lot didn't do any miracles to him didn't say a lot he says I find no fault in this man how long have we been examining the lamb right how long have you been examining the word but yet not come to a place where you say this is a I find no fault in this word it said what he promised he do he can do right see that's the problem is many times people are between two opinions because they think the other opinion is a good idea just like you get two job offers if one if both are basically the same it can be a struggle which one will you take you see Merit in both if one's amazing one's terrible well you know which one you're going to take right but the devil wants us to think that his offer has something good in it yeah that's right he wants us to think that this world of being popular and getting all the girls or whatever you know all this being cool and all this stuff it has it has something good but there's but there's this hook he wants to grab you with it right but the problem is people actually be raised in church and they don't give their lives to La completely because they're thinking the devil's offer has some point to it but if you realize he's only here to kill ruin and destroy you you'd say no no I want no part of that amen you say well I've never had an angel come I've never had an angel come and speak to me like the Apostle Paul say how can I have how can I have such a such a faith like he did well Jesus would say to Thomas Thomas wanted some evidence God gave it to him but but Jesus would say blessed are they that have not seen yet have believed amen you're blessed people want evidence well you but if if you're a believer that just believes it without anything you're blessed I need proof should we have another testimony meeting you want proof how much proof do you need our God lives right but but the Lord said that you know blessed are they that that have not seen yet have believed because an angel has come and spoken to you in this day amen but you see the thing is when we speak about fulfilling our scripture in reality it's everyday Christian Life everyday everyone loves to Rejoice about yes the bride and we're going in the Rapture and all that you must prophesy again Revelations you know 10:8 to11 all these things but it comes down to Everyday Christian Life that's right right it comes down to Everyday Christian character as as uh the Apostle Paul would write to Titus I'm just going to you can read this with me I think it's the whole chapter but speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine now this is this is fulfill your scripture right cuz fulfill your scripture is an everyday Christian Living right that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound and faith and charity and patience if you're an aged man you say Lord I want to fulfill that scripture amen the age women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young woman to be sober to love their husbands to love their children fulfill your scripture am mean to be discreet chasee keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed young men likewise exalt to be sober minded and uh sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works and Doctrine showing uncorrupted gravity sincerity amen sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you exalt servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not pining which in other translations I put there says not to take that which is not taking what is not theirs it means embezzlement different things as as well but showing all good Fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things amen fulfill your scripture for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us denying ungodliness and worldly lust that we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and Purity unto himself a particular particular people zealous of good works these things speak and exalt and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee just like children obey your parents fulfill your scripture wives love your H have you wives love your husbands give reverence and honor to them fulfill your scripture husbands love your wives as Christ gave himself and love the church fulfill your scripture amen amen perfect faith is based on forgiveness if you want perfect faith in your life if you want the power of the spoken word in your life it's based on forgiveness because Jesus would speak here and say you know if ye say to this mountain be thou removed that thou be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe all those things which he uh saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what so what what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them we all love that don't we not all of the scripture to fulfill and when you stand praying forgive oh I don't have to forgive and I don't have to be like this no this is basic Christian Living this is this is everyday Christian Life forgive Hallelujah when you stand praying don't have order in your heart I don't have to forgive that person I think you do Hallelujah I think you do oh no I can hold this Grudge I can block this person and ban them from my life and CU they did this to me are you sure oh no it's only the pastor has to do do that really are we not all Christians here I'm glad some of us are Christians here hallelujah join everyone it's good meet the Lord amen but you know we should this is all part of scripture we must fulfill fulfill your scripture amen hallelujah amen if you have order against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses I want to be forgiven but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen so we have scripture to fulfill now if you examine if you examine your lamb analyze your lamb then there is so much power when you see what he's capable of Amen that he is able he is able to to Deliver Us from all temptation remember there is nothing that strikes us that is not common to man we are not a unique case because people who think they unique cases think nothing can help them right the things we go through are going through have gone through Joe blogs on the street goes through the same thing right but they don't have a lamb to analyze to call upon in their time of need sadly so we need to analyze that our lamb not just is but he's more than able amen not just to F not just to fulfill the scripture in our life amen but to but to deliver us amen that he will make a way of Escape we got to look for that way of Escape amen see Faith looks for a way out Faith looks for God's promises to be fulfilled because when you when you realize when you analyze your lamb and say no God is more than able to come into my situation and meet my need amen then God can prove his word in your life you see when Trouble Comes it gives the opportunity for the devil to come in or it gives the opportunity for God to step in it's your choice who you allow to take over your life right remember the children of Israel I well I just love the example Caleb and Joshua suffered the same Wilderness same hunger thirst everything else that the others did but they allowed God to step in and say God is more than able we're taking the land right the others just complained and let the unbelief the spirit of unbelief take over and just for them to complain against Moses they both saw the same things they both experienced the same problems but one gave a choice no God delivered us out of Egypt he's going to take us all the way amen amen the others said yeah sure God delivered us but where are we now and they allowed that Spirit of unbelief to grip their lives and keep them out of the promised land amen but you see so so everything that comes everything that comes to us what is it going to do is it going to make you a better person or is it going to make you a bitter person I think better is the way to go myself amen so now I'm just is going to come to this Jesus would Jesus would be walking on the water I'm just going to take a different uh I think I have it here Jesus wanted to fulfill the scripture right he wanted his disciples to see him for who he was this is why he walked with them for three three and a half years that they could analyze their lamb and see that he was the master of every circumstance amen that that that when that same one came and dwelt in them they would they would know what he's capable of that when they came into situations that they did not face when they walking with them with God just with them they knew that that same God in them could Master every circumstance right amen but you see the thing is they when they analyze their lamb when trouble struck first they thought they analyzed him wrong thinking he was a spirit but then when they when he said be not afraid be of good cheer be not afraid of Desire I mean in the other place we read last Sunday they willingly welcome him welcomed him into the boat amen so they had a moment see God had to fulfill the scripture I'm just going to wind this up this is me closing okay God's here he wants to he wants you to fulfill your scripture but in order to do that you've got to analyze your lamb to see that he's just faithful he's more than able to fulfill it in your life right because when you do that then then you know whatever situation you come into God's more than able to do it right and then now because you've analyzed him faithful that he can come on the scene and you'll never leave the nor forsake thee that when he steps into a meeting or steps into your time of prayer steps into your family altar wherever the spirit of God begins to move then you realize I have a moment that I can touch the master and I can get virtue and whatever need I have from him I can I can get it amen because remember church or our walk with God is is is is full of moments how many times brother R would ST stand there with the discernment he's calling someone out and says they're missing it and God and His grace would actually allow him to speak their name out who's seen that in the message he says he says lord they're missing it help us Lord and then their name would we call that so so they were being distracted maybe what's going with going on around them with the Pew maybe they're thinking about tomorrow maybe you know the devil's got them thinking about something else but God was saying No this is your moment don't be distracted so he called them by name and I think many times when when you know we're sitting in a service and God is speaking directly to our lives right and he's speaking things that the minister doesn't know you know no one else knows but God knows he's wanting you to take your moment he's wanting you to see this is me speaking to you I want you to step out of your trouble step out of where you're in amen that you can receive what you have need of right but if we judge our our lamb faithful Hallelujah there's no trouble too big there's nothing that's impossible with him remember he's a good shepherd He says I am the Good Shepherd I trust that if you as you've walked with him you realize that word good does actually is the understatement of a lifetime amen about how good and faithful he is amen so let's have the musicians please today I'm just sorry I'm a bit short but you know we're journeying in things and hey we're here to fulfill our scripture don't look at everyone else what about you what's God given you to fulfill that's right and I think it's very important we search out the message search out the scripture to see what God wants us to fulfill and make it personal amen praise the Lord let's let's stand shall we amen I want to sing that song well so I'm going to I I enjoy your song selection brother Maran
