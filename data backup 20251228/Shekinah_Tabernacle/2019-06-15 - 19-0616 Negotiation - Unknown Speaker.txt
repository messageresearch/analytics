recently [Music] amen let's pray this morning Lord Jesus we are so grateful Lord that you have called us Lord that you pursued us by your unmerited grace and love Lord that it wasn't something that we did that may you decide that maybe we were worth saving Lord but that we were a part of you from before the foundation of the earth Lord and that your objective towards us was to save us Lord and to pursue us Lord in spite of us Lord Jesus and we just thank you for that Lord we thank you Lord that that you're a relentless God Lord that that in your pursuit of us Lord you were relentless Lord you never got exhausted you never tired you never you never waned Lord you never thought about going back on your decision Lord but you had resolve Lord and you you you were steadfastly minded towards us Almighty God that you'd pursue us and save us Lord and we just thank you for that Lord Jesus we just want to continue to have you in our midst this morning Lord that we can be changed and touched by you what we don't come here just as a as a tradition Lord or as a maybe something to do on a Sunday morning father but we come Lord to be molded and made into your image Lord Jesus to be made more like you Lord to you to have your mind and our mind Lord - that your thoughts will be our thoughts Lord your desires will be our desires Lord that we can put off these earthly things and this earthly nature that we have Lord and put on Christ more Lord as Paul said till Christ be formed in you Lord and that's our desire this morning and I believe that was Lord the prophets desire when he ministered was to see Christ formed and the people Lord to come to the stature of a perfect man and a perfect woman Lord and we just pray you'd continue to bless us bless those that are away bless brother being Lourdes he's probably starting to minister at this time bless the Saints and fielding bless those that are streaming Lord and bless those that may be sick Lord may you heal them and refresh them Lord and just um yeah be with us this morning we just commit the service to your hands and we just love your thought of our hearts thought and we're so grateful Lord Jesus for what you've done for us we just love you Lord Jesus and Jesus name Amen praise the Lord god bless you all you can take your seats this morning thank you brother James I liked all those new songs well they be original verses of that how great is our God son Laura they know who wrote those ones okay good you know I didn't think that was the songwriters verses they were the his verses praise the Lord I like new songs it's um there's something the the fresh emotion and inspiration that was expressed in a song when you first hear it for the first time or the second time of the third time that you catch that that emotion and their inspiration you know maybe after we hear the song for a while and we get used to what we get used to thee for that inspiration of what the song was but when we hear it for the first time on the second time or they know the early stages it's got that it's got that anointing to it so I enjoyed that this morning I enjoyed those new songs you'll have to do that sit again like on your Knicks but no I'm serious maybe when you do your next one just repeat the same sit so we you know because when we get to know the songs then we can you know forget about trying to know what the words out we can just enter into the song but you've got to start somewhere you've got to do something you can't learn a new song without learning a new song and the fact that you learn a new song which you didn't talk before you lent it that's all quite simple praise the Lord how's everyone doing this morning doing good yeah I like a smaller crowd actually it makes me feel more relaxed more at home it feels like you can it's more of a Bible study you can just relax and talk to the people and there's not as much pressure on I was going to say to brother bin I don't think that I've ever maybe there's been one preached in a service when he's been here for not been I'm one of the old-timers in the Fellowship you know I've been here since the maybe two weeks after we started but I don't think I was just thinking this morning I don't think he's ever been in the service said that I've preached then apart from maybe one about five years ago yeah interesting not that he doesn't like me it's just that when he's away you know that's that's when he he calls up the reserves and then when they're not available they call up me praise the Lord so I've got a different thought this morning and the way the Lord gives me my thoughts is sometimes slightly challenging because sometimes I just get one word and I don't really get much else on top of that and um I was saying to brother James this morning maybe the those of us that minister you know wouldn't it be interesting if everyone had the same sort of subject and then they had a challenge too to administer on that exact same subject and it would be so interesting to see what each different Minister gets out from their subject because we all look at things from a different perspective you know and the Lord's made us a different way that we that when we look into things that just it's to do with their whole being you know we just look at it a certain way and the things we've guarded over the years we sort of ant we tie them with what we're talking about and everything but wouldn't that be interesting if we did it because I thought if they did this subject they would probably do it far better than me you know like that but this is the Lord's given maybe I'll just started off the Lord's given me this one and maybe the other guys can make something decent of it but the thought that I got the word that I got was negotiation right negotiation and when you first get a word you think man I can't extract five minutes out of that word you know to to to speak about it but as you look into it after a while you the Lord shows you a few things and you you're kind of a few little things come together so let's just see what the what the Lord has this morning but yeah the thought that I've got our heart this morning is negotiation negotiation it's actually a funny we're at the meaning of the word is quite funny because it's it doesn't actually the original design of the word it's almost not really what it is today I think we've slightly changed it but I'm going to go with what we think it is today but it's um I think it comes from it it's a it comes from either Greek or Latin and it's and two portions and there's Niko and then she a ssin is two portions of it and I think maybe it's Greek what's the Greek word for know what okay it's lesson I think because that means no and then the other word was leisure no leisure interesting and that's what um the the people would say about businessmen that they were negotiators they hid because they were too busy doing all their business that they had no leisure so we were these other men and the different industries they could just enjoy life a bit more but that's the funny place that's a bit of a lesson for business men this hundreds of years ago I was saying these business guys got so caught up and what they were doing they had no leisure so we work we if you know if you're conducting business or anything don't get so caught up in it you know that you have no no leisure but that it wasn't what I was going to speak about let's um this is my this is just an open description but it's not really what I'm going to talk about but maybe we'll just stand up when we read this one and then anymore then we've got a few more scriptures as we go through but I just want to start off with this when a strobe one is seven to eight and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth him from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like chemin all the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and a sewers evil amen praise the Lord you can take your seats this morning wouldn't that be awesome and I think it does happen that is this meeting between God and Satan and do you know your name comes up imagine if Jobe knew that the pressure that he would have felt that Almighty God said have you considered my servant job is none like him in all the earth he would have felt some pressure and that's the sort of confidence God has in his children and I believe that God has the same confidence than you I believe there's been a little conference a bit of a negotiation between God and Satan and he said have you considered my servant James is none like him and all the earth that's an amazing idea that God can have that much confidence and man and he knew Jobe would stand the test of time but you know the reason why I brought this this here up is because God's our negotiator yeah and Satan came up before God and they had this little negotiation between themselves you know and I think he learned a few things about Satan that that Satan is an evil negotiator Satan just does evil things and you almost can't negotiate with them because I don't think he I think he found Satan to me not trustworthy and look even in this situation he's Satan sitar job's just happy because you have let him you've blessed them but you you take your hand off him a button you let me get Adam and I'll show you the he'll kiss you we hope he'll his ideas will change he won't love you as much what an evil person that is that Joe had done nothing at all to Satan nothing whatsoever didn't II didn't Satan didn't really know him before the study because he said if you consider Jobe Oh who's Jobe oh okay well oh now just go and cause havoc and his life for no reason that's evil that's Satan that's what they did to Christ when he was here they hated me without a cause anything that hates without a causes is from Satan that's what he does he just hates without of course and he just kept on hating without a cause but his end will come now moving on to negotiations there's basically four general negotiating boxes or ideas I suppose you could say some of them kind of interlace and like parents at one with each other but generally speaking these are the four that that there are adversarial negotiations when winning negotiations when lose negotiations and collaborative negotiations generally most negotiations will fall somewhere within the spectrum some of them are kind of both like a like a wouldn't lose negotiation and an adversarial negotiation will kind of you know when someone loses they're not happy so they're quite competitive to try and win and the upset so they you become adversarial and the win-win negotiations in collaborative negotiations are generally positive ones where you're working together to achieve something you know but nonetheless there's these we're just going to go on these for now I'm going to speak about some natural things but but we've got to keep our spiritual thinking caps on because this is all spiritual as well it's not all natural everything we see in life was actually a type of the spiritual everything that there is in life and there's so much wisdom out there when we look you know the Bible says wisdom cries out it's everywhere you look because everything we see is a reflection of something in the spiritual somehow somewhere God's made such an awesome earth and it's such an awesome design that we can just we can stand back and live life and not say a word and just be fed wisdom all our life I mean now I'm just going to start off with adversarial negotiations you understand what they are they're by the word adversarial meaning they are there's a conflict involved in these negotiations they're not nice happy negotiations there there's a conflict I'll just read you out these things adversarial negotiations are highly competitive in nature when losing the and lose-lose negotiations are most likely to be adversarial nobody wants to lose this tends to drive intense competition this man's fallen nature right there in extreme cases negotiations a adversarial because the parties involved intensely dislike each other in such cases negotiators may not be interested in winning instead they may seek to maximize the losses of the other party what have we just read about in job negotiations between political rivals may turn destructive in this way how much have you how many times have you seen that in politics it's just a hateful mess sometimes adversarial negotiations require battle strategies now I'm sorry but you know what I'm like when when I read that I think what our battle strategies been hey because we're all in a fight we're all in a battle I thought okay maybe I'll just quickly find out what some battle strategies are you say here's I was like honors war thing again but hey life is a war that's a battle we're in a fight we're not we're not studying back with an enemy that's you know doesn't care the enemy is out to destroy us as we saw with his negotiations with God he given a smallest given the smallest opportunity that he can get he'll destroy you he'll do anything he can without cause without you haven't done anything to him you haven't you're a good man good woman you'll just come and destroy you doesn't care hates you that's what he's like so I thought I'll quickly be a run through the nine main nine principles of battle strategy now this comes from the the American army field manual and they've won a few battles I figure heads we should be on the right track here number one in terms of battle strategies we have have an objective we've got to have an objective if you've got an objective what are you doing every operation must have a clearly defined an actionable objective gold even minor initiatives and quick ones must have objectives it's got to be some objective in it offensive I like this one now think about this in your Christian walk offensive never forget that no military leader has ever become great without audacity the offensive attack is considered the primary means of achieving victory in other words you aren't going to win anything if you don't go on the offensive how can you win without going on the offensive the offensive is the most important strategy mass concentrate your resources at the right time and place for maximum effects they get spread too thin and you know fighting wars all over the place maximise it for the main objective that's why the Bible will say so he that Waris doesn't get caught up in the affairs of this life you know you've got to be fighting this fight and you can't be all over the place and having all your mind on all these other things in trying to fight the fight the good fight of faith with Christ and you're stretched thin economy of force every unnecessary expenditure of time every unnecessary detour as a waste of power and therefore contrary to the principles of strategy in other words don't waste your resources doing things that they're not going to advance the main objective resources should be deployed with maximum effect no resource should be left without a purpose the resources used to achieve secondary objectives should be minimized the allocation of resources should be continually measured and optimized isn't that a good lesson in life you know we we have secondary objectives in our life with all our responsibilities but they are secondary objectives and they need to be given a certain amount of time but they've got to be continually measured and not the most maneuver defeat in anniversary by moving quickly and intelligently incapacitate their decision-making capabilities by surprising them with your movements when you don't feel like going to church go to church you'll surprise the enemy I didn't realize you'd go he's there they're doing it they're following through what's that mean oh this wasn't supposed to happen like this they were down and out for the count you know we're eased up brother Annie was going to give up but he was there and he was going this surprise objective unity of command responsibilities must be clear every objective must be the responsibility of exactly one commander that's what I like about the kingdom of God it's got structure it's not just a you'd out there and every man to himself do whatever you want this structure in the Army of God security particular resources never can permit your competitor to achieve a surprise advantage protect your resources that also means look after yourself to don't look after your spiritual state don't yourself get all worn out and and then the enemy can come in and disrupt you you see I've had that lots surprise strike at a time place and manner that is likely to surprise the competition I think the Lord surprised Satan when he came down he didn't know who he was if they'll be if they'll be who was this guy simplicity of order everything a more is simple but the simplest thing is difficult the difficulties accumulate and in by producing a kind of friction that is unconceivable unless one has experienced war make your order simple concise clear and uncomplicated complex instructions are likely to be must understood mismanaged or botched what I thought about that's what I thought you know what the message that we have I'm so glad that we got a what is it sixth grade or fifth grade I don't know how they do it in the states with the educational system but you know the Prophet had like he finished up school by the time he was 12 or 13 you know he's done that some that's probably like year nine here you know he had a year nine education and you know he didn't come out with all these complex instructions on fifty-five steps how to make your life successful you know when you when you listen to the message letting off the pressure you think well I'm going to get some great all these steps to know how to lead off the pressure in my life the gist of it is just get into the presence of God and in being as presence and that will let the pressure off you think that that simple is that all I have to do why don't I know this a long time ago it's a simple instruction can't be botched cut we messed up nice and simple get into his presence but don't you don't need to get caught up in all these complex instructions they always cause confusion so now back to our topic of adversarial negotiation so I'm going to I'm going to type the one more - like a negotiation like a conflict situation in terms of like a hostage situation because that's a lot of the times they're that very adversarial you know you have hostage negotiators that that their job is to try and negotiate with some person that is or a group that has got that a I guess evil a nature and they've taken over some hostages and then this this hostage negotiator has to try and talk and negotiate with this person to get the hostages released sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't and there's a lot of techniques they use but ultimately there's not going to be a nice outcome in the end really there's no it's a it's a bad situation there won't even be a nice outcome they they're not going to release the hostages in the hostage takers go free even if they release the hostage takers the hostage the hostages the hostage takers getting up in jail there's never really any nice outcome but I thought I'd look into a few know and I'll put it this way a lot of the time in these situations these adversarial say the hostage situations a lot of the time there comes a point and the negotiator has to determine that point where the negotiations break down and the there can be no more dialogue the dialogue between the two parties are starting to break down to where they they have to make a call and say the situation is going on to another level now where the negotiations can't continue because that the parties can't come to any sort of agreement and the threats that this other party the hostage takers are going to the threats they're going to do that they they want to do they will do those threats they will kill hostages they will do whatever so they get to a point where they're hot with us where the negotiations break down and that's where we're going to start this because I don't think God can negotiate with Satan then it come to a good outcome I think the negotiations always break down they break down there's no there's no negotiating although there was a bit of negotiating I want to tell you I want to show you this a few little stories just to get our mind into this idea this was in the seventies and this was I think it was an Air France plane flying from Israel calibre I think over two maybe it was flying into Paris and it was hijacked and this plane was diverted from there and it got diverted into Uganda but the place was in tibi it got diverted over at Entebbe now this was in the seventies and they the the people that took it were Palestinians and they were wanting the release of Palestinian prisoners that the Israelis head so they release all of the non Israeli citizens from the plane British American whoever they were they they landed at this Airport in Uganda and then they released everyone apart from the Israeli passengers now in the airport they landed that was called Entebbe and it was on I think this is Lake Victoria which surrounded the airport it was kind of on the peninsula and the Israelis were trying to negotiate with that the terrorists to secure the release of these some hostages but I think after about three or four days through trying all sorts of different channels they were going to different countries to say to that country could you ring your friend in that country and tell them they've trying all these backdoor deals but nothing was working and I think it got to a point where they realized that these negotiations are breaking down this is not going to go as we planned and so they had to go on to plan B which was send and guys to try and rescue these hostages send in their their army to rescue these hostages because they said that even if it doesn't work it's not going to work anyway now the first idea they had was to get dropped into the lake these um Special Forces dropped into the lake and then they were going to swim over to the airport because it was right on the edge of the water but they did the research and they found out the the Nile crocodile lived in the lake so they didn't do that so so they are right they they built a special compound very quickly this is over the course of seven or eight days they've built a special compound because they got intelligence from an Israeli company that actually built this Airport and they built a mock compound and they trained to how to storm this compound that their I mean the hostages were in at the airport and they trained for a couple of days built the thing trained and then they flew into the airport and their planes and they pretended like they were the it was a guy I forget the leader of the country they pretended yeah yeah they pretended they were him and they had black Mercedes and these black armored vehicles they were going to pretend that that the leader of the country was going into you know come and see assess the situation so they've all landed they had a quite a big operation hundred or 200 guys and they landed at this Airport and they they drove these SUVs and this Mercedes out of the aircraft they actually worked on was I think it was Kenya to refuel here and come across because no one else would cooperate with him and the at the start the situation didn't go too well at the start because one of the guys that was at the gate he'd knew that he knew that the President had just gotten a new fleet of vehicles and they were white Mercedes not black ones so when you saw these black ones coming in they gave orders to shoot at these guys because he said this isn't the president so they shot these these the first line of guys but that kind of lost in the element of surprise because that was supposed to get past everything and be in the building before anyone knew what was going on so they tried to have the element of surprise but they lost it but nonetheless these guys stormed into this building the Israelis and they yelled out in Hebrew they said we are you know we are soldiers we're Hebrew we we're Israelis we're going to save you even if you once stay down the only person that got shot was actually a French guy that had emigrated to Israel Indian he didn't know Hebrew Israeli so he stood up and he was they thought he was a he was one of the hostage takers so they shot him but of all the other about a hundred people there they they shot all the hostage takers and rescue these 100 people and God onto the plane they had a fight with the Ugandan army because they came and they so they fought them for about 45 minutes out on the airport and then they flew away with all these hostages so they basically risk feeling they rescued all the hostages and this was the compound that they were and then for the state he's still bullet holes in the walls there from there from them taking these hostages and the the one person that died there was actually the only the only person that died was a guy in Netanyahu which was Benjamin Netanyahu's older brother actually was killed in this and this operation the current Israeli prime minister so he that was the only casualty when you think about that story I want you to start thinking about you know the negotiations between God and Satan for the souls of us broke down and God had to implement Plan B what's our sin to send on a rescue operation to come and rescue you and me God had to come up with a plan because he knew that negotiations with his enemy were going to break down he was going to follow through with his threats to kill and destroy but I want to tell you one more story and this is such an interesting story this one I haven't heard anything like it but it's so fascinating what these mean did this was South America and there was a there's a I don't know a lot about the mother I have read about them there's a left-wing group called FARC they're somewhere in Colombia and they they've been content anti-government they've been around since the 70s and they are a reasonably powerful group but they are made up of just farmers indifferent people that are disgruntled with things so they're not they're not necessarily an organized military group although they do have guns and everything but they're just made up of all these farmers and different ones and they've been taking people in that country in and around their hostage for years and years and years and they had they some of the people they had taken hostage with some of these guys been hostage for 15 years 15 years they were hostage for and one of the men that was that worked for the government that was always trying to free hostages and fight against this group he was due to retire but he knew that there were I think they were about twenty or thirty of these police and army soldiers that had been suddenly held hostage for 15 years and he didn't want to retire without seeing those guys free now these guys to understand the story about these guys out in the bush were also they were given radios because they could listen to the radio and and so people that had been a hostage and have been released they started broadcasting on the radio different stations out to these areas messages from families so families will get a 30-second slot to broadcast a message hoping that their brother or father or whoever it was would hear the message and just to say hey we love you you know we're gonna we don't give up on all those sorts of things so so it was quite common for these guys to have a to have a radio and that they would I think that the hostage takers realized that if they had a radio and they could just it would help them just they listen to music and they would be a bit easier to deal with because they would just calmly lovely life while they were under well they were prisoners now the challenge of these mean that they had was they wanted to send and the army to go and rescue some of these guys but they wanted to let the soldiers and the guys that were held hostage know that they were coming in but they didn't want the hostage takers to know they were coming in so that was a challenge we have to get a message through to these people that held hostage but we can't leave the hostage takers no and these guys away from the bush because once they knew they would probably just shoot the hostages they wouldn't care just shoot them and move on and the other thing was the big guys that were held hostage they they were certain such remote areas and the bush that they felt they couldn't just run away because they would die out in the jungles now they wouldn't make it out alive even if they escaped they wouldn't make it out which was the case in a lot of these cases where prisoners of war were held in remote locations and hostile countries they didn't bother escaping because they thought once we escaped this compound we were in a hostile country we were maybe a different kind of skin we are we supposed to go right so so they had a challenge of sending a message through to these guys to say we're going to we're coming to get you if you do manage to escape we'll save you but we are coming we're coming for you haven't forgotten about you so you well no one man came up with an idea of Morse code we'll send them a code and Morse code right you think oh how they're gonna do that so they had this idea they said I'll tell you what we'll do they said our soldiers and our police for know Morse code but these other guys they're just farmers they don't know Morse code so they had this ingenious idea they said we're gonna write a song we're gonna write we're gonna try and write a hit song popular song and we're going to have portions in the song where we're going to put a Morse code in the song and the Morse code is going to be misses to these guys so we've always have the verse then we'll have the chorus this isn't this isn't 2008 2010 we're gonna have the verse the chorus then we're going to have like a little segment and we're going to put an instrument and there that's that makes the sound of a Morse code but you're gonna think it's part of the song and they see all of the all of the radio stations in the rural areas we're all government-owned so they were going to have the governments play the song and just play it like it's a normal pet song and so they wrote the song they get songwriters in and they wrote the song and they put this Morse code in the song and in there contacted all the radio stations they seed play this song play it broadcasted out to the jungle every day play the song and in the biggest cities they didn't know it that much but this song became a hit out in the all of the rural areas everyone knew the song they just thought it was another song this is a great song a hit song but it had a coded message in the song and when they did that too they before they did that the guys that were negotiating with the hostages sending out messages saying you know hey look these guys have radios but people say why you'll give the deploy away but they said no we won't because they know that their families broadcasts on different stations to say to them the are okay you know so that was why they were saying let them have radio so they they said let all the hostage hostages have radios so they all had radios and listening for misses from family and so I'll just I just want to read you the verses so these guys were so cunning they even wrote in the verses this is the song they wrote but they kind of worded in such a way in the middle of the night thinking about what I love the most I feel the need to sing what my heart has to give I talk about those I love about how much I miss them I talk about pride and strength which beat inside my heart yeah this is in Spanish that what's the next fit and this is the chorus a new dawn singing the message from my heart although I'm tied up in alone I feel as if I'm by your side listen to this message brother then after that is the Morse code and the Morse codes is nineteen people rescued you're next don't lose hope and in verse two says I want to keep on fighting for my friends my family my children we will soon see each other again I'm sure better days are coming and the song was called better days I've got I've got like I just got to the last bit of the chorus there it's played three times throughout the song but I've just taken it from there just being that we're the singing is in the chorus in there kind of interlude before the next verse and then when the next verse that's hopefully this will play out I wanted to play this because you think now that can't be how would that work but this is what they broadcast and the jangle can you play that [Music] get it and it worked these soldiers see if they were listen to the song and they they said and they picked up the miche's that was in the song the hostage-takers would like in the song too but they didn't know there was a message in the hidden in it and there was a Morse code message and it word got round through all the camps and they say there's a message in that song they come in to rescue us they're gonna come and they spread spread the word out and guys within after that they weren't scared to escape their thought if we escape the guys around us they're gonna rescue us and a lot of men escaped and they were rescued they managed to get all of the men out and it was a result of that song but there was a message it was a message hidden in that song just seemed like another song you know there was nothing to it it reminds me of what we going through saves it seems our there's just another guy coming and speaking is a message in the mist there's a voice behind the voice there's a message saying it's alright I'm coming to rescue you everything's gonna be alright but see we are hostages here I think that's an amazing story of and a type of what God is doing the exact same thing for us no one even knew that it was there but the ones that were the ones that understood the other language they understood there was another there was another language that these other people wouldn't understand with and has stood the language they see can you hear it in the song I can't hear anything there's something in that song amen now now gonna move on now so now be all that in mind right we're going to talk about every serial negotiations because you know the negotiations between God and Satan broke down man was taken hostage when man fell they were taken hostage by Satan he had us hostage we became a hostage to Satan and you know God began his negotiations to get us back to get us back yeah I'm just gonna put this Godhead little ways to try and sneak a few hostages out here he came up with a little idea and it was this you know he we're going to type this in a hostage situation you know with the he said okay because the wages of sin was death the God said okay if you sacrifice the pure lamb or a pure dove or a pure bull then the net blood will allow you to kind of kind of escape but when you think about it they weren't they didn't really escape fully did they under the blood of bulls and goats they were this is kind of a funny situation but they they had managed to get out but they weren't fully free where they right they were just say so you had you had Satan still taking over this hole that he had mankind hostage in but a few people have managed to escape to some other little safe zone but they weren't really free but God had to come up with a plan to free them to free us and the heating you in negotiations are broken down I want to read you this verse here just to talk about about Samuel and him then I'll carry on this is from Samuel this is about the people that were in their place saul went to the though Witch of Endor and he said to her bring me up Samuel then said the woman whom shall I bring up and he said bring me up Samuel and when the woman saw Sam you should cry with a loud voice and the woman spoke this all saying why has thou deceived me for thou art saul and the king stood out there who'd be not afraid for what source now and the woman said unto Saul I saw gods ascending out of the earth and he said that to her what form is he off and she said an old man cometh up and he has covered with a mantle and saw perceived that it was Sammy when he stopped sleep with his face of the ground and bowed himself now isn't that an interesting scripture he actually said they came up out of the youth they didn't say they were in glory and came down now now I don't know but they were in this place they had to be freed as well they were just under the blood of bulls and goats there and they could still come up and they could actually talk with these people I don't think you could now because it's a different a whole different dimension but they were in this other place so these may need to be rescued as well even though they were they were free they were still on this twenty place right but now God started to send out a message like a little woman well then what he was doing he started to send out a message to the to their to us to say I'm going to be coming to rescue you help is on its way I'm gonna come to rescue you he started within his scriptures putting little messages in there that that the common man would read and overlook but those that understood the language would start to see there's going to be a deliverer coming to rescue us the Lord though God will raise up their prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me him shall you hearken therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sigh and behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel God started to send a message I'm going to come for you I'm gonna rescue you even hidden in the Psalms for dogs have compassed me the Assembly of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet most people would read that Simon think there's nothing in there but that was a mission saying I'm gonna be pierced for you I'm gonna come and rescue you but unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace more messages I'm going to come for you I'm gonna rescue you the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound I'm gonna come and rescue you I'm gonna come for you God had to come down on a covert operation to rescue the hostages now you know we say the element of surprise we talk about the element of surprise the covert operation the men that sneak in they sneak in you know what to me this looks like God snuck in no one even knew he had arrived apart from a few Shepherds on a hill that the the mighty deliverer snuck in secretly I'm gonna call this operation Liberty the Americans always call their ones Operation Eagle Corps or this I'm gonna call this operation Liberty because God realized I'm gonna have to go down and rescue these hostages myself I'm gonna go down and rescue them he had a plan when he turned up he was on a mission to rescue us we were taken hostage and he had a covert operation and he snackin no one knew he was there and snuck in quietly he snuck in quietly even the enemy didn't really know who he was when they tempted him they said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread they had their suspicions but they didn't know if there be he didn't he didn't come like you'd think he would you think this is not Almighty God this is this is not the mighty army of God coming to deliver this is just a man walking around he was secret and as in his little plan he wanted to keep the element of surprise that but he knew he was the only one that could go and do it and even though even as the Pharisees they also didn't know who he was then the Jews and all the the the Satan's children then the Jews came around about him and said unto Him how long do they make us doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly his cover wasn't blown yet they didn't know who you are so if you I just tell us you know we want to know but they didn't know but he was on a mission to rescue now when you think about it where did he have to go to to rescue us he had to go to the place of death he had to go there that was the place we're here to defeat so you think about how how could he get to the place of death he's came on a journey from here all the way down there how could he get there he had to die himself and to venture all the way down to the place of death and his operation his objective had to end up down there the only way he could get there was to become like us and then to die every time every minute he was here he wasn't here to do miracles and all these things he was here to end up in the place of death to conquer it and to free us that's what that's why he came here for this whole objective it as much as he may have been having a good time with the disciples and all that his objective was to end up in the place of death there was this objective he was a deliverer and operation Liberty now what was he after what was this objective what was this objective when you think about it he didn't want to some country's gone to another country and taken over because they want the resources they want the country he didn't want hell he didn't want the he didn't want the place itself what was his objective when you think about it he wanted access to it he wanted to take it over to get access to it he was after the keys I'm after access to that place because you've got them hostage oh and access so not so I can free the whole place I don't want to free the whole place but I want to free my people from that place when I want to I want to be able to have the opportunity that if I want to I can have access anytime I want and go down and free my people so he needed to get access he wanted access to death and hell that's why the scripture says I am he that loveth him was dead and behold I am alive forevermore and have the keys of death and health that's what he went down to to get were the keys the access to it he's gonna destroy the place later on but he thought in the meantime I need access to get my people out of there not everyone but my people out of there amen now I just want to throw the city has a little sight that when I was thinking about this you know the gates of Hell are always locked that's why I need the keys cuz he locked you know why they're locked no one wants to be there no one wants to be there always locked and everything Satan does is binding a bind you and locks you in I like in Revelations assists the gates this is heaven the gate shall not be closed it all by day for this should be no night there God doesn't have to lock his gates no one's gonna leave Satan can't sneak into the kingdom of heaven and I'll come out with me on rescuing you we're like we're not going anywhere we're free to go anytime we want we're not going that's Satan's Kingdom all he can do is bind you and Nestle had this place locked up and God wanted the Lord wanted to go down and get the keys and get access to this place now that was that was here wasn't the end of it even though he's here that has finished he said that wasn't quite the end of his journey we look at the cross and that's what we see but when he died he went down further to get the keys to get access to deliver the people to rescue them deliver the hostages so he can come back and any time he wants have access to it the scripture here that we've got and I love the scripture wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended they went down it's the same also that ascended up far above all things that he might fill all things now before that he had everything under his domain except death there was the one thing here because Paul says he had all things under his feet except death you didn't have death under his feet he didn't have that still had that was still not in the kunda his control but he went down there and he got those keys and I think it was a surprise attack I think when he showed up they they realized they'd made a mistake you know that put when you mess up you realize you made a mistake I think the demons and Satanist whole kingdom realized they'd made a mistake he is God when he hit and followed through with his idea he went and did it himself he actually came he had a surprise attack and he went in there and he got access and got the keys and that's why he says I'm here that loved us and was dead and behold our life for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death so that's that where he ends up now the keys of hell and death this where is that now that's what he's got so he's he hasn't freed everybody but he's got access to free whoever he wants now we want to move on with negotiations right this idea now who said this one who's this principle before negotiate from a position of strength keep that in mind all right because we're going to go on to another topic of negotiations it's just tie those ones and what we were talking about we're going to move on to win-win negotiations one min ago she ations involve expanding apply for example of two people decide to go out the business together their partnership negotiations I wouldn't win the deciding we're going to work together and grow something we're gonna we're gonna both prosper women negotiations may be just as focused on building a bigger pie as dividing the pie fairly every effort should be made to keep negotiations friendly and constructive right now when when we're all going to win there's no need to sort of battle each other we're negotiating together to try and one more right now keep this idea in mind you negotiate from a position of strength we're going to go on to win-win negotiations now God the Lord had taken over the kingdom of hell did you take him here take he had access to it right then he could start to come down and negotiate with you and negotiate with me from position of strength I love the scripture as I 1:18 says come now and let us reason together come now let's have a negotiation saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as wool though they be red like crimson or they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool there's still a little bit of negotiating and by the way I'm negotiating from a position of strength because if your sins are scarlet I can make them white as snow if they're red like crimson I can make them white like wool he comes in because he's got access now to to hell to death to where we were he's got access he can come down and negotiate with us now these are wouldn't win negotiations he say he's not in there to negotiate our failure he's in there to negotiate our success the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and that their vengeance of our God and comfort all that mourn so point unto them that mourn in Zion and here's as negotiations to give them beauty for Ashes here's my negotiation with you I'll give you you got a Shazz I'll give you beauty have you got morning I'll give you joy the oil of joy for mourning have you got a spirit of heaviness I'll give you the spirit of praise that we might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified these wouldn't win negotiations are very very good negotiations that's the type of negotiations that he has when he comes in negotiating with us this is what I'll do for you that's his negotiations with us you believe that now as an every negotiation right every parties got to come out of it with something it's got to be one one he's saying if you're bound I'll make you free if you're hurting I'll heal you if you're brokenhearted I'll make you happy if you're sad I'll make you happy if you're a second oh he loved you if you're if you're in Chains I'll deliver you anything you want I'll do it for you that's this this is what I'm gonna give to the negotiations because I've conquered everything I can give you anything you want right but there's always a catch to it because these are negotiations that one one what does he want I want to be your God I want to be your God you be my people don't I'll be your God now should have no other gods before me that's that's that's my term with you you just do that from L do this for you so likewise who superbear view there forsake us not all their death cannot be motorcycle forsake all you have and follow me that's what I want from you what do you want from me and this what do I have to do do this that's this negotiation back it's not just I'll do or listen you and you deliver we need the way you want it's a negotiation between parties and we all agree okay there that's that's a fear that's a fear deal I think I'm coming out of this deal quite world you ever been in the negotiation when you come out really well you think man I won that negotiation everything went well he says if you walk in my statues and keep my commandments and do them this is my deal with you if you walk in my ways and do them then I'll give you rain and juice season in the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the fruit field shell yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give peace in the land and you shall lie down a none shall make you afraid I will read evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword goes through your land and you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword if five of you shall chase in hundred and 100 of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemy shall fall before you by the sword for all have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you and you shall eat old store and bring forth old because of the new and I'll set my table and among you and my soul shall not abort you and I will walk among you and will be your God and you shall be my people what a great negotiation that is for us he came down to hell and he negotiated with us to the place of death negotiator this is what I want to do with you this is my deal with you you know when we agree we get it we see you know what I agree to that deal yep I'll do it I'll forsake all I'll follow you he says right let's get out of here let's get out of this place come with me Satan can't negotiate with any of us to go back he tries but he can't do it that says that's that wouldn't win negotiation the God is with us now the next one I want to touch on I've got two more these ones are quite sure this one is when lose negotiations right once of the one lose one there which gets a little bit negative in terms of the outcome of it now in game theory they call a win lose negotiation a zero-sum game a common analogy for a zero-sum game is dividing the pie the pie doesn't get smaller or bigger the players play a game to decide who gets the bigger slice so now we're not and a wouldn't win one you're deciding we're going to be expanding and you know we're going to just work together this one here it's a sin amount and we're gonna fight over who gets what if you're facing a one lose negotiation focus your strategy on determining the other party's minimum minimum requirements what's the least you're gonna need out of this agreement and I'll kind of try and get as close to that as I can so that I get as much as I can right the pie is not getting any bigger right they're called win lose because essentially you try and divide it but you know someone if they get it but more the other ones gonna lose it there's no real is that real overall gain it's a zero-sum game someone loses the gauge negotiations and normal life can get into negative gain situations all right now I've coined this little phrase ramen won't mind me telling this because I said I was going to now this is a natural negotiation right because I I heard of a situation hit ramen that years and years ago before she realized it was a negative gain so she doesn't do it anymore so now you need a new tie for your car right your tire you need to get a new tire so there's a place in New Zealand called Tony's tires and they have a policy if you get a quote from another tire place we will beat it by X percent 15 percent whatever it is as a 15 percent 20 doesn't do it anymore see he just pays a fair price right 15 percent say most of its about 15 percent so if you can go on the other say I've got a quote from John's tires for a 100 dollars they'll give you 15% off that hefty so now Rama knows this right so she's not just going to go to Tony's tires and get a tire she's going to go to other places and get quotes and then take it to Tony's get 15% off that again so she goes to one place and she's getting a quote and this is the way that I understood the story she may differ but for the purposes of the story it sounds better she basically said look I'm not really going to Cecily she said I'm not really going to buy the toy from you I'm just gonna take your quote and go to Tony's tires you know so yes it's honest you know look I'm just here to get a quote I'm just kind of gonna waste five minutes of your time then I'm gonna be out of here so I'm not gonna buy anything off you so the guy said well if you're gonna do that I don't like Toni's tires I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you a quote for a below cost so then when you take it to Tony's tie is he gonna get it down even further than that and you're gonna get the fire way way below cost because I'm gonna give you a below cost quote then you're going to go there and get even more below cost but he wouldn't give her that price if he knew that she wasn't going to Tony's right she's only gonna give her that that price because she knows he knows you're going to attain his tires so she gets this below cost quote and then goes down to Tony's tires and say it's how I got this quote for this tire and apparently the guy they said you what no it's too cheap like this the time might be a hundred dollars a good price she might have got a quote for 50 he's got a beat 50 he's got to get down to $40 or $42 you know did they give you this quote yeah they gave me the quote they were going to give it to me for that they weren't they just wanted to nice with these competition true story right okay so she gets a tie for way way below cost you know got the tie put on off she goes you know happy now I hear about the story right know something any sort of just begins to swirl around and in my mind and I'm going there's just something about that story that I just there's something about this situation that it's not really settling well the pieces aren't really going well together and my my mind right not that it's anything on here was just the I thought what is it about that situation that I just I can't seem to make it all work properly it doesn't seem doesn't seem hundred percent right to me and and this has helped me in lots of situations to understand this principal not that ramen was wrong but it was just there was nice that I could keep me thinking about this now any pre transaction say say that you do naturally in life this is a little lesson they should be our interactions with each other and with the general public in people they should be 1:1 in terms of you know there's an amount that some people say you're doing a business transaction they've got their costs and they want to make the imagine the other business forgot their costs they want to make the imagine and if you are one one is look we both make our fear honest margin you know it varies a little bit but in general most transit the transaction should be that I make my but you make your but you know and say and what's the tire it's like I want to pay the market price plus a better picture of profit for the tie because that's what it costs you to do it I'm getting a tire out of it you're getting a business you can run your business everything it's a fair transaction what happened in that transaction was it got into negative gain to where one person's gain didn't come from the profit it started the other party had to lose now they had to actually lose for the other person to gain their to lose more so then the extra bit of profit they got was not what wasn't a fair amount it was actually it was coming via gain was coming from someone else's loss so there was this way called negative gain now now if you get caught in a negative gain situation you're not going to have a nice taste in your mouth towards the person that you just got ripped off from are you you know and I thought you know we can operate in a way in life that we don't have to make money from negative gain no one else has to lose past what they should in order for us to gain as a Christian I thought you know I thought when I when I do it when I do things I want to make sure they every deal it's fear I don't want to start profiting from someone else's loss you know I thought that wouldn't be in that I'm sure God can make us prosper without having to do that because to me that's that's what that's there's suddenly that evil mean and do that not that ramens evil but I'm just I'm glad she gave the situation to me but you know James talks about the you know the hireling in the field is he's crying out to me because you've held Becca's wages by fraud you know he's ripped him off they should have gotten more for what they were doing he's done some scheme to rip him off to not pay the money worth he's keeping the money himself see he would still have had a lot he just needed to give him his fair share and that's the way that a Christian kind of operates and that's how Brahman operates all the time there even so much so that she does it too much I have to tell her look we need to make money here Brahman no no so negative gain situations right I want to tell you that but there's a bit now there's a time when we do negative gain situations that's why I said it right who knows this place Mara Largo so this is now the presidential retreat in Florida they have different retreats this one is actually one of Donald Trump's how retreats but now it's a presidential retreat because he's the president and I want to tell you the story about negotiation too just to get us onto this idea of he's wouldn't lose negotiations so I think it was the ATC Donald Trump went to Florida and saw this place here and he wanted to buy it that's the place I want I want to buy that it's about 17 acres the old mansion and the family that had it the mother had earned a lot of money and she it was her place if she had died and the daughters were kind of looking after it but I don't think they were as shrewd as the mother was in terms of acquiring assets because they just acquired this thing from an inheritance but this sum and that they had actually the government used it for a presidential retreat as well but the different presidents had gone to other places instead like that if they were from Texas they Cibolo in a row I'd rather go on stream ultimate Texas or spend more time we run from rather than go to Florida I'm not from Florida so a lot of the prisoners weren't using it and so it was kind of becoming costly to upkeep so it was it became a bit of a no one really wanted it no so expensive no they couldn't really sell it cuz it was such an expensive place to sell it was a mansion and so the but then in the end the daughters thought okay what we'll sell it we'll just sell it you know because it's not really what it's not really working for us and the upkeep of it every year was about a million dollars that keep this place you know so so Donald Trump goes here's a look at it any Danny says right and I'll give you 25 million dollars for the place they said no that's not enough we need them we need more than that 25 million okay it's fun that's all I'm gonna offer I'm going in the meantime you see the little stretch of beachfront where there's a little house in a little pool in that that was up for sale for two million dollars they bought it I'm gonna buy the front I don't know if they sold or someone else sold it but that was a different lot he bought that different lot he said okay that's what I'm gonna do now this is an evil man it's not good right this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna build me and big tall ugly skinny long building along the front there because in that place that the back is not going to be able to be sold because it's gonna have no beach view it's gonna have nothing and it's gonna have a stupid 8 story thin little apartment block he doesn't he had an architect design up this little squiggly long building purely to to force the people behind them to sell and he drew up plans and the community was like you Capital bit junk me you know it's gonna ruin the look of the beach you said ok that's what I'm building here that's what I want to build he was doing it too so I could negotiate with the people at the back once people knew that he had that he had bought the beach and he wanted to build that ugly building up the front to block the view off no one wanted to buy the mera Lago anymore no I wanted to buy they couldn't find a buyer because they said he Trump's is gonna build an ugly wall of the front in your place is gonna be worthless no beach view and and so the price went down down he ended up buying the place for 8 million dollars because they got desperate so they went from 25 million to 8 million thank you bye bye now that's that's quite hard negotiations I think that's a bit dishonest but you know but there's a principle and that though that when we negotiate with Satan this when you do wouldn't lose negotiations negative gain negotiations you don't give up an inch see these things in our life that belong to us there are promises of God Satan is going to try and negotiate you and me out of having all of it you know see I just you take 50 percent I'll keep 50 no you got whatever it might be you know you're kind of must be healed but uh you know who you'll never quite do that well if you've got promises don't let Satan negotiate you out of anything your desires the whole lot you got to play hardball to get the whole lot don't don't don't give up oh well he's he you know he wants to keep it all no no it's yours you can take it you can take it I want to read this quote from brother Brennan and I've got one more after this this is about the statue of a perfect man and I like this because God's given us a promise that we're going to grow into the statue of a perfect man but how many feels like you are you know who's telling you hit it's Satan trying to come in and the ghosts yet you're not quite gonna get there just don't quite this bit in your character is not quite gonna because you like this you know he starts to try and negotiate his way to not to you giving up some of your inheritance that's all that stuff is because of God's are you going to come into the statue of a perfect man than you are and don't let Satan negotiate you out of what is yours add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge into your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godliness brotherly love to your brotherly love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come because just beneath him the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ into the church to manifest those virtues then as a he says if he's anything he says I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by His grace grace I will pray I pray that I'll seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of those little requirements flying in this little old stature of mine until I became till I can be a manifestation of the Living Christ for he became son like me that I might become the righteousness of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for how many will pledge that same thing by the grace of God with their hearts bound now and their hands up I pledge it Lord Jesus our Lord this church pledges at the full stature of Jesus Christ so he's saying when you go to the negotiating table you want the whole lot don't budge on getting the whole lot everything any promise in the Word of God this for you any anything that's a general promise anything that's for you anything don't let Satan negotiate you out of a little portion of that you want the whole lot you total negative gain total negative gain he comes out losing every time and you know what who cares you're unhappy because that's not my I don't have to keep you happy I wanted you to have total negative gain and I believe that's what Caleb said Caleb had a promise this was his and years and years went by but Caleb said look I received a promise years ago and I'm gonna go and get it that was that was my promise even though I'm old now God's gonna give it to me I'm gonna go and take what's mine it's my inheritance um they're gonna be negotiated out of it it's all mine I'm gonna go and get the whole lot the whole pie I want everything there's people here that want the land is theirs guys living on the mountain that wants it now I'll tell you what it's mine you're gonna leave it's mine that was that says negotiations will go now I've got one last one this is quite short and then then we'll and then I'm about to close collaborative negotiations is the last one now collaborative negotiations creative and friendly for example business partnership negotiations are often collaborative when when negotiations that are expected to yield big ones tend to be collaborative that's when you collaborate together you work together work together to to achieve more than what you currently have now and you're you've got no animosity with the other party because you're now you're just working and you want to like a fellowship you know we work in with brother Ben what's your what's your desire what's the Lord laid on your heart we want to help where we can we want to support you know we we work together we're not scrapping over this we want we want it to grow so that we all benefit you know we want a nice fellowship to grow and everything like that right now but this is an interesting one you know because NER and the way that we understand it was the Lord we're not the sort of people that we don't go and force the promises of God if I could put it in the correct way to happen and our life outside of what he would want you understand like when you know the Lord you know I can't just walk in and pretend that I haven't got a relationship or don't say Lord I want this and listen us because we know him we say Lord you know my situation we talk the understand well when you know him you're not pushy and - trying to get from him what you want you know you deal with Satan and pushy manner right so this is the way it's going to be that but I wouldn't know maybe that's my approach but I wouldn't walk to God and said this is the way it's going to be you understand we have a different approach therefore when we when we do our initial negotiations in negotiate negotiate we negotiate our way out of death and hell we're happy so we're not going to keep going back and I'll give me this give me that I want all this you know but yet we didn't start to negotiate with God as in our walk with the Lord as the as the years go on we negotiate we're both at the same table but we're not going to say what I want this I'm sick of having to go to church on Sunday I want to be able to go out and do my thing yeah we it's different but I hit this idea his description that Psalm 37 it says delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart now you think about this every time you when you feel a bit tired but you think what I'm gonna go to church anyway because I love you want to serve you you know every time you do that you know that the desire of your heart negotiates with God and negotiates with God every time every time you say praise the Lord every time your heart delights yourself in the Lord every time you you do something for the Lord or just want to walk more with them every time you do that the desire of your heart negotiates with God starts negotiating the deepest thing you have in your heart that you want you don't know you're doing it if you look back on your life and thought well I've been look what I've got now didn't even really ask for it but look I've always wanted this and well I've actually got it and I didn't even go and ask for it you did the desire of your heart was negotiating with God as you were but you you're not busy trying to pursue that you're busy serving God and delighting yourself and home but as you do that the desire of your heart is negotiating daily negotiating and you know God's heart God negotiates beg you says you know what yeah give it to him let's do that let's do this let's do that desire this given that desire that's what he said out the desire of our heart negotiates with God when we delight herself and him I've looked back on my own life and I thought man I didn't even ask for any of this and you know I always wanted it always wanted something and suddenly you've got it I don't have to go ten steps to try and make a promise come to pass and make God give me something no just to like yourself in the Lord and that desire of my heart just negotiates a nothing wad and some things I didn't even realize that I wanted but I thought I always wanted that I got it praise the Lord so that was my thought that I had this morning on negotiations and I pray that that all our negotiations would win every one of them depending on which way or this way or that way you know and that we would all come into the stature of a perfect man and a perfect woman Brahman will be having a go at me this week but I did ask permission first though those are minor details problem we don't need to go into that Amy let's um let's stand this morning and um let's sing ham delight yourself in the Lord can I hand it over to can you play that song bruh okay I'll hand it over to brother James and I'm just some decision musicians are getting ready Oh we'll just pray this morning just to just to close this service

spirit Lord moving and dwelling in us Lord and not let other things come and hand her that father but we look because that was your desire Lord you're the only thing you wanted in return Lord was that we would just love you with all of our heart Lord and just delight ourselves in you and that you could just have fellowship Lord of us it seems so simple Lord and yet the thing that you lost with Adam and Eve was fellowship Lord you enjoyed going down and the call of the evening and talking fellowshipping that's what you enjoyed Lord you've made all this effort this to come down and fellowship with us Lord and may we may we do diligence Lord to spend time with you Lord into to keep not that you would like us worse if we didn't keep her into the bargain Lord button it's a from our grateful heart
