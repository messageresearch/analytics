========================================

[Music] disappear. Riches and fame and all that they could buy. I've come to find they never satisfy. What would I gain if my soul price? I don't want to love what the world loves. I don't want to chase what the world does. I only want you. I only want you. First things first, I seek your will, not my own. Surrender all my wants to you and keep the first thing first to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you. All my desires reversed to keep the first thing first. I give it all. My life and offering. My heart is yours. So have your way in me. Your kingdom's all I want to see. I don't want to love what the world loves. I don't want to chase what the world does. I only want you. I only want you. First things first, I seek your will, not my own. Surrender all my wants to you. And keep the first thing closed to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you. All my desires reversed to keep the first thing first. Lord, to keep the first thing first. All my desires reverse. To keep the first thing first. Oh, to keep the first thing first. Oh, first thing first, I seek your will, not my own. Surrender all my wants to you and keep the first thing first to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you. All my desires reverse. To keep the first thing first, to keep the first thing first. To keep the first thing first. All my desires be reversed to keep the first thing first. [Applause]
