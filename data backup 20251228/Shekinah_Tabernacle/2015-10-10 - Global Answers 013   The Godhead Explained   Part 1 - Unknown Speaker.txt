[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to Global answers please join us as we discuss the relevance of God's eternal word relating to events in this day and what it means to you and now your host Lonnie Jenkins Hello friends welcome to another session of global answers I have a special privilege the next probably three or four sessions to speak to you individually I'm not planning on having any guests in the studio with me I want to talk to you about probably one of the most controversial subjects out of scripture or Rel religion and that is the godhead is there one is there two is there three is there many that's going to be our subject for today the big question would be are there many gods is there only one God or is that one God somehow divided and I want to make this clear that such points as these could not be known in previous ages the Bible shows us clearly that that is to be a mystery saved till the time of the end Revelations 10:7 tells us during the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he's declared to a servants the prophets so consequently it was an unknown thing until this age many have probed at it many have studied it many speculations have come and so we're not trying in any way to put down what people have always believed or previously believed that's not the idea the idea is that we want to share with you what God has done in this age in unveiling scripture so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that would of course be the same angel that is the messenger to the last Church age in Revelations 3:14 it says under the angel of the Church of leoda that's the seventh Church seventh Gentile church and as we've told you before these churches though literal are actually symbolic of Ages to come and we're in that final age that Leo leodan age you can read about these in Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3 the term angel merely means messenger it can be a super Supernatural being it can be just a man with a message sent from God and so we see that this mystery of God is reserved until this unveiling is to take place in the voice of the seventh angel so keep in mind we're not trying to put down previous teachings or what your church taught or what the oldtime churches taught that's not the issue the issue is God has done something new and we just want to share with you what God has done in in this age so just before the second coming of the lord of the Lord Jesus Christ God has graciously sent us a thus saith the Lord on many biblical things points that are essential to our faith in preparation for the next really big event in God's program which is the resurrection and the Rapture or the catching away or the meeting in the air as is spoken of in first Thessalonians chap 4 verse veres 15 to1 17 Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and this age is required to have a faith unlike any previous age before because no other age has had to believe for a change in their body the meeting in the air the Rapture and uh we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of eye as Corinthians 15 says that's all the same event the change throws us into contact with the next Dimension and so this is the first age that's that has to have the faith to believe for that so consequently a very special message had to come a very pure word to bring a very pure Faith to prepare a people for this second coming this body's change so this series that we are embarking on today will last the next few meetings I'm not quite sure uh how many sessions we'll have together but I'm guessing we'll go probably another two or three uh at a minimum so we'll speak of the god of Abraham Isaac and Israel as the scripture refers to him is he one is he two is he three we look at various scriptures and we can see how the people could draw conclusions in Deuteronomy uh 3 239 it says see now that I even I am he there is no God with me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand for I lift up my hand to heaven and say I live forever that's God speaking God spoke through his prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 469 remember the former things of bold for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand I will do all my pleasure so when a god declares that he alone can tell you the future and holds the future there is no God except the god of the Bible that does those things because he holds holds the future he can tell you what the future will be and so he declares that what makes him the outstanding God of all the things that people might call Gods Moses wrote Under the inspiration of God in Deuteronomy 6:4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so when we look at that our conclusion would obviously be it seems there is one God but then we go into the Psalms and we listen to David in Psalms 1101 and it says the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol and that's of course if we break it down just a little bit that's the Lord Jehovah said unto my Lord adone now this this word adone is used in reference to Kings to men to God to Masters rulers husbands prophets princes Governors then then sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol it could be that we can now draw the conclusion there are two gods and then now we jump into the New Testament in Matthew 3 3:16 when Jesus went down to be baptized by the prophet John and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo Heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him listen now and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so now in these scriptures we see Jesus the son the Holy Spirit like a dove and the father speaking from heaven now what's our conclusion now it almost looks like there's three and yet when we go back to Moses writings the Lord our God is one God then we know we know that there has to only be one so consequently many say oh he's three in one and some say he's three persons yet one God some say he's three like water and in various stages water can be liquid water can be solid and be ice water can be powerful like Steam and yet all three forms are still water could it be that God has appeared in many forms some people say that God there are three manifestations or offices of God in the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost we often hear the term Trinity that actually is not a scriptural word it's not in the Bible Trinity according to the new international encyclopedia the term Trinity was originated by a a Roman Catholic father named tertullian and then looking further into the EOL glossery it says tertullian was the first one to use the term trinus which is Trinity to describe the godhead but of course that goes on to say in so doing he paved the way of the development of the Orthodox trinitarian or christological trinitarian doctrines and this was in about ad. 200 a good 150 years after the forming of the Christian church in the book of Acts at Pentecost God declares to his prophet Isaiah Isaiah 45 522 look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear so there is a God that swears he is an absolute and one day everyone will know it right now this is called the day of man there's great debate about God some saying there is no such thing as God or a supernatural being as a godhead but those who believe know there is and many have had an experience to meet that personal God now this subject is not merely theology excuse me and not just for our better understanding and here's why proper understanding is essential hold on to this now we don't know where it is God is taking us unless we understand about God and Christ how do we know how to get to a place unless we know what the goal is the scripture says in Romans 8:29 that we are promised to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren so this conforming to the image of Christ so what is our destiny as Believers to be conformed or fashioned like unto God's son so what would that be many try to make it simple and say oh that's just to be like Jesus but again we have a question because now they're thinking about Jesus of Nazareth yet that Jesus of Nazareth said to the father in John 175 now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was so Jesus was more than just the man born of the Virgin Mary before the foundation of the world he had a glory that was God's glory now we'll see how that was as we continue in this study Paul writes in First Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the Sea and did all meat excuse me eat the same spiritual meat here comes the verse now and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank from that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ so now we have Jesus of Nazareth declaring that he had a glory that was God's Own Glory before the foundation of the world we see that he was with uh the children of Israel as that rock in the in the wilderness so this conforming to that image is still is just a little bit uh mysterious we've got to be conformed to that image Paul writes similarly in he to the Hebrews Church in 11: 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward so here's Moses long before Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary here's Moses willing to stand the reproach of Christ remember we're to be conformed formed to this image so we see from many scriptures that Christ was in existence before he came into flesh we'll understand that in this series now another part of this puzzle called the godhead John wrote in chapter 1: 18 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has de declared him so Adam was also a Son of God but he was created not begotten so Jesus the only begotten son now Luke writes God is a spirit so now how can a spirit God have a flesh son we've all heard about the blood of Jesus Christ and so we go through the scriptures we find the blood of Christ the blood of Jesus and the book of Acts declares that the Church of God was purchased by God's own blood acts 20:28 but of course that's not too difficult to understand in one sense the blood of every father is in his child not Mother's blood the father's blood is in his children in the womb the baby is fed by the mother's blood but there's a separating veil in there to keep the mother's blood from becoming the child's blood at Birth only the father's blood is in that child and the the life of that child is in that blood cell the life is in the blood cell keep that in mind we're going to need that fact as we go further along it's important when in this series we reach Calvary and the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ we're going to see how important it is that we know whose life was in that blood cell that was broken at Calvary so now let's gather our scriptures directly related to our study you can read with me there on your television screen first we will look at creation Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth so somewhere at some point God declares a beginning for God himself there was no beginning he's Eternal Eternal has no beginning and no end so in the beginning God created Heaven and Earth in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you will understand that by the time we finish this series the same was in the beginning with God a second person or some other understanding will'll see that as we go in the series now here's how it ties to Genesis all things were made by him and without him was not anything made made that was made so now in the beginning God created heaven and earth now we find in John that he made that creation by the word so God created in Genesis the word created in John and then in Ephesians 3:9 it says that God who created All Things by Jesus Christ so here we have our first significant point in the study of the godhead God created by the word and the name of that word is Jesus Christ in Revelations 1913 it says his name is called the word of God that's not his name but he's called the word of God but his name is Jesus now in Colossians 1:15 you can read starting above this but we'll start there it's speaking about Jesus Christ and it says in Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so this invisible God is beginning to become visible and declare himself through Christ Christ becomes the image and then it says the firstborn of every creature so that goes back far beyond the birth out of the Virgin Mary that goes back before there was a a rooster or a hen or an elephant or a lion or a human it goes back even before that so before there was any creature he was the firstborn so now we find out how was he the firstborn to become the manifestation of the invisible God I'll give you just a simple thought on that a word is a thought expressed when we speak a word it becomes an expression of my invisible thought so God god with his great thinking desired expression and out of the thoughts of God came the word and then Colossians 1:16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible this Dimension or other dimensions whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers Here Comes an important part now all things were created by him that's Christ and for him by him and for him we many times want to get ourselves in the picture there and and want it created for us it isn't it's all for God if we go back and just study the name of Jehovah and the name of Elohim or the name of Adonai we find that those Hebrew names for God all boil down to the self-existent one who reveals himself and that's what we're studying now this self-existing one this invisible one desires to reveal himself he wants to be made known now back to Colossians 1:1 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence that's what Christ's position is to be to the believer everything we talk about everything we live for everything we know about is to be Christ the focus of our life Colossians 1:19 for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell all fullness in Colossians chapter 2 it says he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so when the godhead what do we term the godhead that's Father Son and Holy Ghost so all of those entities were in This Man Called Jesus Christ of Nazareth such a mystery how can all of God be in a man we'll find out as we continue in our study so we can see from these scriptures that the mystery surrounding the invisible God is revealed and through revealed in and through through Christ or to put it in another way Christ is the mystery of God revealed we have a book on that very subject and that's the title of it Christ The Mystery of God revealed you can go to on to our website which may be on the screen right now but if not we can put it on we'll put it on at the end of the screen and you'll see that the book will be available to you Christ is the mystery of God revealed now let's go into this same subject with some graphics and some illustrations and we are told by researchers that we remember much greater portion of what we see than actually what we hear so we're wanting to move now to a visual image so that you can see more about God and we'll just barely get started our time is almost up we told you that God is invisible but we have to show something on the screen rather than an invisible God so this light that you see on the screen represents the invisible God and in that invisible God were certain attributes desires things that were in him you remember in Colossians 1 it says everything was created by Him and for him so it was in him to be a judge it was in him to be a redeemer and if you think of each one of these that if he wants to Manifest this attribute to us then if he's going to be a redeemer someone has to be lost he wants to be believed we find that Adam and Eve stepped away from belief we find the early church stepped away from belief the the Jewish Church stepped away that's when then God turned to the Gentiles now he's working with us he in him is to be a Healer someone has to be sick in him is to be a guide someone has to be lost in him is to be a family catch that he's not going to create a family God is going to be a family for he's sharing his own eternal life so God in his family we can read about that in Corinthians 15 again he wants to be a comforter so consequently somebody has to be uncomfortable to need a comforter he wants to be a husband so there has to be a bride and we find that's the Gentile church he wants to be a savior someone has to be lost he wants to be a deliverer counselor provider Creator father King God Shepherd trusted and alsoo much more so therefore out of the mind of this great God comes a a a plan and unveiling through which we can learn more about him and learn about this invisible God so he makes a way for us to see this invisible God now out of God as he begins to man manifest himself out of God the materialization of God's thoughts comes this term in the Bible called the logos so the mind of God the attributes of God are now going to be expressed in word form this logos that comes out from God and we see this little looks like DNA floating around inside of this logos that's representing the attributes of God that are now that that now they've moved out of thought form coming into expression and then in moving into this expression we find that this logos is Christ and even the uh dictionary definitions and concordances will tell you the same Christ a theophany a body for Jehovah it is the anointing this is the son in a per figure remember father let them see me with the glory that I had with thee before the world was so the logos is Christ it's the anointed word here we got the Strong's Concordance definition down there logos equals something said including the thought and that part's important the logos something said including the thought and that the the Divine expression which is Christ so if we take God's word but change the thought we find that this attribute of God is no longer logos and now the logos of God is likened unto the germ that's in a seed in that the germ is what produces what the seed should reproduce so the thought of God placed into the word of God if not perverted will produce what God had in his mind but if we take that same word and add a different thought to it than what God had in his mind then the word can't produce prod what it's supposed to produce the classic example of that God calls his word a seed and every seed Genesis 111 has the ability to bring forth of its own kind God's word is a seed so if we hybrid a natural seed we mix it with something else now the end product is not uh easily determined the hybrid product can now produce an offshoot mixed with the original but not bringing forth after its own kind and I fear friends of mine that All Through the Ages man has concocted many things that have been injected into the word of God to hybrid it and that's why we don't see produced by the Church of the Living God what God is calling for because it has an injection in into it of man's thoughts man's Creeds man's dogmas that has killed the effect of the word of God so we do not see Christ on display as we ought come back with this next session friends we're going to continue on this God bless [Music] you please take the time to send a note telling us what you think of the program top you'd like to see
