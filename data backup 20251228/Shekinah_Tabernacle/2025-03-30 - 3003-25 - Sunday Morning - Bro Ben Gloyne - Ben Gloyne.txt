to have you praise the Lord amen welcome got brother Chris sukul God bless you amen good to see you bro amen we got brother Daniel as well God bless you amen welcome amen praise God great to have everyone here today amen we're just going to go straight to the scripture um now now we're just going to go to Psalms 25 just got two scriptures to read one in Psalms 25 and then the other uh is in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 so amen so here we are says the if everyone's turning amen praise the Lord are we up it does work yeah I upload my slideshot I'm not sure it actually gets there but it gets there so that's always good amen Psalms 25:4 the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant praise the Lord then we're going to go to Deuteronomy 29 and verse 29 um save you turning or you can if you wish but we're just going to read here it says the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you want to be remembered in prayer I probably say every service but you would to be remember say Lord remember me today amen past be not a gentle savior hear my humble cry amen gracious father as we bow our heads in our hearts in your presence Lord both here and those who are streaming Lord God we father we've come to call Upon Your Great Name Lord to gather in your presence Lord Jesus that you would have complete control of Our Lives Lord we lord my heart's desire as when all is said and done Lord this service is done we walk out the doors father Lord I myself and Lord all of us here Lord would be closer to you father Lord you'd wash Us by Your Word dear God you would refine us you'd mold us you'd take us a step higher Lord may you grant that for your glory Lord we need you Lord pray your blood would cover us all Lord but forgive us of our sins and our wrongs our trespasses Lord cleanse us of our secret faults Lord those things we not even aware of Father cleanse us of those dear God and may you have your way today Father we thank you Lord we can return once again and gather as a people and Praise Your Great Name so may he be glorified in our midst father and those who couldn't be here today Lord we lift them into your presence as well meet their needs touch their hearts dear God we thank you so much for this opportunity to be in your presence in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you you can have your seats may the Lord bless the reading of his word this morning amen so I just want to speak about uh the secret that we carry you it's like a husband and wife there's a secret between them the the world may see certain aspects of it but it's the it's the relationship they have that only they share amen and then and so there's this Covenant that we have with the Lord you know I was thinking um about the you know the parable of the wise and foolish virgins how you know five had oil and five didn't so five was carrying a secret that only they knew that they had and um I'm so thankful that through the message of the hour God has released the Holy Ghost upon the people again amen that there is an oil there's a there's a there's an inexhaustible Fountain supply of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's not just with us but in US amen Christ in you the hope of glory so you know if we look at this here I just want to maybe uh just just walk through this a bit and see how we go but you know he says the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him Now that fear is a reverence there's an awe you know when you when you talk to any True Believer and irrespective of what state they're in they have a genuine reverence for God you know someone who's even lost in the world I remember myself before the Lord ever found me I still have a had a reverence for him he's God you know he's not just an idol or an idea he's a reality and you know so so so there's a real fear but you know you see you know a a a a Godly fear but that secret of his Covenant there is is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant so there's a promise there's this there's there's a union that that that he will prove and show now to me in the Bible when when when God ever says he'll show you something he's not just showing you an idea he's not showing you just some a theory but he's going to prove something to you he's going to reveal something to you that becomes part of you like when when the apostle Paul said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed he's not saying look I'm going to tell you something to tickle your brain I'm going to reveal you something that's going to change your life amen to prove to to to Anchor into your heart that this is not the End Amen but we're all going to be change doesn't matter how you know death is just a travel bus to where we want to get to brother Ron Spencer um said many years ago and I and I agree with that death is just a Gateway it's just a door Amen to get us to where we want to go which is Glory right but but the Apostle Paul he says I show you a mystery he says I'm going to show you a revelation that God has revealed to me and I pray it's going to be quickened into your heart so so this Covenant that God shows amen it's not an abstract idea it's a reality amen it's proved amen you got to you you got to look through your life and see God has proved his Covenant amen where he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee that you will stand on the head of the serpent you will be a conqueror amen you will overcome yourself even amen that's a proof of God's covenant cuz he said that he's going to come and dwell in a people and you know he's going to prove his word what does he do he shows it in you we don't just walk around with Theory amen I you I pray you don't we just don't walk around with some quotes and scriptures and say look I've got this it's no it becomes a reality in our lives amen where the power of Calvary is not an idea or a nice story it becomes alive and I pray that if it's just a story to you it doesn't stay a story am me it's got to go beyond a story book idea and a Sunday school thing it becomes a reality but when it becomes a reality it belongs to you amen because it's a secret thing it belongs to God but as soon as it's revealed it belongs to you it becomes your possession you own it amen it's not something that you just have part-time it's yours all the time amen so if it's yours all the time and if it belongs to you amen if it's yours you should let it live in your life amen it's like if you bought a new car it belongs to you amen or maybe someone gave you a new car so you didn't have the money but someone had the money and they bought the car and they gave it to you what good is it just sitting in your garage or in your driveway or on the street amen you got to let it work you got to sit in the thing put the key in the ignition or maybe just push a button amen and let it work amen so because it's yours and if anyone comes along and says you have no right to be in that car you say no it belongs to me I mean this is my possession and how many times the Devil comes along in a promise of God he'll say it's not yours you don't qualify for it you're not worthy enough to receive it amen you're not in the the condition that it can operate in your life you going say no devil it belongs to me amen this redemp every Redemptive blessing of God Is Mine amen it's not just the prophets it's not just someone else but it's mine amen and if it's yours let it work amen let it let it take control of your life I mean I think there's a you we're living in a day where we actually let God be God Amen we we've I always think of you brother and Paul when I think about those things I remember you saying that one time it just really struck me we're going to let God be God Amen but the problem is that many times we don't let him be God you say how could we you know it's you know we come to a point or sometimes we come to a point because the devil wants us to forget what belongs to us right that's what he wants to do because he realizes if he can if he can actually uh diminish the power of this Covenant remember God has given us an unconditional Covenant am mean so remember with Adam and Eve he you know he said if you eat of the tree this will happen and you know with the law it says if you do this I'll do this but with Abraham it was unconditional I have made you father of many nations but he wasn't even in a condition to be a father he couldn't have a child with Sarah Sarah couldn't have a child herself they weren't even in condition when God gave them the promise you are the father of many nations so so basically God said to Abraham look Abraham I know you can't do it so therefore I'm going to step in and I'm going to do it for you amen and When God says he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle he's not saying if you keep this I'll do this he says no I'm going to make you so amen so God's transforming power comes into our life which is his Covenant to you and I amen and manifest his promises with you friends if I jump around too much maybe I just get too happy and you're got to realize we have all things in Christ amen we don't have just some of the promises maybe part-time every Redemptive blessing he died for is yours you've just got to let it live and so what did Abraham do he surrended himself to the revelation God gave him I mean cuz when God showed him his new name of Abraham he didn't say that's a nice idea he let God transform him to become what God called him and that's why brother Braham said I no longer call you church I'll call you bride that you'll understand we're no longer a denominational Church we're no longer a group of people just a religious people no God has called us out am mean to be the Bride of Jesus Christ he's I'm going to give you a different Covenant they have their promises you've got your promises I mean like Hagar had some promises but Sarah had different promises amen Sarah had a body chain she had a promised son amen she had that you know she had that promise Hagar had her promises right God took care of Hagar you go read the scripture God spoke to Hagar open the well did all those things for her God took care of them God will take care of them but we're under a different Covenant amen so why should we mix the things and try and say well we just like everyone else no God has called me out am mean he hasn't called me out to be religious he's called me out to walk with him amen this is what this covenant's done he says I want to walk with you I want to know you amen I want to live in your life life I want to prove my word in your life sir praise the Lord amen you see so we live so so all everything he has revealed belongeth unto us now I'm going to make a Quantum jump here the book of redemption that was in the right hand of God on the throne it's been revealed it belongs to you everything Adam lost is now in your possession I mean everything what did Adam lose dominion over the Earth godship upon the Earth see the devil wants to make him think that he's God of this Earth some people you know he's the God of this evil age but he's not our God he's not the god of the Bride I mean his politics and fussing and fighting and and and carnality and all these things that he pushes fors and you know uh religious ideas and all these different things he's he isn't Our God God is our God but now God has God wants to prove his Covenant that he has restored us back to have dominion over Satan amen this is this is what belongs to us friends we don't have to put up with any of his nonsense amen we can no we have a right to stand upon the word of God and believe and know God will fulfill his word how he wants it fulfilled sometimes it can be an instant Miracle that's God's healing power sometimes it can be a process of time and you get well that's still God's healing power right brother said a Divine Healing takes time A Miracle is instant it's all God sometimes God will send you to a doctor brother BR says it's your duty to go to the doctor I went to the doctor the other day he says I haven't seen you in over a year Well I hadn't you know my my medical um PL youo GP used to send us letter saying are you still part of this Clinic cuz we haven't seen you in five years so I don't run to doctors every time but I go if I need to it's your duty right sometimes God will use that sometimes just a bit of love or care or understanding God or or by music God heals by many things but it's still God but the Bride of Jesus Christ has come to a place that they're willing whatever God whatever however Avenue you want to use and sometimes sickness will take us to the other side that's still uh you're still liberated from the sickness right but I believe we've come to a point that we're willing for God to answer his word however he wants see the world has people get annoyed or offended at God because God doesn't answer him God doesn't answer according to how they want him to uh but he's God we're not right so I believe we've come to a point Lord however you want to fulfill your word we're happy with it amen now we read we read um last week about the priest standing in the Jordan now after um before they priest came out of the Jordan uh Joshua commanded um well Joshua command the priest saying comeing out of the Jordan it came to pass when the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord will come out of the midst of the Jordan and The Souls of the priest's feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the Waters of Jordan returned into their place and flowed over all his Banks as they did before and the people came up out of the Jordan on the 10th day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of Jericho and those 12 Stones which they took out of the Jordan that Joshua pitch and gilgal so they took these stones out of out of the Jordan and they took them to and they M and you know they made them they made them a mound right now there's a purpose of this right because it says here and he spake unto the children of Israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers uh in time to come saying what mean these Stones then you shall let your children know saying Israel came over this Jordan on dry land for the Lord your God dried up the Waters of Jordan from before you until you were passed over as the Lord uh your god did to the Red Sea which he dried up from before us until they were gone over that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord that is mighty that ye may fear the lord your God forever amen so this was a monument of stones that that the people would know they would first ask the question what are these Stones doing here then the answer would come well God made us go over this Jordan on dry ground and then the account would be told of the priest of the Ark you're on the ark standing in the Jordan and the waters parted we crossed over and we came into our inheritance but the whole purpose of this is that the people would know that you know the all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord that it is mighty that you may fear the lord your God forever so these Stones were were a good rock testimony amen they are a good rock testimony they are proof of God's covenant now in this day God is Not Looking for heap of natural stones he's looking for Living Stones amen he's looking for a living people as it would say in the book of Peter that we are living stones or Lively Stones built up into the house of God am mean so so so we're not a bunch of of of rocks like this that can't speak they can't have action they can't walk they can't talk but God's gone from a from a testimony of stone to a testimony of living Stone amen where there's a people that actually have a rock testimony of God's Deliverance of the proof of his Covenant you got to realize if you know if God's saved you you've got a testimony you've got a rock testimony if God's done the smallest sing for you that's a living you're a living testimony Hallelujah so never let the devil diminish your testimony God's done Mighty things God's done Eternal things I mean he saved your soul from hell that's an incredible thing Hallelujah that's a mighty thing he's done so never let the devil diminish it down and say well I'm just a message believer and this is what I do and I was raised in this no there should have come a day and there has come a day where the light came on where the reality of the word struck your life and now you become a living testimony where it's not just your mom and dad's Covenant with God or God Covenant with them rather but now it's God's covenant with you am mean that where now you are a living proof am mean where God has done a supernatural work as word has come open to you and now what do you do you are the evidence of God's covenant amen amen you are the living proof you want the you want the proof this message is true we should be the billboard of the proof that Calvary Works amen we should be the proof you know our lives should be the proof that that the blood atones the blood saves the blood delivers the blood heals the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just as real now as it was back then that there is overcoming power in God Amen Hallelujah but remember it's it's it's him that does it right used to be times past people would try and just mechanically line up with the word you can never mechanically line up with the word I mean Israel tried to do that under the blood of bulls and goats they miserably failed I mean people of Believers of Ages p and God bless them but you know they tried to mechanically line up with the word no you got to let God line you up with the word through a surrendered life amen so it's a good rock testimony now just like brother um brother Alistair and by the way sends us greetings he said he loved being here with you uh you on Wednesday and and and seeing the Saints and so on so God bless you all for for being such a great testimony amen but you know just as he is saying it's that Rod of Aaron that buds that life amen that comes forth was actually which actually quietens down the accuser's voice because now here is living evidence that the presence of God has Vindicated a life amen and so and remember it's it's it's his word in our life that he vindicates if you want God to vindicate your life stay with the word but let him Li live it out of you I mean I trust that makes sense there's a big difference between someone surrendered to the word and then God living it then someone trying to hold the word themselves because we've seen sadly at doesn't work if we try and do it in our own strength we yield Our Lives to the Lord and then we let him do it right but you see now so these Stones now would silence would silence the thought that God doesn't exist because it was a testimony to the whole world that the hand of the Lord is mighty and that the fear of the Lord yeah and that you might fear the lord your God forever you'd have a reverence for him forever am mean so now as as living stones now the life of God should silence the accuser's voice they don't like to be silenced they'll never agree sadly unless they repent but you see it should accuse it should silence the voice of the devil trying to tell you you don't have anything right a rock testimony deals with his voice we've all had points I'm sure me very much included where we where where the devil tries to pin us in a corner that God don't care anymore that he's not real that he doesn't prove his word that that that our situation is actually out outside his ability to solve who's had that never ever agree with that we're never none of us are special cases none of us are not reachable savable helpable by God okay never ever get that in your mind that the devil's tentacles are too deep and too I tell you what his tentacles were deep in our lives by our first birth his tentacles were very deep and The Roots ran in many multiple parts of our life and our forbears and everything am mean but God rich in Mercy his consuming fire came down and burnt out every work of the enemy amen doesn't matter how deep how you it's like your you your family could be known for a temper for example and it's in every one of your family High Strung High Temple but God comes in and burns that out amen that you're not you don't have that personality trait anymore cuz God has taken care of it's that deep root that the devil's put in to try and make you be identified by that God has burnt it out completely I believe he does that kind of thing amen that we can look back and say I'm not like my parents that's right in some ways we are cuz God doesn't change us he he keeps the good things takes away the bad things right but those bad things are gone Hallelujah you know the best thing that you fire deals with everything just get in the fire of the word and let him start working and you'll see bugs fly you'll see things die you'll see things burned up amen but amen we're built our souls are built to not be burnt up in the fire amen but he just burns out all the devil's Works amen praise God and I'm glad for that amen so what do you do now so why he does that to show his Covenant now the children of Israel were fighting I'm just going to leave that picture up there sorry Lilia I don't have many pictures today so let's leave that one up there but the children of Israel were went to go fight Moab and they journeyed seven days into the desert and they realized they had no they had no water so uh so they thought well they're going to die and they're going to you know God's brought them out there and into the desert but it wasn't his idea it was their idea and then and then the prophet came along and said make the valley full of ditches you know and then God will bring water right so because the reason in that desert was the smitten rock where the water flows from Christ himself they just had to get rid of the logs and all these things dig it all out that the water could flow again and the devil loves to put dams in our life logs in our life of false Doctrine misunderstandings all these things but we've got to always remember God we always got to remember what God did when he first found us that sweetness and that joy that that that reverence that thankfulness that you had when you know everything seemed new who remembers that time amen I remember that time everything seemed new you see his Sonet it's like Lord you just painted that for me that's right praise God I think that still amen praise the Lord anyway you see you see so you got to remember so so if if that kind of state is gone then a log has come in troubles come in remember the devil's allowed to do it but God's greater than the log right just because things trouble may come in you know God wants to show us his Covenant how does he do that in times of trouble in times of hardship and Times of misunderstanding and Times of strife he proves his Covenant praise God hallelujah so now here they were they're in the desert they thought they were going to die and all these things you know they got a prophet to come and you know and God spoke through him say dig out make the valley full of ditches and God will bring water okay so then what happened is that so they did that according to the word of the prophet and the next morning the moabites they got up they got their armor on they were ready to fight standing on their border and then they saw the water that was that had come out of out of the holes that the that the Israelites had dug and they thought it was blood probably based on how the Sun was shining on it or something I guess God just made them see it that way and they thought well Israel's killing each other let's go fight but when they got there am mean the Israelites rose up and they slew the slew the moabites and they chased them back to their country and what they did is they as they as they picked up a bunch of rocks after they cut down the trees and all these things and they stopped up their Wells amen and brother Ram says that that is a good rock testimony amen where you see the power of God living in your life now you've got a rock you got a testimony what can you do you can silence amen the voice of the accuser Why by putting that testimony on his head amen well how do you put it on his head you you take your testimony and you take what he says you say no my testimon is greater than what you say we've got to see see the devil uses reasoning use reasoning against him what is Godly reasoning agreeing with the word amen so if he reasons well there's this problem this has happened you shouldn't have done this this then you just take it back to the scripture say no no the blood of the Lord Jesus is more than enough amen this is is not the end of the story God's able to deliver amen I placed my family in his hands he's more than able to save amen this is not the end so th though the world is falling apart I cannot fall apart cuz my life is built upon his Rock of Revelation amen see the next morning the enemy looked up he looked across there and when he did it was it was water but to the enemy the way the Sun was shining it only looked like blood and it scared him that's right it got a little silly thought woked up in his mind trapped him right into it what did the prophet say to them uh why now this is a little thing the Lord if all you just get those logs out of the way I'll take care of the rest of it if you get all the unbelief out of the way God will take care of the rest of it you know what happened he said each man pick you up a rock I'm going to give you the land I'm going to let you possess it and each the man took a rock and then got over there and where them old formal Wells was he just took that old rock he just had a good old rock testimony amen praise God God give me the Holy Ghost I'm like Simon I'm like Peter now a little Stone amen and everybody just his own rock in his hand a real testimony a real fiery testimony when Jesus come before Peter said your name is Simon and from henceforth he should be called Peter that's that is a little Stone brother he picked that up he knowed that that was the Messiah away he went and he stopped up formal Wells with it you have the same ability what is what is formality it's taking a heart out of anything it becomes a form loud or quiet it can just become a formality if the people just go through the motions amen but if you take your testimony it'll stop that formality well amen because it'll actually because you realize hey God has done something for me God Has Changed Me God has made me closer more like him God has been shaping my testimony by his word am mean the washing of the water of the word just like those stones in Jordan were shaped by the water flowing over them I mean God has done a work Hallelujah God does care amen I say these things cuz that that'll stop up that formal well it'll put your heart back into your worship and your walk with God once again hallelujah amen praise the Lord now God loves to show his testimony right his his Covenant so I'm just I'm just going to make a bit of a segue here um if you don't mind you don't know where I'm going so I guess you can't say that's fine but you see now God Wants You and I right he doesn't want our talents he doesn't actually care about the gifts we have he wants you okay you may think well what about my gift God will use it but he wants you he gets you then he'll he'll use the gift right not the other way around now it says speaking of David he says and when he had removed him so speaking of Saul he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart what shall fulfill all my will man I read that I think man Lord may you write that about me Lord that I'm a man after your own heart to I'll fulfill all your word all your will not just a partial part of your will for the bride but the entire will am mean of your word you see so David David had a genuine let's see if I can find a find another picture here David had a genuine reverence and a love for God right he had a genuine and and you see the thing is when your whole life your whole heart is put into serving God then you actually fall into God's hands and God can use you like more than just giving a part of yourself to him okay so here is here is David now now remember our opening scriptures that God would show um God would uh the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant right so now part of God's covenant with Israel is that one would chase a thousand that you'll dwell in your land and you'll conquer your enemy and all these things but now God has to find someone to show that to to prove it to so it goes beyond a nice sermon on a on a Saturday or whenever they would worship you know the well I don't think they had synagogues back in David's day but you know what I mean it' be it' be more than just reading jeromy or Exodus or or Leviticus but it become a living reality so here David now was a man after God's Own Heart that he would fulfill all of God's Will and we know sure David made mistakes he did worse things than Saul did but he was quick to repent he was quick to say Lord I'm standing in the need of prayer I'm wrong Lord and that's what to me made him a man after God's Own Heart so here is David now because he's now in the hands of God he hasn't just given his gift of playing music to God but his whole life is the Lords I mean therefore because he's he he's he's allowed himself to be fully surrendered into God's hands nothing's going to move him nothing's going to move him so you see when Goliath came along and and um you know made his challenge bring me a man to fight me and you know he manipulated Israel to stay there for 40 days under fear and torment and all these things you know those those Israelites were being moved by the psychology of Goliath they were moved by the reasoning of Goliath but David because he was in the hands of God God and and God had already shown him his Covenant how did he show him his Covenant well he killed a lion and he killed a bear that was God showing David his Covenant it was more more than just in his mind it was in his heart Lord I've seen you prove your Covenant in my life cuz you think about a little buy boy even even what about 13 years old or whatever he was a lion and a beer and you've got a slingshot and you've got a staff and you got a dagger that that was more than him killing those animals amen I've seen videos on YouTube hunters in South Africa big high powerered guns and there's like four of them with these big big cannons trying to kill Lions a line almost Chows one of them and you know all these things you think about now here's an angry angry lion with blood he's got the taste of blood you know he's not going to be a little a you know like a lion I never seen a scared lion they're always angry even a little cuup is angry I remember even like a Lepard I held a leopard cup maholo I know how old it was little thing like a kitten it was mad it wasn't going meow it was like growling at me this thing was angry it's like a lion they just they're just angry things so here he already tasted by you know the blood of the sheep that goes it grab on could carry it off here comes David charging after it it wasn't his natural ability that killed that lion and killed that bear it was God showing him his Covenant amen and then when Goliath came along see what was what was David standing on who is this uncircumcised Philistine I mean he was standing on the fact God has given me made me part of his Covenant he shown me his Covenant he shown me his promise shown me his word amen therefore he realized God has given me a covenant I'm a circumcised son of Abraham who's this guy he didn't speak about his stature didn't speak about how strong he was even Saul knew the reputation of Goliath you know he'd say to David David this man has been a Warrior from his Youth and you're but a youth David didn't bring that into the equation all he was looking at is God's covenant that's all that mattered to David who's with me this morning amen who's with me amen so he could see that you know David had God had made a covenant with David it's one thing to make a promise to God when God makes a promise to you and that's what he's done through the message of the hour he's given you his Covenant hallelujah amen so so here's David he all he's look he's not looking at size ability stature weapons um reputation he's not looking at any of those things he's just looking at covenant and that's why he says who is this uncircumcised Philistine that should defy the armies of the Living God and you see what s um if you go read the account Goliath he just told told Israel that they were just the Servants of Saul you see a man who doesn't have a covenant with God just looks at Natural Things David having a covenant with God he's looking at Supernatural things he he wasn't looking at the armies of Israel as the Servants of Saul he saying no these people here are the armies of the Living God Amen and it's the same thing with you and I friends if you can look beyond the carnal I mean look beyond the devil's reasoning oh that's brother son so that's just a son so no they're part of the armies of the Living God hallelujah they are the mighty host amen God has raised up in the end time to prove his word through am mean they bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Life Is Life they are him amen we're going to look beyond the flesh look Beyond The Faults and the problems and the humanity we're to look Beyond those things David looked beyond it they the armies of the Living God well it didn't they they weren't behaving like them they were in their little fox holes hiding away scared of this one man but David didn't look at what they're doing they look at what they meant actually what they were ordained to be but because David was in the hands of hands of God he could step out there in that Battlefield and he ran towards Goliath when he fought him he didn't stand there still like many children's bible stories and he stands no no he ran and he's running you read the account he takes a stone out puts it in a sling and starts swinging Hallelujah why because go he knew God would show him his Covenant in every circumstance Hallelujah that's why we go through many different things in life God wants to show you every stage of life my Covenant Works my word works it stands it proves itself amen it stands for itself amen I will prove my word if you're young you're old you're married you're not married children no children grandchildren rich poor whatever you know life throws you big curveball my Covenant Works my word Works hallelujah amen but you see David David was was one man he was in the hands of God and by standing on God's word he rallied around I mean I mean he he he rallied Israel amen and they won the day praise the Lord so I'm just still trying to because my notes are never in order so it's a bit of a problem it is right amen so you see you know it's like Jesus when when he went to feed the feed the multitude and uh his disciples getting all worried saying look it's three days away you you we have no food we can't disperse them and how are we going to feed these people and and a little boy with his lunch because many times we think we have nothing God could like how can God use my life the devil wants you to think that how can God use me I'm not able I'm not smart I'm not whatever whatever excuse the devil allows that to come that reason come into your mind because he the devil's afraid of you he's scared you know you know what gives you know what gives the devil nightmares if he ever sleeps you doesn't matter what age you are he's afraid if they really if they really let God live I can't stand before them amen I'll be thoroughly defeated as I was in the desert amen or whenever I tried to come against the Lord Jesus I'll be completely defeated amen whatever Mountain I put in their life it's going to move you know brother Ram says if a spirit filled son or daughter of God takes the word of God and speaks it across their lips it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to move nothing can stand before that man the devil knows that the devil knows that the devil's got test see he's on the other side of the testimony right we're on the Victorious side he's on the defeated side so he remembers every impact of God that he's received amen through the people of God that's right so he's got testimonies too they ain't good ones right he came out the the loser but now he knows the impact of the word against him in previous generations and he knows the impact of the word through the prophet's life now what about you that's why he thinks what you know that's why he wants us to think well God could never use me yeah I'm just I'm just an adequate I just can't do it but you know there was a day when as I was saying that you know Jesus wanted to feed the people and little boy with his lunch came along carrying a few Loaves and a few fishes brother Bram said he skipped school he heard the you know crowd he just wanted to see what was going on and he found himself before the Lord saying here here's my lunch here's these Loaves and Fishes you know in the hands of the little boy it could only do so much feed himself but in the hands of God it could feed a multitude it could be multiplied and spread far more than he could ever imagine with his own ability the boy's ability right so whatever you put in the hands of God God will use it far more than you can realize amen but he wants more than a gift placed in his hand he wants you placed in his hand just like David hallelujah amen because now gifts weaken now this is me well so especially the church world today they think their gift will grant them access to Heaven because of what they have done right as as it would say here Matthew if I can find it he says where are false prophets which come in to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they rly ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes or Thorns or um sorry Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even every good uh tree bringeth forth good fruit but a crup tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot uh a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a crup tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is he down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them says by their life amen say so what is what is our life producing is it the Life of Christ is it his word what are our lives producing I trust it is I trust we're Aaron's Rod budding forth am mean there's actually a life and you know that that people can see those people are real Christians may not disagree with what they believe but I can see there's a real Christianity there's a real life of God amen because he says not everyone that sayith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so so the modern Church world today thinks that a gift means god is there in terms of that's their Vindication as a gift that is not a Vindication no it's the life of the word living out right it's it's it's staying with the word see he says he says I never knew you what he was never see he knew them in the sense that he knew that they were there but he was never became one with them amen and this is what we're called to be is become one with Christ above all things right so so it's a life that's produced now it's amazing when you look at gifts because even even you know God God gives gifts to everyone the gift and calling of God is without repentance right so people have gifts they're born with them amen I'm sure this is not um strange to anyone here you see even even Ezekiel would speak about the prince of Tyrus he says son of man say unto the prince of tyus thus sayeth the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am I am a God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God um though thou set thy heart as the heart of God behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel so he's a man who's got more wisdom than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee with thy But but so so here's a man he's wiser than wiser than Daniel there's no secret that can be hidden but look at what he does with this wisdom and this gift that he has with thy wisdom with thy understanding thou has gotten the riches thou has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by thy wisdom and by thy traffic thou um thou increase thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches so so his heart was lifted up because of what was what what he was gathering through the gift he had in his life there's a big difference between a man using a gift and God using a gift right this man was using his own wisdom his own gift to gather Treasures build his own Empire and how many people around the around Christendom build a kingdom by a gift they've been given amen but we're not called to be like like that we're called to give a whole life that the word can change every part of our life amen that we're not just using a gift and and and and and then and then vindicating our our Christianity by how much God uses us I'm not a Christian because I'm a preacher I'm not a Christian because I'm a pastor that doesn't no I'm a Christian because he found me and saved me and cleansed Me by his blood that's why I'm a Believer if I never preached another sermon in my life that ain't going to change me walking with God Amen it's got nothing to do with it really I am I'm a Believer yes sir right he just placed me in this position for his glory right but but if I couldn't preach anymore I wouldn't quit on God I trust that makes sense amen we you know we don't want to ever get to a point where where we say well our we're a Christian because we're thus no we're Christian because he's saved us he's redeemed us amen he's shown us his Covenant amen but you see the problem is see his his um heart was lifted up because of what he gathered so he set his heart as the heart of God what is the heart of God I'm the absolute my feelings or what I think my reasoning is Paramount above all things we should never let that anything in us that exalts itself above the word is Antichrist doesn't matter how reasonable it may be amen amen you know Jesus was tempted Jesus was tempted Ed to throw himself off the um this is when he's being tempted by Satan he was tempted by Satan says just th you know Satan took him up to the Pinnacle of the temple and and and Satan said to him look just throw yourself off for it's written the angels will will will um bear you up that you don't Dash your foot against the stone you won't hurt yourself a great Supernatural thing will happen when you throw yourself off the off the temple and this is such a trap where where even you know the devil will will will give a supernatural offer just to get someone off the word it says in the Harvest Time notice if Satan fails there which is to use um you know turn the turn the stones into food so basically use a use use a gift for your own ends he says now if Satan fails here then he'll try a second scheme on getting you to disbelieve the word he'll and go to the Seminary he'll he'll try the next scheme now here is where you want to be real careful just sit uh just for another 5 minutes on this part if you will then he makes you a supernatural offer I'm going to um come back to all this just before closing he makes see if he can't tempt you away from the word now I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer he said I'll tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple and bring back up see show the people that you can do something Supernatural it's God that does the supernatural I trust this all makes sense you maybe a bit of a segue but you know we have nothing to prove God proves his word if you ever get in your mind I've got to prove that I'm a Believer because of someone else you've got a wrong motive God proves his word we just walk with God and God proves his word am mean he said boy he got them then now watch this this is it watch when uh you get to the end where this temptation come maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues think you got it see or even let you prophesy even though it not be with the word I've seen people stand up and prophesy and was as contrary to the word as the EES from the the West sea it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by handfuls certainly that don't mean one thing didn't Jesus say many will come to me in that day and said Lord Lord have not prophesied in your name in your name I've cast out Devils I've done many mighty works I've seen a great man in the organ I mean I've been a great man in the organization I've done all these things he'll say depart from me uh you that work iniquity so Satan will hand out Supernatural gifts he's a supernatural being does that mean we throw the gifts away no they're in the scripture but what is the what is the main motive of of God operating the gifts to edify the body that's not a person is glorified it's God himself is glorified amen so we don't throw the gifts away no I'm not I'm not taking any twink to my Bible anywhere right be got but people people run with a gift and and and and many times they're contrary to the word they won't become subject to the word but God will show us as Covenant which is I will keep you under the blood amen I will keep you in my word amen but but Satan will try and try and get us to deviate from the word I trust this is all right amen but see but if we can say subject to the Lord which is his word it doesn't matter what the devil will try and tempt Us by we won't fall for it he says what is Iniquity it's something that you know that's right and you concede it and won't do it in your heart when you know that the Bible teaches a certain thing and you don't do it that's iniquity David said if I hide iniquity in my heart God will not hear my prayer is that truth is that Bible now sir now surely you couldn't get angry with that see Jesus said many will come to me in that day amen see I've um I've done all these things and I'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity same as did Adam Adam said Lord I did this I did that but one word see one word did it that's all it takes just disobey one word see maybe prophesy contrary to the word but now time he got the supernatural gift he so car Away by The Noise by the glamour of it glory to God I pray for so and so I've got up and walked away and and they got up and walked away Hallelujah I can speak in tongues and some interpret see it's genuine the truth should be such a such a treacherous area but thing is if God shown you his Covenant he shows you the truth of his word see that's what I love about God he shows us the genuine that the counterfeit is exposed real easy it's like how people people used to study um uh counterfeit dollars how they know the counterfeit they studied the genuine they saw how the genuine operated and how it was done then they could see the counterfeit right and so therefore we can we can walk with the Lord see the Lord's so merciful to us am mean that if if there's anything that's counterfeit can come up we say no that's not according to the word that's not in the right spirit amen why is that because God shows us as Covenant but if you give if you just give part of yourself then that's the dangerous area where the enemy can come in and trap us right Samson gave his strength to God but his heart to Delila amen we we're we're we're almost done okay Samson gave his strength to God but his heart to Delila and he started off being a mighty conqueror but because his heart wasn't in the right place he only gave his gift to God not his whole being right you give your whole being to God then it didn't matter how many dilas came his way Samson would have withstood the whole thing right now that's just someone who's given part of their life now I just want to go about now what about someone who's given their all amen cuz now I believe I'm preaching to people have have given their all they haven't just given a gift they haven't given part of their life they don't just give Sunday morning they've given all their being Lord I yours unreservedly Lord yours Lord amen you know someone someone who's like that do you know that that is better for a church than 40 revivals a real good brother BR says you put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivals you could have amen I'm trying to convey to you this is the power you have you say the Lord's amazing he's put me on fire his words alive I go through trouble but he quickens his word to me he shows me his Covenant he proves his word I feel down he lifts me up he comforts me he consols me all I want to do is serve him that's someone on fire you say well I don't feel a lot of emotion you don't have to be emotional but what's burning in here I want to be a Christian I want to serve you Lord because I Love You Lord you're everything to me that's that's a real good member amen amen I'll tell you what you do more for this church than 40 revivals praise God that's the impact of your life why is that because you're a genuine you're a genuine Rock testimony amen you're a genuine Rock test a living Stone praise the Lord hallelujah amen a good cleansed member set an example with a face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God and watch when people get sick they'll call that person to come pray or you might you uh you might make fun of them and their tire is deflated so forth you might uh all this nonsense say but let death strike you one time you'll find out when them struggles begin to come who that real sincere person is in the church Here I Am Lord send me let my influence be upon others Lord for me to live as Christ and to die is gain let this word influence me amen why is why is that all because the Lord I know I probably haven't even touched this even the surface of this but the secret of God his C his his Union his word is with you amen and he has shown you his Covenant through your life and he hasn't stopped amen you're carrying a secret amen as I said in the beginning husband and wife they hold a secret together the world doesn't they see certain aspects of it but there's a union together and you know that day he changed you he filled you with his presence more than an anointing but but he came and changed your soul he awakened you lived in you what you're now carrying a secret the world doesn't see but you know it's there the devil can't quite see it he can't quite you know but but you know it's there amen that's why always go back to where he found you and what he's doing in your life and you'll see over and over again I'm I'm closing with a statement you'll see over and over again Lord you have shown me your Covenant amen can we have the musicians please this morning so it's been a bit of a segue but you see amen praise God aren't you glad when he found you he's proved his word to you over and over again amen you say well I'm not feeling all the whole bunch don't worry about feelings God saved your soul he's shown you his Covenant now let that Covenant live let his word live let's just I'm sorry I have to read this you say well what has he done he taken you from among the Heathen amen he's gathered you out of all your countries I'm talking now this is spiritual right and I'll bring you into your own land what is that land the land of the open book The Bible the word that's come open and I'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean we've been created in righteousness we're New Creations in Christ we're clean amen from your filthy from all your filthiness and all your Idols will I cleanse you has he done that amen and a new heart also will I give you what's that new heart when you had a Heart of Stone there the word couldn't impact you it was just like water off a duck's back but he change that Heart of Stone to a heart of Flesh God could impact and change your life right and then he's also given you a new spirit amen but then but he hasn't finished there he's also put his Spirit within you amen because before all this you couldn't even live with yourself Hallelujah you couldn't even get along with yourself but God said I'm going to show you my Covenant I'm going to change you transform you and I'll cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them why because of his Spirit within you and you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I'll be your God Amen you shall dwell in this word amen this is where we're living in every Divine promise amen so as and now as you walk through this land what's he doing showing you his Covenant amen from healing to Redemption to counsel to guidance to uh being transformed by his Spirit maturity proving his word over and over again what is he doing he's showing you his Covenant we're a blessed people today amen we're a people that we just haven't given a gift for our own ends like I had that bit of a bit there in the sermon but we've given our all and I encourage you friends if you haven't given your all to the Lord oh but I can sing and I you know sing and I can play or I can preach I can do these things don't worry about that what about your whole life have you given your whole life to Christ I mean why don't why don't you say Lord here I am take me Lord show me your Covenant Lord amen he'll do it amen let's stand shall we amen what do we what do we what do we play Yahweh amen let's stand y let's sing I speak
