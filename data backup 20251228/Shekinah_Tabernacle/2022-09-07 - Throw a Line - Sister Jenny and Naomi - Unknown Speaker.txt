oh yeah and this is a song that uh was one of my one of my favorites as a teen in in my 20s and the Lord just reminded me of it very recently um with uh trials that I'm going through [Music] I was standing on the air of the Cliff of despair I don't know why but I didn't care before [Music] oh he reached out his head pulled me to his side oh this Jesus of mine so when you're running when loneliness sets in oh he is your best friend when you don't know what to do to call on him he'll see you through this Jesus of mine [Music] when you think you've had a worse and it hurts everywhere just remember Calvary and the Christ he had to bear when you feel like breaking down know that he is all around Jesus Jesus of my mind [Music] there have been times when I thought I was through and I searched so hard I didn't know what to do but then I just looked back I remember all those times when you reached out his head and he took a hold on [Music] holy is your best friend if when you don't know what to do it's all on him he'll see you through this Jesus of my [Music] mind when you think you've had a worse and it hurts everywhere just remember Calvary and the cross he had to Bear when you feel like breaking down know that he is on Earth Jesus [Music] [Applause] Jesus of thousand
