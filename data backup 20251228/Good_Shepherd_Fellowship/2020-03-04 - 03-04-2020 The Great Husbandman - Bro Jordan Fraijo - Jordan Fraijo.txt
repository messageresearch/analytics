I've never been to this kind of a memorial service but it was a three and a half hours and so it was a lot of singing a lot of pictures videos and things like that actually if you'd like to go see brother John la Fontaine's memorial service they've got it out on their website literal Life Church dot org and you can watch the whole thing but it was just a real wonderful celebration of our brother's life and you know you know I remember from the I think it was the generations book that Rebecca Smith and George and Rebecca Smith put out there was one brother there that owned the gas station he had just built a new gas station and he was standing on the corner of brother branham and they were you know kind of admiring the new building and he turned to brother Branham I don't remember the brother's name but he said you know I wish my dad could have been here to see this brother Branham looked at him he said he's standing right down there at the corner looking at it right now I don't quite understand a lab but being a prophet which is the seer he could see into that other dimension you know I started looking around after a while and I started looking I thought I could see brother John just standing there just enjoying it amen my that's exactly what he wanted would have wanted his family to do is get the children the grandchildren up there you know worshiping the Lord and in serving the people in their by their music ministry so amen so it was a it was a wonderful time so but we're glad to be back he-man so I've got a new drummer in the church I was hoping that we could get him out from behind those drums and sing is special tonight there's only one song I can think of a man Beulah land [Music] a man it's good to be back you know it's funny because I don't think you know it's it's weird to kind of coming back it's only been like three months but you know it's like oh hey everything's still here it's good didn't burn down although you guys you're already playing it slower I noticed 10% slower the songs are slower it's funny because down in in Tennessee I'm trying to get them to sing the songs faster and then I come down back here and it's already slower so well the Lord knows you guys needed a break praise the Lord I think we sing it Indy I don't know I don't know what key we sing it in it's good to see you all send greetings from the church down there by the Tom cooker Shane as well as brother Barry Nepal lots of different ministers I was able to meet here in the last few weeks but surely is good to see all your faces praise the Lord [Music] for my country - which I've before [Music] no sad goodbye [Music] we'll [Music] Oh [Laughter] and someday Oh there they're my home [Music] shall be eaten [Music] No Oh [Music] you know I wanted to say something I'll sing that second verse sister Loretta said brother John's wife she got up a tree said she's in a wheelchair and she just said a couple of words and it just amazed me she gets up there and it's so amazing I was someone with all this character and experience can say just a few words and you just know they're saying it from their life and she said it was amazing I don't know she just picked up the microphone and she said just make it there just make it there because if Heaven is full of people like brother John it's gonna be a wonderful place and I appreciated that you know this song you know obviously I don't live here anymore but there's going to come a day or we don't have to say goodbyes anymore we don't have to miss each other anymore we don't have to be

say where can we start from I bring greetings from home and all the brothers and sisters send their greetings mom Finn Yura went very well and just as I was traveling I started to think about it when I was receiving calls from the different brothers back home and brother dealers and his greetings he was planning to come but he had a meeting in Gannon their weekend brother Francis larger also his passport at the Canadian embassy and he couldn't get it out to come in but brother family Joseph came from Nigeria but Valentin and Bragg idiom came from the Ivory Coast well while I was going I was just thinking about it and and although I mean all the law of that the church shows the supporting out of death and I was just thinking uh since I wanted this what brother branham was talking about when he was talking about the squeeze you know it is it is that moment were when when something unexpected may happen even to a brother you know and you just see all the support and all the love you know I was just thinking about that and I was I was very overwhelmed the Saints home they all give us support while we were there but Elijah sent his greetings and everything went will praise the Lord so I thought I was going to go to a beach an hour actually should have left yesterday but then I was asking myself how many days am I going to stay there and brought deli what trying to get me a ticket to come to Nigeria and then I prayed I realized that pretty soon I might not be coming back to the US so I just decided I told him I said well instead of coming staying two days here and in two days on the other end let me go back and prepare myself for to come for the good visit praise the Lord but thank you for your prayers everything went well then and I came in happy and excited this evening but the brothers have already made some preparation so we will respect that and then brother Jordan will be speaking to us tonight but while I was I was I was coming on the flight I was thinking about there thinking about the service tonight and a little Todd was on my mind that is from Saint John chapter 16 a question that a disciple asked Jesus and the question was jesus said unto them over there in verse 16 a little why in the Asia not seeming and again a little wine and yes I see me because I go to the Father then says some of his disciple them on himself what is this that he is saying a little wine so I was going to preach on a little why tonight I was thinking about that in and I started staring only a little bit and what the talk was becoming beautiful in my mind so let's just sing that song just a little why to stay here I was going to see fresh on that little wide tonight less than on our feet let's sing that and brother Jordan will come and bring us the word

in life it's all on a focus of going home you see no matter how far we wondered from home we have we have it in our sights it's not too far off now and we're going home there's nothing gonna stop us I can imagine the prodigal son there when he was coming home when the father saw him afar off if the father could see him he could see the father I'm sure that last little bit it was it was nothing nothing is gonna get in his way he was going home and that's where we are at tonight is we're going home saying there's there's nothing that gonna hold us back there's nothing gonna stand in our way we're going home I can see I can see the ramparts of glory already and I'm going I'm going won't you come with me it's just enter into prayer Heavenly Father Lord will come before you once again this evening father just thanking you Father for bringing us here father Lord where you said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I would be also father so with Lord we just thank you for your presence father Lord here in our midst and ask that you would come and just have your way father Lord that you would take full control this service father Lord of the mouth of the speaker father that I will set myself to the side father that you would be able to come and speak to the heart of the believer for the Lord your people are here they've come searching they've come desiring to hear from you father and we know that if we come before you desiring father to hear from you you said you would come and speak to us father the Lord we know that you're here to speak to us Lord speak to your children I pray speak to me I pray father why surrender this service into your hands or that you would have your way and Jesus most wonderful and precious name we pray amen if you would let's just turn to the word here tonight musicians go ahead I'm gonna turn to John 15 1 through 8 and I didn't know I was gonna be continuing on but we're kind of dis continuing on in the same line that what we were before or at least taking us a sub-branch of it and so reading in John 15 1 through 8 and then we'll let you be seated it says I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples you may be seated for just for a title or a subject here I want to take a thought on the great husbandmen and their the very verse first verse there says I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman we know that God manifests himself in many ways and then shows himself as a husband men he shows himself as the great shepherd he shows himself as an eagle and there's certain manifestations of that and that we can look at he's showing us a natural type so that we can go to the natural and see what are the characteristics of this natural type so that we can begin to see another part of God and see what he's wanting to do now husband men is one that takes care of can either be livestock or it can be just farming in general it can be a vineyard that is a husbandmen yeah there's many things under that that they can do but a husband one is one that cares for some area of the farm whether whatever it is on that piece of land now the father he's the great husbandmen and when we come down to verse eight he says hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so we know he's the husbandmen and we are to bear fruit so that tells us something that tells us that if we were to be fruit bearers then there tells us something about our characteristics he's told some thing about his own characteristics and how he the relationship between us and the father's going to be if we are the bearer of the fruit and he is a husband men then he is the one who was going to be coming in and caring for you as the one who's producing the fruit now the direction I want to take this is looking at it as there's many types of plants that bear fruit but I want to take a look and look at a fruit bearing tree and the reason for that is that I actually used to live quite close to you and a very large pecan orchards and you would see how they would cultivate them all throughout the year and everything they did forth to those trees was specifically for the production of fruit at the time and season of fruit bearing the other example that I saw personally was when I was me and the wife we were in Hawaii for our honeymoon and we went to a coffee farm now they had coffee bushes on that farm that were of over a hundred years old and yet you wouldn't find a one on there that was more than about this tall and there's a reason for that because everything they'd done over the past hundred years specifically for the purpose of fruit bearing okay now if we look at a lot of different types of plants we could look at different types of trees that are not fruit bearing trees we look at them they're usually quite stately and even the way that they are cultivated is very different than a tree that bears fruit or a bush that is just there for aesthetics or for they would use you know you go to parts of Europe and they use bushes as fencing so that that bush had a very specific use you see but the father's trees are to bear fruit so that tells us something okay it tells us that they're gonna be treated different than all the other trees they're gonna be treated different than anything else that is not there but does not have the even the ability to bear fruit you see the ability is not even in it too bear fruit there's you know there's a pine tree out there it does have a type of fruit if you're into that but most people are not out there gathering pine cones okay it looks beautiful and what are people cultivated for its stately a look for its how how tell well it will grow to block the wind or for for some type of a visual shield you see and that that is is something that's specific to those trees but not specific to a fruit bearing tree you see now there's several wreaths there's there's throughout the season a fruit bearing tree is pruned continuously other than the time of fruit bearing okay and there's multiple reasons for pruning that's to promote growth it's to actually just save the tree during times of storms it's for restoration because you could buy a piece of property and let's say there was an apple tree on that piece of property you would go to it and if no one has touched it ever that trees gonna be full of dead limbs that falls gonna be full of growth that is just encumbering the tree that's sucking the life from the tree and keeping it from bearing fruit now it won't be able to completely get away from bearing fruit every year you'll see a couple of small shriveled apples on it but it'll never produce the fruit that it could if cultivated correctly okay so restoration but the most important reason for pruning is solely for fruit production solely for production it's the most important reason for pruning of the tree you see now in Luke 13 and six it says and he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit of this fig tree and find none cut it down why come birth it the ground and he answered and said unto Him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not after that shall cut it down you see the master of the vineyard was coming and walking throughout the vineyard and he wasn't looking for how beautiful the tree was he wasn't looking for how stately it was how strong it appeared how green the leaves were but there was something specific he was looking for he said in he'd been coming to this tree continuously for three years for three years he'd been coming and all through every all three years he hadn't found fruit you see it was a it was a fruit tree and it was meant to bear fruit but he wasn't finding fruit on it you see it was over the right lineage was of the right type but it wasn't producing the life and that's what he was looking for he was looking for that life coming up through the tree to begin producing fruit and then expressing the life in the tree it wasn't just to be there it just wasn't to have life of itself but the life was to be through the tree and produced the fruit so that it could be part taken of and and shared with with those around it now we see here this Jesus had that parable but we know Christ himself expected fruit of a tree and we spoke about this before now he went walking by and hearing the parable he came during a time of fruit when there should have been fruit on the tree there should have been fruit there those three years that the the owner the vineyard came he didn't come during the pruning season he didn't come during the the time of of dunking of the tree to help give it strength and the vitamins that needed to grow and produce fruit but he would come all three years he came during the time when this tree should have been putting forth fruit so this wasn't a time when he was coming when it was the unexpected he wasn't asking of it more than what it should have produced he's just asking to just do what you're supposed to simply do what you're supposed to that's all he was looking for you see but Christ asked of you even more than that more than the master the vineyard because when he came seeking for fruit he came in a time when he knew that according to the season there was no fruit expected and yet when he came to it and look for fruit and there was no fruit on the tree he cursed it because he's not just calling for the tree to produce during certain times but to produce continuously you see because that's what the tree of life did from before the beginning of time was the Tree of Life was there in the garden and produced fruit for the people whenever they had need you see the Tree of Life Adam and Eve with a minute we always think that there was two trees that they actually had no access to but it was actually only one tree that they really weren't supposed to partake of and that was a tree of knowledge of good and evil the only reason why they were driven from the garden after the fall it was so they would not partake of the Tree of Life under that fallen condition and live forever in a state in a fallen condition so until Redemption could be brought forth they were driven away from that tree of life because though the tree of life continuously produces fruit and never stopped it didn't stop just because Adam failed doesn't mean the Tree of Life stopped producing the fruit they just had no access to it because we know the tree of life was Christ himself and so but I partake of the life of Christ is what they were separated from they were separated from that fellowship and so if he was that original fruit tree then we know that any fruit tree that is of his same lineage will be called upon to have the same characteristics produce the same fruit and in the same way in the same abundance as the original tree so that's why as he was walking through and he came to that tree that had no fruit and he looked he knew as a man he knew it wasn't the time in the season it was the wrong time and wrong season what as the god of heaven and earth coming down from the throne from a time of eternity he could remember back to the trees before they had come into that Fallen condition where there was always fruit on the vine and the being reaching up and looking for that fruit reminded him of the following condition that tree was in and it was not acceptable for that tree to stay there Psalms one one through six speaking of a man that is as a tree planted by rivers of water and in Psalms one will just go to verse three and it says he should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8 for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spreadeth our roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be carefull in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit now here in Jeremiah he says something and he says no matter what the conditions are around the tree the leaf shall not wither the joy shall not be taken away and it shall never cease from yielding fruit so even in this condition of drought in a condition of no water in a condition of no sustenance in a condition of no support in a condition where it seems like it's all alone in a condition like it looks up into the heavens and it looks like there's there's no help coming you see because a drought there's no cloud a cloud in the sky you know during the time of Elijah there when when there was a drought they hadn't seen even a cloud for the years that he had said there would be no rain and when there was hope was even the smallest cloud would he lie she looked up and he said he see I see a cloud about the size of a man's hand we hear in a time of drought there isn't even that and yet this tree despite the drought is called upon to still express the joy of the Lord it's still called upon to produce fruit and never cease from producing fruit you see now we are in in that condition today you say how are we in that condition I know we look around here we're in the in especially in the United States and we don't see any famine we don't even see droughts and in fact we're where we stand out you know in with technology lack of rain for a short period of time won't won't be a big issue that's why we got Wells and that's why we got the we pump water in in Israel there they're taking they take salt water and they turn it into fresh water you know we look around and your to tell someone who the thing that we got to worry about right now is is famine and drought and they're like no I don't think so we're not the least not here we're not in a third world country but you see God was not talking about it just like the tree he's not concerned so much about the natural tree he wasn't putting this in parable form to talk about trees but he's laying something down for you to catch an understanding of how your life should be expressing the life of Christ even in a time of drought and we look at it and we know we're in a time of drought because it speaks about in the Book of Amos about the end times and in Amos 8 chapter verse 11 it said behold the day comes saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from North even to the east and they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it and in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst so we see here that we are understanding now that this drought is not a drought for natural water but it's a drought for the Word of God and the revelation of the word in and amongst the people and it's in a point where it's not so much the word as a physical form there's more Bibles printed there's more Bibles sold and more Bibles held in the hands of individuals today than ever before in the history of man it's not for the lack of being able to see it it's not for the lack of being able to read it but it's for the lack of understanding so for the lack of revelation because if if you have no revelation it's not open unto you if that is not open unto you it doesn't do anything for you it doesn't feed the soul it doesn't bring quench the thirst and here as we stand in that time of drought when it looks like everything is Raya round us yet God is looking to us and saying yet yet you sons and daughters of God are being called upon to yet still produce fruit in a time of drought because that's what he did he came in a time of spiritual drought and despite that he didn't let that get in the way of him being the expressed word for the hour he didn't let that get in the way for him catching a revelation of where he stood in the word and what his was what he was meant to do despite where everyone else was that despite the religious leaders of his day despite how they had taken the word and made it of none effect to the people but it was a personal walk with God that he had it come and fully surrendered to that so despite the conditions around him he would then express that life from the inside out the fruits of the spirit would then be manifested on the tree now fruit trees both in pruning and in harvesting it can be quite brutal and we'll take a second here and and just take a look at a few examples of some of God's fruit trees that have produced fruit throughout the throughout time but you know when the farmer comes in and he begins to trim the tree the most important thing about producing fruit is first of all it's got to be close enough to the ground to be easily gathered second of all the place where the most fruit grows is on new growth new growth there has to be continuous new growth to produce the the highest yield of fruit it may look good it may look strong but if there's no new growth on the tree there's the chance for fruit is very low so the farmer is gonna come in and first of all if you've ever seen either apple or citrus orchards they come in and they just crop the top right off the trees all that self-importance they just take it right off in fact they're all day all they cut them all down at the same height why because they're thinking about the fruit yield they're wanting to gather fruit they're not worried about how tall that tree is gonna grow because the tree growing extra tall doesn't do anything for the farmer doesn't do anything for the husbandmen it doesn't benefit his kingdom in any way shape or form so guess what that comes off anything anything now they start looking at the tree and looking at it going is there anything here that is making this tree too heavy we want that we want it to have a nice solid center right but we don't want limbs that are too heavy that are going off on their own off in any weird direction why because as the time goes by they're gonna get heavy and they're gonna snap off and when they snap off they actually can take and cut right into the heart of the tree and be a detriment to that tree and actually killed a life in the tree now we might be able to save it but once again we're concerns concerned about fruit we'll save the tree if we need to if this happens but we don't want that to happen because it it destroys the truth that tree for its ability to yield fruit and the next coming seasons and so is it with us is we get you know we go off on a tangent here or we go off on a tangent there or we go off on our own thing and God wants to come in right the beginning and cut that thing out we think that we know best and know he wants to cut that out he knows if he lets you run out on a limb too long it's gonna get heavy and it's gonna damage that life and your ability to produce fruit and benefit the body now instead of benefiting the body you're actually gonna be pulling the body down why because the body is gonna have to come up around you and bind you up and tell you're well enough to produce fruit again but your ability of this fruit goes back to zero so pruning very important and they come in it is it's almost without discretion they they they clean it all up everything gets cut anything that's there that doesn't need to be there gets cut out doesn't matter well you know how the tree feels about it well I kind of like that limb don't matter cut it out gone why because we want to get that tree down to a certain size because we know at a certain size with a certain number of limbs it's gonna when life begins to come into the tree and the nutrients we've been giving it all the time began to come up into the life of the tree it's gonna have to push it out somewhere and it's gonna push out all that new growth and at the end of all that new growth is where all that fruits gonna be growing okay so we'll talk about harvest in a minute but let's take a look at a few people a few fruit trees that God did a lot of trimming on and one that'll this take quickly we can look at is Joseph Joseph you would look at him and you know from the time he was born he was favored of the father but you know whether he he thought so or not Joseph became a little bit self-important you know he had a little bit of developed a little bit of pride and he felt like he was began to felt like he was an authority on spiritual issues with him within the church you know I I I have a dream and and this is my dream and I'm gonna share it all with you he didn't he didn't go - you know - Jacob first and say dad I had this dream I just want to know what you think about it and and then after telling Jacob Jacob well yeah that's a really good dream we should share it with the family he didn't do that you know he waited for he waited til they all sat down for dinner and he was sitting next to his dad at the right hand because he was the favorite and there in this place of importance is where he decided to share his dream from now he had more than one dream that were very similar and the first one just said that basically when you interpreted it and you didn't have to be real smart to interpret it to see where it was going was that all his older brothers were gonna serve him now we know cuz we are at the end we know how it ended that it was a true dream the interpretation was correct you see but whether you're right or not has very little to do with it but what when what way is it that you're bringing forth the truth because God has set in his word away that you're supposed to do things a way that you're supposed to bring a message to the church a way that you're supposed to honor the elders of the church a way that you're supposed to do certain things because if it's done correctly then it can be received but if it's done incorrectly even though it's the truth it won't be certain received you see so here's Joseph he's coming and he he feels real spiritual you know he's got his his his real special robe on and and you know he's he's favored of the Lord and favored of his dad and favored of everybody and you know and he's and on top of it he's rather clueless he has no idea that on the undertones that he's setting in the family or are just turmoil and strife anger animosity why because of his approach now we know it was all for a purpose God was doing it for a reason because God had a place where he was gonna take Joseph to where he had a take and trim things out of his life and build a character that was fit to rule so yes he was favored of the Lord and he was favored and Lord throughout his entire life there actually was not a day in Joseph's life that he was not favored or blessed of the Lord no all you're like wait a minute I think I've read that story and I'm pretty sure that's not how it goes well our problem is and was probably Joseph's problem at one point or another is what we consider blessings you see if someone says I've been really blessed the next thing we're gonna hear out of their mouth is how they got a new car they just bought a house they got a new job they got a raise but maybe they won the lottery I mean not that we buy lottery tickets of maybe someone gave it to him it could happen but that's when song says blessings that's the first things that we think about but we know that the trying of our faith is greater and of more value than gold try it in the fire so what we have to do is then now apply this new way of looking at it to our lives and the lives of the believers and see how often were they blessed and how often were they not and when we begin to look at it the times that we would normally look at and go like man they were having a rough time when we begin to look at it through God's eyes and see it through his eyes the times that we're going like they're having it rough once we take and look at it through God's filter like man that's the most blessed time of their life why because God was doing something and preparing them to produce fruit if they'd never gone through that there would have never been any fruit or the fruit that was would come wouldn't have been worth even writing down about go to nothing to the term says nothing to write home about it's something you plucked it you ate it you took one bite and you tossed it away because it looked good but there was nothing to it right and here's Joseph and he's getting things pruned out of his life the first thing that gets taken away from him is his self-importance and authority within the family why how do we see that his brothers strip him of his coat that mantle that showed his favor with the father and sell him and sell him down into Egypt now that's a pretty rough pruning already but you know god still wasn't done he gets old down into Egypt and he begins to a little bit at a time he's a slave but of his own ability he's he's a he was given a lot of natural gifts go out equipped him with the right gifts for the job he was gonna have to handle now those gifts he had from the day he was born cuz gifts and callings come without repentance so Joseph was a very gifted individual very intelligent we know that because he got the power for his house and he took part of hers house from an average house - it was doing so well that the man of the house took and turned all authority over to the slave boy he had bought out of out of out of Israel or what it wasn't even is ray out of Canaan so we know he was doing something right and he had natural gifts to handle money to handle men to handle property to handle cattle - you name it he had he had the gifts and the ability to do it but God said okay I've given you a little try at this you know just like David when he was in Saul's Court Lord brought him into Saul's Court but he didn't just bring him into Saul's Court and then from there just here you go your king now he had to continue shaping David's character so he'd be fit to rule he allowed him to come into that position so he would see what it was like to be in that position and the authority and the responsibility that would be laid upon you but he still wasn't done shaping him he still wasn't ready so Joseph here he is he's at the pinnacle the only thing he could have been more was free to be his own master there wasn't anything who was waiting for I don't think he was living in the slaves quarters he had full access and run of the house I'm sure he had his own very nice quarters somewhere on the property if he didn't beforehand he probably had it built for himself because he had full authority over the entire estate he if there was a granary to be built he was going on who made the decision if there was a crop that was gonna be sowed he was one who decided what got sowed that's how much was turned over to him there was something to be purchased he decided what was gonna be purchased and how much was gonna be paid for it everything was isn't in his hand but God said I'm gonna put something else in your way cuz I'm gonna take you from this position that you felt maybe Joseph was feeling like wow look it they sold me into slavery but look what I've been able to do that I showed them what God's like no no it's not you and he brings the next trial and accusers gets him accused allows him to be accused of something he didn't even do and now he's cast into prison but we see God is still blessing him because if Joseph would have received the punishment for the crime he would have been executed he wouldn't have been sitting in prison see God's just moving him God's moving him getting him ready and now he sets him in prison takes all this authority away takes everything and strips it out again and takes him back down to nothing and now Joseph sitting in prison and as far as he knows he's in for a life sentence but God's working on him working on his character and now even within the prison God's letting him use his gift to be expressed no matter the conditions around him God's wanting that character to come out so showing Joseph I gave you these gifts and whether I allow you to be in the the richest of the rich in the largest companies whether you're the CEO or you're down in the dungeon I still want you to use those gifts for me no matter how low in life you feel you are God still wants you to express his life and use the gifts he gave you to be a blessing that to those around you you see Joseph finally was able to bless somebody else other than himself when he was in Potiphar's house Potiphar got really blessed because Joseph was there because he was partaking of the fruit from Joseph's tree but so was it in prison Joseph didn't have God didn't give Joseph the right in prison just because he was in prison to sit back and feel sorry for himself but even in prison he was called on to minister to those around him and continue to pour out of himself of his gifts and let God God worked through him and manifest that life even to the prisoners and even to the guards so it wasn't just to the prisoners right to those around him but even to the guards of the prison those who are holding him in bondage even to them he was called on to express the very life and thoughts of God to and allowed even them to be partakers of the fruit that was on the vine you see they called God's working him to something God's working him to something Moses Moses say almost the exact same you can see God did almost the exact same thing here he is he was meant to be born into poverty into slavery but God made sure he was born and raised in the most stately of manner because God said who what better way to have my servant trained on how to lead people then let those who I'm gonna use him to deliver the people from do the training if there was anyone who knew how to train people on how to move armies how to build cities how to move groups of people how to conduct business the Egyptians were at the top of the game at the top seeing God just slid him right in there said now am i protecting him what he's getting an education too but when he hit the pinnacle of that and God was ready to use him he said now you got all this education you're too self-important you're too self you have too much prestige you have too much I can do it myself because that's what he tried to do he went out and he said okay well I realized that I'm a Jew and my mother tells me I was called to deliver the people well I've been a general here in the armies of Egypt for the past almost 40 years I've run campaigns all across the deserts I've taken cities I've destroyed armies many times my size I know how to I know how to conquer I know how to set people free and so what does he do he takes the sword and his own ability and knowledge and he attempts to conquer Egypt you see but Egypt had become a part of him as well and as long as he was trying to conquer himself by himself it was never going to happen for every dead Egyptian he killed there was another Egyptian to kill for every one that went down there was another one that would pop up and as long as he kept doing it his way it wouldn't work but God used that because now he said okay I've let you see all this I've put you in this place and now I'm gonna tear you back down to nothing all these branches you've grown how tall you gotten how pretty you look get ready because the buzz cuts coming and that's what he did he came in and he sheared Moses of everything power he pulled away his authority he pulled away his importance he pulled away his he took him from his family he drove him out into the desert so even the people he thought he had started to identify with he couldn't even have access to them and God dries him out into the desert into a place of drought and he said Moses you're gonna go out there into a place of drought until I see that you're ready to bear fruit in any condition not just when the condition is good but in any condition and when you're ready to believe anything and Moses got to that point because he got to the point where he was so yielded that he could see a bush on fire in a desert which is not so unusual walked up to it and instead of start addressing it with his intellect to figure out what was going on but the bantam says he didn't take a look at it and say well maybe I need you to take a sample of these leaves and take him back to the lab and see why it is that they don't burn God put him out too long enough to where he wasn't trying to use his own ability and thoughts his own ideas to figure it out in fact he got touched to the point to where even when he sees a bush on fire and all sudden the bush starts talking to him what you would think anyone who had a bush or a donkey start talking to you you it would catch your attention and immediately you're like there's something going on here but Moses he's so down and out he's got so down to the point where I'm old he's 80 years old he's got no strength of his own anymore he's got a bush talking to him and for all he knows he's hallucinating and God means to speak to and says I'm gonna send you back to Egypt to deliver my people and all Moses has the entire time is what he can't do I have no strength I can't talk he was at one of the greatest orators of his time in Egypt do you think you could be a Prince of Egypt and you were not a powerful orator you got something else coming these were men who were taught to stand before peoples and crowds and military mites and command them with their voice command them with their authority and God got him to the point where he said deliver the people I can't even I can't even talk to nobody I have problems talking to the Sheep luckily they just follow me because God had gone in and used 40 more years to trim that tree down until it was a point now where any life put it into it would produce new growth where fruit could be produced okay he'll jump we'll jump real quick here and I don't want to be too long and I think I already am I will jump to the New Testament Paul the Apostle Paul one of God's great fruit trees you know he went through the kind of almost the exact same steps he grew up and was trained by the best Gamaliel was known as a teacher of teachers respected by all and that was Paul's teacher he was zealous to a fault he was ready to take everything he'd been taught and he was gonna apply it and and if I feel like you're a step out of line I'm gonna let you know and he had it memorized - so you couldn't beat him you think well you know well Paul is not that bad and he has scripture for you here description for you get a quote for you he could tell you exactly how it was to the smallest detail that you were transgressing the law and God did that for a purpose he let him go through that but then he had to take him and and start tearing him down same thing you know he sent him to the backside of the desert into a place of drought where he his only thing he could rely on was was the Lord coming forth and begin to reveal this word to him everything he thought he knew he had to come to a place where he said everything I thought I knew I count his dung all my own learning all my own thoughts everything I thought I knew about the scripture everything I thought I knew about the coming Messiah everything I thought I knew about anything in life I've come to the place where I counted as dung it's as nothing God had to take him back and scale him down and in fact there was God trimmed he kept his fruit tree so trimmed there was a part of him that Paul never could get back beyond and God told him my grace is sufficient for you because that will continuously remind you of how small you are he said because I have so much revelation for you that I'm gonna keep this little thorn of the flesh here to remind you of how small you are no matter how much revelation you get you're gonna be reminded of how small you are and how it's not you but it's the Lord and the life of God being produced through you you see now we mentioned talking about producing fruit in a time of drought but I have some good news for you is even back in Psalms is it spoke about that fruit tree or that man being planted by rivers of water and even in a time of drought the believer has access to the river of life always you see because that is his life source it flows deep underground and the roots of the believer weeks down to that underground river of life and tap into it where all the other trees or all the others around him are suffering from the drought on the surface that tree has reached down why because the storms of life have forced him to go deep with his roots and reach down into that river of life to draw forth now there is a reason why you have access and that just isn't for your own benefit but in John 7 and 37 through 39 it says in the last day the great in that last the last day of that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink so here in a time of drought you have access to water you have access to life you just have to come and receive it and it says he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so here we see even at a time of drought Jesus says that if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink but it's not just to sustain your own life but even as the tree is putting out fruit so here he's calling that the individual that would come and drink of these rivers of life it wouldn't just be to take it and internalize it but it's become something that flows out from the individual so it's not just an importing but also an outpouring of the spirit back out onto the people around you you see because he's not just calling you to leave us live a secret life with a secret reserve you know that's where people are all doing today they're all there's all of these Doomsday Preppers and they're getting ready they had their secret stash of supplies if they're there water in fact just the other day faith went into Costco and they told her that they are wiped out of bottled water and and disposable paper products because everyone's preparing for the coronavirus you see people want to go get that they want to stock up because they're thinking of themselves I think in hell and what how and what am I gonna do so I will survive this so that I will live but the believer isn't called to look at surviving or how they're gonna live because scripture says think not think not I know I had it in here somewhere but Christ was speaking he said not to concern yourself oh here it is Matthew six wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall not he much more clothe you O ye of little faith therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto you you see because if we were really concerned and we took the profit even at his word what he said the end time would look like then we would be built digging the deepest of of safe houses bunkers into the ground we would be setting aside food and water for years because we know even more than anyone else that there's a squeeze coming on this little bride he said that well there'll be a quick short work where the bride will have to manifest the spoken word for her daily bread so the conditions we know what the conditions are going to look like now we have to know on whether or not we will be there ready to meet the conditions or will we fall short you see because it says Jesus speaking to him he says oh ye of little faith he said the reason why you're so concerned about all these things is because your faith is so small he said it's not even great enough to believe that God is in control doctor I want to hold all these things in to myself I can't give it to anybody else it'll drain me and that could be physically well that could be spiritually too you know we get a little bit of joy and we're like well I've been going through a hard time and I deserve to feel happy so I can't give it to anybody else because if I do I won't have enough for myself or love you got God's given you of his love but to extend that love is too much for you why because we don't have faith that there's more of it where it came from see God God has an endless supply depending on your level of faith it's your level of ability to reach into the storehouse and believe every time that you reach in there'll be enough there for you to preserve life just like the widow woman during the time of drought there she was she was gone one of God's Gentile fruit trees you know she was a Gentile she wasn't a Jew she was a Gentile and she was the only one the Prophet was sent to there's a during that entire time of drought someone who wasn't even a part of the promise for her day none of the promises belong to her it all belonged to the to the children and we know because even when Christ came and the Gentile woman came after him he said how would it be fit for me to cast the children's bread on two dogs and yet this one was able to grab a hold of faith enough to where it caught that God's attention during a time of drought so much that it brought the only prophet in Israel to her house so there was something going on and she saw no way out but even of that she was still ready to give it to somebody else before she even had a promise that it would be restored you see we see there the characteristic of Christ was already being portrayed before she even had a promise of anything else before she had a promise that her meal would not run dry of her oil not run dry when the prophet of God came and said give to me first she said I know we're gonna die but since you asked for it you can have it and that's the attitude God wants us to have as bearers of fruit in his garden is even when we see no way out even when the sky looks books brass and judgment is in in the air even when we've had no contact we've gone all the way she'd made it all the way through those years of drought to where she was down to nothing and she hadn't heard anything from the Lord but here the Prophet comes he says you have anything and she said I have a little bit he says give it to me he says she says were always gonna make it for me and my son and then we were gonna die but since you say you're coming in the name of the Lord you can have it as a servant of the Lord I'll give you what a little bit I have and it wasn't until he had actually taken it and eaten it partaking of it it was gone he turned around and the blessing came upon her you see it's not looking to see well do I have enough to give do I have enough of myself to give do I have enough joy to give do I have enough love to share do I have enough peace in and of myself to and out but God's saying when you look in the barrel and it looks like it's the last thing you have give it anyways when you look in and of yourself and you say I have nothing left I said that's good because the next thing you're gonna hand out is something of me you're gonna stop giving your opinion and thoughts to people and now you're only gonna give out what I give you so as I give unto you you're gonna be sharing with the individuals around you because what you were handing out before had no life in it had no potential to do any good but now now that you got to the bottom of your barrel now that you've gotten to the bottom of yourself now that I we've trimmed all the loose branches and deadness out of your tree now as you draw forth life from the word and you've been to push out all the new growth it's all going to be Christ all the fruit coming down from the tree is all Christ even if it's just the first one coming out its Christ whether it's whether the tree is full of their shoe it's one partakes of it they're gonna partake of the life of Christ why because that's the life coming up through the tree and that's where we need to come to is where we've come and ask the Lord and say Lord cut out anything that is not of yourself anything that is a hindrance to my life anything not just a hindrance to your physical life not a hindrance to your your own ability to succeed but a hindrance to your life with Christ what is coming in the way of you coming into communion with the Lord and him coming and indwelling in you so that you can be a fulfillment of this scripture where he says he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water rivers he wasn't speaking about a trickle he wasn't saying well you know every once well as it hits as what I give you gets it'll splash over out of the cup they said there's so much and you'll be so yielded as it pouring in it'll be pouring out there will be no way to stop it it'll just take over in and of yourself what you you would have been thinking well you know that brother he really offended me and I'm gonna go let him know and about the time you walk up God says no this is what I'm pouring into you and also in what pours out wasn't what you were thinking but what God just poured in and now the grace of God is extended now God's love is extended why because it's it's taken over it's taken over your life it's taking over your thoughts it's taken over your beam it's taken over your spirit it's in control in your soul and it's just coming out of you you can't stop it you see there's been those throughout scripture that that happened to just once and they had no control over because God wouldn't let them falsely prophesy it was Balaam you see he went up there and he had a thought in his own mind for cursing he said I've seen the backside of these people and I know they deserved to be cursed because that's what seeing the backside is all about seeing someone's backside is seeing their worst seem that the the their their worst attitude seen their seeing them on their worst day when everything's going wrong for them and and you you say hello brothers look don't talk to me you know it's like God bless you and you're like oh wow okay it seems someone in their failings and Balaam saw all that the reason why he wanted to see that because he wanted to curse he wanted to put a curse upon them but God had already told him he said you only say what I put in your mouth you'll only say what I put in your mouth and when he came forth for cursings blessings poured out you see and that's what we're called to do is get this flesh so under the control of the Holy Spirit that this flesh we want to rise up and go forth and go forth is cursings but the Holy Spirit would come in and take control that see and say no no not cursings blessings you say but lord look at what they did to me look at what they did to me here's here is the first martyr of the church being stoned Stephen he preached a fiery message fiery message and they were angry and they dragged him out and toss him down now I know he was filled with the Holy Ghost he just come from a powerful sermon but his flesh wasn't looking forward to the stoning but he had to put forth the fruits of the life that was inside him and so when the flesh would cry out for cursings the spirit that was inside of him when called out and said lord lay not this sin against them Leyna lay this not to their charge and in that moment it says he gave up the ghost it doesn't even say the stoning killed him it says in that moment God just took his spirit from him you see there had to be something there that could be more powerful that could be expressed because he'd already been through the purging so that once he was in that state now the only thing that could push forth his new life the old man was there's nothing left so the only thing that can push forth his new life new life new life is coming forth and that life can only produce the fruit that's in the life just like the the grafted tree the grafted piece into the tree can only produce the life that's in the graph so that graph was originally meant to produce a tangerine even though it's attached to an orange tree it'll produce that tangerine you see and so is it with us is we were originally a part of that tree of life so even though we look like a grafted we've been grafted into this world and attached this old tree this tree of knowledge of good and evil but when the life pours through into the original branch has to pour forth the original life so dukh just because you're attached to the old tree doesn't give you excuses to produce old fruit because you're supposed to reach back to your identity of who you were from before the foundation of the world and produce the fruit that you produce back there so God's calling on you to produce fruit and he as the husbandmen will come in and he's going to come in and begin cutting things out of your life you look at your life look back even where you're at right now whether you're young or old and you can see where God has done things and been shaping you and you look at Mackey and say Lord why why did I go through that why why did you even you look at even your failings God allow you to go through those failings because he's raising you up because he wants you to produce a fruit and if you'd never gone through that that he wouldn't have been ill cut those things out of your life and they'd be hanging on but he had reasons for shaping you the certain way that he has is because he knows by shaping you into that condition you're gonna produce the most fruit so here you can look back to your life and you can see these things that you've gone through and you can see your the path you've walked and we look at well and we look at it we go well it goes up to me and with with 20/20 if I could go back and redo it I would skip this part now to make a different decision here and I'd make a better decision over here that way I wouldn't make this mistake but you know that mistake was a part of God's pruning just like Joseph's just like Moses the mistake was a part of the pruning because he wanted to take you somewhere to remove that from your life so he allowed you to go there because he perfectly made that trial specifically for you because he was gonna use it to shape you he was shaping character you see he wasn't concerned with how good you looked he wasn't concerned with your prestige he wasn't even concerned about your your own your own I'm missing the word but with how you look to everyone else with your own reputation thank you he's not concerned with your reputation spiritually he's not concerned about your reputation physically he's not concerned he's not concerned that you grew up in a perfect message Church in a perfect message family and and you've heard how how God and the Prophet and the ministers all come forces they'd you know the most precious thing is just that one that never had to go out into the world you know the devil uses that against you he'll come to you and say you have to meet that mark that you look right to maintain the reputation not just your reputation but your reputation is is hinging on the reputation of the church and the ramification of your pastor and the reputation of your family and he's gonna hold that over you why as long as you can hold that over you it'll never allow you to go to that place where God was gonna use to prune things out of your life and shape that tree so you could produce fruit they'd be a blessing to others later see because his whole God's whole thing isn't about worrying about how you look or worrying about what other people think about you or wearing what the pastor thought about it or worrying about what some other individual thought his whole purpose was as I know at a certain point this fruit trees life I want them to produce a certain type of fruit because there was gonna be someone who needs that kind of fruit at that time and stage of life you see and so to get you produced that quality of fruit he has to walk you through this way that even to you you're looking at and you're like with the decisions and the things that I'm doing I'm lost I know it and the devil comes to remind me every day you see but God had that in his plan the whole time you know why because scripture says the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord now immediately most people think the righteous well that's after conversion but the steps of the were of the righteous before conversion because he says you were his sons and daughters before the foundation of the world you were righteous in his sight back there and your steps were ordered of the Lord from the day you were born in fact it was so ordered that even your mom and dad your grandparents your great-grandparents their steps were ordered to come together even if they never were to produce the life of Christ they were carrying something that had to be manifested which was you and I which was to carry God's own life and he watched over that carefully so don't think that after he's washed over that seed for six thousand years after the mix-up in the garden that he's waited for the last sixty years of that six thousand to lose you because even back there before the foundation of the world at the time of the fall he saw you brother Steve he saw you brother Joseph he saw me for the dam loyal he saw us in Arma his mind and he saw he said that that right there is a son of God that right there is a daughter of God not only that but they are being called to the hardest to the most trying time but also to the time when the most fruit will be produced in the life of the believer because this is a time of restoration of the bride tree with a bride tree will come to a point of a restoration of knowing who she is and brother Ram said when the bride recognizes who she is she'll be an invincible army now it's not because she's not an invincible army but because when she recognizes who she is and her place in Christ as she steps out day by day as the Spirit reveals to her who she is as she steps out of that spiritual amnesia the fruit of the Spirit can't help but be manifested because that life that was in the individual from before the foundation of time when the sons of God for joy and meaning you were there shouting for joy with the sons of God so is it now we're coming back to a full restoration of the garden where we're coming back to the spoken word in the life of the believer which we hear the spoken word but what does that mean we know what that means in the 5 manifestations of the wave sheaf of the producing of fruit because we know a wave sheaf does everyone know what a wave sheaf is what is a wave sheaf anyone firstfruits so do you know why they waved they called it the wave sheaf they would take that first fruit and go before the field the entire field of that same type of seed and they would wave it over the field they would wave it over the field do you know why they waved it over the field because they wanted all the rest of the field to catch a glimpse of what they were to be and what they were to produce and so we had a wave sheaf come in our time a fruit tree that was allowed to come to a full manifestation of fruit bearing age producing fruit on the tree so that we could see that wave before us not so that we could idolize the tree not so that we could lift up the trees but so we could recognize I too am a fruit tree I too am called to produce that same line where the spoken word came in and he was able to speak to nature and speak to that bull and I don't let love come forth and speak and say bull I didn't mean now wait a minute wait a minute do you know that's not the first thing he thought about you know that was early on in himself he was still thinking way to fleshly because the first thing he did his first plan of attack the Scot was his gun but you know what God had already done that gun that he carried with him everywhere God had made sure he left it in the truck and let him get halfway into the field before they even saw the bull or the bull saw him because first of all if he would have seen the bull he would have walked around the field and avoided it altogether you see God put him in that position on purpose because he was building faith and he does that with me in you he will put us in the field with the bull without telling us because he wants us to get there and he wants us we might at first we're like where'd that gun where's that extra money I hid under the mattress where's for that trial because that's gonna be our first response but he knows when when all that comes up short then we're gonna go well I guess that's it it's over for me that's what he said I said I know I can't outrun him I guess this is where it all ends and it wasn't till the bull was charging at foot at a dead run in his direction that something rose up inside him to meet the challenge of the day to meet the need of the hour it wasn't something he had when he started at the field it wasn't something he had even when he first saw the bull when he saw the problem it wasn't until the problem was about to hit him dead on as something came up and spoke and it came out in humility and humility with authority out of love it wasn't you bull you have no right I'm a son of God go back you see that would be the wrong approach I said bull I'm gonna have to ask you to forgive me because I've I've come here and disturbed you but I'm a son of God going across to pick to pray for one of his sick children now it in the name of the Lord going lay down you see the approach the approach to the problem wasn't one a panic and wasn't one of bravado it wasn't trying to show off it was just that love of God reaching out and taking control that situation we see what else would do what each wave sheaf do when the wave sheaf came and the spoken word came forth and and fruit was produced he spoke life into existence he spoke life into existence those squirrels the Spirit came the Lord came to him and said whatever you say will be done okay and it was the number he called for and how many he called for that produced but the Lord wouldn't let him leave one of them when he was hunting because one was getting away he said no you're gonna take every single piece of evidence of this home with you so that no not once when you tell the testimony to everyone around you say aye I believe it was seven and you say seventh they said but I ran you only have six squirrels I think you're making something up he said no you're gonna take all all of them home with you okay God's building his faith building his faith building his faith he's working him up to a place where first everything is hands-on in location he could see it happening he can touch it but he's working him to something and he's working him to the same faith that that's the Centurion had when he came to Jesus and he said I am a man of authority and when I speak with authority those who hear it has to listen and I know you also are a man of authority so if you speak it it's done already and Jesus at that time he said paint like this have I never seen in all of Israel but that was a faith that brother Branham was being brought to you is not just something he could see but something that he would speak it and know it was already done you see because he did that and he comes forth and he God showing them that no matter what when love projects it's in control whether it's speaking to a bowl in the field whether it's bringing forth life new life whether it's speaking to a maniac on the platform and stopping the devil right in his tracks whether it's speaking to sin and rebuking it it takes full control that young couple on the front row love projected and took full control of the situation and a little bit at a time but the last manifestation was sister Mita you know she had that growth on her ovaries I believe and brother Branham had been seen it for years and wasn't until after that incident where she disrespected the sermon Oh God and the Lord wasn't pleased with it that that thing began to manifest itself it been sitting there sitting there waiting why you see God knew and he could show his prophet what trial she was gonna go through before it even manifested so don't think your trial just happened by accident God has it tailor-made for you knowing the reaction you'll have in the decisions you'll make because he's shaping you up even all these ones where you made you look at you like I made the wrong decision he's shaping your characters when you face that again you be like no I know what decision I made before and I know where it took me no turn to go the other way and he's shaping you shaping you he did that with the Prophet the Prophet made decisions that he shouldn't know that's what happened the beginning of his ministry he was a tree needing to be pruned and there he went he was being drawn monks the Pretender coastal people right and his mother-in-law said don't you drag my daughter out amongst that trash and he said fine I won't that's how great his his revelation of faith was at that point and God said no if you're gonna come to the spoken word your revelation is gonna be a lot stronger than that it's gonna have to be a lot stronger than that so guess what I have some tailor-made trials that you're gonna go through that's gonna trim the tree to the point where the only thing it can produce his life and it went so low so low he went so low to the point in his life where he twice tried to do something that we would consider despicable most of the Christian community and world at large doesn't still doesn't know what to do with anyone or someone that does this he tried to take his own life twice twice he was the point where his tree had been so trimmed it was down to the almost down to a stump of what was left because God said I'm gonna take you down to nothing just like the bride tree over the ages right it was stripped of everything because God said I'm gonna build it back up from nothing so everything in it is of me it's word upon word upon word upon line upon line upon line no part of man is gonna be left everything is gonna be Christ upon Christ glory upon glory upon glory upon glory because he's building this church to get out of here he's building it up to a capstone of love we know that capstone was Christ coming down crying love crying grace grace grace to the believer but what was it what was Christ coming down to do an indwelling of the bride because it says the spirit and the bride say come and and the bride was gonna be the final voice to the final age Christ a manifestation of Christ on this earth the very life of Christ in the life of the believer so here he is he's got to trim it down and shape it and get it to the place was the only thing left now is Christ building on Christ building so here it is the prophet got to the point where he was torn down to nothing and he said and he had to get to that point where he removed any tie that would stop him from taking God at His Word and stepping out on his Commission and doing what God had called him to do so it is with me and you were not any less you see when the wave sheaf of his wave we see the fruit we see it in its end condition and we all like yeah that's what I want to be I want to produce that fruit but then we turn around and we look at all the pruning the tree went through and we're like we don't want that I don't I don't want anything to do with that because that's what the rich young ruler did he got to that place and he came and he said I want eternal life what can I do to gain eternal life I am willing to do anything I keep the law i from the time of my youth I've kept the law I've done everything I know to do right and Jesus said yeah you've done everything you know but there's way too much dead weight in your tree he said go sell all that you have come and follow me he said no no I want eternal life but not if that's what it costs me I don't want to be a partaker of the tree of life if that's what it cost me but God will take every individual to that place where they get to the point where they go I had where you are called on where it's give everything for life that's what the parables were all about when when the merchant of pearls wanted to buy the pearl of great price he had to give up all of his own pearls to gain it he couldn't keep any of his own if he wanted to attain the pearl of great price to attain the fruit of the Spirit you say how do i how do i attain how do i produce the fruits of the spirit well there is no secret formula to how you produce joy there isn't some way well if I do this and I'm just really happy and I'm really positive and I ever you know real positive outlook on life and you know the power of positive thinking there's no joy that's not joy guess what you're gonna break eventually love you think wow I just love everybody I could just wait wait long enough somebody will do something where your love will come to an end you're like well you know I do yoga and I meditate and so I'm just real peaceful guess what there is no there's no way that you can produce even one of these things you can't you cannot produce a one a fruit of the Spirit there's not one flew the spirit that you can produce of yourself he's calling you and saying give up all of yourself so I can pour all of myself into you and then you don't have to worry how do I produce the fruit of the Spirit because the when that tree of life is imparted into you and you begin to produce the fruit of the tree of life you bear fruit because the life and the nutrients you're taking up you see if the tree didn't you ever get anything it would just wither and die in its spot but what it is drawing up into itself that is producing the life in the tree that's producing the fruit so you just get the life in you and don't worry the fruit will produce allow the drink of the water of the word and that that valley of rivers of living water that pours forth from you you won't be able to stop it but too much of a time we don't let the husbandmen do the pruning we want to hold on to it even if he proves that we want to stack all those dead limbs at the bottom of our tree so that we can at least look back to them and remember them and feel good about ourselves maybe it was one of your accomplishments in life you want to stack that up it's dead if you allow that dead wood it's dead at the bottom of your tree it's a fire hazard and it's gonna consume you and destroy you don't do it yield yield say Lord Lord whatever you got to do if you got a shake the tree if you got to trim the tree if you got it remove even the limbs that I love the most that's what he did to the wave sheaf he removed the limbs he loved the most his wife and his little girl gone God Room God removed them because he was shaping the tree to produce fruit it wasn't because the Prophet did anything wrong but he was concerned the spirit was concerned that that tree would not produce the fruit it needed you as they didn't go through that every step every little part of his life that he went through was focusing on producing fruit there's not there's not one step folks that we've gone through in our lives that had any other purpose than what God is shaping us to produce fruit and here we are we are called to this city to this church to this assembly you're called to be sitting where you're sitting you've been called to go through all the things in life that brought you to this place I've been called to go through all the things I've gone through in life to bring me right here to this place I can look back and I see Lord why why couldn't I just receive it why couldn't I have just seen it why did I have to go through those struggles why did I have to face the enemy in that way why they had to come to such a place of feeling so lost and so depressed thinking I have no way out why cuz he's got a reason he wants me to prove some type of fruit he wants to come to a place where he where I can shared the fruit you know what kind of fruit that that shares is no matter what you're going through God can bring you through if I if I never gone through that then I'd never look back and see what God had brought me through I couldn't share that with you if I'd never have been in a place where I felt always lost if you came to me and said you know it's done it's over always lost there's nothing that can save me I'd be like well you might be right especially after you just shared what you shared with me I'm pretty sure you have no coming back like I've read in the Bible about there's a sin that you shouldn't even pray for and you do your own praying this time I'm not going to get caught up in that one because you know I gotta watch out for myself I don't want to pray for you and not be supposed to be praying for you and God get mad at me but I know I've been to that place where I was those I could go no lower and looking up and God said you're still mine you're still mine don't think don't think that you could go solo that's why he did that he brought me to a place where all those I knew all the friends I've ever had in my life were ripped from me in a 24-hour period and knowing that they all thought I'd become the Antichrist and gone to the devil and I and you look at that when you're going through that and you say Lord what's going on what's going on Here I am I'm all alone how do I bear this how do I bear this he said you can bear it because I'm your friend I'm your exceeding great reward and so now anyone else who says you know what I'm without a friend in the world nobody cares about me and I can look at them in the eye and say that's an absolute lie of the devil because as long as you have Christ you have a friend who cares for you more than your brother more than more than so begin looking in back into your life and stop looking at it as as those are horrible things that happen to me or horrible things I did and begin looking at it say Lord based on what you wrought me through what kind of fruit are you wanting me to produce and who is it I should be sharing that fruit with because he brought you through that to produce a fruit to share it with somebody he didn't call you to hide it a light that was put on a hills to be shared it's not a light to be hidden under a bushel so is that tree as you're producing fruit you're supposed to be sharing it with those around you so you - you know what you've been through in life look back take a look say God why did you take me through that you know we know the Prophet talks about he he went to the Lord one time and he had prayed for a sister and the sister didn't get any better and she passed away and really ran and went to the Lord and said Lord I demand an answer but the man said the Lord didn't speak to me for six months until I said Lord you don't owe me anything and the Lord told him he said that sister you prayed for did what he think was about a year or six months four so had been in a some type of boating accident he said she was meant to die then but she wasn't she should have drowned but she wasn't it wasn't her time and she wasn't ready said so this was just she's ready I took her home and I don't owe you an answer to nothing okay and I say that to set the president for this is many times if we've been in the message long enough we've heard that people say well God don't owe you an answer for nothing and that's the truth but I think the devil puts that out there as a scarecrow to stop you from asking Lord why not why because poor me or not why because I don't deserve this and not why for I deserve an answer but Lord why is it that I've gone through this why is it I'm going through this what purpose do you have in it for me for your kingdom because we know God never does anything without a purpose so if he's doing something and we know the trials of your faith at greater than gold that he's got a purpose because you know that means he's making an investment in you and anyone who makes an investment in someone or something is it expecting a return just like the parable of the talents were the master left he left one with ten and one with five and one with one when he came back he wanted to see what did you what fruit from these talents did you produce it wasn't just keep these talents so if he's in he's investing in you and the way you know he's investing is if you're going through a trial if you're going through a trial God's making an investment in your life isn't that amazing that's great so if if if things are going too easy just start praying for God to invest some more because he's got more to invest because he's wants something he wants two out of that investment he wants a return he's looking for a return of fruit in your life so my challenge to each of you tonight is begin looking at God's investments in your life and now ask him why say Lord why is it you invested in this way in my life and what return are you looking for for me to produce if musicians would come what return are you looking for because God never invest you know and people invest all the time in different ways depending on how they're investing it depends on what they're looking for in their return so is it in your life God puts you through individual unique trials because in his investment he's looking for an individual unique return I got one quote for you and this is where Christ where God's trying to bring us all to here in the producing of fruit here at this end time and it says brother Branham if the rising of the Sun 1965 and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has spoke of the bride all the revelations spoke of the bride throughout eons of time that's the fruit you're called to produce because that's what who were identifying with we are the Bride of Christ so what we got to do is look and see what is the bride meant to produce because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him there's no there's no in-between even he when he stood there with his disciples they said Lord show us Father and he said have I been with you so long and you do not know me and it says they hated him because he being a man was not thought it not robbery to be equal with God and here he is he's calling us to that same thing he's identifying us in the word flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him and that's why the world will hate you it's because you're able to identify yourself in the word and see yourself as a manifestation of Christ and if someone was to say can you show me Christ can you show me the Lord you'd be able to turn to them with confidence of saying Here I am have I walked amongst you so long that you do not know me it's not a prideful thing it's recognizing the very life inside you that should be producing now if people aren't seeing that then that bears witness to us that maybe we should be looking deeper we should be going smord why am I not producing a fruit that those who would look and see would be like is that him is that him I can't quite tell I can't make it out it's a little bit blurry to me that sure looks like Jesus because they did it with the profit they saw him in fact they did with all the profits that came in the time of Christ John the Baptist they said are you him he said no I'm not him he's still coming they did it to the profit of this age are you Christ he said no I'm not Christ and we're not Christ we're not Jesus Christ we're not the man we're something even greater I would say we are the manifestation we are many many many membered Body of Christ manifesting to the world see when he came he was just one that's why he said what I do show you do also and greater than I do shall you too now he had raised the dead he had healed cancer everything everything you can think of he had done but greater because there's be more of you and as you step out on the word and speak the word it's not just the disciples waiting for Jesus to come back down off the mountain because they can't speak to the Apple the demand with epileptic fit but it's a Christ in you not waiting but letting Christ and you rise up and speaking to that thing and saying in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and commanding it speaking to it that's what the wave sheaf did it came to a point where that growth that spirit that was on that growth that was attacking to our sister Mita he prayed he didn't tell nobody about it no one else knew he has sprayed the Lord said whoever you say it'll happen and he said before the surgeon pan touches her it'll be gone you know they had to help her up onto the surgical table because the growth was still in such a manifestation but even as he said before the surgeon's hand they're going into surgery they're ready to do surgery sister Mina is already out on the table she's knocked out asleep but it doesn't matter the condition of the individual on the table it matters the word that's been spoken by faith believing and that word could not come back and return void back to God himself because it came to a point where when the Prophet spoke the manifestation of a son of God fully adopted into the presence of God when he spoke goes as if the father spoken himself so now when he spoke it wasn't the words of William Branham but it was the words of God Himself going forth to the situation and now those God's own words and God's Word cannot return void to him has to happen it has to come to pass and that's the place that were called to as fruit bearing trees we're not called just to survive we're not just recalled to to live in grace we're not just called to manifest a little bit but were called to something even higher we're called to manifest the word so that when you speak it's gone Himself speaking to the situation and God Himself speaking to him that's why he has to do so much character building that's why he has to do so much trimming because you got to get that human side that flesh side so removed that you are so one with the mind of Christ in you that when you are thinking you have the very mind of Christ and you were thinking the same things that Christ Himself would think that's what the mind of Christ is about it's not about just being able to think nice thoughts but it's that the very thought you would think would be the same as the father so that the words you would express to the word is the thought Express she has to be able to think that word before can express itself and wanted to express it can't it's already gone forward life has been spoken but he has coming to that place of character to come to a place of adoption so that the father can so trust you with that word he wants to build you and build you to the point where he says I know if I give them the power they won't abuse it they'll use the power the same way I would let's just take us to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we commonly thought gone all over the place and the message has been so cut off and the Lord I been bounced all over my notes and what I thought should be said but lord may you take something father whatever it might have been Lord make someone take a hold even if it's not a word spoken here tonight but may it just drive them drive them to the foot of the cross drive them Lord to more of you Father Lord drives them to say Lord why are my Lackey drive them to say why am I not producing the fruit write them to say Lord why why if this is a promise why don't I see it in my life Dryden say Lord I can see that you're moving but Lord where's that manifestation even as Gideon father there he said if if we are God's chosen people then where are all the mighty miracles so here we stand tonight and the world is engrossed encamped against us Satan is encamped against us the demons have been released from the river Euphrates and they're out of attacking the people following see complete insanity I was moving amongst the people this world father but Lord we know that that was a sign to us as the believers that when we see sin and the devil moving so rapidly are there amongst the people father that we could look into the bride look into what you were doing in your church and see you moving father or if the evil is so great then the Spirit of God is so much greater father so we just dedicate this to your father asking that you would have your way or do we just surrender at all as you go to people bless them for their attentiveness Lord or just for staying here and being willing to listen father Lord we surrender it all to you and Jesus most wonderful and precious name Amen what's that song there what's the song let's sing that take my hand brother one if you want to come [Music] me too let's stand to our feet take my yeah pressure yeah precious lord [Music] let us be sad [Music] we [Music] Oh through ya dig my precious father we commit ourselves in your hands now take our hands the others and lead us until we meet here on Sunday keep us Lord in your good keeping hear Jesus name we pray amen let's sing that I just wash it maybe dismiss down through the storm [Music] take my head rash just long leave me know Oh precious go take my head yeah [Music]
