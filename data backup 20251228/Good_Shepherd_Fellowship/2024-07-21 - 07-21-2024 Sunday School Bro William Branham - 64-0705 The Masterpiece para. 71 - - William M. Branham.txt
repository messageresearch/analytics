[Music] [Music] for [Music] yet there was no Beauty we should desire him when this virgin born son of the Living God become so perfect and humble and in the image of God until the Great Master who had brought his life up through the prophets and he was a fulfilling of all the prophets he was so perfect until God seeing this he smote him and cried out speak as Michelangelo did speak you say is that so St Mark 9:7 we find upon on the mount Transfiguration when there stood Moses the law there stood Elijah the prophets all the way back from the Patriarchs of fathers the law the prophets and all of them stand there we hear a voice coming down from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and if they're going to hear he's got to speak just a few days before he was smitten amen this is my son who I'm pleased to dwell in I have molded him I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this and now he is so perfect I've got to Smite him so he can speak hear ye him he's the perfected one he he is the Masterpiece remember he was portrayed all times back to the Old Testament we find him being The Rock in the wilderness that was smitten Rock in the wilderness I am that rock that was in the wilderness but that was a stone that had not come to its Perfection yet but in tight form it followed the church to draw from it that that he could draw give life to those who he could give life to but he was that rock in in the wilderness he had not been made man yet he was only en typed Moses saw him standing on this rock he saw him pass by and he said it's the back part of a man you see the sculpture was presenting to Moses which was a potential image of Christ what the Great Masterpiece would look like when it was perfected he passed his he injected or or projected to Moses the vision of what the Masterpiece is go to look like it was the back part of a man when it passed by in the wilderness remember Angelo could only cry out and smite the image and say speak but how different it was to God the great sculpture when he made a man in his own image so perfect that it reflected him God SP through the image of man showing what he would do he spoke through the prophets as they were in their potential image as his bringing up to the head but when he come in the head he was all the image of God Amen he was portraying himself then smitten for us now he is the Masterpiece to us the gift of God Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we never forget that as we see the days darkening as we see the Shadows falling when I predicted just a few more turns of the sun this nation's gone do you know yesterday Fourth of July or Thomas Jefferson had signed the Declaration of Independence him and the other uh board that was with him and the liberty bell rang and we was declared in Independence as a nation according to history there has never been a democracy at any time last over 200 years that was 1776 July the 4th and we're just 11 years left will it make it no can't 11 years and if it does it'll break all history and we see the condition of time we see the condition of the people we see the condition of politics we see the condition of the world it can't stand it's got to sink like the Titanic it must go down for there's give room one nation gives room to another as it falls and this Kingdom Must Fall in ever other Kingdom to give room to that Kingdom that's coming which cannot Paul while we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved through this perfect image of God the Masterpiece God when he looked upon him he was so inspired he was so the seem the way he looked and to see the the form of him he was so inspired that it would be the perfect Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the Redeemer so God in order to be smitten himself because to pay his own penalty God and Christ became one so God could be smoked in the image he could be scarred and that's why Isaiah said we did Estee him smitten and Afflicted of God yet he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the Chas of our pieces upon on him and with his stripes we were healed the perfect image of God man God and IM marfia had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death God's perfect Masterpiece he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in the prophets Isaiah who was saw with saws till he was saw to Pieces he could not do it in the prophets that were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it there was just a potion of him but in this perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness of a godhead bodily he can not only project Moses he could project his entire being into this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it you become the Redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the backgrounds who had been before and now all promises was met in him he was a Perfection of the Perfection all types is fulfilled in him our kinsman redeemer and Ruth and Boaz our lawgiver from Mount Sonia our Prophet from the Wilderness as he come from the mountain as he come from the Wilderness as he come from eternity and become man The Perfect Image God down through the age heing Away by the Patriarchs and made his platform and brought him up from the different things that he lay this Foundation upon upon this he begin to build his word the prophets and then finally come out to the perfect Prophet the perfect Foundation the perfect vision God had now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word to speak he must come into the image and then for the image to speak has got to be smitten amen comes into the image and then in order to speak the perfect Redeemer all the types of the Old Testament was metting him as I said the other day Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new yes like many of you man women my age we used to have around the country a lot of Chinese laundries when the Chinese first started in they come from the West Coast moving Eastward coming over from the Eastern country moving this way and uh as they did they were people who were not acquainted with our language and our ways but they were fine laundrymen and uh they couldn't write the ticket so you could get your right laundry back but the chinan he got himself a bunch of little cards with nothing on it at all so when you come for your laundry he would take this card and tear it in a certain way and hand you one piece and he kept the other piece and now it's a little better than what we have now because when you come back to claim what was your own those two pieces must dovetail you couldn't impersonate it if you had to there's no way of you can make copies of letters but you can't impersonate that tear it's got to fit exactly with the other piece Therefore your dirty clothes that you brought in you could redeem them by this ticket because it match the ticket that was turned in and when God by the prophets and under the law condemned us to sin and the law has no Grace it's only tells you you are a sinner but when Jesus came on the scene he was the Fulfillment he was the the Fulfillment of everything God had promised he was a perfect identical image of the promise amen therefore all Promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in hand the prophets but it was met in the Masterpiece it matched all that it said it was is going to be so will the church have to be a match to everything God has promised amen amen must be that piece is smitten off of it so if the original is the word so will the subject just been taken from it be the word to match its side therefore the Chim you could claim where the law condem and said you were dirty and you were guilty and could put you in the prison but when he came he was the match piece for it that could take you out and bring you back to to be the complete ticket the Redemption that God had promised back in the Garden of Eden thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head but his uh heel shall bruise uh uh bruise its head now we find this perfect Masterpiece that God had completed now we notice that he was all that it was promised to be he all the promises all the prophecies everything that God had made a promise of thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head now he could not bruise it with the law he could not bruise it with the prophets but he did do it when the woman's seed became the Masterpiece Christ he was a stone that Daniel saw Hue out of the mountain he was the one could Smite he's the one that could bruise bruise the Serpent's head his life matched exactly the life of Moses his life matched David let's see if it was if he's the matching pie notice David a rejected King over his own people he was one day while he was his own son rose up in Mutiny against him and he separated and divided the armies of Israel and he was David was drove or driven by his own people from his throne and on he rolled out there was a man who hat him and he's walking along there spitting on David that guard pulled his sword said I'll let that dog's head stay on him spit on my King David said let him alone God told him to do it don't you see a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he stands like a sheep before shears [Music] Dum he said that for perhaps David didn't know what he was saying but about 5 600 years afterwards or a little more the son of David was going through them same streets amen and he was spit upon but notice what happened when David out of his out of his when he became a fugitive and out of his Exile when he when he came back that man begged for peace and mercy even those who him we'll see him one day when he returns and we find out then in Joseph as Joseph was a peculiar Barn boy the last the top part of the foundation or the Masterpiece was to be built upon it come from faith and to love and to Grace it come to Perfection and so did it from the feet of the beginning come forth unto perfection in Christ notice how that he was portrayed in Joseph the top of the foundation the most perfect of all of them we find that Joseph was born to his family and he was by the legal woman actually which was um Jacob's wife and notice also that when he was born his father loved him and his brothers hated him without a cause why did they hate him because he was the word amen see the very Foundation see how the head of the foundation come look at the head of the body comes I watch the head of the Bride come he was the word and they hated him because he was a sear he foresaw things and told him they happened no matter how long it lingered it happened just the same and by being spiritual he was excommunicated from his Brethren they ought to have loved him but they hated him because he was a prophet he was spiritual and they hated him notice he was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver thrown into a ditch and supposedly be dead but was tuck up from the ditch and in his time of Temptation the prison the Butler and the the baker we know that the butler was saved and the baker was lost and in Christ's prison house on the cross one was saved and the other was lost two thieves two wrongdoers and we notice he was taken from his prison to the right hand of Pharaoh that no man could speak to Pharaoh only through Joseph and when Joseph left that Throne of pharaoh the trumpet sounded throughout Egypt the blast went forth and said bow that he everybody Joseph is coming forth so will it be with Jesus how he was loved of the father and hated of them denominational Brethren Without a Cause he was sold for 30 pieces of silver as it was and put into the ditch supposedly to be dead on the cross one lost and the other and saved and was lifted up from the cross and sets at the right hand of God in the Majesty of the great spirit which have been reflected in him and no man can speak to God only through Jesus Christ thank of it and when he leaves that Throne starts forth a trumpet of sound and every knee shall bow now and every tongue shall confess amen remember he was a son of prosperity everything that he did prospered whereever his prisoner whever it was it come out right and has he promised for his children and they make everything work together for the good whe it was sickness prison house death Sorrows whatever it was they would work for the good to them that loved [Music] him he promised it it must be so it's got to be there it's figurative spoke to us in himn he was that perfect image of God now we see here also that when he comes again remember Joseph by Revelation Save the World by his great prophecy the world would have died if it hadn't been for Joseph and the world would would been dead if it hadn't been for Jesus for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish God is reserving life on and on we could go because he was simply the match of David he was the match of Moses he was the match of Elijah he was the match of Joseph everything is a portrayed or foretold by in the Old Testament match into that what is it showing a perfect Redeemer that we can put our old dirty clothes into the laundry go claim it again has been washed in the blood of the lamb praise the Lord hallelujah we can claim what's our own and everything that he died for we can claim it so he was a perfect word portrayed it pleased God the great sculpture to Smite him and to do it this way we see him in Isaiah here is read we all did a Ste him we turned our face from him there's no beauty that we should desire him everybody talking about him make fun of him I'm talking about him now in this day everybody making fun of him see we did esteem him we saw him esteem means to look at we did Este him smitten Afflicted of God yet he what did he do this far he was wounded for our transgressions amen he was bruised for our iniquity now we could go on and on with that but I believe you had the picture of what I mean now God building back his Masterpiece but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoke the side of Adam he took something from his side now the smiting of Christ this was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride you might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but all the same creation my brother don't think bad of this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the [Music] bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word Kimberly South Africa once I was looking at diamonds how they was brought up out of the ground and I seen him laying there as well the the superintendent of the plant or the mine was one of my ushers in the prayer line and uh I noticed the diamonds valued at tens of thousands of dollars piled together but they didn't Sparkle even under the light and I said to the superintendent of the mindes I said why don't they sparkle he said sir they haven't been cut yet they must be cut then when they are cut then they reflect the light there you are the Masterpiece must be cut notice cut for what is the piece cut off no no the piece is cut off is made of betr needle and the victrola needle is put upon a a a record that's unseen music to the world but the needle is what brings it out brings out the true interpretation of the word [Music]
