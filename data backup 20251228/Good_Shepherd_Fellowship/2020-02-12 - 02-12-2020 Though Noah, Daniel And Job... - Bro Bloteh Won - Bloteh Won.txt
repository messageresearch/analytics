for the service on Sunday it was special in the selfie mean but then coming with their education just behind Joshua testimony was just specially me and we are grateful for their praise the Lord and a few like we announced on Sunday this coming Sunday we'll have a communion service we want to remind you 5 p.m. we'll be back in the evening to have communion with the Lord we skip the communion service the first Sunday of this month and then since I will be away the first Sunday of next month so I think it would be a good thing for us to come in fellowship in have a prayer meeting Sunday evening and you pray for me anywhere I pray for you and we can stand on the promises of God amen praise the Lord also Sunday we will you also may make some announcement for the month of March I was I was thinking about [Music] I was actually talking to one of the same thing we were and there was a question that was asked me how do you know a religious spirit and so after we talk a little bit and talk to the person and and just gather them in the word I actually ask them to go and listen to a message after we finish talking I said listen to this message and then you you might be able to learn a little bit from it but then I was thinking about there too when I got out of their composition I said well maybe there will be a good thing maybe they come in not of match we will have a time I think I spoke about then we supposed to be almost done with the subject that he's doing for Sunday school and then we would take the message impersonation of Christianity there's 57 or 120 we will play that but then we will announce and also encourage you to be able to listen to the message at home study it yourself because as we play a true through the other Sunday School there are there there are things that we would like to talk about whether when we come to the end of the message we will we would like to just open a time of discussion and see some of the things that we pick up during that time now you know I want to speak on something tonight just before we go home but you know I've never tried to be I try to keep politics away from the pulpit because it's no place for politics you know but they are things that that are happening around us I don't know what this year holds for us but we know him the whole time in eternity Heys but we see things things are moving in in a direction word we I mean we learn to trust the law and just look to see how everything is happening around us but now I was standing I want to encourage you this is just the second month of the year and Bert Branham says in the same night that Jesus was betrayal from that time that Judas Iscariot the communion service and went over to the todo to the Pharisees right between that time he says there were thousands of prophecy that was fulfilled from that time to the very time what Jesus said father into your hands I commit my spirit a short period of time there were thousands of Bible prophecies that will fulfill so God don't need a whole year to to fulfill all of his word he don't need a whole year praise the Lord I believe that we we are standing on one of the greatest time in history and because our future is the rapture so it's one of the greatest time in history that we are standing but year instead is a scary time to the word amen to the people that don't have no hope and no foundation in Christ is a scary time to them praise the Lord just a couple of years back the nation kind of legalized same-sex marriage and it was looking like a big thing but now we have in same-sex marriage going into the White House in a White House race then it should be more scary to the nation these things happen you know and we wink our shoulder I didn't and you know and and one of the one of the thing about the last year's spirit is is to just make you complicit it is to just is to just have you to agree with the Papa love you everybody is agreeing with it let's let's agree with it let's see what will happen praise the Lord but I think better it's not a time for father for the church to be lazy it's not a time for the church to be slumbering praise the Lord it's time for us to be on our toes it's time for us to be seeking the face of God it's time for us to be praying it's time for us to be cleaning our lives and cleaning our home and cleaning the church and bringing the power of God creating an atmosphere for the part of God to come back in the church because we we need their power to get out of here praise the Lord amen in as much as last year was a was a year of you know we we were trusting the Lord in and I mean believing God for different things and it's like we came to the end of the year and we fear they're accountable relief of victory I think like brother Branham says the more lawyer you become the more trial you have so with that being said tonight I just want to take a little touch here from the Book of Ezekiel chapter 14 if we were just into our feet and Ezekiel chapter 14 let's read from verse 12 and the word of the law came again unto me saying son of man when the land seen it against me but trespassing grievously then I would stretch out my hand upon it and we break this type of the bread there off and we same farming upon it and we cut off man and beast from it though these three men Noah Daniel and job were in it - you deliver both their own Souls by their righteousness said the Lord God if I caused not zombies to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts though these three men were in it as I live saith the Lord God they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall they only shall be delivered but the lane shall be desolate or if I bring a sward upon the lane and say it's war go through the lane so that I cut off men and beasts from it though these three men over and over the scripture talks about these three men let's pray together Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we just ask Oh God - nightfire the Lord as we come of garden and try to Lord approach you by the way of praying and in trying to concentrate on your Lord trying father to get our mind from the destruction of father of our self in the things that is around us Lord we come humbly tonight father and asking your help that you would come of God and just bless the portion of your word that we have read all God and speak to us to night Lord we're just committing ourselves into your hand so father Lord we need you tonight Lord like the son says all white needy this our father God in every hour of my life I need him father we will pray tonight and seek your mercy again we will pray tonight father and confess I was Saints Lord and say have mercy upon us O God we will pray to naru father and say fill us with the Holy Ghost we will pray tonight and say Lord we want more of you father take your word tonight oh god father Lord and write them upon the tables of our hearts O God we love you and we appreciate you blessed it's time to get a noun in Jesus name we pray amen Allah bless you you may have your seat though these three men estranged died right here the Bible brings these three characters together I pray that the law will be able to help helping to be able to do we ought to draw something from here tonight I will be able to help us now the Bible year that Ezekiel the Prophet is talking about a time of judgment as we spoke about that one time we were talking about the importance of the Elijah ministry we pick up these three things over and over you see in the scripture whenever God will bring judgment to the land he always come in one of these three or four why because four is the number of deliverance praise the Lord so yeah God spare are four things is pestilence not some beasts and in a small and funny praise the Lord amen so these four things he point out here in the scripture but all through the Bible and commentators and great men that stated the scripture they took these three men Noah Daniel and job to be the most three righteous men counted out in the stricture for the fact that God is even measuring them over to the prophet Ezekiel then job lived a very long time and I call into history he came right after the time of Noah because job referred to the floor in his writing so he was right between the time of Noah and Abraham he might have left praise the Lord Amen now brother Branham said job is the oldest book in the Bible it does not means that he lived before Adam it means that that was the first recorded book because Moses was the one that wrote the book of Genesis but what job has already given job has already had a record of his trial amen because he said it there in the book of Job praise the Lord so so we see here that God is measuring this and that's one of the reason why we can believe that the book of Job is not just a story that was formulated about somebody it was a real thing amen because God would not bring it back if it was just a story that Moses wrote or a story that somebody wrote just to make us to feel sorry for the man called job it was something that actually happened to a human just like you and myself praise the Lord amen are we together but God is bringing this that time you have to realize now that this is the time of of the anxiety of Israel over there in Babylon and I mean he's talking about after the people have seen it against God the people has gone away from God I mean when people have indulged themselves in things that is against the Word of God just just going against mercy amen praise the Lord and God over and over to show him mercy but the people still riding over God's mercy then he comes down to this place and says if he bring a judgment he says a visitation upon the land whether is a farming or whether is a sward and pestilent we seeing all of these things happening and we see that great virus over there in China just like the Ebola was in Africa and all of these things there is all signs of judgment praise the Lord Amen when those things comes in and take and hundreds of life away is it's not an accident it's a sign of judgment prays alone and it's now owned it against China it's against the whole world because those virus they don't need possible to travel anywhere it's right in the air praise the Lord I think we need to be breathing in God's Word and reading God's promises taking this Bible and sticking it to our nose and in God's promises then you know then then Wareham axis will help us also praise the Lord but you ever said that God is saying I mean he's talking to the prophet Ezekiel yet and the word of the Lord came and says son of man which mean the Prophet and when they went that when when the land seen against me but trespassing grievously you remember the days the days of Noah what did the scripture says when the Spirit of God would no longer strive with me a man can do something and God will keep beating iya conscious but there will be a time we're going not strive with you and it's a dangerous place to be amen that the God of heaven will decide not to even warn you not to even touch your conscious now to even touch your heart nothing nothing I mean nothing would seem wrong and how many times he he pricks our conscious and he speak to us but yet instead we stayed guest stubborn and we stick in our ways how much more if he choose to not strive with you if the land seen grievously trespass grievously I mean same gets to the place where God says I fool my hands let me see if you can bring yourself out amen he says if if the if the land ever gets to that place see what he's saying if the lame ever gets to that place and he said even if these three men with all the erogenous the Bible says Noah was a righteous man amen job got stuck in the integrity of his righteousness he would not take the accusation of his of his friends praise the Lord now even though these three men Noah job and Daniel was found in their lane God is saying their prayers cannot hold back God's judgement now the reason why I bring in the scripture is because we are right at that place we are right at our pleasure year people Oh let's pray for the nation you know how I was some work and and and it was not tool I was trying to do something and it was not too long this person knew that I was a preacher begotten they were looking at some information and and and then we started talking from wanting to another you know in his having all of this great mind you know in her and you and this nation will rise again in Africa will rise again I mean and they were talking all of these things and you know we started talking things and things he was saying that your stolen assets were you know when when people drift away from God that's the reason why we can we can see the kind of things that we are having you know seed up one of the greatest nation in a word being blessed just like Israel you know and see the things that is happening around the world you know but there is there is a this hope amen you know there is this hope Eman and it's not bad that we have this hope but we must be hoping for a resurrection we must be hoping for a rapture not a death Society to rise again because there is nothing can come from out of this society what is America this Europe or Africa is there's nothing good can come from out of it the only thing good will be the crops of God the Redeem of the Lord praise the Lord so God is talking to is right here in the case of of Jerusalem what Jeremiah have prophesied on their laning and against the evil that the people have done that even though these three men were in it their prayer will not save the city the appraiser will not save the city praise the Lord now back in Genesis when it when Abraham was interested in now you have to remember Genesis chapter 15 the city of Sodom was conquered and Abraham went out with his man and he redeemed his kursi lot and the king of Sodom and and but this time and when those angels went down there to sue them Abraham was on the other side Intercity he was now only interceding for for Lord he was interceding for the city of Sodom praise the Lord Genesis chapter 15 god back Abraham a man that never had no military he just wanted rally the men Eliezer and the rest of those boys that was in his house God was able to go before them amen was able to go before them in in battle and and and give him the victory fighting with bronze takes aim and and and hawks and and and whatever they could have in your hand but yet God was able to back him up but this time God would not even hear his seven price of Oy it's very interesting because when you look at these three men Daniel was in a time when the swore was visiting the land because it took the captivity of Jerusalem to put Daniel into Babylon Jim was in a time where pestilence was visiting his body and Noah was in a time that I would call the time of Fahmy praise the Lord amen so we see these things and it's strange that you look at you look at out of those men in the time that I live and the things that were going on you realize that the Bible says Noah what Joseph Armour amen he was just a farmer a humble simple farmer and he got a call from the Lord and girls start dealing with his head he was not even into construction but yet God asked him to build a knack all he knew was just to tell the earth praise the Lord and you realize it's so it's so strange that God is saying this to Ezekiel the Prophet I read something to you from your enemy in a little bit here that God is saying this to Ezekiel the Prophet it's so strange because you realize that each of those men in their age and time just like her job hard to stand alone Noah also had to stand alone Daniel also had to stand alone praise the Lord you can go on any one righteousness they all had to stand alone in India day of trial prays alone you just think about it the whole world at that time the whole world had Noah's time the whole world the whole existing word at that time he was the only man that had the message bill a knock there was nobody as preaching that same message anywhere around the world it was the whole entire world against one man Laura and he had to stand with his conviction that he believed that he had where from God he believed that there was going to be rain when it had not even rained he had to stand alone against the whole entire world praise the Lord I mean Dania had to stand alone publicly when the King announced that there will be no man to pray I believe there were other Jews that were praying but they were all praying in hiding but Dania had to be the only man alone that will open his curtains because there was nobody that went to the lion den with Dania he went there alone he had to stand alone just like job it was injured generation there was no male like this man job it had never happened before four in one day time for the man to lose all his all all that he ever had never happy in the world but he had to stand alone it's wrong well we have to be we have to be begging people we have to text them we have to call them we have to I mean we have to do everything and God has given us I mean everything but yet a state is so hard to stand when we have all the support to rest on a stay hard to stand but this man had to stand alone praise the Lord amen and God is saying even if they were there if they were if they were now yet in this age the righteousness will only be sufficient for the alone praise the Lord or sometimes we want to think maybe our our our you know husband is a preacher or our wife is this or our you know you can go on there you have to get your own personal experience it's a blessed thing when when when the wife can have an experience with God and she know the Word of God and the husband can happen experience with God in the day where when one feeling another one can be able to encourage himself living in a society worthy you know we might just I mean please one another you know yeah honey if that's why you say okay that's the kind of asset I mean situation that we are in so a whole home would just go straight under the rock or go in a flaw because really there is nobody standing we just only pleasing pleasing praise the Lord but there's something that caught my attention here I'm getting out of time a little bit let's read we pick up we stopped dead on verse 17 or if I bring a swarm swarm upon the lane and said sward go through the lane so that I cut off men and beasts from it though these three were in it as I left said the Lord they shall deliver neither songs or daughter need a son or daughter so even Noah songs how to get a revelation of what their father was saying they never only came into the act because their fathers say coming to the eyes they had to get a revelation but then owner shall be delivered himself or I send pestilence into the lane and pour out my fur and upon it in blood to cut off from it men and beasts though lowered on your job way in it as us as I left said the Lord God they shall deliver need a son or non daughter they but deliver their own soul by the earth righteousness amen that's reason why we must encourage our children to the new birth amen we must encourage them but that said the Lord God how much more when I send my false cold judgment upon Jerusalem where is the false cold judgment the swore the farming not zombies and pestilence to cut the lane are we together amen now to Israel you look through the scripture or through the scripture all through the scripture it was either one or the other one of these things God always used to get his people back into the adjoining he either bring it upon them to rebuke them punish them and get them back to to start seeking the face of God get him back to start calling upon God how are we together like better Bentham says Satan is just like a whip in the hands of God now so we realized here I to the church in the natural word we will see these things happening but it came to the church in a spiritual form he looked over in Revelation chapter 6 Revelation chapter 6 speaks to us of the praise the Lord religion chapter 6 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and beheld the white house and he that sat on it had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now you have to watch the way that God is with Israel in the natural he also deals with the church in the spiritual amen now so the things the happy to Israel in the natural always come to us the Redeem Church in the spiritual amen Israel inheritance was and natural in everything's our inheritance is a spiritual inheritance are we together now and just like how God said to Israel year telling him there he he called it I like the way the scripture said in here a full school judgment praise the Lord a force called judgment and now you have to realize and that's the two things that follow the opening of the seal judgment and mercy praise the Lord amen and just like Israel whenever God brings any of these judgment upon him whenever he brings judgment when when David number the people and God was not happy with David an angel of the Lord came down praise the Lord and what did he said he pronounced judgment to David he said even though either I would commit you in the hands of your enemy by war or I would bring farming upon the lame or I will bring pestilence upon the land praise the Lord but what happened given you that whenever judgment comes there is always a little door for mercy praise the Lord and we together because you see it's almost like the like like the believer when God takes us through trial what I was trying for like the scripture says is to purified us is to bring us our more stronger is to bring it out as God that's the same way when God brings judgment upon the leg is to set the people back into the mines for the journey I mean and so call the redeemed out is to open the eyes of the people it's to get down to that to that predestinated seed in the heart of the Ilia for them to start seeking the face of God and start looking for mercy praise the Lord and the ones that don't have no knowledge of mercy they get wept out in the Josh manner praise the Lord is that seed of God in your heart that make you to cry for mercy whenever there is judgment amen whenever there's sickness upon your body you say O God have mercy upon me it ain't going wrong o God have mercy upon me praise the Lord that's the two things that follow the opening of the seal you find there as you go through the book of Revelation we're not dealing on the seals tonight but I'm trying to help you help us to see that just like God had those four squirt a judgment that he deal with Israel is all through the scripture as I've said is the same thing applied to the church amen now so all of the seals are the opening of the seals going I give us an understanding that just like he'd air with Israel naturally spiritually right from the Church of Jerusalem to the church our goals completely in the rapture God has been dealing with the people spiritually are we together you think about thing about it right there in the book of odds the Holy Ghost had just felt these people has God a fresh experience from God the pillar of fire coming down in the upper room literally seeing God and flaming the hearts I mean that the ones that were quiet and I mean that the dry eye Christian were all crying the ones that were quieter were all shouting and praising God the ones that you think they're not had no bones in your body the hands were all lifting or thanking God and speaking in tongues agreed a move of God amen but it would not be too long they will start whipping them in the public it will start arresting them and giving them public whip praise the Lord what was happening it was a cannibal spiritual attack on the church because remember bird balances when I see you openly declare war whenever God does something in the midst of the people it declares war amen when we prayed and God answered our prayer you get ready for more of the devil to come that is the reason why I'm encouraging you you better get back to your praying closet praise the Lord find time to pray because I'm telling you there is a shake that is going to come that is going to shake and you need a unshakable stand just like Paul says everything that can be shaped will be shaken now so we see you're writing us in in the scripture we're going to have just like we had for anointing the scripture called them beasts and arrived from Ezekiel they are called living creatures but actually they are for anointing that is given to the church for the church protection we also have there is also what is called the hospital amen but Brenham help us to understand there from the message countdown okay my time was to be out him from the message countdown when he talks on the message countdown what actually he was teaching was the the gathering of of power that I mean the the knowledge there to realize the other goal gave these hearses these beasts you know power to be able I mean to plot the field to be able to transport man and and and you know someone grabbed the revelation and realized that if I can be able to be a little card and set it and set it behind a hearse put wheels on it my hearse can be able to carry me it's this this beast has a power now sober Branham was was was teaching us to realize that man in his mind in his falling knowledge was able to grab there that the Beast the animal has power instead of just holding the ground and breaking a water Bay they were able to build instrument and put it on the shoulders of cows to be able to tell the ground and make big feet I mean that the power that is put that is that is in when you put two animals together that the more work that can be able to do now he was he was using that in a type to be able to show that is the same way that a God also has given power to the church are we together now so you see this horse rather in a book of Revelation is also talking about a power that is coming against the church and the living creatures are also speaking about the spiritual power that the church also have are we together now you have to remember the Holy Spirit spoke to to Zerubbabel that is Napa might it's neither power but it's by his Spirit I mean so it's not in a physical power and strain or anything that the church can be able to do it's in the power that comes from God's Word are we together so just like how is shown here that's what Bob Arum was teaching in the message count down how the church has been moving in strength to strength just like how science has been advancing from the hearses to an automobile amen seeing how the horses were I mean a fair rehearsal school I mean cool ramen and and I mean and seeing how those basic applauded a field man was able to gather that an increase strength talk to mechanism to be able to make an engine of a car to go more then a hearse can go amen and then when he make an aeroplane he was able to increase the power for the plane to go low then the vehicle can go now when he goes went into space with an atomic racket he only increased the horsepower that the atomic plane can go faster than your Delta airline can go now so brother Branham was teaching us that man could only achieve that because it was the same thing that God did in the spiritual I mean he was teaching us that's what God did in the spiritual through the church ages the more the church was advancing the more power amen are we together the first anointing I was on the church before anointing was the man's anointing the arc sine moiety the ego anointing and which one the lion anointing so each of this anointing had enough power to be able to preserve the church the first three Church ages was under the Lions anointing that was the ages were great in the moving out of the gospel that's the reason why when the persecution came on the church they had to spread about you remember in the book of Acts the people were selling their land and bringing all their all their well-being to the feet of the apostille why were they trying to do they were trying to settle down now they have seen the power of God yeah we are coming to Saturday I can say all my leg I mean the power of God is in this place Peter by his shadow we are being healed I mean I mean we just saw Ananias and Sapphira died from being dis earners the power of God is so much they were about to settle down God said it's not time to settle them so what he had to do bring great persecution upon the church and the people scattered bad and the gospel started going around the world there was the lion's anointing so there was there was enough power that's the reason why I Paul calling died being bit by a second because there was enough power in the church are we together when it came to the time of the persecution under the axe anointing they were also enough power for people to hold to their faith and walk to the Lions Den they had enough power praise the Lord another one that we don't have fit for the two egg library Baraboo say offer a headache but these people they I mean ago it was the anointing that was on the church under the Foxy Brown says the church couldn't do anything but just to respond to her anointing we don't have that we don't have that anointing in this age this age is an ego sonority it's a it's a is I mean is it's the anointing year is to fly away praise the Lord amen no one astronaut trouble comes in a church people start flying away praise the Lord you only responded to your anointing I can blame you you don't have the anointing to die so you just fly away but what are we trying to say this is just to be able to show the power the power that was moving the church because there was a power that was coming against the church are we together that's what I'm trying to show you so just like how God was was dealing with his rating and natural so here we see under the first church age we had a we had a a horrible year a power that was coming against the church and and and and this power that was coming against the church if we take it honor the full skull Josh mean what was the force called Josh mini-game anybody remember we just read in Ezekiel swirl wishes war famine pestilence sickness and now zombies so that we take if we take it under the false code judgment here we have a beast a man with with he has a board he's declaring war against the church amen he's declaring war against the church in honor honor the Ox anointing we have a rare house rather and power was given unto him they are sat on it to take peace from the earth now if you go back to the Book of Ezekiel the the the the nose the nose on beasts you know was worth a wide Anna mercy you know coming and drop the people from the land all sometimes during the time of famine the locals would come you know and eat all the across just like the time of affair of frogs jumping in their plates on their bed and making man to leave the city and run into the mountains gaku okay cool thinking even you sir are flies to drive the people away amen I'm gonna trying to bring out these things so you can be able to see that just like how God be with Israel in the natural the same thing has been happening to the church but in a spiritual way now when brother Branham taught the seals he was dealing with with the most spiritual things that were happening to the church amen in the spiritual way that the Antichrist power was attacking the church the third beast what was this work to do a measure of wheat now if you if you look at a measure of wheat and all what will you take that on a farm amen because a measure of wheat if wheat is becoming so expensive which mean there is a drought in the lane glory be to God Amen now watch watch this here in Revelation chapter 6 verse 8 let me let me try to to close up here I can take the whole night to preach this I'm kind of all straighten a little bit out of my my toes tonight but that's fine verse seven and when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see there are four beasts there are four power that was calling to come and see is the Eagles anointing and our Lord and behold at Pihl house and his name that sat on him was death and hell follow him and he and and power was given unto him power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth now you take salt hunger death and the beasts of the earth take it back to Ezekiel chapter 14 you will see your force call judgment are we together amen the night will not allow us to go through all of these things if the Lord keep the toad on our heart will continue on a Sunday if not we will try to follow what he want us to do but the reason why I try to bring this tonight it's for us to encourage ourself and realize that we are not in a picnic this is not a happy go game we are playing where we just want everybody to come along let's be happy this is time where we have to know where we stand with God praise the Lord because I'll tell you there is not a day that goes by that God don't speak to you there was not a day that goes by right 4:00 in the morning when he wakes us up for us to come out of sleep he calls you by name it's not your alarm that wakes you up I will tell you take your alarm to the grave and see if you'll wake those people up when we wake up it's so easy for us to get consumed into the daily activity because our Facebook feed is failed the phone is there with lot of messages on it and things are popping up and down and we don't even acknowledge the one that caught us by name around for our phone the young people we want to see won't post this morning that the first thing that run through our mind and then we get caught up into our our religious recitation the same thing we said to the Lord yesterday is the same thing we say today if those three men when in this age even your righteousness will not stop the wrath of God for the thing that is coming upon the lane the judgment that is coming upon the lane the name of God has been blunt Fame wickedness is who is rotting out like a mighty floor I mean is swallowing the people has never been on an increase where parents are taking their own children life it's just like in a book of Kings where they were offering their children to fire it's never been like that even if those three men were year they can never start this age from the wrath of God there is evil that is eating the heart of man every day it's eating the heart of man and if you have the grace of God speaking to your heart you better count yourself a privileged person and listening to the still small voice and do what the Lord is bidding you to do and get away from the
