========================================

[Music] you hit a place where somebody say see somebody talking nobody else talking see well then one of the deacons walk up and say we uh we want you to worship during time of the service you see see it's not a house of talk it's a house of worship understand I think that was it please explain yeah let see please explain how to the Deacon should in the sanctuary that's all that's right that's it all right now here's the last one brother Brandon when we have uh had opportunities on the beginning of the service I'm come we had complaints it's WR real little I had complaints in it had complaints in the beginning of the service we have um we we we have songs we have songs testimon testimonies and prayers and and prayer request special singing and um you maybe get it get into the message getting into the message at 11 to or after but don't have too much don't have too much time for the word some of the people get restless and have leave before it is is before before it's over it's please explain how many songs and what time to start the message and some sometime we have prayer request and it in ends up in a testimony meeting some uh things that don't be don't seem time right at the time I hope I've got that Billy trying to help me here on the tape you have somebody in the M meeting in the service listening to what this was is Billy trying to help me read it because it's wrote very very fine and um I couldn't make it out I got the general idea it is that how many songs uh should we sing before starting the service and what time should service start now the first thing I want to make here is the confession and when I'm wrong I want admit I'm wrong see and I and I I'll make a confession here that I kind of the leader of that because it's been me holding these long services and things it's what got the church into this routine see of doing so but it shouldn't be and now remember I have I am telling you all Sunday night if the Lord willing on Sunday night and I'm trying to a lot my services from hence for if I have to stay a week extra till about 30 or 40 minutes at the longest for my services because I found this that a service that's it stands up and the message is given and the power if you go too far you wear the people out and they don't get it the reason I've been given I know that all along the most successful speakers are those who have exactly Jesus is a man a few words watch his sermons watch Paul's sermon on the day of Pentecost probably taking me 15 minutes he punched to there's something that that that sent 3,000 Souls into the kingdom of God see just R straight to the spot see and I I'm guilty because the reason I've have done this not because I didn't know different but I'm making haes see and these tapes will be played in houses for hours after hours after hours but as you'll find out the coming Sunday the reason I've done it this coming Sunday the reason I've done these things I might say it right now on the tape the reason that I have did this is because of this tremendous wait upon me for the message of this hour to get it out now the message is out now I'm taking a 30 minutes or something like that after the first of the year and my meetings out in the every World ago and try to even set my watch to 30 minute or not over 40 at the most punch to that message and make the alter call if I or whatever I'm going to do or call the prayer line and not take that much time because you do wear the people out I know that but look here I guess in the year we haven't had a dozen people get up and walk out and sometimes I keep them here for two and three hours see that's right because it's been making these tapes that goes all over the world see and the people out there they'll set for hours and listen to that ministers and so for Germany Switzerland Africa Asia and everwhere see listening to that but see for the sanctuary for the church and now that's all right if you're he making a tape and you got a 2hour tape put a 2hour message on it but if you're not making a tape for something like that then cut her message cut her message down I tell you why there some fill up easy some fill up long see like that and you've got to be the happy medium between it and how many times that we ruin our services by a dragged out testimony meeting which I know I'm guilty of doing it and you get out used to have Street meetings and some old brothers stand out there and he'll stand out and ask him to offer a word of prayer and he'll pray for the mayor of the city and for the governor of the state and for the president of the union and and uh everybody like all the pastors around and each one but number and sister Jones that's in the hospital and things like that and the people standing walking by on the street Mee you keep just keep on walking see it just wore them out we're just a see the main thing now your prayer is to be in secret your main long prayer Pray all enter into secret Closet close the door that is where you want to pray all day all night or two hours pray there but in here where you've got the attention of the people make your prayer short quick add it make all your service and put the most of your service time into that word that's the main thing punch that word just as hard as you can see get the word to the people now here's my suggestion now now remember I've confessed that I'm guilty of leading this on but then I've told you why I've Le it on I'm making two hour tapes to be sent overseas and everywhere of a message you see but the church shouldn't pattern that the message here at the Tabernacle after them tapes two hours to be gone places see and go out like that now here's what your order let me just give you an example would that be all right a suggestion I would say that the church should have its doors open at a certain time let the congregation come in let the songs be playing and let everybody come in to worship not to visit and don't let them visit afterwards tell them to dismiss and get out not to visit you wanted to visit there's a ho outside but this is the sanctuary let this be kept clean now if the spirit of the Lord is dealing here let's keep it Spirit of the Lord and and uh and it'll keep if you don't you just mark my words it's going to fall it's sure will and let's keep it's our duty that's why I'm here tonight just keep this thing lined up with these these ERS now look I would say this ordinarily unless we are giving out especially and tell them you're going to tape a message see now brother Neville has a message here that he's going to he's got a message he wants to get out to the people out on tape or something say now next Sunday night we're going to tape a 2hour tape three-hour tape or what or what more we're going to give a two or three hour tape or whatever it might be next Sunday night and then the people know and then when they come in say now we are going to tape a message tonight tonight and I've got a message here and I want to tape sent out I've been I feel led to send this message out it's going to be taped it maybe two hours 3 hours or whatever it is say that but ordinarily just as I do when I'm going into a place like one of them businessman's meetings or I'm out in my meetings out there for a prayer line if I stood up there and give a three-hour message of a night before having a healing service you see where it puts me see why the people next night your congregation's half of what it was see because they just can't do it they got to go to work and everything I'd suggest this that's ordinarily I watched brother Neville last night uh when he preached I know we all know that's a startling message I took notes I got here in my pockets to use another messages of my own that's right uh the way of Escape see and that was a marvelous message you see how quick he got that through see about 35 minutes see and he he had it over now that was fine now and brother Neville usually his messages are like that see stop that WR see before you kill your meeting is all that draw out stuff before you get to it see now and and where you do that I know and I I I'm not saying that dishonor to you trustees or deacons or or pastor but I'm just telling you see what's trth and this is what it must be now you what does it now everybody you're all good nature every one of you man are good nature wasn't so I'd say all but brother so and so he's not got a good nature we're all praying for him but you you do have good natures and you're longsuffering gentle quite s man that's fine but don't be a with that Jesus is good nature too but when it come time to say things it's written my father's house is made the house of prayer and you're making it a d to thieves see he he know when to speak and when not to that's that's that's what we got to do see never was a person like Jesus he was God and remember he even talk about being a deacon in the church he he took over he ped some ropes togethers and he didn't wait to gently walk come out he beat him out see as a house of God and he was playing the part of a deacon for an example to you deacons see he was your example and now it's it's written my father's house is made a House of Prayer now remember Jesus was the Deacon man you know that Jesus is taking the part of a deacon when he come to the part of a pastor what do he say you blind Pharisees leaders of the blind see he take the part of a pastor then and when he told him what was going to happen he taken the part of a prophet see and when they required that there must be tribute played he taken the part of a trustee Peter go down and cast a hook into the river and the first fish you take up it's got a corn in his mouth pay him pay your just debts if it give Caesar what's Caesar God's what's God he was both Pastor Prophet trust the and Deacon sure what so then you see what he did let that be your example in the house here at this brandom Tabernacle that we want to be a house that he'll be honored in with everything every office every place that there'll be no taken back to be gentleness and sweetness and kindness but yet straight on the line every man said he supp to duty see that's the way that's the way he wants it he never slag when it come time to say call what was what he called it when it come time to show gentl in he showed gentl he was sweet kind understanding but Stern and everything was right to the dot with him and he did that for your example now the Holy Spirit just gave me that so I never thought about that him being Deacon before but he was see he he acted as deacon now I'd say this say if your services begin at 7:30 if that's the time open your church half hour beforehand it's 7:00 Let The Pianist telling Argan do you pay her you all pay the Argan is she PID her a Pianist she does it free will ask her with a gist even if she wants to have pay for it to give her something for it tell her we want her a half hour for service and if she says well I can't do it or something complaint then just have her come here and make a tape of some sweet organ music you see and let put that on the don't have to be here every time set your tape up see one of the deacons trusty orever open the janitor put it on up there the tape on and let it be play while the people com see because if the deacons are not here somebody that trustee or somebody be a to do it and let them play for a half hour but exactly 7 dir let that bell toll on top of the belly see you still have your bell out there yeah all right let your bell told at 7:30 and that means that we're not going to walk up and down the church and shake hands with Joneses and all that let the song leader be on the job if there's no song leader there let the Deacon see that there see that there's somebody to start leading songs and that Bell starts tolling turn to your hbook number so and so see Let It Be Right on the St at at 7:30 all right then I have a congregational song and then maybe a second congregational song and then have somebody already spoke of if you can to lead in prayer let the uh the pastor well the pastor shouldn't be there the song leader should do that if it's brother caps I think see you know what do let let him have someone spoke or he leading prayer have the congregation to stand in prayer see just stand up and let somebody lead in prayer now if you don't watch we believe that everybody should come to the house of God and pray that's that's a place of pray but when you're in that Sanctuary conserve your time see you call them all up around the altar you'll find out there'll be somebody will'll be there for 15 20 minutes your time's all run out that's you're see your praying's at home Jesus said when you pray don't stand like the Hypocrites do and for long make a long prayer and say this that or the other and all like that for a sh see he said when you pray pray enter into the closet secret Closet close the door behind you pray your father that says in secret he shall reward thee opening now that's the way to have secret prayer that's what he said do but when you somebody when they come in let the song reader say all right after the first song then let somebody have prayer ever who it is just a short prayer don't stand up and pray for all the governors and so forth like that if there's any prayer request let it be known let be sent in have sent in right it say here but tonight in having prayer we're remember sister so and so brothers so and so in the hospital so and so and so and so and so and so remember him in your prayers as you pray brother Jones would you lead us in prayer let's stand let it be laid on the platform tell them let them get used to that if you got a request for prayer lay it up here up here don't be speak who has a request now would you be let it know but and then the first thing somebody get say glory to God you know start off like that and the first thing it's a half hour for the sit down sometimes see we are responsible for this church not others this is our responsibility to God these offices are your responsibility to God see reason I'm saying you're not telling you all this is because it's my responsibility to God it's your responsibility car it out see now and when something uh like that let somebody lead in prayer and when they do that's fine let lead in prayer then sit down and if you got a special I wouldn't say this I wouldn't go along and if anybody wants to sing a special announce it in the church tell them any specials or anything that wants to be sing

feeling good see if you don't and see if you let see you you you mean well see but see you know this is about 33 years in this platform for me 33 years the world around you learn a little something in that much time surely see if you don't you better quit so that see I find out this now if you're dealing with this Saints all together man you can just stay all night if you wanted to what your see you're not dealing with them exactly you're trying to catch these out here here's the ones you're catching you got to work on their field see and don't bring them in here and then let the word come then see there's nothing can be complain if there's anything they wants to see you about well fine take them right on into the office like that but don't hold the congregation then you know people get up and say well I tell you let's have a good testimony meeting I don't mean any Critics on that I just mean to tell you the truth I mean to tell you the truth see I found testimony meetings of more uh they they do more harm sometimes than good see they really do now if somebody would have have a red hot testimony in time of a Revival you know you're having Revival on you know a meeting somebody got saved and just wanted to say a word well that's God let him unload his soul if if he wants to he wants to do that see just in time of Revival say I just want to say thank the Lord for what he's done for me he saved me last week and my hearts are burning up with the glory of God thanks be to God sat down amen that's fine go on see that's all right but when he say now come on who's next Who's Next now let's share a word your a word of Tes now if you got a meeting set aside a certain night for that see you're going to tonight next Wednesday night instead of prayer meeting it's going to be a testimony meeting we want everybody to come in it's going to be testimonial meeting and when you come to to the place to give testimony read the word have prayer then say now we have announced this is testimony night so let people testify for that hour or 45 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever it is and then then go ahead like that see what I mean and I think it will help your cond congregation it'll help everything all together if you do it that way now uh I'm getting late so brother brother these are the best of my knowledge I see what's on your heart this is the best of my knowledge the questions that you have asked now from now on you know and if it's ever in your mind come to the tape ask the listen through the tape it's for Deacon Tru or whatever is let the tape be paid let it be paid to the congregation out there they want to hear it all right and that's that is the be of my knowledge to the will of God for this Tabernacle here at eth in Pinn Street and that's the way I'm commission you Brothers to carry this out under the leadership of the holy spirit with all kindness and love showing uh your grace before people that you are Christians and Christian don't mean a baby that can be pushed around anywhere that means a man is full of love but yet just as full of love for God as he is for the congregation see what I mean is there a question the tape's about to run out you're now got somebody waiting for me over what time is it supposed to be there right now right now he's coming over himself I will get all right all right sir now I know we're going out now if there's no no further any word now if not let's dismiss yes brother Colin might face turned off all right well brother I appreciated being here with you tonight and brother Neville and to uh the deacons and trustees and Sunday school superintendent all of you we trust that the Lord will help you now to carry out these orders for the kingdom of God the reason I've said this is because that I think you have grown from children to adults when you was a child you talk like a child and you understood as a child but now you're a man so let's act as adults in the house of God behaving ourselves and honoring our offices and honoring every office every gift that the Lord has given us let's put it in order and honor God with our gifts and our offices let us pray Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight for this Gathering Together of man that's putting office this year to carry out the work of the Lord that's being carried on here in Jeffersonville in this church God may your hand be upon them may you help them and bless them may the congregation and the people understand and know that this is to embed the kingdom of God that we might become man of understanding and know the spirit of God and know what to do granted father dismiss us now with our blessings and may the Holy Spirit watch over us and guide us and protect us and may we be ever found faithful at the post of Duty in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen [Music]
