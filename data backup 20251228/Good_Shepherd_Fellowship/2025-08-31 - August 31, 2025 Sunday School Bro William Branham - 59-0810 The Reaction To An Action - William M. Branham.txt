========================================

believeth on him that sent me as eternal life and shall never come to the judgment but pass from death unto life. Lord, they were yours when you spoke to them. They were yours before the foundation of the world. And tonight the gospel net has drawn them to you. They are yours. Care for them, oh Lord. We place them into thy hands. Tenderly, Lord, be merciful. And here's some of your children here that has iniquity in their hearts or they've done something. They've said something that's wrong. and maybe by hearing my testimony tonight that I did something wrong, had to go make it right, they come too, Lord, let the God that pass by that little whirlwind, let him pass over each heart here tonight, expelling their iniquity, washing them in the blood of the lamb, renewing their faith and their spirit. it into the great fellowship of the Holy Ghost. Granted, Lord, they're yours. They stand penitent making full confession before this audience of people that they've been wrong and they want to be right. And you said, "He that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out." We know that you're here, Lord, and will do it. Now, while we're waiting and they got their heads bowed, I wonder how many in here has not received the Holy Ghost as yet and would like to be remembered in prayer to receive the Holy Ghost. Raise your hand. God bless you. There's an altar, I think, to the right. There's an altar prepared right here. I'm asking these that standing here now, some of you there at the boy with a wheelchair, move right over to this altar right to my right here. We're going to meet you there just in a few minutes. Move right around that way. I'm going to ask you that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you would like to receive the Holy Ghost. Here's the time to start it. You're here on the campgrounds. You're here time to receive it. You know that no one will be in the rapture without the Holy Ghost. That'll be the sleeping virgin that'll not the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years. That's it. Move right out this way, my friends. That's it, Dad. All of you come right along here. Take young fella, push the boy there in the chair, will you? Right over here. Right down through this way. All of you, if you will, come right down through here. Now, just a kneel over here to give a little word of thanks to God for what he's done for you. Come right down this way. Now, you that wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost, would you come up also? Come right over here. Stand up on your feet and say, "I I'm I'm in business, Brother Brandon. I mean business with God. I've got a little word in my heart tonight and a little bit of spirit that tells me that if I mix this promise of God with the spirit that's telling me I can receive the Holy Ghost tonight, I'm coming to receive it. Is there enough spirit in you to tell you that God will do it for you tonight? If there is, raise up your hand. If you believe you've got enough courage in you, there's enough Holy Ghost conviction spirit telling you that tonight you can receive the baptism. If there is, come up here and let's have a word of prayer and go over here so we can lay hands on you and pray. Would you want to come? If you really want it, come now. That's right. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. The Bible said so. God can't fail his words. What are you doing now? You're making preparations. How long have you sought the Holy Ghost? A long time. Long time have you sought the Holy Ghost. And now you sure tonight what happened? Maybe he was down just about ready to give up. But what's happened? I want some of the cooperating ministers if they will go over with these people here to instruct them how to pray and give thanks to God. Some ministers here that knows God. Any of you brothers here that knows God, come over there. Four or five of you go over there. And some of you stand right along in here with these here, we're going to pray for them. How many of you here's gospel ministers in the building? Raise up your hands. Gospel ministers, we're not questioning your denomination. We want you here. Come here. All you ministers, we need you here. Here's the time. All of you Elijah's come here. Here's the people. Let's mix the oil and the meal together. They're here to receive. They're here to get it. Let's come show that we have thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Holy Ghost is for you today? What did Peter say on the day of Pentecost when they said, "Man and brethren, what can we do?" He said, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then you're here. What did they do in the Bible times? laid hands upon them. Now, we're going to pray for these people. All you ministers, stand by and pray. Then, we're going to take them over to the altars. And there, they're going to receive the Holy Ghost. Every one of them. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; There's six nights of this service. Don't you come from your knees till the Holy Ghost has baptized you. Then there'll be a revival break out here. &gt;&gt; Don't really mean business. We come to be in business. Now, we're going to do this. God promised it. The devil ain't going to rob us from it. We're going to stay here till it happens. That's right. Now, let us bow our heads. All you Christians, pray for these not seeking the Holy Ghost. You ministers along the side. Father, these sure are already confessed Christians, but they read in the Bible that just those who had oil in the land went in to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; And they're coming tonight to receive the oil. They seem like a few minutes ago by having the meal already in the barrel there was spirit mixing around in there. &gt;&gt; They come for self-sacrifice to feel the hot burning fires of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll light up the cross of Christ in their heart and will fill them with power and glory and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Granted, Lord, anointed ministers of God are standing by them. We are here, Lord, to pray the prayer of faith. We want to see a great revival break into this community and around here that'll make every church a burning blame. And we've come tonight to you, Lord, our God. We believe that you won't turn us down. May each of these from this little boy, little girl, all the way to the oldest receive the Holy Ghost. And as Christ said in the days gone by, as his servants, we say now, receive ye the Holy Ghost. Breathe upon them, Lord, the spirit of life. May they go now and receive the Holy Ghost. Now, take to the right. Each one of you seeking the Holy Ghost, go right this way. Ministers are going with you to go over there and stay there until the Holy Ghost comes. I want to deal with the rest of congregation just a minute. There'll be no prayers for the sick. Just remember that we're going to get things started right and then we're going to do right. It's going to come back. There's something wrong. We want it right. Amen. Go right this way over there. Ministers, you instructors go with them now. That don't purpose in your heart that you're not going to come off your knees if it takes from now till Saturday night. How long shall I carry until you're in due? How long is until you receive it? How many personal workers is in the building at work? Women or men? Raise your hands. Would like to go with these people. Bless you, Sister Rosella. All right. Would you go with them? Is someone else in here a good personal worker that would like to be standing present when the Holy Ghost fills someone? Would you like to do it? Any of you women, any of you men, you women, go to the women. You men go beside the man. Stand there. Be sincere. drive at the devil. Defeat him. He's a defeated person. Do you believe that? He's just a big bluff. He has no legal rights over us. We are free children born of the spirit of God. We have a right to this God's heritage and we believe it. Is there another in here that's a sinner that never come up and raise up their hand say, "Brother Random, remember me. I didn't even have the nerve to go, but pray for me that God will put such conviction on me that I will come the next time." Pray that God will spare my life. No accidents or nothing tonight. I'll be able to get out here again tomorrow night, raise your hand. Any person that's got iniquity in their heart, but they didn't come up. Raise your hand. Be honest about that. Raise your hand. Say, "Pray for me, Brother Brandham." How many sick and afflicted, raise up your hand, say, "I come. I want to be prayed for. I want to be right." All right. Confess all your wrongs now. You got from now until tomorrow, tomorrow night about this time, God's going to do more healings in here. I believe that he's ever done in this country. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. All right, let us stand now when we sing. I need every hour. Dear God, in the name of Jesus, I pray for these nicks that you'll give unto them, oh Lord, the grace and power and heal ever these. I pray in Jesus name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need God bless you. &gt;&gt; So, how would you [Music] Hey. [Music]
