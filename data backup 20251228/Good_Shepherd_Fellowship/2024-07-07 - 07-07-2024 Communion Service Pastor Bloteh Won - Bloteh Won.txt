take the scripture let's read u a portion of the word is you can stay right there we will we will want to be quick tonight and and uh let's just read Exodus chapter 6 as we promis that we will speak from there tonight like I said uh was reading uh something in found of that in the Jewish Passover this is the scripture that they read when they said for their Passover where the the they do exactly what Moses tells them to do so we read from Exodus chapter 6 verse one praise the Lord then the Lord said unto Moses now shall thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord amen praise the Lord what a comfort he is our God Amen I am the Lord and he appeared unto Abraham and I appeared unto Abraham sorry unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them and I have also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan and the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptian kept in bondage and I have remembered my Covenant praise the Lord amen now this is where I want us to pay our attention tonight wherefore say unto the children of Israel as I'm reading onto you tonight I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians and I will ra you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with an outstretch arm and with great judgment and I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God which bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians let's pray together father we have read your sacred word and we just will ask that Lord father by the inspir a of the holy spirit that you will just come Lord and and edify us tonight we thank you we glorify your holy name in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat just before we go into the communion we're going to read over there in in St John Chapter 13 where Jesus uh after supper the Bible say he he he told uh uh uh a basing to wash the disciples feet but uh uh when the even that have happened that night was was uh given to Paul when it was shown to uh Paul he make us to know that that evening you know Jesus Took bread and he break it and and then he took a cup and uh and he told the disciples that uh it was uh uh the New Testament so like I said this morning it was the reason why that I choose to go back to this is because um I didn't I didn't see this um you know sometimes you get yourself into uh uh a certain subject steuding and then it gives you a line of thought and then you start looking so while I was uh studying during the week and and and actually thinking of this what happened was that after after we had a time of Fellowship out there I left from there I came right back to to the church here because uh I spoke on this subject sometime ago in in uh uh Tennessee when I I was there with Brother Bill Young and the Lord kind of placed that on my heart and uh I spoke on U uh the king's cup barer but then during the week uh uh I I fed uh um the thought in my mind that I should speak on it on Sunday and then so after I came back here uh uh when we left from down there just spend some time here just appreciating the Lord for giving us our time of Fellowship that we had out there and all of that and then I started you know uh looking at some few things that I wanted to study before I go home and then while I was looking into that this whole subject of uh uh the Jewish Passover came open to me and uh I just I just copied some few things here I we write nothing is posted tonight the four cups of Passover known as uh I uh I Kad in Hebrew are a cental part of the Passover celebration and and are drwn by each participant at the Passover the cffs represent the full expression of Deliverance promised by God in Exodus 6 I will bring you out I will deliver you I will redeem you and I will take you to myself next now so uh uh according to the the the history when the Jew Jews having their Passover uh they they have these four cffs down and everybody that is participating they will drink from each of those cup and then and then they will remind themselves of these promises even though the uh uh uh Exodus chapter 6 will be read during the ceremony but then when they come over to partake uh of uh of I mean they are sitting at the table they don't come like we do uh uh they all sitting at a table uh when they are partaking they will go go around and each everybody at the table will partake of the four cups reminding thems of these four promises then when I was looking at them I was saying I was saying to myself how unique is this how unique this is is and knowing their fold you know uh uh uh plac out to us for the number of Deliverance but I just want to go over them uh a little bit and uh and just be able to to see how we can uh apply them to ourself tonight as we as we look at them now so we know that God promised Abraham there in Genesis that he was going to bring his people out with a mighty hand he was going to deliver them and uh uh uh over in Exodus chapter 3 he came down and met Moses and told Moses you know I've heard the crowd of my people that I've come down to deliver them this was something that God was determined to do now that is that is the beautiful thing that kind of capture me in in uh in this Exodus chapter 6 is something that God is determined to do praise the Lord amen it's something that he's determined to do he's determined to bring us out amen he determined to deliver us whichever all of these promises pertain to us is something that God is saying I will bring you out amen it's not that I'm waiting for you to come out he's saying ah I'm going to do it praise the Lord amen and I believe there are uh just like uh uh every period of time that very time of the exit of the children of Israel they had their ples you know no doubt some were planning to get married some were planning to have a baby some were you know were planning to get a uh uh maybe uh uh uh uh another uh learning if if if they were given the opportunity to learn you know and and all the different things that is out there but uh when it was God God's time to be able to bring his promise to pass praise the Lord no matter what they had planned at that time it just it was not important to God what was important to God was what he said in his word amen he was not going to put the exitor on hold until The Graduate he was not going to put the exitor on hold until they do their wedding he was going to do what he promised to do and whatever his children were Desiring to do would come out after that praise the Lord and that's what I want for us to know this year in all of these promise is I will bring you out and I will deliver you now so if you just look at at uh at that first two uh uh promise there of God now uh uh the Jews classify it because all of those four promises they they they compare them to the four cup so the first promise they classify it as the cup of sanctification or they called it the cup of Salvation because God is promising that he's going to bring his people out we have to know all of those things is applied to the stages of Grace the way God deal with the believer in uh under the New Testament but uh we are looking at that in a way to see that uh God promis promised to bring them out of Egypt and the part that is beautiful to mean there he says I will bring you out and I will deliver you and that portion of Deliverance is bringing Egypt out of them praise the Lord because we have to realize that in the book of Corinthian Paul warned us now all of them that came out of Egypt were saved they came out of Egypt but Egypt never came out of them and the ones that Egypt never came out of the they got drown you know they were all part of that Coran Koran and death thing in the wilderness coming against Moses so you see God is now only it like brother brandham says you know that's what exodor is you know is bringing us out but that is not the only thing that God is thinking about just to bring us out he's also thinking to take us in and establish us praise the Lord so you see uh even though it was something many years you just think about the orthodo Jews that are still practicing this this was something that took place many years but yet when they come over to their Passover they remember they try to bring it back to their mind I don't know whether they do just like we the the the New Testament Believers or the Gentile Believers uh uh uh in the way where we apply the word of of God or they are still looking at the promise in the past but it's such a beautiful thing that God promised to bring them out to deliver them and to redeem them and take them to himself praise the Lord so they have the cup of Salvation or sanctification they have the cup of Deliverance they have a cup of redemption and the last cup is the cup of praise so they go through there you know and uh and uh the you know the they Worship the Lord they thank him for bringing him out of Egypt they thank him for delivering them from slavery you know they thank him for redeeming you know like like uh the scripture says that he says I will redeem you with an outstretched arm praise the Lord what a beautiful picture of calary Amen his hands his arms were outstretch on on on the on the pole with those Nails spread out in the heavens praise the Lord and then uh uh the last cup there is the cup of Praise but coming over to the New Testament Church like I said this morning here is Jesus sitting in the midst of uh those uh uh uh Jewish Believers and he sent them to go and set the Passover I believe they said it just like they have done it over the years with the four cups of the Passover but when he come over there to to that Passover he changed the other because all of those four cops was represented in him he was the one that was doing all of the and now he would take one cup and give it to us and says take this this is the blood of my new covenant praise the Lord amen so I mean uh uh uh uh just just by embracing what he's doing you know he bring us through it is almost like Paul says uh them that he called he justified them that he justified he glorified when you look at it in the stages of Grace there have to be a sanctification you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost before glorification but yet the Apostle Paul is looking at it in such a way that just one work of Grace in our life is enough for God to carry us through true amen if he call us if he's the one that have called us and have made us to respond to his call that work of grace is enough to carry us through the entire one praise the Lord because God do not start anything that he do not finish are we together now so uh uh uh talking about uh that uh full cup that I kind of briefly shared this morning you know that that just came uh uh uh out during our time of study and it was it was very very amazing you know when I when I read through it because it stood out in a way that I've not seen it I've really never come across that information before so it really you know it was really a blessing to me when we look at it so uh uh we just want to encourage ourself tonight you know we want to encourage ourself tonight as we have been taught we have to remind God of his promise that was another thing that I saw in the book of neias if you read the book of neemias there was seven times neias asked the Lord to remember he said oh Lord remember that was another beautiful thing that I saw he said remember me for all that I've done for your people and seven times in the book of neemias if you read through it you you find that now Soh we can take this and apply it to ourself as we as we go through the the service tonight go through the the communion tonight as we approach the word you know remind God he promis to bring us out no matter what we are we are dealing with been battling with he promised to Deliver Us Praise the Lord and he says I will I will ra you out which mean I'm going to I'm going to take it out of you I'm going to rip you up I'm going to snat you when I was looking at the word that's what it means I'm going to snat you from this thing and he has the power to do it praise the Lord yeah no matter what what we you see it's it's a work of redemption it's God's work God would not uh uh uh uh give us his work to do how how we uh uh uh fall in humans born in sin shap in iniquity how can we help ourself if God don't come on the scene to help us we have to take his word serious because God mean what he says and he says what he means I will bring you out I will deliver you I will redeem you and I will take you to myself praise the Lord we can apply that in uh in uh uh everything that we are dealing with that he's the one that make the promise and he's more than able to be able to see us through praise the Lord and uh also uh before we go into uh the the second part of the service uh we had we we had a situation that I spoke to you about in church and we thought that we will have addressed that today but uh uh we've been we've been kind of for working uh with the family that is uh that is going through that and uh uh our brother wrote the church and sent us a letter of apology so uh we will not go through with that and uh but I I I told them that uh we would had read a letter of apology to the church until uh they return back so uh they they way this weekend and uh trying to to uh go through uh you know some form of healing and and Reconciliation uh uh for themselves so we we want to thank the Lord uh you know and and I would say thank you for your prayers if you you you had them in your prayers thank you for praying for them and every every other effort that was made uh uh because you see the thing about it there is there like I said over and over if uh Redemption is not driving you to do the thing that you are doing then you miss God's plan praise the Lord amen God's plan is not for us to build a big church it's not for us to get a mega church it's a plan of Redemption Redemption should be the one that is driving us praise the Lord and that's the reason why the Bible says if there is one that is fallen and we restore that one back you know that's what we are asked to do okay that's what we are asked to do so uh we will we will address that properly but I wanted to bring that to you to you tonight since we trying to use this as uh as a time of of prayer meeting and we will we will we will go to the Lord in prayer now just before we we go into the communion service and I said there to say that I we want for us to remember uh brother Stephen and and sister Kish uh uh let's let's remember them and remember their family remember their children and uh we believe that is the enemy that that was trying to to destroy their lives and destroy their home with everything that was going on so we we just want to bring them before the Lord tonight and uh uh and you see when when we deal with this thing it's it's very easy for everybody to uh uh uh you know uh uh you know have have our opinion and thoughts about it but you see as a church as a family what hurt one person hurts everybody and that's the reason why we Tak the time to be able to be with these things work with faith the best way we can be able to to work with faith you you know and uh there have never been a time where I I see the eneme and for the the past past few years two years or so we we just been going through one thing or another but he's the one that made the promise he said he will bring us out amen he's the one that make the promise he said he will deliver us he said he will redeem us and he will take us to himself so let's buy our house tonight we want to remember them and uh we also want to pray for every unspoken prayer request we want to pray for every family that that is identified with this assembly uh I just uh the deacons just told me uh a family that moved from uh uh Norway uh came to to visit with us uh today and uh uh uh they want to uh uh continue coming here to church and all of there we just want to place them in the hands of the Lord you know and uh we just we just want to pray pray for every every brother sister that we cross your mind and uh we want to also pray for our young people the the you know uh some of our young boys that have been struggling uh and and it's it's so so so kind of for strking you know uh uh brother Dan and brother Ben boys uh you know uh we want to we want to commit them to the hands of the Lord God says I will I will I will bring them out you know I will deliver them he's able to do it you know we must remind God of his promise he's more than able to do it you see that's that's what uh communion means to us it's something that has to do with the entire body so we want to once again go back to the Lord in prayer and uh we want to take these knees to the Lord uh like I said remember these different families if there are families that come to your mind that you want to remember tonight we are without bringing our needs now is is the time that
