========================================

[Music] [Music] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice became aware of our father calling us and recognized that we are the sons of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i am returning to thee a son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son in fact a lot of true christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen you know that the eagle is a type of the true believer well a farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest and he placed it under a hen in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all but one day from way up in the air the mother eagle that had laid the egg spied that little eagle on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try again that mother screamed for him to arise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he'd try beating his wings he hurled himself into the air and answering the cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies you see he always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place and once a true son of god hears the cry of the spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in christ jesus now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism with the holy ghost galatians 4 4-7 but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ there it is jesus christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as sons he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and hear this and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father upon whom did the spirit fall at pentecost sons at corinth upon sons while they heard the word what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward god what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believed the doctrine of the oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in that godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the holy spirit coming in to give us power if that were true why are we dishonoring the father by not giving him a part in our complete salvation for if salvation is of the lord and there are three lords then he father must have something to do too but surely it can be seen that jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is god and it is he and he alone who is coming into the believer john 14 16 says that the father will send another comforter but verse 17 says that he jesus dwelleth with them and should be in them later in verse 18 he says he will come to them in verse 23 in speaking to the disciples he said we father and son will come unto him thus it is the father son and holy ghost all coming in at the one time for it is one person comprising the godhead that advent took place at pentecost there aren't two comings of the spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in jesus for remission of sin but never go on to receive the spirit before i close this subject i know there is a question in your minds you will want to know if i believe in the doctrine of pre-existence i don't believe in that mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed jacob have i loved but esau have i hated romans 9 13 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and god bought back jacob because jacob alone was seed jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of god if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you again note jesus was the royal seed he lived in a human body when the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to jordan and was there baptized in water upon obeying the word the holy spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved son hear ye him the voice did not say this has become my son jesus was the son the holy ghost positioned him as that son before them all then having been filled thus and the same pattern holds at pentecost and ever after he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of god and from god for that day now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives let me show you most clearly the seven ages as set forth in revelation chapters two and three taken the whole span of the fullness of the gentiles for the whole time in which god is dealing with the gentiles unto salvation in every single age bar none it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message to each age unto the messenger of ephesus smyrna pergamus thyatira sardis philadelphia laodicea right these things saith he etc etc he that hath an ear let him singular hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches notice here that jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for god by revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private revelation nor is a group getting their collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god now think it not strange that this is the case for paul set this pattern under the hand of god paul alone had the full revelation for his day as evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that paul was the prophet messenger to the gentiles for that day and also note by actual illustration in the word that when paul desired to go to asia god forbade him for the sheep his children were in macedonia and they the macedonians would hear what the spirit had to say through paul while the people in asia would not in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember paul warned the people to say only what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only they add here or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god paul warned them to say what he said even as peter did likewise he warned them that even he paul could not change one word of what he had given by revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of god by way of his messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches i hope you are beginning to see it now perhaps you can understand now why i don't hold with the fundamentalists and the pentecostals i have to hold to the word the way the lord revealed it now i did not cover it all that would take a separate book but by the help of the lord we will get many sermons and tapes and messages on all of these points to help you to understand and dovetail all scripture he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches of each age in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you are a christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word from the first book in the bible genesis to the last book revelation there is only one reason for god's displeasure leaving the word and there is only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word in the ephesian age and in this age and in every age we contemplate we will see that this is true and in the last age which is our age we will find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the holy ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god this is my earnest prayer for all of us may we hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today chapter 5 the pergament church age revelation 2 12-17 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it pergamus pergamum ancient name was situated in missia in a district watered by three rivers by one of which it communicated to the sea it was described as the most illustrious city in asia it was a city of culture with a library second only to that in alexandria yet it was a city of great sin given over to licentious rites of worship of escuelapius whom they worshipped in the form of a living serpent which was housed and fed in the temple in this beautiful city of irrigated groves public walks and parks lived a small group of dedicated believers who were not fooled by the veneer of beauty and abhorred the satanic worship that filled the place the age the pergamian age lasted about 300 years from 312 to 606 a.d the messenger using our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose ministry most closely approximates that of the first messenger paul we unhesitatingly declare the pergamian messenger to be martin martin was born in 315 in hungary however his life work was in france where he labored in and around tour as a bishop he died in 399. this great saint was the uncle of another wonderful christian saint patrick of ireland martin was converted to christ while he was following a career as a professional soldier it was while he was still engaged in this occupation that a most remarkable miracle occurred it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in the streets of the town where martin was posted the winter cold was more than he could bear for he was poorly clad no one paid any attention to his needs until martin came by seeing this poor man's plight but not having an extra garment he took off his outer cloak cut it in two with his sword and wrapped the cloth around the freezing man he attended him the best he could and went on his way that night the lord jesus appeared unto him in a vision there he stood like a beggar wrapped in a half of martin's garment he spoke to him and said martin though he is only a catechumen has clothed me with this garment from that time on martin sought to serve the lord with all his heart his life became a series of miracles manifesting the power of god after having left the army and having become a leader in the church he took a very militant stand against idolatry he cut down the groves broke up the images and pulled down the altars when confronted by the pagans for his deeds he challenged them in much the same manner that elijah did the prophets of baal he offered to be tied to a tree on its underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless god intervened and turned the tree around while it fell the wily heathen tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill assured that the natural pull of gravity would cause the tree to so fall as to crush him just as the tree began to fall god swung it around and uphill contrary to all natural laws the fleeing heathen were crushed as the tree fell on several of them historians acknowledge that on at least three occasions he raised the dead by faith in jesus name in one instance he prayed for a dead baby like elisha he stretched himself upon the babe and prayed it came back to life and health on another occasion he was called to help deliver a brother who was being carried away to his death in a time of great persecution by the time he arrived the poor man was already dead they had hanged him upon a tree his body was lifeless and his eyes protruded from the sockets but martin took him down and when he had prayed the man was restored to life and to his rejoicing family martin never did fear the enemy regardless of who it was thus he went to personally face a wicked emperor who was responsible for the death of many spirit-filled saints the emperor would not grant an audience so martin went to see a friend of the emperor juan damasus a cruel bishop of rome but the bishop being a nominal christian of the false vine would not intercede martin went back to the palace but by now the gates had been locked and they would not allow him to enter he laid down on his face before the lord and prayed that he be able to get into the palace he heard a voice bidding him arise when he did so he saw the gates open of their own accord he walked into the court but the arrogant ruler would not turn his head and speak to him martin again prayed suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the unhappy emperor vacated speedily surely the lord humbles the proud and exalts the lowly such was his order in serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused the enemies of truth hired assassins to kill martin they came by stealth to his home and as they were about to kill him he stood erect and bared his throat to the sword as they leaped forward the power of god suddenly hurled them back across the room so overcome were they in that holy and fearful atmosphere that they crawled upon their hands and knees and begged forgiveness for the attempt upon his life too often when men are signally used of the lord they become lifted up with pride but not so with martin he ever remained a humble servant of god one night as he was preparing himself to enter the pulpit a beggar came to his study and asked for some clothing martin referred the beggar to his head deacon the haughty deacon commanded him to leave thereupon he went back to see martin martin arose and gave the beggar his own fine robe and bad the deacon bring him another robe which was of lesser quality that night as martin preached the word the flock of god saw a soft white glow of light around his person surely this was a great man a true messenger to that age never desirous of ought but to please god he lived a most consecrated life never could he be induced to preach until he had first prayed and was in such spiritual frame as to know and deliver the full counsel of god by the holy ghost sent down from heaven often he would keep the people waiting while he prayed for full assurance just to know about martin and his mighty ministry might make one thing that the persecution of the saints had abated not so they were still being destroyed by the devil through the instrumentality of the wicked they were burned at the stake they were nailed to logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose upon them so that the dogs would tear away the flesh and bowels leaving the victims to die in terrible torture babes were ripped from expectant mothers and thrown to the hogs women's breasts were cut away and they were forced to stand erect while each heartthrob poured out the blood until they crumpled in death and the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely the work of the heathen but many times it was caused by so-called christians who felt that they did god a favor in exterminating these loyal soldiers of the cross who stood for the word and obedience to the holy spirit john 16 2 they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he do with god's service matthew 24 9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit martin was truly vindicated as the messenger to that age but not only was he gifted by a great ministry he himself was forever true to the word of god he fought organization he withstood sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of christian victory a biographer wrote of him on this wise no one ever saw him angry or disturbed or grieving or laughing he was always one and the same and seemed something beyond mortal wearing on his countenance a sort of celestial joy never was anything on his lips but christ never anything in his heart but piety peace and pity often did he weep for the sins even of those his detractors who when he was quiet and absent attacked him with viperous lips and poisoned tongues many hated him for virtues they themselves did not possess and could not imitate and alas his bitterest assailants were bishops the salutation revelation 2 12 be these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with the two edges the message to the third church age is about to come forth the third scene of this unfolding drama of christ in the midst of his church is about to be revealed with trumpet-like voice the spirit presents the matchless one he which hath the sharp sword with the two edges how vastly different is this presentation from the time when pilate introduced the lamb of god clothed in mocking robes of purple smitten and thorne crowned saying behold your king now regal robed and crowned with glory stands the risen lord christ the power of god in these words he which hath the sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of godhead in the ephesian age you will recall he was set forth as the unchanging god in the smirnion age we saw him as the one true god and beside him there was no other now in this pergamon age there is a further revelation of his godhead set forth by his association with the sharp two-edged sword which is the word of god hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart ephesians 6 17 and take the sword of the spirit which is the word of god revelation 19 13 and 15 a and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and out of his mouth go with a sharp two-edged sword john 1 1-3 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same word was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made which was made first john 5 7 there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word in his name in john 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful john says the concept of god was expressed in jesus and paul says the very same thing in hebrews 1 1-3 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets half in these last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high god became expressed in the person of jesus christ jesus was the express image of god again in john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the very substance of god was made flesh and dwelt among us the great spirit god unto which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold was now tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of god to men john 1 18 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him god who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or pillar of fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this god whose heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets now became emmanuel god with us declaring himself the word declare is taken from the greek root which we often interpret as exegesis which means to thoroughly explain and make clear that is what the living word jesus did he brought god to us for he was god he revealed god to us with such perfect clarity that john could say about him in first john 1 1-3 that which was from the beginning which we have heard logos means speech which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ when god was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh he that hath seen me have seen the father now back in hebrews one one through three we made note that jesus was the express image of god he was god expressing himself in man to man but there is something else to note in these verses especially verses 1 and 2. god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son i want you to notice here in the margin of your bible you will see a correction the word by is not a correct translation it should be in not by it then reads correctly god spake in times past unto the fathers in the prophets by means of the word first samuel 3 21 be for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly the spirit and the word are one jesus revealed the father the word revealed the father jesus was the living word praise god today he is still that living word when jesus was upon the earth he said [Music] you
