seated for a while uh this is my second time of being here among you the first time was about I think seven months ago at the passing away of brother J B I think that was November 24th or 25th and uh here I am again on uh May 22nd and I'm very glad and happy to be among you brother pastor called me the other time to come and share the word with you so in fact he has been planning that for a long time and I believe this is the time that God has made for us to be here and share the word together I live in Connecticut Bridgeport in Connecticut go to New York sometime in Bridgeport and very happy to be among you tonight and I met one brother who came to the wedding what he said the brother maybe he'll be out he's outside and I'm really excited to be here so without wasting time let's stand and our Bibles through the book of second Peter my name is brother Paul uh second Peter let's read from verse one second Peter chapter 1 we read from verse one to the 10th verse second Peter chapter one reading from verse one I think uh we all familiar with this scripture but brother use this portion of the scripture and preach the stature of a perfect man and tonight we want to speak on building a spiritual house for the Living God building a spiritual house for the Living God so let's go to Second Peter read from chapter one Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus says our Lord according as the divine power had given us all things that pertain unto life and life you know is existence so all that we need for our existence both spiritual and physical God has provided it and then he continued to say um that is uh verse three and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and power whereby are giv unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through L for us to be partakers of that divine nature it beholds her to do what to escape the corruption that is in this world through last and verse five and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound the May make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack these things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore there are father Brethren give all diligence to make your calling and your election show for if you do these things you shall never fall may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray oh God that you come and breath into us Lord speak yourself you know the need of your people this evening and come and speak in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated as you are seting let's go to the book of Acts Acts chapter 7 we read verse 44 Acts chapter 7 Acts chapter 7 we read from I believe verse 44 as 7even he says this our fathers had a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness that he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God draw out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon buil him a house how the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayeth the prophets Heaven is my my throne and Earth is my full stool which house will he build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest may the Lord add a blessing to his word amen amen so this evening as I said we want to speak on building a spiritual house for the Living God now we see that when we look around today we see many many mansions being built but little attention is given to the the spiritual house and you see that today people are building mansions but uh is a reflection of the age that's right but there is one building that people are neglecting now we recall that we not come on Earth by ourselves is the almighty God that brought us on Earth for a purpose right and that purpose is that he will come and dwell in US amen and that is his purpose of creating men now we recall in Genesis 1:26 God creating a spirit man and after creating that Spirit man he formed a body a physical body and then he placed that Spirit man in that body now you see when you look at Adam in the Garden of Eden he was motivated by that Spirit man that dwell in him now Adam didn't didn't do anything unless being motivated by that Spirit man that was in him now we will recall that after God creating everything he brought it to Adam Adam it is now your turn I have created everything now it is your turn to give names to these things that have cre created amen and as he was giving the names to the various things God was there saying Amen to it why because Adam had the mind of God Amen it was God in him giving names to those things Lord now we can see that after the fall that Spirit man that was in Adam took flight he left Adam so Adam was left now to shift by himself as a prophet said so we see that after the fall God has been trying to bring man back to him all that God was doing is to restore man back that he himself will come back and dwell in man that the purpose for which he created men will be accomplished that was the purpose of God now we see that after the fall God started building something we see Prophet after Prophet came but we'll see that at the end of the seven Church AG in the Old Testament the fullness of God in the form of Jesus came on the scene now we see that after Jesus was crucified was buried and resurrected he promised the people that uh They will receive a power amen from on high what was it it was God coming back again Amen to dwell in man amen in order to fulfill his own plan plan and will right amen so you see that from the very first age God started something now we can see that throughout the ages Messengers after Messengers came and at the end of this age which is the seventh age God sent a prophet again now to do what to bring a total restoration and we see out again that the fullness of God came again and that is why Revelation 10 came it say in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels that's right all the Myster of God will be fulfilled amen as he had declared to his servant the prophets now we see that from the very first age God started building a church do you agree with me now you see that in building a natural house you need a contractor now when this church was being built you needed a contractor you see and that contractor had to employ the services of other men like electrician a carpenter and mes all sort of things so God when he started building this church he had seven contractors and Paul was the first contractor and after that came other contractors and in this last age he brought a contractor that will finish the work prise the Lord amen I hope you following me now brother brother PR preached the message the stature of a perfect man now before he preached that message he preached a message the key in that message he was emphasizing on something and he said in that message that uh faith is very important he said faith is the key that open the scriptures yes sir now this Tabernacle has a key yes anybody who comes first here he has to use the key to open the door but why do you have to close the door because you have some valuable things in this place you don't want anything to breaking and steal the things that's right not spiritually speaking we have a key right and that key opens the scriptures and Christ is the door now inside Christ we have many valuable things that's right things that to life amen and we need that key which is Faith which is revelation and without a revelation you cannot enter into Christ right glory and that is why the prophet kept on doing what emphasizing on Revelation yes when you go to pray ask God for Revelation that's right and Revelation is the key that an open the door that's right for you to enter in think about it is very very important the prophet of God says he says it says this through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the div divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God Amen Jesus said at that day you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me now I'll not dwell so much on that now the prophet of God when he was preaching uh the seven Church age he drill the pyramid and placed every messenger in it now when he was preaching the last age the angel of the Lord came down and Dre the same thing that the prophet Dre vindicating that the message that he was preaching was the truth now you see that from the very bottom of the Statue of a perfect man was faith right and Faith was the foundation for the Christian church and for every believer that starts faith is the foundation yes that's right and we will see that uh faith comes by what hearing by the hearing you see and the prophet of God says without a new birth there is no faith it is the new birth that brings the faith and that faith is the Revelation you see so every Christian as we start we start by faith and Faith come by hearing the word of God am now the Apostle Peter was saying the this he said Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtain like Precious faith in other words to them that have been born again you see and then he continued to say uh they have obtained a life precious with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowled know of God and of Jesus according as his divine power are given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue yes now uh he said he has called it through what not by our own effort but by his divine power he has called us and it is that divine power that works in every believer it is that divine power that brings what transformation to the believer amen now we were in the world we were born in sin shap in iniquity but we needed something yes we needed God divine power and when you f the go for and you responded to it it was God divine power calling you to himself Hallelujah because before the foundation of the world he saw you and he predestinated you to life now when that day you heard a message it was God talking to you it was God calling you you did come by your own will but it was God God doing something in your life amen then he continues to say he said verse three according to his divine power had given unto you all things that pertain to your existence life means existence and godliness and through the knowledge of him that has called you to glory and and power now when God calls you and fills you with the Holy Ghost there is a glory around you that's right there is power in you that is virtue when Jesus came on the earth and as he went Healing The Sick sometime they say virtue came out of him true amen you see and in a in a certain message he said as he went along people were drawing God out of him and you sitting here this evening if you are filled with the Holy Ghost God is in you am and that is why we can pray for people they are healed Hallelujah why they are drawing some power out of you they are drawing God out of you amen Jesus and when your pastor son stands here he's a messenger to this to this church and as the word he preaches the word Virtue follows the word and those who come your burden amen as the word comes forth amen that burden is taken away amen what was it is God in operation amen hallelujah verse four whereby are giv unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through last now we see that today there is a lot of corruption in the world today and God wants us to do what to escape that corruption you cannot Escape it by your own power yes there must be something in you right Amen to overcome the corruption and that is why when you hear the word there is a buildup word upon word upon word upon word as you receive the word there is a build up of power in youen which will overcome the world that will overcome the corrupt that is in the world Amen and you must count yourself I mean blessed to be here this evening there are many in the world this evening who have not got this opportunity but as you have got this opportunity you need to take it seriously because God has been mindful of you to be able to send this message to you amen than you Jesus thank you and in verse five he says beside this give all diligence give all diligence and I was I went to the dictionary to look at the meaning of diligence I mean those who are English speak speaking people they know exactly what diligence means now the dictionary tells me uh this he said diligence is To Be steady is to be Earnest devoted and then energetic now when somebody is diligent he's steady he's Earnest and he has that sense of devotion yes you see yeah that is being diligent now what about uh uh to be uh Earnest to be Earnest is to show what sincere and intense conviction when you Earnest in doing something you have a conviction a strong conviction yes that this thing that I'm doing I'm going to succeed amen this thing that I'm doing is the right way this thing that I'm doing is the true thing that is Being Earnest and when you are diligent in doing something you are devoted to it yes you are stable you are balanced amen amen you don't go to one side of the other side you are balanced that is to be stable amen now if you see a ship on the ocean and as it's well loaded it is balanced now if he goes to this side too much it's going to sink but you see it is steady on the ocean it is balanced and it can go straight to its destination and that is what the prophet of God said we must be balanced in the scripture amen we don't link too much to legalistic or uh the other side the middle of the way is the road amen so as Christian Believers we need to be diligent we need to be stable we need to be convicted amen of what we are doing and know when you are you have a conviction doing something amen you are very particular about things look take for instance the the Muslim they have uh they believe that uh if you kill somebody uh you you go straight to heaven but that is a deception of the devil you see there's so much believe that there's so much convicted about that but it is a deception yeah right you see but a Christian conviction is through the word of God Amen amen it's not through the mind of somebody it's not through a certain Creed Creed but when you really convicted of the word you have a revelation and that Revelation convict you am that this is the truth yes there is no other truth amen and we see that the message of the hour God has proven that this is the truth and all I receive this message and are convicted of it amen you see the way they live is different from the other churches God has called us to that and he said uh add to your faith virtue so you see that when God Peter was talking about this thing going back to verse one again that Simon Peter servant of an apostle of Jesus Christ Christ to them that have obtained what like Precious faith and in verse five he saying that what and beside this giving all diligence besides what because he has already receive the faith he has already been born again and he's telling that what add to your faith you see so the new birth brings the faith in the message the statue of a perfect man the prophets of God was saying this it says the new birth bring Faith now he says this there was a prophecy that was fulfilled when he spoke about uh the gly be he said last evening some friends come in they had heard that Vision told about the Caribou that had 42 in on and a silver G steep grizly bear I don't know how many people that is SC at the house wants to see that I said yes is the tape the tape measure get on the horn and he heard it before it happened see why When God says anything is God to happen that is the reason is based then he continued to say this now here is the Plan of Salvation and then if his vision happened perfectly exactly the way they say they do and this church here knows that is right then what about his word see there is more sure than the vision if the vision didn't speak with the word then the vision is wrong but is the word first because the word is God see so he's omnipotent he spoke that here and made it come to pass in Canada amen see he's omnipotent now listen carefully now first you must be born again and then when you are born again you have faith you believe the word until you are born again you will argue against it if you are just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you will never be able to agree upon the word of God you will never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces Faith all right then after you get Faith this right here talking about the faith at the bottom the statue of a perfect man faith f a i t h Faith then you are just in a position of growing prise the Lord faith when you get it then you are just in a position of what growing that's right now we see in the natural every child that is born has to grow do you agree with me and so spiritually when you are born again you got to grow and the first thing when you are born again is what you receive the faith that is the Revelation that comes and the prophet of God says what you are just in a position of growth now when a child is born and he's fed well that child is going to De develop well and brother Bram in a message he preached in 1962 after preaching the spoken word is the Original Seed he preached about the end time seat sign in Georgia and then he was making a statement that uh a an infant church was born and when that infant church was born it has to grow that's right that was prior to the what the revelation of the seals now when that infant church is born it has to be fed fed with what with the word of God that's right and that is why the seal have to be open for this infant CH that was born to be fed on the word that came out because the prophet of God came to do what to gather the loose end you see and the revelation of the seals brought the true way back into manifestation so that chair that was infant CH that was born needed to be fed that's right Amen on the opening of the for it to be able to get what all the new spiritual nutrients for it to grow into the stature of a perfect man now the prophet continued to say this he said now a lot of people go up to the Altar and pray and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification come upon upon them and things then you have a great time get up to the altar shouting you go back say bless God I got it no you just started to a place where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you done is just lay the foundation you see you just lay the foundation now the foundation that you laid you got to build upon it and it doesn't take just one day now you have the foundation which is Faith and on that Faith you have to lay stone upon Stone amen Revelation upon Revelation and as you are laying upon it many things come against it trials Temptations they come here and there God is testing the building that you are putting up is just like when the children of Israel went to captivity and some of they have to come back to build the temple to restore and as they were building there were people that were coming against that's right but these people they had a sword in their hand and then with the other material putting up the building and there were some coming to discourage them there were some coming wanting to destroy but they have to fight as they were building the Temple and so it is for every Christian every individual when you are born again said what all the armors of Hell attend against you yeah right but what you need to do is to St with the word of God prise lord we see the same thing going on today and as you grow they will come against you now the target is not this flesh their target is the inner man that is in you right that's right they wouldn't want the inner man to grow that's right but the more you grow go through this those things the more you become firm and steady and the prophet of God put it this way giving the example of a tree growing Sometimes some storm will come and the storm comes and Shakes the tree what does he do it becomes more firmed and the room get deeper and deeper and the more trials that you have the that inner man in you don't worry stand firm you see and that is why God has to send trials Temptations but there is something that is in you amen there is an anchor that is in you as you just s your anchor will hold and those trial that come they just want to make sure that what you are believing is the truth because those who went ahead of us they face the same situation the Paul the peters and others they didn't have it easy and that is why they if you read Rew Hebrews 11 they were recounting the life of those men amen Joshua Caleb David they didn't have it easy and you will not have it this that easy because the one who made a promise say he will never forsake you yes nor leave you I will be with you even in you amen until the consumation of the ages though you might look very few but God is not in big numbers you see so what I just want to do this evening is to encourage you don't be discouraged God who made a promise he said I'll be with you amen I'll not forsake you amen discourage me will come but look at the life of the Apostle Paul when he met the pillar of fire he had to face a lot of things somewhere he he went to a place the brother had Vision spoke in Tong said this brother the person whom it belongs to this this and that will happen to him but the apostle so Paul was really convicted God met him and spoke to him you have been chosen to take this gospel to the Gentiles and God told him the things that he was going to go through and as he was going those things those things strengthen him they strengthen his faith I know whom I have believed that's right praise the Lord even if I go through all these things the one who call me is more than able to protect praise the Lord thank you Jesus I said now you are going to build a house and you pour the foundation say boy I got her see you you got a foundation to build your house on and you got to build a house now there is there is where the thing comes in this morning we are going to talk about now all right a house this Foundation is first what is the foundation of the Christianity faith in the word of God Amen that is your foundation that's right then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add this to the foundation now when you are building a house what is your motive for building a house is to dwell in the house you see so the house that God is building he wants to dwell in that house you see on their Journey from Egypt going to the promised land God showed a vision to Moses of a tabernacle of a temple and he was telling Moses that what he should build it exactly as he saw in the vision because what he saw in the vision was the model and he has to build it according to the model that he he saw and the prophet of God when he came he show us the model the type of go house that God is building now in the physical you see that when somebody is building a house he has diverse materials that go into the building of the house and then we have TR men that do various things on the building Warehouse the Mas SC the Carpenters SC the electrician come the painters they come and they use different materials but that spiritual H that we are building the material is the word of God that's right and you must use the proper materials amen at the proper time amen it's very important you see that the messengers that came they had different skills Paul was a messenger he led the foundation he was the master builder and he said the foundation that I have laid anybody that comes and build upon it he must be very careful and the material that you use in building the house but the prophet of God in this last age those that the material is the word of God you cannot build this spiritual house out of the material that God himself has provided amen amen if you don't use the appropriate materials if you are really child of God he will come he tell you no you have to break it down you know there was a brother who had a dream one time contractor that he was building a house the owner came and said no this is not the plan that I gave you and they had to break it down and start it again so the house that we are building that spiritual house we must follow the instructions from the prophet out of that you know build you build a house a house that is not of the plan of God for God to be for for the house to be able to be approved of God you must follow the model you must follow the plan other than that you finish building and the one that you are building it for will say no this is not the type of house that I need and you are you have to break it down and start again now you'll see that Ezekiel Saw a vision and the vision that Ezekiel Saw about God giving whatness a new heart and a new spirit and his own spirit in it it talks about the same thing because he said I'll come and take what the Stony heart that's right out of you and give you a heart of flesh amen and I will put a new spirit give you a new spirit and after giving you a new spirit I'll put my own spirit in it now sometimes people go through the process of sanctification as the prophet was saying they will go to the Altar and pray I have it but said you haven't got it yet now when you are Sanctified they think they have it all but they haven't got it because that state of sanctification is just a process preparing you for the spirit of God to come and dwell in that new spirit amen now that new spirit God is giving it to you to be able to get along with your neighbor to be able to get along with God then when all is set then he himself will come and dwell in it and when he come to dwell in it then he will do his own will the purpose for which he has brought you on Earth because we are all we've all been brought here for a purpose and that building that you God is building you occupy the position this sister occupies a position this brother occupies a position and the position that you occupy in the body shows the type of person you are because the position I occupy it may be different from that of brother brother Wong and God process according to our position now when brother Bram came on Earth he occupied a unique position and in the message experience he preached 1947 he was in Phoenix preaching he prayed and after that a brother came and when the brother came he spoke some words he said he has been in a Ministry for about 35 years but he has never seen a man as humble as brother Bram and he said this man the the trial that he go through the way Satan comes against him is more than against any other preacher because he was the messenger of the age he was the pastor of the age and as the messenger of the age all hell will turn against him because he was carrying against gift and when you are carrying a gift of God Satan comes against you that's right and the gift that brother Bram was carrying was a unique type of gift and Satan was against him why because that gift was to bring Deliverance to the children of God now your pastor here you don't know what he goes through brother Abram was talking about brother Neville he said I have a little bit Insight of what brother Neville goes through because he has that gift of discernment brother Neville goes through things yes he never speaks of them and the prophet through discernment he knows what he goes through and if the prophet of God has to go through those things what about you and I because we are building a spiritual house for the Living God to come and dwell in now today the battle today is a battle of possession possession of what of our souls God want to dwell in our souls and Satan is also fighting for that but as predestinated children of God no matter what Satan does we overcome am am am we will Triumph amen amen but you must know who you are amen and when you know who you are he gives you confidence he gives you Faith to be able to persevere Paul he knew who he was he knew that he was Call of God and all that he went through he knew that the God who has called him will fight for him amen will see him through as a little group here don't fret amen stay with the word of Goden and one important thing is this stay with your pastor if he has led you thus far trust God that he will lead you through amen and today there are many things going on you see people Living Church no we are going to do this we are going to stay with the tapes or listen to tapes but the tape that they are listening said what they must have a church that they call home they must have a church where they support with their presence their offering and they are tight that is what the tape says stay with your pastor and together build that spiritual house with with him and if you do that you stay with the instruction of the Prophet you see this little church little group here in uh Minneapolis will be the lighthous yes of Minneapolis Amen brother Bram in the message a guide was saying this he said don't forget now always remember this that these are the things that build the servant of Christ see Faith first then virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the the building of God until these things are operating by the spirit remember faith is the first one that is the new birth then you are only in position of growth then when you have the faith then you cannot act upon it a child who is not born how can he grow he cannot but first the condition of growth is what new a birth that's right if you are not born how can you grow you see so when you are born again you are only in the position of growth now then you'll be able to add to that and the prophet of God is saying faith is the first thing he said you should remember that see Faith first then virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building of God until these things are operating by the spirit no matter what you do see those are the things that he that builds the body of Christ see those things now don't forget that that is here is first faith is your faith virtue knowledge and so forth is to be added to it until the complete stature of Christ is made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body these things must be therefore Jesus said by their fruits they are known see fruits you could not bear fruit without these things to Bear to Bear it in you and then when all this takes the place of we and ungodliness and so forth then all unbelief is cast out then all the things of the world is pass away then there is nothing but a new creature in Christ and then Ephesians 4:30 says gri not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption sealed unto the kingdom of God now don't forget keep that in mind now take these things first then Sealing is the Holy Spirit the cup that seals us onto the body that's right and again I want to say don't forget the new birth Faith first is the foundation then you can build on it and building upon it doesn't take a day for some it can take many years is according to the calling you see we are called differently we are called to to occupy different position in the building do you get what I'm saying because the more the trial shows the kind of calling that God has called you what one go through you might not go through what I go through you might not go through some go through deep trials some through the flood some through fire but all of us through the blood that's right praise the Lord it's according to our positions now if you take a building that is being put up sometimes the Architects they have to take the sample of the soil send it to the laboratory study it what kind of materials are in there and when they are able to find that they'll know know the sort of foundation to put up there you see now when there there is a rock in that place they need a sort of concrete that will have to go in there now you see some building you see that it will take 6 months for them to build the foundation some might take about two months it depends on the quality of the soil that is there you remember the prophet of go preached the message uh I forgot the title where they had to put a bridge in Australia and Engineers came from different places some said no I cannot build it but the one that came from UK he went there and to the some post under the river bed and he came no I can build this brid and he went on and built the bridge and when they buil the bridge was built there was a railway line on it yeah and the engineer had to walk on a on a bridge with a railway way following it and when they saw that everything was strong what was it the mayor of the city have to come to inaugurate the bridge and the building that you are building when it is complete the owner of the house will come and test it you if it is well built then you commment this is my son in whom I'm well placed to dwell in then you'll be adopted into the family as he did the Lord Jesus Christ when he took Peter James and John to the mount that day and the voice came this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in why he came to do the will of God he never failed anything that the father asked him to do because he said I do nothing until I see my father do it and every child of God his desire is to do the will of God his desire is to build a spiritual house for the Living God to come and dwell in what stage are you in your building today are you using the certified materials which is the word of God because the word has been certified the Holy Ghost has satified the word and if you building that building then must use the certified word he has proven that his word will never fail and that is the material that we are using today to build the living house for the Living God I'll stop here God bless [Applause] you bless Beau Wednesday night praise the Lord we'll have more of that on on Sunday praise the Lord and been poor for a very long time let me a few things from you as I just U encourage you from what our brother was speaking tonight you know David said something in the psalm he said uh Psalm 127 except the Lord built the house the man they buil it he build it in vain amen so what I want you to know like our brother is saying tonight uh God is not building apartment buildings okay and the matter of fact there is that you are not the one that is building you have to know that you are just a material you are not the Builder you are not the one that is building it's just like Solomon Temple you know the uh ENT evangelism brother brandom says uh uh all of these years we've been Gathering Stones now now what God is actually doing he's shaping those stones for it to fit in the building okay he's cutting all the ESS out of us the ESS habit the essess weaknesses the ESS nature for us to fit into that building you see everything that was done in the Old Testament all the prophets were successful to build only one building that was Jesus Christ as God says uh you know this is my son I'm well pleased to do it so everything the whole Old Testament did it was enough to achieve that building and in this age or in this in the New Covenant from Paul and everything they have been doing was building one building and that's the bride building to make a bride body you see that's the reason why people think that they have their personal revelation they have their individual way that God no no God is not building you as a person by yourself no he's building a building he's building a barding he's building a house it's a bride house am you are not an individual building standing by yourself that's the reason why you can't run your individual life you don't have your individual uh H Revelation no it's not an individual work God is doing it's a building work and brother B told us that the hardest thing in building is to turn the corner it's hard that's the hardest thing if it is just putting walls it's easy running the walls is very easy but when you want to make rooms you want to make the dining room big the kitchen big you got to turn corners and that is the thing that gets tough for [Music] us because we we we get so used to one way of doing things when God want to turn Corners in our lives that's why he allowed us to go through the things that we go through because he want to turn Corners let me show you something h h a beautiful thought brother Paul spoke on today uh this evening let me let me show you something he talks about the birth feeding and growth studying the message uh uh statue of a perfect man many times uh slow that a little bit uh uh brother arel many times uh uh people think what what Peter said add onto your faith that word makes us to feel like it's something we need to do no that's the reason why the principle is birth faed and grow you can't you can't give birth to yourself something has to give birth to you look in Genesis let's just read Genesis uh uh 3024 tonight and uh this kind of a settled this thought of that principle Genesis 30 see what happened here when uh when When Rachel gave birth when Joseph was born now you have to realize brother B said Joseph was the was the fourth Cornerstone amen when God was being his Old Testament spiritual house Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph was the four the four Cornerstone that that he laid down but look at this verse it will it will help us tonight to be able to understand something here there uh that's uh Genesis 30: 24 you will appreciate what brother Paul was bringing to us tonight the Bible said verse 22 and God remember Rachel and God he him to her and opened her womb and she conceived and bear a son and said God has taken away my reproach verse 24 watch now she the Bible says and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add now that I will add the Lord shall add so when when Peter say add unto your faith it's not what you do it's not what you going to do because you are not the Builder you are not the one building this if you are the one building your your your spiritual house that is the reason why it is the way it is because you are building it she said the Lord shall add so the same God that brings Faith by the new birth is the same God that brings virtue when you are feeding on the word now when you are making things up by yourself when you are F him the Lord shall add he V you and you see the thing there is that it is not an individual think no is a body think just like brother Paul was talking about our different strength and our different trial you see the thing is it's something that God gives to the body praise the Lord you find bunch of people trying to impersonate V you you know brother say to get V you you know I I need to get vet you it it just it just him workout it is not you iding it has to be the Lord that is hiding and how is he hiding is through our feeding on the word yes feeding on the word staying on the right atmosphere that's the first time the word ad is you used in the Bible this this verse that we just read if if it was the Lord that add it it has to be God that will add this vud to the church he brought it in a spiritual form through the seven Church ages now he's bringing it imortal spiritual form it's for the entire body it is not for you as an individual because you are not an apartment God not building apartment houses he's building a build a a body it's a body that he's building you are just one stone that need to fit in that body and for God to get you to your place he need to cut all the asss and sh [Music] so the principle is birth birth is the one that brought the faith it's birth and let me let me tell you something whatever you are feeding on shows the kind of a birth you have that's right praise the Lord whatever you are feeding on shows the kind of a birth you have we love the Lord tonight we want to thank the Lord for the word we look we look forward for more on Sunday good to have brother Paul here give me a little bit of a break here but uh sit down and and enjoy the word just like you praise the Lord amen amen glory be to God David said except the Lord build the house you can stay up all night you WTH in V except it is God that is building the [Music] house you can do all your all night praying you can do all your religion that you want to do except God is building it house so that's the reason why we have to realize we need to submit ourself in his hands he's the one that is doing the building let's stand on our feet tonight I we just sing that song with the musicians are are playing and go praying [Music] tonight yes I am and B with a price Jesus has changed my whole

Lord Jesus that is made out of people from many nations Lord from many backgrounds so father the Lord you are the one oh God that has sent your angels to gather those stones just like when Solomon was building Lord God stones from all around the world oh God came for that Temple and you have gather us as stones in your hands and you sent the Holy Ghost as the stone Meer mner Lord God to ship us Lord to put us in in shap so we can rightly fill into the building Lord God oh God we say shap us tonight Lord father may we be able to receive receive the word and address things in our lives Lord the word is not for entertaining Lord the word is to be able to shape us is to be able to positionally place us [Music] amen except the Lord build the house and father we know that you are the one building this house you are the one building Lord God father this bride [Music] body and when you get that last Stone in your hands and you ship it and put it right into that corner the Rapture [Music] goes if we are not finding our place in the body is because we have lot of loose ends that need to be shaped if we are not finding our place in Christ if we are not finding our place to be a Son of God or be a daughter of God is because we have lot of loose ends that need to be Shi up Lord let us let let the the stor amazing come tonight Lord God shape us Lord in our mind shap us in our habits Lord shap us in our family life oh God that we can be able to bring trueu worship to you a living Tabernacle for the Living [Music] God father as you turn the corner after the ep the Ephesian Church age Lord you turn the corner Lord God to another age and father Lord God you are turning a corner Lord you turn a corner father when you call a bride out of the Ladish Church Edge father and this is the bride chamber you are shipping this room for the bride chamber is where we go in in the veil Lord we go behind the curtains Lord Jesus we must not be too particular and and individual we have to fit in the building how am I bringing service to a brother how am I bringing service to my sister your Prophet said as we serve one another we serve the Lord is because we are fitting into the building it's not an individual house and and this person is the individual house and this other person is the individual house no that's not what it is we are all joined together and the joints Supply one another amen we have to faithly join in to be able to supply one another beyond our selfishness how can I be a blessing Lord we thank you for your word tonight thank you for the atmosphere thank you for the Holy Spirit Lord God coming tonight and speaking to us so father we we just want to go to our home tonight thinking on these things Lord you are the one that add we are not adding anything we just playing religion if we think we adding that's the reason why it have never standed we've been trying to add just using our own own uh uh him mind kind of mind and think that we add him no we don't add anything you are the one that add because you are the one that is building When Rachel received one son she says the Lord will add unto me the Lord that brought the first one he will bring the second one the Lord I have given me Grace he will give me favor the Lord I have taken this thing out of my life he's able to take this one out of my life because it's All About Him
