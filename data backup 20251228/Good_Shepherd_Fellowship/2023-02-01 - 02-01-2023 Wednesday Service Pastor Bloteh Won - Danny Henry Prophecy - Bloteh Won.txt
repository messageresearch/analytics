kneeled down Lord he didn't do anything special he didn't have any certain chant or special words that he said or anything that he did he just kneeled down at the foot of the cross and as he kneeled at the foot of the cross the story tells us that he just felt his burden become lighter and when he turned around and looked it was gone and he saw a tomb with her the stone was rolled away and he could see the price had been paid and there was nothing he had to do but just surrender father and Lord we have here with that opportunity once again to kneel at the cross father the Neo in your

Lord Jesus praise the Lord God bless you thank you musicians amen amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat tonight I want to just I want to take her a little thought here praise the Lord I want to take a thought here on uh uh I've been kind of looking at some few things uh I was going to pick up some of the types in Shadow in the in the mauritian devil series that we're playing for Sunday School so uh but something caught my attention as I was looking uh going back looking at the message and and other things and I realized that I want tonight I want to look at Daniel Henry prophecy Diana Henry prophecy that he uh he he uh prophesied over brother Brandon 1961. and actually that prophecy was on February 11 1961. and uh and there were some other few things too that started that started catching my mind on uh looking at uh what is happening in the times and and what has happened through the history of the message and the times that we are living in but for now we we just want to look at that uh Diana Henry prophecy and uh and and be able to take some things from there so brother Branham was preaching over in California uh when when Diana Henry prophesied over him so when he came back to the Tabernacle he was doing Easter he started preaching on the Easter seal so that was the first time he would make mention of Daniel Henry prophecy so I would read I would read a portion there in Easter seal then we would read the word together amen because uh that is also mentioned now uh when we when we look at this a little bit the Lord will bless it in the way that uh uh Affair to speak upon it you will see the importance of why he had to mention it especially in marriage and divorce and and in in some of the messages also that he preached on the wings of a snow white dove over in uh sweeper He also mentioned that when he preached that message also and uh and a few other messages too but let me let me read this so uh he's he's there preaching and he preached such a message and and brother Brahm says he really rebuked the Pentecostal people you have to realize that the Pentecostal blessing fell in in California uh on Azusa Street and to see how the the the church was getting away from from uh the origin of Pentecostal uh faith and uh and now they started bringing in all these theological things so brother Brandon was very hard he he says he preached a very high message he says tear the people down I was listening to him today and then uh he says them right after that this young baptist boy that was in the meeting uh you know he came to Sheikh brother Branham to congratulate him and he says he said to brother Brandon he says man this this message you preach we can stick it at the back of the Bible and make it a 2010 chapter of Revelation and as soon as he said that the Holy Spirit fell on him amen you have never spoken in tongues before you don't even know what what actually it was he broke out into speaking in tongues and he spoke actually in the French language he he you know he he prophesied over brother Branham and there were three Witnesses in the in the in the meeting one was a U.N interpreter and another woman from Baton Rouge and and another young man all three of them were in the meeting sitting different places and they caught exactly what he said they wrote wrote it down all three of them brought their their Witnesses and everything match word for word praise the Lord so now brother Brahm is testifying on this because thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path now you see I get that all right there's part of it are done now he's been Earnest now there is part of the prophecy that he understood he knew exactly but there was part of it that he says I don't understand it yet okay and over and over he would say you know as as time goes by uh it will start to come together the picture will start to come together he says that part of it uh there's part of it I've done because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in thine own choosing I can get that all right because he can look at his life look at some of the choices that he made he says I can understand that why the holy spirit will say that I can get that all right see you choose it yourself it was your own choosing praise the Lord Moses made his own choice he didn't have to do it neither did I have to take this path I could have I could have had big buildings out Yanda like some of them has got I could be all across on television but who sponsor me on tearing the very Foundation but one thing I don't have to bow down to anybody's feet but the Lord Jesus Christ that's right I preach what the Bible says I don't have to compromise with with their organization because I don't belong to them I made the choice just like he said up there as I was with Moses so I will be with you praise the Lord and he gave Moses two signs of confirmation to proof and Moses made his own choice see Moses made his own choice so that's easy to understand thou has chosen now let's stand to our feet let's read a portion of the word and then we will continue Hebrew let's go to the book of Hebrew Hebrew chapter 11 . now when brother Branham over and over make the emphasis every time he he talked about this prophecy come back to that place now Moses make his own choice I believe he's referring to the scripture we're going to read tonight Hebrew chapter 11 let's read from verse 23. praise the Lord from verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commitment praise the Lord by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God it was his choice vento then to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we we just want to reflect the night Lord after speaking our knees to you which of course we are needed people will always be in need Lord father and and dear God so we we just want to look at this portion of your word now father in line oh god with this prophecy that was uh spoken over over a broad branding father God and we just asked a blessing now father bring an inspiration bring something that will encourage us Lord that will strengthen us tonight we gave you the praise we gave you the glory and honor father praise Lord for your namesake and for the sacrifice of your people bless your word tonight oh God and bless this portion of the service in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat now we go back to our reading now so now he continued here because there has chosen the Narrow Path the harder when thou have walked in your own choosing now and then when you look at Hebrew chapter 30 I mean 11 year like we said Paul yet is talking about by by faith now so he's associating faith and choice right amen in one sense your your choice the choices we make reflect the faith we have you can claim to have faith in God I believe God I believe God's word but your faith is expressed in the choices you make praise the Lord Hallelujah fed is a choice if we if we want to look at it that way and uh uh so we see here that uh even even Moses parents now the scripture says that the fear not the case commitment they they dare to keep their son they choose to keep him believing that Jehovah will protect him praise the Lord the choice of putting him on the Nile River it was a choice they never knew where the boy was going to end up an expression of faith praise the Lord and it was a high choice after three months to win a baby out of breastfeeding and put him on the night River and and and and just and just and just send him out with a prayer just like putting your your child on the on the bus the first day of school praise the Lord you so nervous you are rubbing your hand at the you know the little little one is anxious to go to school and uh and then you yeah I mean you saw you you want to take it in by yourself say no I want to get on the bus and and all of that but this is a three months baby that we are talking about praise the Lord but that was that was uh Moses Parents Choice they had to make a choice and it was not an easy choice choosing is not easy praise the Lord choosing is not easy sometimes it's hot so I mean some people want to make it easy but in most cases it's difficult to make a choice praise the Lord because in in many cases there's not so many times that two persons sees the same thing the same way at the same time we might get to see it the same way but not at the same time praise the Lord so choice is a great thing brother Branham will say praise the Lord now so here we see that uh uh honor Daniel Henry prophecy and and this prophecy is actually going to affect brother Brennan it's going to affect him in such a way that uh is going to make him to stop thinking you know he's going to start reflecting on some of the things that you know the choices the the move that he have made the decision he have made and is is is actually in one sense it was more of an encouragement to him but yet it had him thinking because as he goes alone and and and keep talking about uh the prophecy he's seen uh understanding some and yet he's saying I don't know how this other one is connected to the whole thing praise the Lord because of that choosing because they all have chosen the Narrow Path the heart away thou has walked in your own choosing noun he says now this man now watch how he how he wrote it you can see the foreign words and now he he gets down here he says Thou Hast picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way he said bless God is my way amen God is you know affirming that that is his way because of this uh momentous decision a huge portion of heaven and with thee now he says that uh he had never heard about the vision now brother Branham has just also had a vision behind the curtain of time he had just had it in that same year of 1961 he he just preached a message few times uh on uh on the beyond the cartoon of time talking about the vision and Yara said that this uh uh uh about this board I don't know anything maybe it was his first time there in brother Branham uh meetings you know he's now confirming these things a huge portion of heaven so brother Branham is now tying that part you know could this be what I saw in the vision behind the cartoon of time praise the Lord he never he had never heard about about the vision you see or of this you remember the vision a huge portion of Heaven away thee what a glorious decision there has made this in itself now here from year on I don't understand he said from this side I don't understand how the whole thing is connecting to this this inner self in that big parenthesis around it which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the law of divine I don't know what that means this will make come to pass perhaps a little ten one of these days sitting back Yonder he will make it noon so you see brother band is now looking for God to make him to understand that part of the vision praise the Lord amen so you see the prophet follow and understand God dealing with him in a Progressive Way praise the Lord in a Progressive Way why not because we had to do it not because that is just an easy way you can you can be popular you did have everybody patting you on the back money flooring in from from from every word for a radio television and so forth now he's you know talking about the choice that he made they said uh they will take it and and televise it I don't believe in taking God's thing and putting them out on such vulgar stuff of the word I don't believe in all that hoping up and making something they are asking I believe in just letting it alone praise the Lord now this is 1961 but you'll realize that uh uh down in 1963 1964 brother Peregrine I already started setting up uh what will have been the television program for brother Branham so uh but but he just he just expressing that here he's expressing here to make us to understand the other it was actually a hard choice a difficult Choice Birmingham talks about his experience going over to uh uh over our University and seeing uh you know he says man what that young boy could do you know that young man from Oklahoma would call him he says man I was really proud of what uh Aura could do he went down there to Tommy Osmond place and he says all of these boys are spring out of my Ministry and God bless and then being him on his day he's thinking in his mind so maybe maybe I've not had the character for God to trust me you know with with all of these big things praise the Lord and right there the Holy Spirit came down and the Lord spoke to him and said I'm your portion praise the Lord amen I'm your portion uh it's it's in the place that we have to understand you know uh the faith that we have believed I mean the the choice that we make even to be here tonight the choice you make to be in Savvy the choice you made to live a Christian Life praise the Lord amen is not something that you must you must overlook because that's your life coming to service Wednesday night coming to service on Sunday you know uh putting in time for devotion and the different things that you do it's your life it's your everyday life your lifespan on Earth year a big part of this is all part of it that's the reason why the the the the choices that we make we must realize it is very important we have people there to encourage us we have parents there to guide us but at a certain point of time we will have to make certain choices praise the Lord brother bam says I don't believe in all of that okay he says I believe in just letting the God he says he's God let him do with it uh what he won we are servants just save the Lord just do us God said amen in the midst of all of it though is forced to make a decision they were forced to make a decision that he was talking on making decision before he came to this place right here on on talking about this Vision now he takes takes the very same top dead in uh in another message he preached but it was not so from the beginning because thou has chosen the narrow path they had a way thou has walked in their own choosing I can understand that Moses walk in his in his own tomb and not only Moses David walked in his own children praise the Lord amen I mean he was he was the youngest of the brothers but I mean to be out there taking care of the sheep it is something that he had to I believe make a choice fall in love with even if it was given to him as a responsibility for him to grow to the place where he will grow a a courage to be able to fight if he didn't like it well the bear take one there are many years let that one go I'll take care of this one praise the Lord but to make the choice to take a slingshot and go and get a uh uh alarm from a lion or a bed that is a choice he can Wing his shoulder and don't care and because of that choice that he make of protecting his every father Chiefs God bless him and God positioned him to be a king praise the Lord because just like Paul espressive we read he says esteeming the reproach of Christ the greater riches than the treasure in Egypt for he has respect unto the recompense of the reward he knew there was there was going to be a reward I was going to come he didn't know his mom was a Sunday school teacher she was his nanny and she took her talk that Tender Heart of Moses and find a way to be able to steal and and install into him that he was a Hebrew that he was born under a sign praise the Lord all those Bible stories they make the time to be able to build courage and character in him that when he came to age he could make a choice to identify himself with the word praise the Lord now so if you bring it over now to uh to uh uh our our Sunday school tape you realize that brother Branham going over this vision is trying to make us to realize that coming to preach the subject marriage and divorce it's a hard thing which of course he said on tape I have good friends here people that have supported me people that will give their life for me you call out his son so it was a hard thing so that's what he's sleeping this vision aim for us to understand but it is it is his choice for him to go on the mountain and wait on God to be able to bring us a word to be able to bring us a pardon are we together on certain sign he says now I understand that Moses had to walk in his own choosing he didn't have to do it he made a decision that was my decision to stay with the world regardless of what is done praise the Lord I mean to have the the the kind of a gift that you know that he was born with it was just something that uh I mean he prayed for kings and and great men uh next week Wednesday I want to take up one again and uh and and the reason why I'm doing this I will let you know as as we go along power does brother Branham says because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the hard way thou has there has made their has walked in your own choosing in other words now you see that's that's the place where it is you know people people have confidence in you as as their Pastor they have confidence in you as a brother as a sister but sometimes you know brother Brandon said you know what it's just there that uh uh like what uh saw that you know he wanted to identify himself with the with the prophet Samir now he knew that he he have already he have already broke the Commandments of God he did what the prophet Samuel to him not to do he started losing the favor of God and and God was not dealing with him like the way that God should deal with him and he all he also started losing you know the the authority over the people so what he did is that he tried to associate himself with the prophet amen he says me and the prophet Samuel who are on me and the prophet saw me aside praise the Lord you know that resonate with us praise the Lord I mean even if it is scripture or not as long as we can talk brother Branham name to it we get the people attention the people get excited so sometimes it's also like that we want for uh you know our choice is to be a frame or confirmed by somebody about doing the right thing but you see sometimes it is that place where God brings you he wanted to be you and him praise the Lord it is you and him dealing it is you surrounding your heart and surrounding your will to God and say Lord not my will but your will help me do it to do this I'm going to step out by faith to do it and I will also say even if I fail because most of the time there is the fear of failure the fear of failure Rob us of faith because we are afraid to fail we we we return to stock uh uh uh thinking of what would people think and pretty soon we lost sight of what will God think even if I feel he would bring me out if I trust him praise the Lord if I trust him I mean not not not doing something like Balaam not doing something when you know that the word of God condemn it you've just been stubborn you're just putting yourself on a country on a wrong Spirit the evil spirit when the word condemneth leave it leave it because all you would do is that you would just build up regret for yourself you'll just build up regret praise the Lord but when you know that it's the right thing to do praise the Lord and I believe that we are we are we are coming to this place where we will have to make some some strong choices to stand for what is right praise the Lord because more and more the popular opinion is is beginning to influence the dead and age that we are living in and what people would call decent uh you know like the prophet uh Isaiah said they were called good uh evil and evil guilt but because the popular opinion says it is okay everybody says it's okay praise the Lord and then what do you think about it I don't know praise the Lord you don't know which side to stand on because you don't have it in you to take God at his word praise the Lord when he fell there was a carriers in the Garden of Eden the first time chaos will be seen even the animals were confused they didn't know what happened Adam was trying to get himself get himself back home and when he got home he met Eve there praise the Lord it was also a hard choosing praise the Lord for Eve to tell Adam the serpent beguiled me praise the Lord have you done what God said we shouldn't do he says she said is this happen now it was his choosing for him to take his wife but it was a hard choosing it was a hard choosing praise the Lord to assure that even God's choice for you and myself to choose you as a as a seed of God in in this age it was a hard choosing you say brother one how could it be hard for God Calvary shows that it was hard because he had to come and pay the price he chose you and you were born in sin for him to have what he choose he had to pay the price so Joyce is always a I think praise the Lord so it always depends on who's influencing our choices the choices we make to do the things that we are doing the choices that is influenced in our life young people you have to come to that place of personal conviction and make sure that you bring it back to the word no don't don't don't do it because of your stubbornness that I just want to do it why you want to do I just want to do it I just feel like I should do it there's no no Bible verse say just just do it because you want to do it you must pray about it you must think about it where will this thing lead me to what benefit am I getting from it praise the Lord choice is a great thing praise the Lord now brother Branham would tell us when we go back there to Heap uh Ephesians chapter one he will tell us that uh uh uh that's word the mystery of internal security age is that God choose us praise the Lord he had to make a choice is all tied into internal security and the prophet of God said he had to predestinate he choose the age that we were coming he choose the parents that we will be born you choose the part of the word that we will be born in he made all of those choosing and then he sealed on the predestination so that's what Jesus could make that statement all that the father had given me will come and I will now lost one because the father make a choice and when he make that choice he sealed the choice he protected his choice is a great thing so the choices now you see that you know you you we think about choices you know the you know our mind flies all over the place because I mean uh I mean when we wake up in the morning I mean it's right from uh getting all out of bed and whatever is a choice he could choose to roll over praise the Lord you could choose to pull your pillow tight choose to switch the alarm off so right when our eyes comes open choices We Begin our day with choices the choice of waking up and lifting your hands and say oh God thank you praise the Lord it's a choice even it's a choice to break your sleep in the night and and slip away and just have a little meditation time and just and just take something on your heart just take something on your heart it's a choice that you have to make and God reward those choices he reward him praise the Lord every step of the way as we go down the road you have many lanes you have many roads to take you make a choice think about the traffic and say well I think traffic would be yeah let me make a choice and go this way but you see there is one thing that is setting in this and I hope I hope to share with you when I bring bring this thought another time you know brother Brown talks about how making that choice of having the Lord to be the Lord of our life it helps to influence all the choices that we make when we surround our life to him praise the Lord it helps to influence the choices that we make praise the Lord it gave us the courage when we are making our choices because we know in in whom we believe praise the Lord amen we know he will be there to help us we know he will guide us so I want us to look at this and uh uh most specialized we look at you know uh that marriage and divorce tape and and and and and and when when you when you when we understand it from the place of someone standing in a place of doing something that seems difficult praise the Lord it's almost like God telling Abraham a need Isaac take him up off the mountain and sacrifice him to me praise the Lord it was a choice that Abraham had to make praise the Lord and not knowing what the outcome will be you know the story is written for us we can read it and because we know the end from the beginning so we can be so revelated but it was not that way for Abraham he did not know what the outcome will be he just spoke things out of faith and by by choice he never even told Sarah that God said I should sacrifice this boy there was a choice that he had to make he came back from the mountain I believe before he even told Sarah which of course that was a smart choice that was a wise choice Father Abraham praise the Lord but you see it was a choice the scripture make us to know that he believed that God will resurrect his son from the dead how he believed that God will raise him up but God never even allowed him to kill him but he had to make that choice praise the Lord we choose him to be the Lord of our life not just part of our life our entire life our family our health our mind and everything our finances praise the Lord we have to throw everything in amen I was listening to Easter seal while we were driving to church and brother Branham after the the the the message you got into a little prayer line in the Tabernacle and you started expressing you know making decision and things and he says talking about a prayer line he says he said he says I'm not the one I'm not the one I'm not the one that healed your sickness he says I just I just learned him my body to use praise the Lord and is also a choice praise the Lord he says I just learned him my body to use he says and you can do the same also musicians you can come and as Masha was a comfort to brother Branham realizing that God comes back and then he he see all of that and and uh and everything I mean some of the tough life born in the family that he was born I believe that was God's choice for him praise the Lord see the Apostle Paul where Brahms is because of him not not only that he just couldn't get over the guilt I believe Paul there with that he knew that God was gracious he knew that God forgave him for what he did to Stony Stephen but he made a choice [Music] that because he took a life he was also going to give his life for this gospel that's the reason why when Philip daughter prophesied over him and told him there was chains bound is waiting for you Paul was ready to give himself to Aid we make choices every day we make choices with our time we make choices it's very important [Music] that's why our house together tonight [Music] brother Branham High the the grace and I believe that God wanted to comfort his prophet [Music] coming away from a meeting like that Carl Williams and all those big Pentecostal boys [Music] prophet of God was preaching one time and the man told him brother Brown and why you always just tear the people say you know the people respect you as a prophet you know they love you but it is almost like you you just you just you just tear them all the time [Music] praise the Lord brother brand of me in the message Masterpiece he said he asked the man you know Beethoven that great songwriter he says that I believe that he spent many night up tearing papers to get the right inspiration he had a whole trash fort [Music] he had a painful of paper that he told every time he wrote oh no it's not a heater he put it in the beanies but Branham says that's that's the same thing that God is doing to us when he take us through the things that he take us through we are making choices to try to trust him we are making choices to serve him believing him for our family believing him for our children believing him that he will bless our home believing that he would take care of our needs and sometimes things happen and sometimes uh uh we feel a little bit disappointed when it's just not on time when it's not happening the way we expect and our mind and our hearts get broken a little bit foreign [Music] to make something better out of you so as we close this prayer meeting tonight while the musicians softly play [Music] that we just recommit our choices to God foreign to realize that the choices we make express our faith we can talk about great faith we can think about raising the Dead but the choices we make every day I mean even as a church to keep this body together the technicians have to make choices to be here the musicians have to make choices to be here like brother Branham said they don't have to do it they don't have to do it this church do not pay them to do it but it's a choice that they make to come and save us whether we are here whether we are at home they make their choices [Music] let's think about it foreign [Music] and that's another group of people that wonder how it happened foreign [Music] you can make choices not to just sit back and watch because you have to know that the prophet of God says God is what he's waiting on you foreign let's pray together tonight No Doubt by God's grace we have made a tremendous decision to give our heart to the Lord if we have given our heart to the Lord if we have accepted him as our Lord and savior that was a tremendous decision we are safe but yeah there are other choices we can make even keeping our homes under the atmosphere of the word that is choices foreign father Lord Jesus on this Wednesday night of God We Come O god father Lord I'm just thank you Lord father God yeah Lord God in them February 11th of God is going to drop on the
