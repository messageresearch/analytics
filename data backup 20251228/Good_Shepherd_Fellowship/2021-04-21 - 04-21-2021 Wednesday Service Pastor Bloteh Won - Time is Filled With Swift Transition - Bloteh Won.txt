the world tonight then we might water if we praise amen if the lord bless the word then we will water it with praise but it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight it's going to be in the house of the lord we trust that that god will will uh come and help us tonight praise the lord and uh uh he will he will i wanted to speak on uh on a little thought that i had on my heart and had a little thought on my heart and that's why that song came to mind to mind time is filled with swift transition i will use that first line as a subject to preach on tonight time is filled with swift transition hebrew chapter four hebrew chapter four we read that verse on on sunday really never had a time to get into what we want to share with you but the lord hired us to say something anyway and uh and we we are grateful for that hebrew chapter 4 let's turn to our feed we read from verse 9 tonight praise the lord we'll read from verse 9 tonight there remained therefore a rest to the people of god i mean we can close our bible and i'm sure the lord can be able to give us something to just say from that verse i believe that there remaineth a rest to the people of god and that's what we are looking forward to our rest is not in this economy our rest is not in our jobs our our bank account and uh our even in our home we in this in this place we have no continuing city amen but every minute therefore a rest to the people of god for he that entered for for he that is entered into his rest he also has seized from his own work as god did from his so paul is saying here if you are still working trying to make yourself good god will be resting but if you will be resting in god's promise to make you good then god will be working on your behalf praise the lord amen for he that is entered into his rest into god's rest have ceased from his own work if you have entered into god's rest you are resting on the promises of god you are seized from your work amen praise the lord you are not impressing god by your action you are not impressing god to impress god is to say lord i believe you i believe your word be it unto me according to your word praise the lord amen for he that is entered into his rest he has also ceased from his own work as god did from did from haste let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two eggs who appears in even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and modern and is at the center of the tops and intents of the heart let us pray heavenly father we just want to ask tonight lord your blessing upon this word father we want to find rest in you we want to find rest in you from the things that we are struggling with in our mind the things we are struggling with father in our life in our habits we want to find rest in you father and only you lord can give us that rest that brings satisfaction father we just ask the lord god you will you will bless your word tonight and come father lord and speak to our hearts father in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen i'm having i'm having some uh broken notes tonight but i think we will be able to use it praise the lord i would take one year brother branham used that song from hebrew chapter one he was preaching on hebrew series he said time is filled with swift's transition not on earth or move can stand nothing on move on earth can be able to stand with what is happening there your hopes on things in he said let us catch a view of him that unseen one in the midst now praise the lord jesus said wheresoever two or three are gathered he promised that he will be in our midst we believe that amen he says we must we must catch a view of him that unseen one that is in the midst now and just worship him now as we think praise the lord amen so we we want to we want to talk on uh some of the swift transition that is happening in the world i mean things are happening that we have we have uh some of them we have no idea about some of the great changes that is happening in the world that we are living in even in the laws of the land and and uh and all of the things that is happening but tonight uh uh my mind uh mine the inspiration of my heart actually uh is is looking at something a little bit different i'll use this as uh as a stepping stone maybe the law might help us to be able to to to work on it but my mind uh the thought that is on my heart tonight is uh is to talk about just like we started sunday talking about how the word of god is quake praise the lord brother branham in a message that he preached on the developing of signs and speed the countdown brother branham starts to talk about how science was actually reflecting what god was doing spiritually and he took that what actually he was trying to help us to see is to understand the move of god praise the lord god is the inventor of speed god was the first one that took the first speed no one can run faster than god because he's everywhere praise the lord because god is everywhere you can never run faster than him but he was the first one that took the first p and the first speed that god took was to come from eternity to time that was his first speed praise the lord because he's the great internal god that one time failed all time in all space but yet he could condemn himself he could move he could move himself from an internal being to begin what we call time and he did that by a move he did that by speed praise the lord amen and it is so difficult it's so difficult no matter how we try to think it in our mind it's so difficult for us to be able to understand and put together how god moves jesus said in john chapter 3 it's just like the wind he says we feed it amen we feed the moving of the wane you know what is coming from here or there and and and he was just he was just kind of for describing how the spirit moved and in the bible we heard in genesis chapter one that god moved upon the water praise the lord god move upon the water now we all you know uh we we say sir you know when we believe that uh uh uh we're in the message of the hour but what is the message of the hour the message of the hour is the move of god amen is the move of god in this last day a move of god that we have identified by scripture praise the lord we have a time we we have attached malachi 4 to this move of god we have attached revelation 10 7 to this move of god sin luke uh uh uh 17 we have attached all of these scriptures because we see god fulfilling we see god moving upon those scripture sure praise the lord amen and so we want to talk a little bit about the move of god we want to talk about the sweetness of god we want to talk about the speed of god praise the lord are we together amen because you see that as as time goes by and and things are happening uh in the earth you know and things are happening around us every day there are a lot of things and that is and that is the place where uh uh the critics and uh and the atas and all the people that that think that uh you know this thing about god is just uh it's just you know it's just a man's idea and uh uh where is god and all of the evil that is happening in the world sure you know if really there is a god which means he has abandoned us glory be to god amen but if we would just understand or have a little bit of an idea you know about how our god moves and how he operates god is not a man for the modified god mid man praise the lord so god is not a man and you cannot use uh you know a man's brain to be able to understand how god moves and how he works praise the lord amen so uh as we look at as we look at these things together uh let me share something here with you from the message the truth is the seal the truth is to seal saskatchewan would take the second one first before the first i have everything missed up here so amen now we just happen to think just watch this meaning see einstein proof but scientific that if two objects are coming to each other like two cars coming down across the road and if they were coming fast enough now they did really have to to be going fast like a billion miles a second which of course the inventors of kais have not put their speed on kai yet we don't have that speed speed limit we don't have a speed limit like a billion miles a second but i i wish we would we will look into some few things and help you to understand what we're talking about if a car could go that fast a billion miles per second but uh he says they could pass right through one another and never disrupt i think sure they could pass through one another and never disrupt and think praise the lord the speed would do it pass them right through one another without disrupting a thing think about this you you you you you you go to the airport and you get in a plane and the plane takes down the runway okay it's about to take off you see the speed that the plane gets on and it gets you know on the wrong way it starts to take up it's going you know even as the plane starts to take up it's it's just picking up to go the speed that it takes to pick up is not the kind of a speed that you drive on your highway with sure okay and then when it gets on the wrong way and it starts to pick up i mean you grab the edge of your seat because it's speeding and then when it takes off you know it starts to go off you are just holding the earth hole in there and then when it gets up to a place where it's settled down you feel comfortable and it looks like the plane is not moving but the speed has not changed it's still moving in such a speed but you can feel it right praise the lord amen if you have the idea of the speed that you are moving well up there you will not sleep even the food they give you you will not eat it because it is not your normal caspi it's moving with such a speed yeah the distance from here uh uh uh uh that you would take to get to uh uh uh uh washington dc you might be you might drive maybe uh uh even if you choose not to eat or not to stop in a way you just take gas you're going to drive i mean maybe close to 20 hours sure but if you get in the flight it takes you maybe about two hours you see the differences in speed praise the lord and another thing with speed is that the the kind of speed that an airplane would take to take you from here to dc can only operate in the ram up there yeah right if you use that speed down here is disaster praise the lord amen and this goes to saying as we as we move upward the speed changes praise the lord the speed changes i'm trying to to to put this in a place where uh uh it will even the the the children will understand it verbally says this as he goes here he says but yet heaven is so many billions and billions and billions of light years beyond that praise the lord tell is is not even taught off you cannot think about the distance from here to heaven if you want to put it into mass sure praise the lord you continue about it are we together he says till issa is not taught of how will we get there is is the travel it will be like the mind it will be like the mind they will your mind think amen it will be like the mind so fast it will be faster if we could think of heaven that's how quick you they be there praise the lord if you think of heaven as your mind think of heaven that's how quick you'll be there brother branham experience beyond the curtain of time when he laid down on his bed on his little twin bed and he says lord i wonder what it will be like as he thought of heaven he traveled as his thought praise the lord amen brandon says this he said jesus after he was resurrected came through the walls right through the door and stood in it boyfish and honeycomb hallelujah speed no sooner than life has gone out of this body we are in the presence of god there is no dumb woman that's just how speed is even healing that comes to a present body like like like miracle you know when when god performed miracle change water into wine it bypassed all the process of fermentation very quick speed amen when you when you're having health headache and and it's oh god my head is pounding me lord jesus please touch me and heal me and and that healing comes to you it comes with such a speed that you can't explain it you can't explain it even when you take medication because of pain you have pain in your body and you take medication and you and you drink the medication we know that the medications don't heal praise the lord are we together now so brother berlin is saying this he he he's comparing it with with jesus resurrection the bible says when when jesus says father into your hands i commit my spirit and the bible says he give up the gospel praise the lord his body was hanging on the cross but we know he stepped down to the region of the lost he was busy he was on his way down to the region of the lust as he gave up the ghost year he was opening the doors for the old testament saints [Music] praise the lord it was so fast yeah praise the lord praise the lord there was there was just no door movement for him sure and we know he went down there yeah and uh uh uh uh to the old testament scenes and like brother brandon says and went down there you know step the door sit and take the keys of of of uh life and death praise the lord he took the keys and and and and uh just in that period of time then we know that uh on the resurrection morning he came forth from the grave and and mary magdalene saw him and says and says oh my master he said touch me net don't touch me go and tell my brethrens praise the lord because he have not ascended to the father he has now presented the sacrifice to the father praise the lord so just in that time he was able to travel to heaven he came down met the two men on the road of immigrants we are talking about god speed praise the lord are we together time is filled with swift transition praise the lord just go away feel just go away for a week a month you come back and look at you oh my god you have grown we are snapping right now all of those things are just evidence of things that are swiftly happening that we have little ideas about praise the lord brother branham told us about the fourth dimension he says there are voices that are passing through this building now and as we are talking the invisible world is more real than the ones that we can see with our eyes praise the lord praise the lord amen because man has corrupt the word and they tried to faction it and they tried to dress it and try to make it colorful they have lost all of its natural beauty are we together he says speak no sooner than life has gone out of this body we are in the presence of god yandere we own and know as feet and inches and yeah and minds and so forth brother brahms says that is how much we know about speed how many yeah can you run how fast can you walk right that's why we know about speed but there are more speed that is going on praise the lord amen how do god take habits from our life that we don't feed it how he takes habit how he takes the desire of this world that you don't feed it you don't need an anesthesia for you to be delivered from lies praise the lord the word of god is quick and powerful the word have such a speed a has such a power it have such an effect if we will just only rightly receive the word don't pull it through our reasoning if that word can just goes directly to our soul it will have such an impact that we all can leave from this building tonight more stronger than we came in because the word is powerful and it's quake praise the lord we wouldn't know as feeding in inches yeah mars and sulfur we we are in this f bound system but when we leave here brother oh my water time [Laughter] what a time glory be to god what a time praise the lord amen it comes natural no wonder when a kid learn to ride a bicycle they are struggling to balance on it sure but as soon as they get a little sense of balance what they do the speed they don't think about the danger there is something of this body that want us to go faster [Music] praise the lord and after the know how to drive i mean ride a bicycle i mean uh they get they get used to that speed they want something more faster right sure praise the lord then they can't wait to get a driver license they said in a car they don't know how to drive but they were voo what is in their mind speed they want to go faster oh sin has slowed us down people sin has slowed us down sin has slowed us down that's the reason why the man that living in sin he's sluffle he's very slurful because sin bounds you amen a bounce you erupt you of your abilities if it was not because of sin we don't need a vehicle that's right right we don't need airplanes praise the lord we could have traveled more faster we could have traveled by the speed of the world praise the lord you realize that i i at a young age oh man you you could move faster than and and enjoy can run as you get older you cannot run like you used to do when you were young why because corruption in the body [Music] sin affected the body yeah so you can't wait you want to get out of that body why because we came from out of the world from the thought of god everest child and daughter of god have in them such a speed social speed that the devil can make it with you [Music] [Laughter] you can go so fast that a democracy i i thought he was a drunkard where he [Music] [Applause] gone praise the lord amen but we we've been held back so long church as children of god glory be to god amen time is filled with swift transition right from the beginning of time it happened so quick it was so quick for man to lose that innocence and prettiest and and now he knows he has a sense of danger he knows now he's naked he knows about evil right a word of innocence and purity changed so quick praise the lord so quick so quick time is filled with swift transition one of these days will not be here this time will pass praise the lord that's the reason why no matter what you're going through just hold to god's unchanging hands because it will pass and it will pass so quick it will pass so quick that you will be looking for the date and time that it did happen are we together oh my praise the lord amen oh my what a time people what a time we can just we can just look forward to that amen if we can we can look forward to that praise the lord and just like i said and brother brown taught about you know he he taught us about uh uh you know how science you know uh the advancement of science uh uh showing you know he was trying to give us a picture you know that everything that science is doing they are copying from what god has already done amen and and that that's what he taught in the message the countdown and he says how man moved from traveling on his legs and then he he got on the hearse and started you know uh traveling with hers to go more faster and then he pulled two of them together and just built a little box and set it behind it praise the lord i believe even before the the the first time maybe it was just rolling them down down you know down uh i mean just like those people in siberia do with the dogs and things they just put a slate there and tie it around the dog sit there and dogs ride them on the snow and all of that and uh and and then and then uh from from that man understand by gathering you know by putting two or more hearses together they could get more power they could go more faster and uh uh so the they picked that knowledge and and they were able to you know put some uh uh uh mechanism together build a vehicle you know and and then when when the vehicle started going from one to another you know uh uh and then they realize that that this i mean they can they can they can increase the speed but but if they put more mechanism together there will not be space down here for that speed to go so they have to carry up a little bit sure so they went to the airplane age and they realized oh my we can get up there in the cloud now we can gather more speed and go astronaut praise the lord amen we can gather more speed and go astronaut yes praise the lord now so we see you we see all of that and uh uh i mean uh uh so he he's showing us that you know that that uh just like he said or all we know is his feet yeah and minds that's that's what we know in this uh in this dimension praise the lord in this dimension that we live right but if you go up we know that we on earth here we we we eliminated three dimensions you know not limited but i mean they have space three dimensions the fourth dimension is uh is beyond our scene and uh uh but in in that dimension also there's a speed yeah i mean and uh and and and and the fifth dimension has more speed than the fourth dimension as you break the range of dimensions your speed goes more faster praise the lord but it's it's this this is a beautiful thing here oh my goodness i was trying to keep a little bit of time here for us to uh just prayed and thanked the lord before we go home tonight amen let me read this uh taking god at his word let me read this and then maybe uh uh if we can get through this then we will we will find a little place here to pray lord be to god amen if there's one thing that we must be grateful for is that god has caught us on this wagon young people this is not a church no it's not a church making this is a move of god this is a move of god and with the move of god you cannot choose to move as you want you have to catch up or s is going to pass you back you cannot choose to move as you want no you got to catch up or else it will just pass you by praise the lord oh you you can see it in your prayer life you can see it in the reading of the word if you if if god is blessing you you are enjoying uh uh the presence of his word and and and and you just you know you just be careless with it it will just pass you by and before you realize you are struggling to even find time to read you are struggling uh uh oh i'm so busy and it have just gone praise the lord many people has make this a church they have made this uh you know uh uh uh you know we call it the message they have make it whatever they choose to make it that's why many of them are standing by the wrong side they are just looking wow i wasted my years sure oh my goodness i wasted all of my years it passed them by right now these people one time that i mean they were so zealous they with their family they defended this message because they were they were in the move at the time but somewhere in the alive they stood and turned around and the wagon just came in past and when they can no longer kesha this is i don't believe that i think it made me to look like an old lady can you believe your sins being a young girl i never even wore paints i never even used use makeup it's not your making it's not your desire it's not your desire it's not your making and that is the same way you cannot be on a moving vehicle and refuse to move [Music] you sit in that in a vehicle and say i'm not going anywhere i'm not going anywhere how many people do that glory be to god i love to preach these things for the young people you old-timers oh praise the lord you love the lord jesus let's say thank you jesus thank you jesus amen praise the lord [Music] praise the lord we are a privileged people amen brethren says here in taking god at his word he says that's what the matter today we are teaching theology and little all baby petty things i mean we we want to be right we struggle to be right sure that's that's that's our problem we struggle to be we want to pronounce things right we want to make sure it's arrived brother branham said it we we struggle for all of that sure it's not a bad thing but it's not the real thing it's not a bad thing but it's not the real thing praise the lord they keep referring back to what movie said and what a b samson said they were good men but they are they have lived their lives 150 years ago the greatest signs in the world listen to what brother branham said he's talking to the church here he says we we we i mean we we capitalize on theology i was baptized in jesus name and and you know i believe there is one god and and and we struggle with all of these things sure because that's what we make religion praise the lord he says they refer back to movie and they refer back to to all of these great men praise the lord now it's bringing us it's bringing us into context because we refer back to brother branham we have to say brother branham say sure praise the lord and because we said brother branham says and we can be able to to to get on the computer and gather a bunch of quotes on what he said on the same thing we think now we are preaching we have a bunch of indoor and preachers even in this message take us out of a message pupate we don't have a message to preach take us out of a message preach it poop it we don't have message to preach and then he says well there are denominations god called us to preach to the bride brother man i'm saying here glory be to god amen he says and they keep referring back to what modi said and to what a b samsung said they were great men but they have lived their days 150 years the greatest science in the world was a french scientist said if a man ever made at a terrific speed 20 miles an hour gravity would take him off the earth why how nonsense science has got him glory 900 900 signs has got him going 900 miles an hour now in a jet plane or something like that and still taking him further the problem of referring to brother branham is that as a prophet says see you he preached a message for a future generation praise the lord amen and that's the reason why if you cannot be able to get into the message and be able to address your present time and be able to address your your your life situation and your house situation sure praise the lord glory be to god praise the lord if a man ever made a terrific speed oh when their scientists said it it was looking like a brilliant idea right now but now better balances they have more speed like that right praise the lord you have more speed like that even the jet plane goes more speed like that but it still struggle with gravity yes it is still on a gravitational influence and the problems the power got to keep balancing it in the air oh my goodness praise the lord oh my are we together amen he never referred back to them moldy harder had a message of his day samson calvin all the rest of them had it of the evening but this is another day sure praise the lord amen they were going on oscar we are a jack plane moving barbarian is helping us to see that what god is doing in our age or god has started to do will be a move that would be so fast that if you get you just get stuck to the balkan tapes it will leave you behind it has to affect your life yes sir praise the lord for you to enjoy this move of god it has to affect your life every day every day every day it has to affect your life or s is going to leave you behind there are people that have been in this message 40 years 60 years they don't believe it anymore and sometimes we said that me i never leave this mess with me at me i don't know what those people are thinking about they said this very same thing one time in their day we just sit around we just play church we come wednesday night we come sunday you know we can follow the the service online and and and all of that right but if this move don't affect your life if it is not affecting you every day man shall not lay by birth alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of god every day god want to take us a speed father amen in a way we relate to people the way we think in our mind in our desire you want to take us speed further praise the lord am i making you afraid that's what happened when you get on a plane it's taking you to your destination but you get afraid oh my goodness oh my goodness oh man brother brother i tell you on top resource resources of god hanging here before us on top on top we must go beyond church membership on top resources things that we have not talked about yet things that we have not touched things that we have not experienced and we sit around and complain about every every little thing that fly before our eyes if we were in such a speed all of these f-bound things would not bother us if we were in such a speed with the world [Music] these f-bound things will not bother us when i wear the blue necktie tonight we will not bother you praise the lord oh what kind of necktie he wear oh my goodness that's the thing that concerned people in church what does that have to do with your rapture right now amen simple instruction of the word we cannot discipline ourselves today simple instruction of the word come in church pray come on time how can god carry us any father praise the lord before you enter that door it's written right on that door switch your phone off how many times people come you hear their phone going sure again simple instruction then how far can we go with god sure yeah how far can we go with god when there are all of these strains that are still hooking us back all of these trains still hawking us back [Music] we come to church we can't even fight a sleeping devil a sleeping demon trying to rob you of the world you can't even stand up and say satan you are a liar i came to church to worship god i'm going to receive from that word how far can we go with god yeah sure young people we have not even started testing life experience god bless us we he gave us parents that are willing to support us and help us and we still complain [Music] we stay complain we don't even challenge ourselves sure if you complain about your parents that born you what's about the the girl the boy that you're married that you don't even know where they're coming from but i tell you on top resources of god hanging right before us where all things are possible where all things are possible praise the lord i had this little burden on my heart and then i was i was i was working today then and i just i i was just i just i was i was so interrupted because the spirit just couldn't stop feeding my mind praise the lord i was just typing it on my phone okay this code here oh beautiful lord oh god have mercy i feel ashamed of myself but it's beautiful amen i came and sat down i was trying to gather my thoughts together but brother hillary said we sing the song and call the pastor i said brother jordan let's get going i've not even sent my notes out there yet but on top resources i must think that god would love to teach us not spiritual things not spiritual things just common decency [Music] remember brother man says we come to church to be better hustlers better wives better children better neighbors that's what we come to church for it's not to learn all the mysteries but god want us to be better citizens and how god could teach us praise the lord he can even teach you how to make up your bed oh yeah and keep your room clean and give your house a welcoming atmosphere he can teach you that on time resources yeah sure praise the lord notice now brian when we just we just get in the closet and take out the clothes and put it on us and start stepping out to church now let me not go to those places let me stay right here i'm almost out of time i promise that i won't keep you alone tonight oh glory be to god you love the lord tonight amen what a wonderful jesus we serve amen praise the lord see people has made this message thinking that when we just say i you know uh uh i just just you know feed on the word and you know uh uh uh uh resot the word and memorize what brother branham said and you know we just carry ourselves through all of those physical activity yeah that we will have been better i know praise the lord you see the thing about speed and the changing from one dimension to another that's what i was trying to explain to you in the movie of a flight before as the flight gets down the wrong way you hold on to your seat and as it's going up all your stomach is turning in you oh my goodness it's good and then when it gets up when it gets up that's a mystery praise the lord the mystery there is that the speed that the airplane is going on that speed has slowed down for your body to catch up with it that's why when the fly gets up there you feel comfortable you can even get up and go to the bathroom why because your body has caught up with the speed pressure why the plane was down here the speed that it was on to take off that's why they say keep your seatbelt on because your body cannot catch up with that speed a stay in the same atmosphere where you live right oh my goodness oh thank you jesus oh i could break into things tonight i feel like speaking in tongues oh my praise the lord amen that's the reason why one time when you were a sinner there were things that ran through your mind and things that you did and it was just looking like your your your identity i mean you you could live it you could see it you could do it [Music] but when a word that is quick and powerful when the speed of the world came and got ahold of you from the beginning you feel uncomfortable when a preacher preaches you feel uncomfortable because you have just been caught up into that speech [Music] but as you start growing in grace now you can sit down and you can lift your hands up and say praise the lord thank you jesus [Applause] oh my because your body has caught up with the speed now you can look back and say wow is that where i used to be [Music] you look down through the window you say if the lord help
