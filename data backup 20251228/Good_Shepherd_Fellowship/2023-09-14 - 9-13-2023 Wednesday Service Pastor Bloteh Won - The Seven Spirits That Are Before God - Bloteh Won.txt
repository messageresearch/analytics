amen Lord the Lord bless you thank you musicians who will just go to the word and what I want what I want to do tonight I I mean I was so blessed with the service on Sunday I want to preach from my notes amen I don't know if I can be able to do it for my notes on Sunday that's what I want to preach from so we will have to find a place to start from here amen praise the Lord let's take our Bibles just for the scripture reading we will re-first to me to chapter 3. then you have you have your seat and then I'll see if I can I can be able to share with you what were my notes amen praise the Lord I don't really know what if I should do that but uh that's where I am tonight because preaching from my notes could take the rest of the year for me to be able to finish it praise the Lord First Timothy chapter 3 let's read from verse 14. let's read this uh conscious word of the Apostle Paul these things right are on today hoping to come onto the Short Lane well if I tarry long that they are married know how they are altered to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the house of God is the Church of the Living God is the pillow and ground of Truth and with our controversy greed is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit sane of angels preach unto the Gentiles believe on in the word receive up into Glory let's pray father we just write this read these few words because they are your blessed word so God and Lord Jesus we know your word is blessed your word is Anointed we just father Lord uh trust the Lord God the channel will be found tonight for speaking and also Lord God for receiving Lord we just pray that God you will bless bless her the service tonight Lord bless your people as we Fellowship around your world speak to us Lord tonight in a way God father that our soul will be fed we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen you appreciate the service on Sunday well let's give the Lord a hand a praise [Applause] one thing I learned is they are there you learn to thank God for the things that he has done then there is more for him to do amen praise the Lord if we're always waiting for what is done to thank the Lord then we we linger our expectation but if we keep praising him for what he has done and uh and uh it is it is a conscious art to know that he's he's working amen he's doing he's he's doing things presently so the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh so tonight I would just I would just take my time I'm I'm I know uh we we gotta get we gotta get out of the crazy amen we got to make our Prison Break amen we got to make our prison break we were talking about uh uh uh you know getting our ourselves out of this praising the Rapture is going to be our greatest Prison Break amen but until we can go to that I believe that the Lord there with us this weekend greatly with his word praise the Lord I mean we were so capture under the Holy Spirit when the service and I was looking at a time I said oh mine it felt like it was just it was just 30 minutes amen praise the Lord I was reading something during the week I can't remember the name of the person he says uh uh he says no matter how long you preach as long as it's fair as it is fair like 20 minutes he said that is an effective preaching no matter how long you preach praise the Lord you could preach 20 minutes and it feels like four hours amen but if you can hold the people for two three hours and it just feel like 30 minutes then which means that is an effective preaching the Holy Spirit was dealing with the preacher and the Holy Ghost was also dealing with the people praise the Lord amen you know what program says uh you know a successful preaching should be about uh uh 45 minutes he says uh uh 20 million ceremonies almost like an eight hours labor you know well so all of that but we thank the Lord amen so tonight uh we read about that policies the Church of the Living God he says which uh the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillow in the ground of Truth now they're they're pillow and ground of Truth uh something came to my mind I was I was uh meditating Monday morning and reading the scriptures and just and just looking at some of the few things uh uh from my notes in and something came up to me uh uh and then it drew my mind into where I want to go tonight and then uh so I sent I I sent a WhatsApp message to brother because he left her left the house so I dropped it to the airport about four a.m in the morning and then uh so little on I sent him a text message when he told me that he arriving and I shared that with him and there was something from first king about the Tabernacle uh there were two pillows now you can see the pillow of Truth the pillow and ground of Truth so you see where my mind went to pillow because I was looking at those two pillows in the Tabernacle that was that was named after two individuals Jacob and the other person was Boaz they were on the porch of of Solomon Temple they were now holding the building they were just there for faction but yet they gave them two names and uh not only for faction I would also believe that they were there by Divine uh inspiration praise the Lord so that's I I want us to look at that and go and the reason why is because of uh brother Daly spoke to us on Sunday on the Council of the Lord and uh the counsel of the Lord I was I was looking at that from the Greek it means a deep extreme poverty and deep things of God the Deep things of God things hidden amen especially Divine counsel to make deep now so the the counsel of God you know is is uh is is more than just being counseled by a Godly Man it means the full truth of God it means the entirety of of the thoughts of God for our age for our day praise the Lord amen that's the reason why we are taught to run it through from Genesis to Revelation and uh uh and it should be able to come out through the message of the hour uh as as an as an instruction of God so uh uh and then these these two pillows uh let me do something tonight I sent I sent too much information back there for the Wednesday night I send too much information back there for the Wednesday night but uh if I can if I can get into my now Tabernacle pictures Temple pictures oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus if I can get into my temple pictures and uh if you just caught the light off for us thank you okay since I'm that this is not my my style so you can see that I don't have no uh laser light here but this is the Old Testament Tabernacle this is uh the Tabernacle that Moses built okay thank you thank you sir okay this is the Tabernacle that Moses built uh Genesis Exodus 25 this is how it will look you have in the author of sacrifice the lava for watching and then here is the Tabernacle and uh and there is the Tabernacle and then if we just if we can just move to another picture okay so I wrote this down here because a lot of it is there in Leviticus and when I was when I got captured to to the thought I went to to be able to get some images just to to to to be able to capture our mind but the Tabernacle is one of the subject in the Bible that that God took a lot of time in the Book of Leviticus there are a lot of details he gives the measurement okay he gives the measurement now you will see that God taking the time just like the act of Noah Bill he just didn't tell Noah Bill and Ark he give Noah the detail right the measurement for every piece praise the Lord amen and I call into measurement the Tabernacle and the Ark of Noah was the same length according to to measurement now God took a lot of time you know the the structure the furniture the preschool the offering you know everything about the Tabernacle now the reason why he did that is because there are a lot of things from the mind now just imagine now he's telling Moses build this Tabernacle I call him to the vision praise the Lord I call into the vision of the party now Moses saw the pattern but Moses never had the details so God has to come down and give him the details give him the measurement you read The Book of Leviticus you will see cubic and uh you know God just give him every measurement of the Tabernacle so there's there's a reason there's a reason because this Tabernacle is going to go to the temple and and then the temple is going to come to our body as a Dwelling Place of the Living God is going to go to the four square City and is going to go to the millennial Temple and then to the four square City and all of that so uh there's there's one of the reason let's move to our our next picture thank you so uh uh it's kind of a spread out in a little bit it kind of for spread out uh uh the the menorah year is uh the the seven lamps here is the seven line here is the the table or shop red and the golden Altar and then back here the holiest of holy is where the Ark of the Covenant is uh and then we will move to the next one praise the Lord thank you now so there were three three major things that we made now if you look in the book where Paul was talking about uh uh uh him being the master builder okay you realize that Paul named six things he talked If any man bear with gold silver or precious stones then he came to hell and he he and he named uh three other efflict things that can be destroyed by fire he said every man work will be travel fired so Paul took three precious stones of the Old Testament Tabernacle and then he took three other things that were not precious stones that will be destroyed by fire just to be able to make his picture but these were the three uh uh uh pressure uh melters that were used in the Tabernacle now we know that browse represents judgment because it can handle fire and the beautiful thing about it did is that this bride was everything that was on the outside of the Tabernacle everything on the outside of the Tabernacle was Bryce praise the Lord I'm beginning to enjoy every time you see me take up my coat I'm beginning to enjoy amen the Lord has come to my help so the price it was on the outside of the Tabernacle the inside of the Tabernacle was all gold praise the Lord which is deity favor if you really Leviticus every saver was was uh how can I call it everything that was sitting sat in silver everything that was sitting the the legs of the tables were in silver praise the Lord everything that was sitting sat in several yeah praise the Lord so savior represent blood Redemption okay it represents Redemption you know so uh uh God designed it their way you know that will be sitting even even uh the the Old Testament the Redemption money was in silver 30 shakers and as it seemed 30 pieces that Jesus was betrayed for so in Leviticus that was the Redemption money what that money was used for you have to remember that the the first bone Belongs to the Lord amen God claimed all the firstborn after all the firstborn in Egypt were killed all the firstborn Belongs to the Lord now so what if uh if uh if uh if uh a family has a firstborn it belongs to the Lord now if they are first born will come now you have to realize that God traded the Levites for the firstborn because it was on it was not all the first born that was serving in the Tabernacle it was only the Levites right praise the Lord so then the the first born will now redeem you had to come up with a uh 30 pieces of of of of uh save a coin to redeem your firstborn so you you gave them money you gave your first bomb back so that was the Redemption money now where am I going with this let's go now so uh the price was on the outside uh gold was on the inside everything in the Tabernacle was made of gold praise the Lord amen the outside was made of brides it can it can handle the Judgment of God our body you know there is no temptation that comes upon us that we cannot bear that's what the scripture says amen because we are made of brides we can handle the body can handle sickness can handle you know and all of that but inside pressure stones and uh made out of gold and then uh Savor was was also representing Redemption everything was sitting in silver Redemption is a thing that is driving the plan of God Redemption that is the thing that is driving the plan of God Redemption Redemption should be influencing everything we are doing not judgment amen not judgment Redemption blood should be influencing all our decisions I'm going somewhere with you tonight now so uh the next picture that will be that will be the last one here I know I won't get through everything now this is the Temple of Solomon not the Tabernacle the first picture we saw was the tabernacle this is the Temple of Solomon it had little changes they kept the the the the format of the Tabernacle the the Holiness of holy the Ark of the Covenant was stayed here the holy Place uh was uh was still the same and this is the auto call but here in the outer core they put something there which was the porch the porch of of uh of Solomon praise the Lord the push of the Temple of Solomon let me call it the Posh of the Temple of Solomon now Solomon pulls but the temple porch amen then on the porch of uh of the of the temple they had these two pillows they had these two pillows now you have to realize Paul says to the New Testament Church that uh the church is the pillow in the ground of Truth praise the Lord amen I can I can dwell on that and keep us the whole night but I just want to I want to go this is just an introduction we'll come back to it so we are here here uh they have the two pillow one was named ah after Jacob and the other one was named after Boaz am I dwell on that tonight and uh yeah you get a molten seed they have the uh the lavash here and uh which of course also later on it was is being caught by the Jews the Holocaust altar and then outside year there was another thing that was also uh added to Solomon Temple to the temple that was now part of the Tabernacle this was a place of personal storage for the priests that was where they were keeping the uh their things will come to death because just like I said the temple the Tabernacle to the temple to the dwelling place of God our body they all have their representation praise the Lord so it is it is almost like God was aiming to dwell in US but then he started to give us a picture how he would prepared to come and do it in US so the Tabernacle uh the Tabernacle was was the curtains in the Tabernacle was made out of skin the Badgers came you know the different skin was the curtains and different things you know and then uh uh you know well follow up and move to an exhale put it down down the the the the Temple was different they couldn't move the temple it was built it was now built it was now strong it was now established now so this is the thing that caught caught my mind yeah these two pillows here because one is uh Jacob which means Council but but dealer was talking on the Council of God that's what caught my mind that's what brings us to where we are tonight it's called establish in Council and Boaz is strength so God established the Tabernacle in Council and strength praise the Lord so the Tabernacle year is is established in all that's that's the reason why Paul in the New Testament can say is that the Church of the Living God is the Pillar of Truth the pillow and the ground of Truth not only what we believe but what we live and what we speak the scripture say lie now one unto another let your year be yeared and your name because the Church of the Living God the pillow of the the pillow and the ground of Truth so one of that a pillow that was standing there was representing the counsel of God and the other one was representing the strength of God praise the Lord and uh so uh now when you when you come to think about that you come to think about their life like like I said to you I'm trying to to share with you uh some of the things I wrote from the from the services on it is bringing me to a place because as I was looking at uh as I was looking at these two pillows uh uh being established in Council and strength it brought my mind to something uh Isaiah chapter 11 let's read Isaiah chapter 11. let's read Isaiah chapter 11. how how could I forget about this and uh I think you realize that uh the the fans are not blowing tonight praise the Lord the angel of the Lord that Hank around this building help to repair the air condition [Music] ER and we want to thank the Lord for that amen praise the Lord a brand new one was going to cost us close to 20 000 or Plus and for all the works that was going to be done so uh I think the Lord want us to be to be prepared before we we get there but we hope that the Lord will be able to work it amen and uh brother Jordan sent someone over to come and look at the zoning system and all of that and and after he realized everything is working and founding and he was leaving he says well can I just check your acid and see what is going on and I said yeah you you go ahead praise the Lord and uh you know I just I just I was just I was I was sitting back there uh standing a little bit yesterday then I just said Lord if you can just figure this thing out and and save us that money praise the Lord and then he came back he says I think I know what's happening and uh and he was able to work on it and all of that so we hope that it would just hold up praise the Lord amen amen so we want to thank the Lord for that I want to thank the Lord for that did I lost my top Isaiah chapter 11. Isaiah chapter 11. now let's read from verse 1. Isaiah chapter 11. and there shall come forth a roll out of the steam of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his root Jesus was called the root and The Offspring of David so that's what is coming from amen verse 2. and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might now so studying on the Council of the law that was preached to us on the on Sunday that structure caught my mind as I was reading through it that uh yes the prophecy of Jesus Christ and he was going to come with the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of understanding the spirit of counsel the spirit of Might the spirit of knowledge the spirit of the fear of the Lord praise the Lord are we together amen now so uh uh uh uh seeing the other uh this were going to be the uh this was this this was a prophecy of our Lord Jesus and uh this uh and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might now that that also caught my attention the spirit of Might praise the Lord amen now where it got my attention is that you remember we were talking about the word of God Shepherd in a two-edges swore and and we we showed through the scripture and the message brother Branham says that little compartment where there is where blood do not uh temper with there in the heart he says that's where the sold words of men and that's where the word of God goes now the scripture says Lord the Lord thy God with all of your height all of your height your heart not height praise the Lord amen I'm excited amen praise the Lord love the Lord your God with with all of your heart amen yeah if I can't pronounce it let me let me show you I'm talking about the heart and all of your mind all of your soul and all of your strength yeah praise the Lord now as I was looking at that it will it will shock you to know that there's a difference between strength and energy right sure praise the Lord yeah the Bible says he's coming with the spirit of Might he's the Almighty he's releasing himself to you as might when the Bible talks about he that endureth that's where that word from is a strength of God that makes you to endure that makes you to bear the body is weak but the spirit is what willing you don't need energy to come to church you need strength that's why you come from work you are tired but strength gather you right something gathered you and brings you to the house of the Lord praise the Lord so to come under the attitude oh it was a busy day I'm tired and all of that it's it's that's not the mind of Christ that's not the mind of Christ that should not be the attitude of the believer because the spirit of Might comes with the Holy Ghost a quick hits praise the Lord your body is tired but there is a there is a strength that makes you to clap your hands and and and and praise the Lord amen you forgot that you are even tired it picks you up it makes you alive you receive the word of God and then when you get out of it you realize oh wow are we together a lack of Revelation that's what make us tool make excuses of you know what I you know I'm tired you know you you talk about uh I was telling you sorry I went to see uh uh uh brother John Bibi were over to his house the other day I think about Ben Tommy and his family was there on Sunday and uh he's very very you know uh out of physical strength but you can see that his spirit is strong praise the Lord his spirit is strong he's a light and he's uh he's holding to the promise of God he's uh he's confessing his healing I spoke better better Stephen bird today and uh he was waiting to hear from the doctor to be able to understand what was happening he's having having a pain in his lower back and and all of that and but yet his spirit is strong now his daughter is a is a surgeon she was uh you know trying to to advise him to go slow you know especially he have he have an over and out and 10 minutes driving and they were just they were just concerned but you know well he was telling me now yeah maybe I'll be in church on Sunday I said Tony I said no slow down praise the lord we want to have you in church but we want to keep you here longer amen so uh listening to the folks at home and and well but what what what is happening is that uh you know you have we have infirmities in our body but there is a strength that rides us above that amen we're dealing with issues in our life but there is a strength that rides us above that praise the Lord amen I'm just I'm just sharing my my notes with you I've not even started preaching tonight amen first Samuel chapter 15 let's read that first Samuel chapter 15. verse 29 I hope I got the right uh uh scripture for that but the Bible says God was called the strength of Israel he was their strength praise the Lord Jesus told Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness he was the strength of Israel first Samuel chapter 15 verse 29. and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man the strength of Israel is not a man the strength of Israel is not human strength are we together the same God that is the strength of Israel he is our strength that's what we can say I'm strong praise the Lord amen now realize it's not it's not uh you know all of these uh uh uh energy to run from here to to your house to Nino it is it is that inner strength praise the lord we sing the song something keeps holding me in John chapter 3 verse 16 the the same thing is used is called the the strength of Israel but it means the stronghold their strength means their stronghold so the scripture says Lord the Lord thy God with all of your strength foreign praise the lord lord the Lord your God with all of your strength with all of your heart all of your soul all of your mind and uh and all of your strength so we realize here that uh uh my friend is made perfect weakness we deal with that uh Moses said that in Deuteronomy 6 5 love the Lord with all of uh the Lord God Israel is one and you have to love him with your heart your soul your mind and your strength praise the Lord over the Edison might in the New Testament it says strength now so uh as we look at that I'm trying to run through through my notes Here quickly now praise the Lord are we together are we together are you with me tonight have I lost you no no okay so Revelation chapter 1 verse 4. Revelation chapter 1 verse 4. because they have a few minutes I can I can start up here Revelation chapter 1 verse 4. in Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 chapter 3 verse 1 chapter 4 verse 5 and chapter 5 verse 6. the scripture talks about the seventh spirit which are Before the Throne amen it talks about the seventh spirit Revelation chapter 1 verse four let's read that together John to the seventh Church Ages which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and wishes to come and from the seventh Spirit which are before his throne amen Revelation chapter 3 1 if we can go through there too and we can go through that and unto the angel of the church or scientists right these things say he that have the seventh spirit of God Jesus introducing himself to this church age as he that have the seventh spirit of God and their seventh ties I know that work that they are had a name that they are living and they are dead but we are looking at the seventh spirit and you go in the other verses four verse 5 5 Verse 6 you will see there are seven Spirit what is the seventh spirit that's why we want to look at a little bit brother Branham talks about it but uh I want us to uh to just look look here look closely together tonight praise the Lord you love the Lord but I'm in the seventh Church ages he says now the seven spirits that are before God these seven Spirit was represented as the seventh Spirit there will be sent forth for the seven Church ages amen seven spirits before God we could pick up from the Old Testament and pick it out there if we just had time now he referenced us to the Old Testament he never had time to do it but it is you and myself responsibility to go and do it he said we can pick it up from the Old Testament the prophet of God will not make that statement if it was not in that's right praise the Lord now I don't know if I found it or not but the scripture that we read in in Isaiah chapter 11 that speaks about the spirit of wisdom the spirit of knowledge you know the spirit of understanding the spirit of wisdom the spirit of counsel the spirit and if if you if you read from verse 1 to verse 5 you can be able to fit a seven Spirit right in there that that that that is just to give you a clue you go and look for it are we together now but he says we could pick it up from the Old Testament amen if we just had time now in in Hebrew uh uh Siri Hebrew Exposition uh he says here Forerunner has gone before us the Forerunner is gone has for US enter even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek this great Forerunner has gone before us making a way he's become from a spirit now see what brother Branham is going to do now he become from a spirit from the great invisible spirit amen he's going now to make himself tangible he's coming from the great invisible spirit this Forerunner he went ahead of us the Bible says his work are finished from the foundation of the word he went ahead of us he is our Forerunner that's the reason why he's not learning anything new he's not planning anything new he's now his works are finished his owner working on our confession if we can believe it and say it back to him he made it come to pass are we together so he says here he uh uh this great Forerunner has gone before us making a way he's become from a spirit a great Fountain of the rainbow of God who has no beginning no end he was forever God this ray of light went forth it was a red of love that's the main one red he called one of the colors there in the rainbow the next color follow which is blue truthness red means represent love blue represent truth mess follow after there was other colors told their seven perfect colors which is the seventh spirit of God now so he's taking the seven perfect colors representing it as the seventh spirit of God so what what brother Branham is trying to do here that brother Jordan if you would just poke that man picture up of the rainbow now this is uh all of these Google pictures they are not clear but that's fine it gave us an idea it's only to give us an idea amen now so what he's what brother Branham is saying this is the perfect Fountain of God amen this is the perfect Fountain this is the great internal spirit all of these colors came out of this white amen it came out of this pureness this is this is the pureness of God but when it comes through the diamond it breaks out into seven so the seventh spirit is not seven different spirit is one spirit coming true amen with different characteristics are we together are you having an idea so it's not it's not a seven Spirit you you you you you you see it like seven Spirit Before the Throne of God it looks like uh uh uh uh uh it's it's nothing like the Trinity that's that's not what we are we are looking at here we are looking at one invisible Spirit One internal spirit of God now so this picture is up let's stay up let me read this and and and you try try to see what I'm reading through that picture if it would make sense to you amen he says next follow uh uh after that other colors of the seven perfect colors so these are the seven perfect colors no let's stay up these are the seven perfect colors don't don't put the coat up just just leave this picture up let's see if we can we can be able to see the code in that picture the seven perfect colors which is the seventh spirit of God so these Seven Perfect Color coming from this pure light of God amen so which are the seven Spirit meaning that the spirit of God the great internal Spirit when he broke into time it was Christ in David it was Christ in Joseph it was Christ in in all the the the the the the Old Testament character it all comes from this pure fountain but it breaks out to be able to do different work in different dispensations praise the Lord even before we get to a seven Church ages are we together that's that's that's the picture that I want for us to understand why because uh before there was a seven Church ages God allowed the seven perfect colors to be seen in the rainbow praise the Lord before there was a seven Church ages God allowed Jacob to have an inspiration to give Joseph a coat of many colors it was just God releasing a little of himself what he was going to do at the end of time it's now with the opening of the world we can look back and say oh wow that's what a man that shows that you see that uh Jacob put Joseph on a covenant make him a cult out of inspiration he wore the court and to God meet his brothers he never left the court back he wore the court yes sir he was under that Covenant to their eyes it was the father that he just spawned in this boy but in the eyes of God God was keeping him on a covenant yes praise the Lord are we together amen you love the Lord tonight amen just experiencing some dryness in my throat it's okay I have three bottles of water down yes you love the Lord tonight so let's let's just read this quote let's let's read this quote keep looking at that picture foreign Perfect Color which are the seventh spirit of God that went from the great fountain and that great Diamond that Jesus spoke of that great diamond that chapter reflect these colors God was God was made flesh endured Among Us so Robert Brown yet is trying to say is that this great internal spirit coming through this diamond is is is is is is God condescending himself amen is God condescending himself he's coming down and uh and and and and he's he's he's living in eternity in the in the pureness the pure Fountain of God he's coming through time are we together God was made flesh endured among us that he might reflect his goodness and mercy Among Us by gifts and signs and wonders they are all right in these seven colors amen the love of God the mercy of God the nine spiritual gifts are right to you are we together praise the Lord so you see that just how God works that's how the Mighty God works that whole big rainbow have become a teal funny made in the image like man now he's now he's calling Jesus the great big rainbow praise the Lord in Revelation the Bible says the rainbow was around the throne so it was complete in Noah's time it was just a ball it was not complete in Genesis it was just a bull it was just half in Revelation it was a complete story are we together amen the half has not been told yet it is just half that you are seeing half of the story that's what you are seeing there's another half that wait for us beyond the river now so he's calling Jesus the whole big rainbow have become a tear funny Made In the Flesh so all these seven colors was right in this white as long as it was eternity it was just going to be white pure but when he manifested himself in time then he breaks himself into seven colors are we together all the seven Redemptive memes is right here praise the Lord the seven Church ages is right there now he says here the many flesh yet he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet he was a tear funny Moses said I didn't like to see you God hid him in a rock and when he passed by he turned turned his back Moses said it looks like the back of a man that's what come to pass one day down there when Abraham was sitting in a tent we would get to that tonight Abraham when Abraham was sitting in the tent God came up to him in a body of Flesh so in every dispensation he was breaking himself into one of this manifestations praise the Lord so we can take seven colors from here and put seven spirits we can take seven spirits from here and go to Zechariah and put seven eyes the seven out of God that go tour and forth through the Earth we can take seven hours from here and put seven Church ages are we together am I making sense oh I'm just I'm just I'm just it's just all in my head I want it to come out of my head amen I wanted to come out of my head so you can see it praise the Lord amen so the seventh spirit that is Before the Throne of God is not it's not it's not the spirit of The Messengers you know I've heard people preach that you know the spirit of the seven Messengers when all the another is the spirit of Jesus Christ are we together is the spirit of Jesus Christ okay I can take few more minutes here and and then uh we'll find another time to to be able to wrap this up they're in the same uh Hebrew Exposition that seven part two and in there we find that uh yeah you can you can take our our seven seven colors away praise the Lord are we together you love the Lord tonight amen are you seeing the picture praise the Lord because the the Bible says that the spirit of strength the spirit of Might will come we come upon us that's what we need to wait on the Promises of God see all of those men they had to wait Abraham 25 years he was not doing it by himself job going through try your embarks all over his body he was not doing it by himself God put a spirit of strength on him for you to go through loudisha age God will have to anoint you with an enduring power there is no way you can fake it right you can fake it amen there is no emotion that you can express let the trial come let us let the squeeze come you you hear all of those things right God has to get a hold of you amen all you can say Lord give Lord anoint me with the spirit of it all comes it's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost let us not get wide in our mind and start to imagine different things we're talking about the same thing is the Holy Ghost are we together because you you you you you now begin to appreciate why the whole counsel of God was given to the church because the whole counsel of God is the strength of Israel he's the strength of Israel we will now be uphold we will not have that strength if we will take part of the word and leave part of the word the scripture says they overcame the blood of the Lamb which is the word of God the bleeding word and their testimony of that same word are you getting the picture amen are you getting the picture that's what I want I want us to see tonight as as long as the Holy Ghost make you to see the picture the preacher don't have any work to do amen that's when he put the preacher at the side and then he starts dealing with you Hebrew chapter 7 here and in there we find out that he had seven varieties of spirit is that right the Bible said in in Revelation that the seven spirits Before the Throne of God the seven manifold the seven spirits we find out there's seven colors there's seven Church ages seven is complete and God was complete in seven spirit and those seven spirits were perfect you see that's the reason why I said you can take the rainbow and just pull seven Church agents you can take the ring ball and just pull seven Church edges seven messenger coming out from God are we together sometimes people take these things and run it and then they just they just run it all over the place and can't carry the complete picture that's what I'm saying out of that trying to repeat myself the first was the colored red perfect love Redemption and how if we had time to give those colors ensure that each one of those colors represented God's purity each one of those color came from the white it represent God's purity amen each of those Messengers to their age he was they were God meant for the age in their age that was the fullness of God for their age are we together it was It was kind of for bad for your mind I mean there's something running through my mind but let me stay with this I'm running out of time amen let me just stay with this but I won't hold yourself together the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet and if we have time and those colors show that each one of those color represented God's Purity amen those colors these seven natural colors those colors represent the purity of God those callers represent the motive the attitude you see he's bringing all of that all he's he's bringing it for us to realize that it was it was God's attributes praise the Lord it was something from the father they represented seventh Church ages seven stars seven angels the Bible says the seven Idols of the Lord that is running to and forth throughout the Earth I remember one time uh uh one young brother asked me this is he says brother one God is one but why the Bible say you have seven spirits praise the Lord it's I mean this this is just enough to be able to to understand go ahead that is not three pressing on the throne it's not three personalities of God but it's one God manifesting in three offices the same God that could break himself in the upper room and and in in in in in in in a form of fire and then he could he could light over the head of 120 percent praise the Lord amen another one that 120 person did not finish God in the house of kolena he broke himself again to all that were in the house of Colina that received the Holy Ghost they never talk all of God the ones that believe and were baptized he broke himself again praise the Lord as he filled the house they never finished God there was this promise is unto you to your children and to many as the Lord Our God shall cause every time God calls call Wong he breaks himself upon them praise the Lord amen that's the reason why the Bible says Jesus never taught it rubbery he never robbed God if God breaks himself into all into all the Believers that have God you didn't Rob him of anything right praise the Lord is because you have a portion and he still is the fullness praise the Lord Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight you love the Lord tonight amen what an awesome God we self what a wonderful girl we have praise the Lord he's the inexhaustible fountain what a God we serve what a mighty God we self amen what a mighty God we serve you love him tonight let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] he's a mighty God okay he's a mighty God and all of those things we have with us praise the Lord he comes with all of those things we can read on and on and on I want to keep I want to keep this for the the next part of the service as I just try to to wrap up year for tonight you know when you you you you just you look at all of these things and you know a a kind of grabbed your mind do you know that seven times in the New Testament the Bible says you are the temple of God seven times the Apostle Paul now so what God gave to Moses as a vision God revealed to Moses as a vision praise the Lord Solomon got it as an inspiration he got it as an inspiration according to the scripture David David you you remember David was the one that was having a desire to build the Lord a house so David paid for everything he paid for everything Solomon only followed the instruction and the inspiration of his father but David paid for everything everything that did that Solomon God was all from the benefit of the relationship that David had with all of the kings around him are we together that's why Solomon had a golden age he did not have to fight for nothing the work was already done and that is the same with you and myself the work is already done everything is painful praise the Lord everything is paid for we just need to bring the materials together follow the instruction follow the blueprint and put things in their place and then we enjoy the blessings of the lord we enjoy the presence of God are we together you love the Lord tonight I think I can I can close with that if if amen you love the Lord okay okay I know I know what's what's going on I thought I was lost a little bit but I think I know what's going on but a one okay so let's just do this let's just do this together tonight and uh and and bring this meeting to a close uh get you out of year by nine Teddy like I said seven times seven times the scripture declared ye are the temple of God so like I said uh uh Moses got the Divine Moses got the Oracle he got the counsel of God for the Tabernacle amen he got the counsel of God for the Tabernacle everything that Solomon by inspiration added to the temple it did not contradict the original pattern right yeah you can say while the Tabernacle was this and Solomon why did he put her uh uh uh those two pillows it was not in the original Tabernacle you have to realize that God a revelation like the prophet talk about progressive revelation he said I'll not change one of my Doctrine the Holy Ghost progress as the same way he deal with us just like we grow naturally we grow spiritually in better understanding are we together so when Solomon honor inspiration when he put the two pillows and that's the reason why he had the inspiration to name them he's trying to he's trying to say when you come to the top to to the temple when you approach the temple you see Jacob and Boaz what you understand that this Temple is established in the council and the strength of the Lord that's all he was saying that the statement he was making it is not contrary to what Moses did he was just making a boss statement that this this Temple you are saying it is established in the council and the strength of the Lord Paul says the house of God the Church of the Living God is the pillow and ground of Truth it does just the same thing it's not rocket science it's the same thing it's inspiration of the Almighty are we together first Corinthians chapter three First Corinthians chapter three reading for verse nine let's read together all the scripture that will come on the board that's that's that's how we're in the service tonight amen let's just read it together read it claim it possess it amen as a word of God don't be afraid of reading it read it for we are laborers together with God ye are God s that's right next verse I called him Chris which is giving unto me as a wise Master building I have laid the foundation and another building there on and let every man take heed how he build a little bit and we have gone over there before you have to make sure not not you don't do things to impress God make sure it's according tool the counsel of God if you will get God involved make sure you are bringing it back to the word not to your feelings not to your mind not known not to your culture it must come back toward the word the foundation has already been laid are we together next verse for all the foundation can no man lay that is laid which is that's the foundation is already laid Yeah it must come back the next verse now if any man build a palm-based foundation gold silver precious stone wool Health now let's stop there now you see so uh you we we can take precious stones in a place of Bryce amen because when we were when we were looking at the Tabernacle we saw the three elements that was made it was gold silver and Bryce is God that gave gold is is God that gives sivir is God that gave precious stones are we together now the other three wood comes from the tree that God made when you cut it down is dead that way you get wood from so the other three the amendment three are gone given and the other three are man-made that's what Paul wants us to pay attention to If any man there upon this Foundation let's go to the next verse we are closing praise the Lord you know this is beautiful you started reading slowly just like you turn in the volume I felt like it somebody was turning the volume I think it's almighty God I was trying to turn the volume is the word of the law let's read it let's not be afraid of it here's a blessing the scripture says when we read the word amen so that's what he says let's go to the next verse we're closing here if any man works and bye he shall receive a reward the next word If any man Works shall be burned he shall suffer but he's shall be saved yet so yes so as by fire Paul says some work out of strife he said it there also in the scripture some work out of strife some work out of impression some work out a competition some work out of you know whatever it is all of those things are men's work praise the Lord now if if if we are working out of division or working at a Strife or trying to have the biggest church in Minneapolis you know we got we got to make this happen you know we gotta show that and you and you're doing all of that that's what he's talking about there if it is just to have the big church or just to to impress or you you get competition in your mind or you get uh whatever it is money or firm or whatever it is that would be burned it cannot it cannot stand the test of time is going to be burned praise the Lord he says the man work is going to be burned he's going to suffer loss there is no reward for impressing God amen but he himself will be safe if he's also travel if he's having the Holy Ghost praise the Lord are we together amen if he's having the Holy Ghost his work I mean is is going to be burned he will not have a reward for that but he himself will be safe yes so as by fire yet so as by fire what is just it's just online he will be saved if he has the Holy Ghost he will be saved if he's born again so you say brother one a man born again can he uh you know do something that is not of God yes of course yes yes definitely yes he can do it yes he can do it in a message uh uh enticing Spirit you go over in a book of of first king chapter 13 brother Branham use that he used that scripture you remember that young prophet that was Goring and the Lord told him don't turn around don't drink water and then there are another all the prophet came to him and said the Lord told me you know God did not slay the old prophet ghostly the young Prophet yeah amen he came back to the all-profit house and he ate and and the old Prophet stood up and prophesied to him yeah that you have disobeyed the word of the Lord and your carcass the same man that said God told me to come back praise the Lord now so you see all of those things all of those things uh we must stay in the counsel of the Lord we must stay under the pillow in the ground of Truth amen let's let's continue to read that this is just only the first scripture and then I'm preaching I'm supposed to be reading let's go to the next verse amen yeah the temple of God and the spirit of God dwell it in you first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 now you will just take one verse here chapter 6 verse 19. what knowing that that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which of God and ye are not you are not your own your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost coming down from the Tabernacle the temple Jesus said destroy this temple in three days I will raise

next verse second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16. second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16. number two and the two shall be one flesh is that uh Second Corinthians no this is Second Corinthian second
