========================================

therefore it is a paradox constantly it's a mystery how that god does that we look at it so much until it becomes so common we look over the top of it and that's what's the matter with we pentecostal people we have seen god perform so many paradoxes so it becomes just occasionally that we even think of it if we would only stop a minute and consider god is everywhere god is is performing in his old time pieces clicking right around till finally she'll go come out into eternity because god has promised it to do that now we know that there is paradox now back in the days of noah before the rain come and the flood it was quite a a hard thing for noah and that great intellectual age that he lived in to try to tell people by a word of god that it was going to rain now it would be uh no doubt that it didn't meet the the qualification of their scientific research there was no rain in the skies but you see noah said there would be rain because that god said there would be rain and noah by faith before the rain ever come he said it would be there that's the reason we say the same thing that they say why jesus they said he was coming a long time ago hundreds of years ago they claimed he was coming the apostles said so maybe their generation that doesn't stop it a bit we still know he's coming how's it gonna be i don't know but god will send him he promised to and i know he'll be here now noah could only say god said so but you see then after all it did not meet their scientific approval in that day but when the time come for the word to be fulfilled it rained just the same that was quite a paradox in that day to think that rain could come out of the sky where there is no rain but if god is stuck at his word he can perform a make a paradox he can perform a miracle and any man is born of that same spirit that performs miracles why it's the easy thing for him to believe miracles because he's part of god a son and daughter of god not by denomination not by a creed not by handshake but by birth that you have died to your own intellect and been born of the spirit of god and you are a paradox yourself how that you can change from death and for life how your innermost being is a new creation in christ jesus it's a paradox god speaks his word his children believes it and god the science cannot prove how it can be done they know nothing about it but the children believe it anyhow and then god performs a paradox makes it so makes it so because his word that spoke the world into existence can break can make every word that he ever promised come to pass that's why abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was fully persuaded that he was able to perform and to keep what he said he would do he staggered not the promise of god being 100 years old and sarah 90 to have this baby because he know that god could perform and may have a paradox to happen on something a miracle to take place and he did it the hebrew children now how would you make scientists believe today that a man could go into a furnace or i would be afraid to say how many fahrenheit's hot it was but it could go into that a furnace back there in the book of daniel and stay in that furnace until the they thought that he was all burnt down to ashes which even the man the great uh army uh soldiers great husky man that moved out there to to throw them in the furnace there was a man that went in there perished by the intense heat of the furnace against them and they fell into the furnace and was down in there for all this time and come out without even a smell barrel god performing a miracle that was a genuine paradox of the keeping power of god against any enemy when a man is ready to admit god is true and god keeps his word and honors those who believe in him certainly i believe in a paradox joshua the great lawyer i just read about a few moments ago in the book of joshua the 10th chapter notice joshua was a a friend and a god he was a soldier a general and he come up under the influence of a prophet moses moses had been taken away and joshua was commanded to take the children into the promised land and to glide the lands the children's disobedience and moses is a way to be old and so joshua had come up to take the place of moses to be god's general and the lord spoke to him and said as i was with moses so i be with you that's good enough for joshua said be strong and very courageous for the lord thy god is with thee world our voice and every place the souls of your foot shall set that i have given you then footprints meant possession the whole land belonged to it was a promise way before it ever happened when he come down there with caleb and the other spies and they seen the great opposition the amalekites and and the persianites and high tides and so forth all fenced in and there jericho could run a chariot race on top of the of the place and great strong man that some of the uh the unbelieving among them said well we look like grasshoppers to the side of but caleb said in joshua we are more than able to take it why god said i have given you this land no matter what the opposition is how great and the the difficults look yet god said it was theirs oh god is able to keep what he has promised it was a paradox to see a handful of people unarmed almost for what they picked up on the deserts and where they chased other men probably with such as old rakes and sauls and whatever they get a hold of go in there and beat those men down that were giants it was a paradox god knew that they had courage to do it and he given the promise and they went in and performed exactly what god promised them to do one day in the heat of the battle when the kings had made a great covenant among themselves and had come down against joshua and the children of israel that god had promised in the land and uh he had routed the enemy and they were in the woods and hills scattered out through the wilderness there joshua looked and he seen the sun going down he knew if those armies got a chance to replace themselves and and come back again adding well he knew that he'd have twice as hard a time and would probably lose more man if they ever got a place to unite themselves together those were ministers that's where we failed that's where the church failed when this revival that we just had this great campaigns has started across the country when we had the enemy running we should kept him off the run but the thing of it is we have to go off this on tantrums and so forth and big sprees of building and making more for our groups and so forth and there you come and separating ourselves from the word and taking this and building up some more organizations and starting something else that's why it always goes that's the way it was in the days of luther wesley moody sinking fendi knox calvin all the way down it's been the same way they get their eyes off of the the revival and get it onto what they can do for themselves but you know what happened joshua wasn't that type of a man he needed time the sun was going down and he if the enemy ever built up the revive was almost at the end of the close of it like we stand today he knew if he ever waited until the enemy got a 45 against him it would be hard to win that battle you know what it is he know that god promised that land he needed more time so the sun was about to go down and he said son stand still [Applause] hey man a paradox indeed that sun stood there for a full day and never moved and the moon over agile never moved also because the bible said here that it was never a time before or since like it that god hearkened to a voice of a man he said oh if i know we just lived in that day jesus said in saint mark 11 24 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you have what you said still facing the paradox on down into our age sure that moon and sun stood still until joshua fought his way through with israel and advanced themselves upon their enemy why it was in the line of duty now if you go out here and say mountain move i'll show you i can do it it won't do it but if it's in the line of duty when god's commanded you to do something like he said to moses why cry to me speak to the children people days crying all that lord what next what next just speak and go forward right god has commissioned us to do something let's do it don't stand around and think about it say how can it happen well this is that makes any difference if god said do it do it anyhow he's still the god of miracles joshua it certainly was a paradox when that son stood still i was talking to a scientist in school one time and uh a bible teacher and he said i referred this to him i said i thought you said that the uh the earth turned around see and uh the sun stood still i said what about the bible you just tell us was the truth god joshua said son stand still well he couldn't answer that one but the sun did stand still didn't make any move you see that's actually the earth stop and now you say he said the earth stopped i said you said if the earth stopped it lost its gravitation everybody would fall off of it now what are you going to do it's a paradox amen [Applause] god stop the entire earth from turning amen because a man said stand still there until i fight this battle through that's a paradox amen it was a paradox when all the armies of israel was backed up in a corner and they were afraid of some great big a prehistoric like giant standing there by the name of goliath and there the armies of israel well trained saul uh head and shoulders above the rest of his army and shaking in these boots nobody was able to meet the challenge of this man of that day there come a little ruddy looking stoop shoulder kid up weighing about 90 pounds with a piece of sheepskin draped around him like that he said shame on this army of the living god stand here let that uncircumcised philistine defile the armies of the living god when the word come to saul saul said you're nothing but a youth and he's a warrior from his youth and you're a kid and look what he is why you couldn't go against him but what did he take he never took a spear he never took a sword but he took a sling shot and only one place could hit that giant that was right in the forehead where his armor dropped down over his face to hide his eyes and that rock at a long distance from that 14-foot needle spear he had in his hand would go all out as long as it was could have picked up a little david and done anything to him he hung him in the tree as he threatened to let the birds eat his carcass but what happened there was a paradox when god took a ruddy little man that wasn't very much to look at him not even a trained soldier just a kid that had faith in him and put the whole country to shame how did it about chaos and he still caught the night of the paradox just the same as he was and he put the whole army to ride they saw that and begin to run and take off because if they seen that in that little fellow was a faith in a god who could change all nature do anything he wanted to do when man would believe his word certainly i believe it was a paradox moses a great military man who tried to deliver israel and didn't do it he wanted to destroy the egyptians he destroyed one man and he got in trouble over doing it in his own will but then he took a stick an old dry stick off of the desert and threw a hole on me but that ain't apparent i don't know why when he struck that stick over the sea and called for the sea to close and he drowned each of a whole nation at one time by a stick in his hand it was a paradox how he led israel through the wilderness and for 40 years and when they come out there wasn't a feeble person among them that's a paradox yes sir what a great man it was what god did for him because he believed god it was a paradox yes sir it was a paradox when god chose one little man by the name of micah before 400 well-trained prophets of israel because this man was willing to stay with the word of god when all opposition was against him when the 400 said by go on up he said to ahab and jehoshaphat growing up the lord is with you we just got the revelation the lord is with you go up you'll push them come off of our land because it's ours god gave it to us joshua divided up the lands and this belongs to us and there's the philistines up there eating corn off of our fields why it's no more than reason our revelation is right then how god chose a little man like micah that couldn't even get into the association but he come up there with the word of the lord and he said why but i seen israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd there was a paradox how god would stand a little bitty unnoticed fella out there in the midst of a whole great big 400 group of prophets of israelite prophets jewish prophets standing there prophesying falsely how did micah know he was right because he was right with the word elijah said the same thing would happen how could he bless what god had cursed it was a paradox but god made it come to pass certainly one is a paradox when a little bitty looking boy with seven little locks of hair hanging down his head maybe a bull ribbon in it for all i know like a little bitty his name was samson and when a line about a 500 pound maybe lying rory come against him and he took his hands and tore it out apart man watch what happened to the spirit of the lord come on in first that's what causes the paradise that's what a paradox like that would set this arena of fire tonight for the glory of god if the lord can be permitted to come upon the people a paradox indeed yes when samson slew that line with his bare hands pulled him apart a little bitty sort of a boy with seven little locks of hair hanging down his back he was a paradox when he took the jawbone of that mule and beat in a thousand philistines heads when that big helmets the big coats of nail on brass weighing probably 100 pounds or close to it big shields and so forth spears well-trained man and a helmet about an inch and a half thick out of brass come down and turn up just their faces and sampson stood there with this jawbone of the mule been laying out there maybe for 40 50 years on the desert dry or one lick against a piece of steel like that would have shattered it into a million pieces but he stood there that's the only thing he was commissioned to fight and to take that country out he was raised up and born to save that nation [Applause] the pentecostal church could only realize what you're here for what's your representation why did you come out of these things to be what you are yeah you what he was born for he knew where he stood the thing he had his hand made no difference he stood there and as those philistines come and that powerful liquor that little shrimp standing up on a rock to reach top of their heads when they're afraid to knock one more and one the other and they laid a thousand of them laying dead in there it was a paradox how that used jaw held together it was a paradox how that little piece of brittle bone would break through those instinct helmets of breast and slay those philistines a thousand of men he still stood there within his hand just as good as it was when he picked it up it was a paradox still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same amen has been called to take the word of god god will stand by if he don't be a coward samson could have run but he didn't do it ryan it was a paradox when god called john the baptist the son of a priest out of a great school of priests a great seminary why didn't that which it was customary that man followed the tradition of their fathers why it was a paradox when god took john to the wilderness to tell him what the messiah would be to tell him what the sign of the messiah would be how he would know it instead of going to school to learn what the messiah would be god took him to the wilderness to tell him what the messiah would be it was quite a paradox of them people in that day yes when the virgin birth came on that was a paradox how that god and order to make himself known to man became man how the god the great spirit god to me was before there was even a light there wasn't a meter there wasn't a atom there was a molecule there there wasn't anything and everything was god yes that's how great he is he's from eternity through eternity he always was god he always will be god and how the greatest of all life become a little small a germ in the womb of a woman in order to take his own law to pay the penalty of his law death how god was manifested in the flesh how the great god of heaven changed his strain come from being god to be man through the virgin birth nobody can figure it out science today can't tell you how that virgin birth was but god did it he came no one was able everyone was sexually born like the red one man is the same as the aston no one could help the other ways all in trouble and then god himself came down and was born not of a jew not of a gentile but his blood was god blood comes from the male set in this case it was god god the creator created the blood cell in the womb of mary and build himself a tabernacle at himself come down and lived in it god was in christ reconciling the world the very word christ means the anointed one god in his tallest dwelt in him amen and him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily that was a paradox it staggered people that made you be a man make yourself god it still doesn't but just the same is still the same paradoxes carried on he was god you still god he always will be god yes sir he's the same yesterday today and forever yes sir that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people they can't understand it they don't know what you mean they have belittled it bring it down saying but just because you believe something the devils believe the same thing and tremble it isn't what you believe it's what god has actually done a new birth is a birth it was a new it was a paradox when god brought new life to the human race to rejected his eternal separation to receive in his eternal life you have you're on the same basis that adam and eve was you can take if god put you on anything else it would be unjust to adam and eve each adam and eve tonight's got the right and wrong standing before him you can make your choice you can take god's word or leave god's word you can take god's word or take your denominational creeds about it take your modernistic ideas of what it is you can be born again and fill with the holy ghost or you can be church eyes either one you want to be for me to live is christ hallelujah i believe that that same god that fell on the day of pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with cloven tongues among his people his chair tonight is the same god he was then he is today [Music] i know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotion screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how god does it's the unseen god dwelling in the human heart making yourself visible by vindicating his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever is a paradox on a carpenter's son by the name of jesus of nazareth tuck up five little biscuits and two fish and fed 5 000 people if it is and i want to see somebody do it today i want you to explain to me what kind of an atom he let loose what did he do not only the fish but the fishes growed the fish was scaled the fish was clean the fish was cooked the fish was whatever it was and the bread was planted and grown and all of it bypassed and god turned it from from cooked fish to cook fish he just grown it out they broke it off they throw it out they broke it off they throw it out until they fed 5 000 what does that routine mean break it off grow it out break it off throw it out feed it throw it out that means he's the same yesterday today forever [Music] he's still the better life to any man you can't exhaust his goodness they say we have no need for miracles no need for paradox he's waiting that's his program that's what he is he's the same yesterday forever he's waiting for you to reach up and take your potion are you scared to do it would you rather go down to the river and fish out a fish and try to cook and fry in some kind of hoglar or something or you don't take it the way god has just preached about faith and say jesus the same yesterday forever i clean lord i believe in you place within me the food the strength the faith that i need watch to see what happens with the sincere heart he'll satisfy every hunger he'll do it jesus was a mayor had a paradox when he fed 5 000 people of five fish and and then taking up two basketballs or several basketballs afterwards it was a paradox when a man with feet like i got in yugo [Music] a lake like lake michigan out here when the storms is on and the white caps probably if you was ever there and see how the storms come down they do it yet across galilee there and it almost looked like bail upon the ocean drive when that comes down through them winds terribly and begins to sweep and the white caps pitch that boat until all hopes is gone and upon that sea where they had been roaring from ordering from along about four o'clock in the afternoon i'd say until the last the fourth watch along three or four o'clock in the morning how far had they rolled across the seat and they left him on the other side amen at the fourth watch here he come walking up on the waves that was a paradox how could he make himself light enough how could he step on the waves and step from one wave to the other those big waves coming he go right up over one right down in the other right up over the line without a drop of water on him come walking all the way explaining it to me what was it it was a paradox absolutely it was a paradox when peter who he had never seen in his life his name was simon walked up in the presence of jesus christ because his brother andrew had told him he was the messiah and when jesus looked that man in the face for the first time that he had ever seen him and said your name is simon and you are the son of jonas that's a paradox if it isn't tell me how you did it it was a paradox why because he is the word and the bible said the word of god is sharper than a 2 8 sword and a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart that prove that he was the word amen the same yesterday and forever [Music] [Music] you
