is important is the relationship that that child is having with the parent or they can talk and fellowship and we want to bless you for that and many of the saints that are trusting god for their children and just to know that there is a relationship and there is a fellowship with god they can be able to talk about family things they can be able to talk about things that concern them lord and

honor the faith of your children we love you we appreciate you in jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen amen the lord bless you you can have your seat a little bit here before we get to preaching uh there's a little bit of an echo here uh i love in the door it makes me to sound uh more powerful than i am praise the lord but what can we say about the service on the weekend amen praise the lord let's just give the lord a hand of praise amen praise the lord now you know uh as we as we all know we've been taught uh every birth is a mess but i think this gone weekend birth was was a decent birth amen it was not a mess at all it was a decent birth praise the lord and it's something that i've been looking forward to and uh you know trying it the first time is scary but when you have done it first you are not afraid to do it again amen is one of those things so uh you because you realize that uh uh uh worship is a very is a very important thing yeah you know there are somewhere in the book of jeremiah where the lord told israel you know pretty soon you were here no longer the voice of the bridegroom in need of the voice of the bride and uh and i've always associated there to the spirit of worship being gone away from the church because if you don't have the spirit of worship you can never hear the voice of god you can you can be stuck in the things you think you know you know you can just be stuck in your rituals and your duties and you know all your performance but you know to really be in in fellowship with god you have to worship him praise the lord because he's an object of worship and that's the reason why we were we were made to worship to fellowship with him it's a big part of our fellowship worship so you see when we come and then singing just becomes so dried and the people you know holly can move their hands and and we want to get through the sun service quickly you see the sun leader trying to oh let me just sing the neso and get up from here you know and you know and he just uh let's let's call the pastor quickly then it's then there's a problem right you know then then it's a problem because uh when we take that kind of attitude we grieve the holy spirit you know then you have a preacher that comes behind the pulpit and then he comes and you know uh he's looking for an extra ordinary you know uh revelation and inspiration and and something to pick him up and then now he got to go and create some kind of a thing that would be sensational to the people so it can tickle the people a little bit and all of that and that's why we have all of these things going on because the spirit of worship is going away from the church you know but we want to come and come on an expectation you know where we can sing and we can clap our hands we can feel free to worship the lord and and that's just exactly what we wanted to do last weekend praise the lord amen so we will look forward for the lord to help us as we go along and uh uh you know we will we will be able to stage uh something like that again just a singing night where we can just come and and think and you know just let's just say to the lord praise the lord when we get or to internet there's no preacher there you know there's you know if the preaching is the best part of the service that you you think you love you'll be disappointed when you get on the other side so you better prepare yourself in worship here because it would just be worship there praise the lord so i think uh that was a beautiful thing and uh man what can we say about the choir they pulled out something this weekend let's just clap for ourselves praise the lord amen let's just talk to ourselves praise the lord amen that was wonderful i was wonderful praise the lord and we we look forward to more of that we look forward to more of that in uh trusting to see how the law will will uh you know help us to come from our baby stage to be to be uh teenagers and be to be a mentor group to sing so we thank the lord for that i praise the lord amen and and i think the preacher also did a good job and and we all went home happy enjoying the word of the lord praise the lord amen so let your stand we'll sing one more song and then we uh we will now turn to the preaching of the word [Music] praise the lord there's a song it's a song though [Music] praise the lord there's a song i sent back there that i wanted to that i wanted to practice with it with the church and i never got the time to it's a song that a brother sank and okay i can't find it now i can't find it it's one of those things i'll get home and then i will remember but let's sing one of our keep me centified let's let's try keep me centified keep me sanctified [Music] while the storm cloud gathered [Music] okay keep me sanctified [Music] seems hot [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whatever i [Music] when the storms [Music] is [Music] whatever i see [Music] high [Music] my [Music] when i try so hard [Music] yes whatever i do whatever i see keep me safe [Music] [Music] whatever i do [Music] oh is [Music] he must ever [Music] so [Music] one more time oh yes keep me [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen praise the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians let's take our bibles tonight amen first john chapter 3 first john chapter three that was i was getting ready for for the service this evening go home and and trying to place my thought on the lord and then for some reason i i was i was thinking about uh old friend that that was a good friend to me and then i taught about uh elisha when he says my father my father uh the cherub of israel and the houseman that scripture hit me so hard like it had never hit me before and i started thinking about it as that's i said i said man i mean what was going through he lost your mind when he said that you know so i started i started reading through a little bit and and uh [Music] and then you know sometimes like that then things start to develop in your mind is oh my goodness i've never seen but there are there are some very and uh very interesting thoughts that came to my mind and uh the way i saw the lord kind of for dealing with me on that i never thought about that that way but uh first john chapter three first john chapter three i said i i just said i said well maybe i might need to get back and study that a little bit because it was it was it was becoming interesting amen it will become interesting to look into let's read first john chapter 3 praise the lord it's hard for me to keep these glasses on my face but it looks good when i read with it praise the lord so i'm trying to learn to keep it on my face it's just since i don't know how i look so i took i take it off okay let's just read verse one here beloved what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of god now let's let's read it together this is this is one of these verses that it does not you know it's not fed if you read it alone because it concerns every one of us and uh we all might relate to it in different ways so let's just read verse one uh yeah let's read verse one together i'll read the rest below what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the word nowhere else net because it knew him man okay i read the rest beloved now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that have this hope in him purifying himself even as he is pure amen let us pray father we want to thank you lord the lord god we can we can reckon ourselves with this verse that we have read what manner of love how can we measure it how father that you have bestowed upon us that in a dating age like this we can be called sons and daughters of god father may that just sink in a little bit may i go over the letters of that we have just read may we begin to think about the love that you have bestowed upon us father we thank you we praise you lord we glorify your holy name and dear lord we will just ask that you bless us now in your presence come on garden break your word to us who god speak to us father as only you can we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name amen amen thank you father praise the lord and now so that would be my thought i will speak on tonight what manner of love behold what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that's what i want to talk about tonight because that's that's what is on my mind i pray that the lord will will be able to to uh to bless it now so when you when when you know when you think about this i think uh probably last last uh wednesday i commented a little bit on this because i had it on my mind and it just it just can't go away you know it just can't go away i'm kind of looking at the love of god uh in this way you know uh the scripture says for god so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son you know god brother branham says the expression of god's love you know was for him to give you know when and you know uh it's it's not just you know god so loved the word that he gave that he he uh uh or gave moses the ten commandments or he so loved the word that he spoke from heaven for us to hear his voice you know but uh he so loved the word that uh he came down to associate himself with us you know and and and that is the way i want to look at look at the love of god uh uh a little bit i want to look at it in that direction to the sense the other uh an expression of god's love you know when god loves a people he identify himself with them praise the lord he identify himself with them and to be able to look at the love of god uh uh and and measure it out in the way uh in which that uh he's dealing with us in our personal life in a way that he has there with us throughout the ages the way that god has there with men that's what i want to look at there is a a a a little teaching part that uh that i share with you on uh last uh you know last uh last wednesday and it is that part of verse two where the scripture says beloved now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise the lord now so when you think about uh uh you know john the revelator you think about uh the experience he had on the island of patmos and the revelation the way you know his experience he had with jesus being john the beloved the one that lied on jesus bosom and you know and the close relationship that he had with jesus why our law was here but then to realize that john also had you know uh he had a more closer relationship with jesus when he was thrown on the island of patmos and uh they lock him out there you know uh uh uh you know and and try to put him into a ball in order and all of that that we know and we know how you know that place was uh uh almost like like a desert place the way the true john but to realize that in such a time he will have a relationship with jesus more than in in jesus athlete ministering praise the lord john will come up to an understanding he will he will he will see the uh uh by by the teaching of the holy spirit he will see things concerning the end and then how god will deal with him and and all of that to realize all of that and then and then coming back you know uh from the island of patmos brother branham in one message said it affected john so much you know it affected him so much that when he looked at the church uh i think he spent some time with the church of ephesus you know and and he he remember what the lord jesus you know told them and compare it with some of the experience that he had on the island of patmos you know he didn't have struggle like even if you read a true uh first john second john and you know his last letter you see how he talked he talked more like a mental person he says uh he says young man you have overcome the word because greater is he that is in you you know than he that is in the world you know because i mean he was he was looking from the place of a vision praise the lord he was looking from the place of a vision you know uh you know if uh uh we we we are walking you know by faith and uh and trusting the lord every day you know but when god gives you a vision of of what he's going to do in your life it brings a sense of rest it brings a sense of of realization so it's a little bit of that i'm i'm trying to find a way you know uh uh just to be able to narrow what is in my mind here down to you tonight so what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon us you know if we think about it as uh this lost this church you know and and you will see that throughout all the ages you know when god expresses his love to his people you know he don't he don't he don't leave them alone amen we we we see there in eating uh you know adam and the father were having perfect fellowship you know it was just a perfect fellowship that he had but yet when adam fell and and out of shame he was hiding himself from god you know it was god that came after adam and saying adam adam where are you okay so you think about it now in the sense of what manner of love think about adam saying this now we're not talking about john now john said his own adam said the same thing what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon me yes praise lord that i should be called the son of god think about the story about of the practical son he came back he says uh you know my father sevens are not even eating this kind of a trash that i'm eating down here i'm going to my father i'm going to tell him i want to be one of your seven and when he gets there the father said forget about it boy you'll get the best robe you'll dress this guy up you're giving me a bath here i'm not taking bath you know for for for some while because i can get the smell of him but give him a good bath and put the best rope on him and everything i believe when he sat down to himself he says what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon me right praise the lord and you see when that becomes a revelation to you when you can sit down and and and and draw into yourself and start to see that is it's a love that the father has put upon you you know uh when he when he looks down on you he looks at you with a loving eye now with an angry eye you know if you can if you can see that so that's what i want to go tonight but i want to i want to also go in a way to say that uh just like adam when god uh saw his son feeling and like brother branham said he never sent an angel you know he uh he he show himself out there to adam he appeared to adam amen and even brought a sheepskin to dressing to cover his nakedness praise the lord now so is that is is the way in which that god reveal himself to adam the way that god like like i've always tell people you can never serve god above the way that he has revealed himself to you praise the lord if you know god through a church you will stop at the church praise the lord if you know god uh as a baptist you will just conform to baptist teaching you know god as a matter of this that just where you will stop you will do everything that the matter this or the catholic want you to do praise the lord are we together amen so you see is is that revelation is that revelation that's what jesus said it's upon that i will build my church revelation yes that's what i'm going tonight is that revelation because like brother branham says the word that the word of god can only work for you if you see it you're here people say oh i see it now they've been hearing it they've been reading it [Music] but something has happened oh i see it now that's when the word works for you praise the lord that's when the word works for you now so let's get into this little teaching part of of tonight uh uh hesitation or message whichever way we will call it and uh so uh uh john here is talking about now we are sons of god it does not yet appear what we shall be now if you read through other uh study bibles you will see that uh the same word appear also means reveal that word appear also means manifest amen the manifestation of the sons of god is the appearance of the sons of god the sons of god coming to life the sons of god stepping out the sons of god are revealing themselves we've been held back by denominations increased by the opening of the seals is bringing the sons of god out amen the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god they have always been here right they've been going to school they've been learning trade they they got married but that's that's there's a there's a time something happening praise the lord amen where they can step forward and says i know i'm a child of god it's not that moment that they became child of god they were always sons of god but something happened something happened that's what i want for us to share a little bit tonight now so uh if if you look here uh one of the uh but brian will talk about uh the lamsa bible you know he you make sudden comment on that yeah it says says uh it reads the same uh scripture see how the love of the father is towards us for he have called our sons and made us therefore the world does not know us because he did not know him my beloved now we are sons of god and as yet it have not been revealed what we shall be but we know when we know that when he shall appear we shall see him in his likeness for we shall see him as he is praise the lord amen and uh uh uh another translation used the same thing beloved we we are now children of god and and what we shall be has not yet been manifested we know that if if it is manifested we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise the lord now so watch and see how this is going to happen and and god took that same approach in every age to bring this revelation to his children he took that same approach in every age praise the lord amen take for example trying to create an atmosphere when when when when it's wrapped then i know it's time for me to preach so you got to help me when uh moses was down in egypt he fed a sense of failure right he went in the desert and yeah he met god in the burning bulge praise the lord amen now when he came uh back into egypt the elders of israel struggled to believe him yes amen they struggled to believe him until they started seeing the supernatural praise the lord amen well every time when moses and and and and aaron goes over to uh to uh to meet pharaoh and then when he says uh uh this evening you're going to see frogs and uh when moses get back frogs started going everywhere and it's all over the places it's in the newspaper is on the newspaper it's under the newspaper frogs everywhere so all of those things started building the faith of the people that there is something to what he's saying amen there is something and when he came to the place where uh uh uh under the voice of moses there were darkness in egypt and light and gushing what the people started seeing the creative power of god all that they have heard about elohim all they heard about jehovah they are fit now their feet was gradually being restored in the god of their fathers by seeing his manifestation through a prophet are we together amen it was not just on a reading story now they were seeing the manifestation praise the lord so by seeing that manifestation they were also seeing the revealing of god god was making himself materialized to his people by fulfilling his word praise the lord amen now if what moses said never happened the people were not going to obey by having the passover because the passover came on a direct command gather your house together kill alam for this night you are leaving egypt yes you see god build the fit of the people amen from the first plague to the the plague of death when it when they started yearning christ coming from everywhere whoa the next night every word they started becoming sober praise the lord even the ones that were so doubtful now that was where all the missed multitudes started entering because they are afraid of death praise the lord amen they were not believing the word for what it is but now they were fearing death so they all jumped in there and and started you know we got to get serious moses said we are leaving i thought you said we shouldn't believe forget about i said pass up let's go thank god you didn't die i said pack up don't argue here but but daddy i thought you said was don't make me mad i said get ready let's go praise the lord amen so you see but what what i'm saying is that uh uh uh god started revealing himself restoring the faith of the people amen remember he says i would come down and with mighty hands i would bring them out praise the lord but you see even if he would have come and and and have spoken over egypt the people we're still going to struggle to believe he had to come by bringing the very same runaway prophet amen he had to bring that runner with prophet he had to go back to the fair the very thing that he ran away from confront those very same people that said we'll make you ruler in law over us yeah absolutely praise the lord right that's what was making it hard for one mortal to believe in another malta because now they knew that he he has run away sure praise the lord so every time they will they will argue with moses that's what they would bring up you killed you killed egypt and you ran away you left us here right they always go back to his weakness and say you killed an egyptian and you ran away you left us here what do you want to tell us are we together but that was the love of god the lord that god have for his people the lord that he had for abraham that he told abraham after 400 years i'm going to come down with a mighty hand and i will bring them out i will bring them to this very lane praise the lord amen hallelujah on the road of emails those gentlemen after the resurrection i was i was listening today and listening to that today and there was a beautiful picture that that kind of a play in my mind that day was one of the most beautiful day in the sense that god it shows that god starts working from the morning because the resurrection was from me in the morning it was the very same days he appeared unto the ladies to go and tell my disciples then he met those men in the afternoon then in the evening time he has to meet every one of them it was just it was just so beautiful but you think about it now those disciples they have put their faith in him and believing that this is this is the guy that would bring us out of uh judaism and bring us from under the roman rule and after jesus died they were all looking there you have done something they were looking to see the greatest miracle they thought that when they nailed him on the trade on the cross there was there was something he was going to do their expectation they all stood there in their little corner and watching honor expectation that something was going to happen in the last meeting he would do something but when they saw those roman soldiers taking his body down and joseph one of them asking for the body yeah and the body was wrapped in their mind they were saying really really asking the question have we been deceived really sure right is this a dream we saw this man opening the blind eyes we were just on the road the last time i you know when when that widow with a woman they were taking the ball to bury him right you see such a disappointment that dropped in their spirit praise the lord amen but you see how he show his love to them how he did it not by giving them visions it would have been wonderful sure speaking to them in their dreams but they will wake up from bed and realize that he's dead so how he proved his love by appearing to them praise the lord and then he asked them what what are you guys talking about are you a stranger you don't know what have happened he says what what happened what really happened and as they talk they talk and the bible says and then he begin to open the scripture beginning from moses he expanded the scripture and what was he trying to do he was trying to help them to identify him [Music] he was trying to to associate everything that have happened with the scriptures so they can be able to identify him not just by his uh uh uh uh you know a terrestrial person but to be able to identify him by his word his promises are we together and as he talks he says you have a full slow slow in harding he talked to them he talked and they talk and and and i mean they were they were so captured that he told him about with us for this evening praise the lord amen now see what happened normally in uh uh in in any house not not only the jewish house but in any house i mean no stranger come to your house and then he start breaking bread you break the bread and give to him praise the lord but he realized that he has created an atmosphere that has made those men to be attracted to him they were not attracted to him by everything that he have said praise the lord you see the the word is the bounding power the word is the keeping power the revelation of the word that's what keeps us praise the lord so as uh i mean they were so attracted to him they say about what they set the table and he took the bread [Music] and he broke it it was not it was not in the physical breaking of the brain that the eyes were open [Music] everything that he had said has created the atmosphere that when he broke the bread there was there was a physical witness they could see the scars on his hands praise the lord amen so his appearing he revealing himself open their eyes and the bible says when when they realized it was him he disappeared praise the lord thank god i'll i'm telling you after promise me i can i can challenge you when we get on the other side and ask them they will not tell you to sat down to eat no if they were so hungry they took the broken bread and said let's go let's go and tell the other guys we have seen the lord [Applause] praise the lord what did that do it restored their confidence that was destroyed the confidence that the the that the the the saheedra's counsel and the romans tried to destroy the revealing of the son of man the revealing of christ restored their confidence they were ready to travel mars to go and meet the other ones that were gathered in jerusalem to go and tell tell them that we have seen the lord praise the lord let's look at luke 17 30. that's what i want to get to tonight luke 17 30 is such a such a promise that is a scripture that hangs around what god did in our generation praise the lord now so you have to realize that john with with with the experience that he had you know and for him to say that uh you know it it it does not appear you know what what will be when we see him when he shall appear we will be like him praise the lord amen there's a place where our our terrestrial body will be like his glorified body but even before then there is something that god did in our age and not only our age do you know what what it was for for people like luther and and and calvin and knox and all of those men that were that were under the uh uh the catholic ruled when the church and the state were so strong together what made luther to be at a place uh uh uh uh so empowered with the joshua led by faith just that little verse that was quick into him it was the revealing it was the appearing he saw it he saw it that we cannot be justified by works praise the lord we cannot be justified by works everything that he tried to do praise the lord you see that's that is the place where i i appreciate the portion of uh uh kind of balance that brother uh ben was going this weekend and just like john said everyone that had this hope of being like him of seeing him to be like him he says everyone that has this hope purify themself if that hope is in you you will strive to live right praise the lord you will not take what the preacher said as a license for you to do anything you want to do if that hope is in you to be like him you will strive you will do everything that you know right to do praise the lord tonight i was i was going to talk a little bit on on on babylon because uh there is there is uh a scripture that kind of blew my mind revelation chapter you read revelation chapter 19 there is there is four times where hallelujah and praise and and worship was you know was was expressed after babylon was destroyed after the beast system went down we know fault is the norm of deliverance praise the lord because right from the babylon of nero that spirit has reigned through all ages and it has its influence in every religion praise the lord amen just like after the fall what happened it was there was a mix there was a hybrid now uh uh adam the son of god in the in the same warm of eve now there are two seas it's a seed of the adam the son of god and there is a seed of the serpent because that's why the bible says the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the seed of the serpent so there was there was just like how the the fall came by the mixing of blood that's the way right after the flood there was a mix there was a mix of the approach to god religion and that thing has run all through all through the ages and even down to our age that we are in praise the lord amen unless god set us free he that the son has made free is free in day unless god break us completely loose there is there is a tendency of of trying to hold to something right to prove that you are safe or trying to do something praise the lord and there we need the grace of god to always remind us and always help us now so we know here uh luke 17 30. we it's it's a very common scripture to us the bible says even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise the lord now so if you look at the revealing of the son of man praise the lord now so what in one sense what john was trying to bring to us you have to remember now it was jesus in the midst of the seven golden candle state so it's the revealing of the son of man in the midst of the church ages that is going to give every age its overcoming power an age will never overcome until they see the revealing of the son of man of their day when when luther said that joshua lived by faith it was the revealing of the son of man that he saw of his day the world came alive to him and it helped him to break loose from that roman system praise the lord and that is the love of god [Music] that is the love of god that the father has bestowed upon us praise the lord that we can be called sons of god god's love when he loves you he show himself to you praise the lord and when he loves you he show himself to you he revealed himself he will do things to grab your attention that's the love of god are we together are you grabbing the picture of where i'm where i'm trying to go tonight what matter of love that the father has bestowed upon us praise the lord amen what manner of love that the father have what bestowed upon us he has placed on us yes so god god's love is not is is you know it's it's we we become so so sensitive of our feelings and our emotion but god love is the things that he gave to us praise the lord amen the things that he gave to us the things that he showed us the people he put in our life are we together so we know that this this is a promise from our lord jesus that the son of man will be revealed when it gets in the age word uh uh uh uh the days is rolling down to the same time of sodom and all of that we have this promised word the son of man will be revealed but just like god did in the times and the shadow look at the time of the judges amen israel goes into adult trading and and they are worshiping the gods of the the philistines and the people of the land in order to all of them and god will raise up a george to defend him yes what was that that was god's love to his people yes trying to re trying to remind him that he remembered them he has not forgotten them he will always raise up a man he will always have a witness he will always do something i mean for hashem god to just take a bone and get out there and start breaking the the the combats of those philistines and busting their head just just a bone erase the fate of the people to know that this was god this was the same god that opened the rest heat yes praise the lord for something to raise up the gates and put it on his shoulder even at his death for him to kill more men than the time of his life yes praise the lord are we together what manner of love that the father has bestowed upon us yes that we can be called the children of god praise the lord amen and then at his appearing is is his appearing that that that bring us closer that draw us closer is every time he manifests himself every time he reveals himself he show himself in the situation of your life absolutely that's the thing that changes us that's the thing that makes us more like him praise the lord so you see being like him is it's not a it's a i it's not his physical appearance right every time we see him in his word yes every time we see the promise of his word being fulfilled let me read some few things to you tonight and then we will find a place here to close since i can get away from this we'll take it another time god has a provided way now remember these two words before i leave you brother i'm talking here he says the appearing of christ and the coming of christ is two different things christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power he's appearing in the fullness of his power praise the lord that's the reason why i have this thought in my mind that that every martyr has an opportunity to see god yes amen praise the lord people people experience i mean a terrible accident close to death movement they don't have to be christians or believers but they can testify it had to be god or as i would have died praise the lord god just appeared on the scene and delivered that person in the fullness of his power that's what we experience when we are sick and we get well that's what we experience when we are down and he comes and lifts us up the fullness of his power is his appearance is he revealing himself to us are we together christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power his coming will be afterward his appearing before his coming god be merciful amen let me take another another thought here in in jehovah jairo to realize that as uh time is time is upon us tonight but let me let me take another thought here jehovah 2. now notice at this time of the appearing now of the revealing of the sun now he's talking about abraham abraham and sarah situation now just at a time where the son was going to come isaac was going to be born now notice at this time of the appearing now of the revealing of the sun is going to be revealed when the sun is going to be revealed the sun they don't really recognize his name they know who he is he is elsha their almighty elohim but now we come down to the time of the promised son to be revealed so you see the appearing and the revealing i just use that quote to show you that is it's the same it's the same word amen when he's appearing he's revealing himself praise the lord and then when he make himself known when we see him he put our confidence in his promise yes we can trust the word we know as a promise to the age the revealing of the son of man uh we we we know that that that scripture that that scripture was fulfilled that one man portion of it was fulfilled in the ministry of brother branham praise the lord and that is the thing that that that put our faith in a present tense god because of the things that we have we have seen and we have heard him doing in our age in our day we were not in the meetings but yes so see the truthness coming out of the word the revelation of the word that has come to us is the is the effect of the of the revelation of the word that changed our life so we are becoming more like him not in physical appearance praise the lord by the law for his word that was the harmony that was between the father and the son it's the same harmony that is between the bride and the groom she will do everything that the bridegroom have said she's not going to argue with the word why because she's becoming more like him amen she's becoming more like him sometimes we try to to you know the uh uh uh kind of a picture that and and think that uh uh is in uh you know the uh our physical experience no doubt eleazar told rebecca everything about isaac everything that he could remember all the questions that she had in her physical life she stay her to know him praise the lord so the thought year tonight is that looking at the love of god the love of god to an age amen not a love of god just to a person okay that way that we that we kind of put into our day to day life and things that are happening around us but look beyond that what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon us amen to bring us to the understanding of his word delivering us from trinitarian teaching and all the lies and deception that is out there people are more attracted to church than attracted to the world they can argue about what is in the world and still defend their system that's true what matter of love that the father have bestowed upon us that we can be called the sons of god not because of self-righteousness praise the lord amen we can be called sons of god i can say i'm a son of god not because of my dues and my dawns but because of what god has said in his word and what he has revealed to me what manner of love that the father has bestowed upon us amen praise the lord john they see him talk that in in in his uh gospel he came unto his own his own receive him that but as many that have received him he has given them the power praise the lord amen he has quaking them right to many that have received him i mean you can receive your until you have identified his person you identify that this is not a trinitarian god this is one god that has manifested himself in three offices you have seen it yes sir are we together that's the thing that quicken you is that revelation that's the thing that quaking you the thing that quaking you that open your eyes it's not because you came to the message it's because you have seen the word coming to the message and seeing the word is two different things you can come to the message because you are attracted by the dress code these people they can dress right the people they can live right all of those things can attract you and yet you can see the world but when you see the word when it's quickened to you when he appears to you you know that you'll be like him praise the lord because all you desire is to walk in the light as he is in the light praise the lord you start to say lord your word is a lamb onto my path i take one step and i put that line before me as i walk every day because i want to be like him to be like jesus to be like jesus praise the lord like i said last week you know theologians will look at that scripture and point it to the coming of the lord when he appear in the sky we will be like him praise the lord but we're talking about a bride that should be like her husband absolutely amen we're talking about a bride that should be like a husband she's discovering this guy she's getting to know her likes and his dislike she's stepping into it praise the lord that's how we be like him for we see him as he is in the light of his word that is the bound in power so god did he took that approach in every age when he showed his love to his people his the the the highest expression of god's love to you is for you to see him praise the lord amen it's for you to see him god is not in this texting game praise the lord like brother brooks would say you were snapping on the word you're just you're just taking you know [Laughter] it's his highest expression that's the reason why he became flesh that's why he took on a system element right and he was not even satisfied with the assisting element he had to come in the form of the holy spirit to dwell in you that's how much he warned you to know him how much he wants to you want you to be like him just coming in the form of a man born of a virgin was not enough for him you have to break himself out and we can all have a part of him you cannot you cannot compare that to any material gift you know as as the asian day that we we we are in uh people measure the love of god to uh to substance earthly substance the love of god is the person of jesus christ is the person of jesus christ because that is the satisfying portion when that thing is revealed to you no matter what you're going through it holds it can keep it can strengthen amen that's the satisfying portion what manner of love that the father have been stood upon us that we can be called the sons of god musicians you can come up you can come up praise the lord what might not have love that the father have bestowed upon us that we can know the revelation of the son of man in our dying and we can we can hear about the mysteries of god we can hear these things that uh that i mean they just they blow our mind you know you think about it that's that's what revelation would do to a man revelation would make you too weak [Music] it would just not make you excited it would make you to weep [Music] it makes you to weep when you just think that that a person that a person you know that a man can can love you like this that he can look beyond all of our thoughts [Music] you see when when when when we see the all the challenge and all the confusion in the day in this day and age when people try to to challenge the authority of the world and challenge the authority of the message [Music] and say we are trying to make something you know about a man willing branham or uh they really they they have not seen the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord like like we we say all the time that is the thing that have preserved our life that's the thing we look to to keep our young people young people church cannot keep you it's the love of god that can keep you you you have to see this thing you have to fall in love with faith [Music] jesus said he that loved me will keep my commandments he has trapped his love to keeping his word that is the thing that that changed us that thing that make us more like here let's worship the lord a little bit to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] to be [Music] glory [Music] i want to be like jesus [Music] to be like a true [Music] oh yes i want to be like jesus [Music] [Music] to be like i want to see my jesus oh i want to see my jesus [Music] my [Music] to see [Music] i want to love

can we can all see them listening to the tapes and identify the revealing of the son of man in the ministry of brother branham but until you start to see this very seem revealing the opening of the word in your life until you start seeing christ revealing yourself that you can say it's no longer i that live it but christ i live that it means until you can see the revealing of the son of god in your life the revealing of the word the word is unfalling in your life it's giving you understanding it's controlling your temper [Music] and second sounding your tongues from lies and deceiving [Music] the word is revealing is controlling your thoughts it's purifying your thoughts you are placing things in the hands of the word lord i give this to you and you see the word dealing with hate until you can see that revealing that appearing of the sun every time he appeared it's a it's it's a religion of himself [Music] everything that eliezer told rebecca it just increased the anxiousness for her to see him [Music] the scripture said when she saw isaac in the field she said who is that man because she was so anxious to see isaac she was looking around and tried and pointing every man but when elaiza says that's my law that's that's my lord she took her veil and she covered her face [Music] i believe that was not the first the first and the only man that she pointed to she might have said where is that man at least i said well i don't know him it does not bother her where's that man oh he's the chief carpenter in town that was not the one she was looking for but when she said who is that man he says that's my lord she took up dale and she covered her face it was enough [Music] she has been able to identify the ones that she have heard about [Music] father lord we want to thank you for your love that's what we are focusing on tonight the love that you have loved us the love that you have loved us not only to keep us alive [Music] only to sustain our life through the the epidemic of the coronavirus lord but father lord god and lord we can see your revealing we can see you oh god unfolding yourself opening our understanding teaching us lord helping us to know you

your heart you are ready to abandon yourself in the hands of god's promises [Music] to realize that god's love you you don't look over your shoulder that's the reason that's what the apostle says
