you musicians let's take our Bibles Psalm 105 . let's take our Bible Psalm 105. praise the Lord let's take our Bibles and turn to Psalm 105 tonight praise the Lord Psalm 105 Let's uh let's read from verse 12. oh let's read from verse 16. let's read from verse 16. I just want to use this as a uh scripture reading tonight and then we will go right into what we want to talk about tonight amen okay from verse 16 moreover he called for a farming upon the land god called for the farming upon the land of Egypt he break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a seven whose feet they hurt in filters he was lay in iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him the king sin and lose him even the rulers of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance let us pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that you would take these few words tonight Lord take these words of God in now break it to our hearts so father We Want to Thank You Lord God that we can come together and bring you on the evening sacrifice bless Lord Jesus and even your children that are streaming into the service tonight keep us all in one Accord father Lord and their God and put us aside tonight Lord and bring to us Lord your internal thoughts in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord man as we read over here in uh Psalm chapter 105 uh I taught about this and and stay keeping our thoughts of praising of love but uh you read Genesis account of Joseph being taken to Egypt and you read the account also of his imprisonment sometimes it's hard for us to imagine some of the treatment that he went through so just thinking about this today and I was actually uh going over starting over the message again for the prisoner and then the Herbert Branham saying something and then I remember there was somewhere in the psalm where the Bible described Joseph being in filters of change and lying in ions praise the Lord and I believe that's what David was trying to describe here or the samis was describing when he said uh he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a seven whose feet they hurt in filters he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord try him amen so uh looking at that tonight and then we would drop back a little bit to our top dead of Paul the praise in the Broadband shared down here he said he was bound he was bound by a chains and by felters of love to do the will of God and and that une he was a prisoner he was in the filters of love that in the filters of law he was in the York with Christ he could yoke up with nothing else he was yoke up with him praise the Lord amen now so that's that's what actually I was thinking about to today and as I was uh looking through what we were speaking tonight but what I want to do uh this evening I want to also go back to the book of phalaiman we read the the we read the first verse on uh read the first verse on Sunday morning and then we took our speed from there and we we start heading on but what I wanted us to do is to just to see if the law will give us Grace to just go through this letter that Paul wrote here and uh and then uh in coming days if the law will allowed us to look into the subject we will start to appreciate some of the thoughts that go along because uh uh brother Brandon used the first verse like we did and uh and then he drew their subject of Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ and uh but yet we realize that there's a whole lot here that is in this one chapter book and uh uh a kind of a story of redemption that is right in here you will see as we look into into the the letter year you will realize that uh it holds a story of redemption and uh uh I pray that the Lord will just bless us together so back in the book of phalaimon let's let's look at uh chapter one the only chapter it has verse one just to be able to get a background tonight next week uh uh our services starts from Friday night and there will be no service on Wednesday evening and so we can prepare ourselves for the weekend so we pray that the Lord will just give us a wonderful time in his presence amen praise the Lord Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ and to me to our brother unto faliman our dear beloved and fellow laborer praise the Lord amen so just like uh we we read to you on Sunday Brad Brown says Paul was not uh only using that title or being a prisoner because he was in prison but he was also he was using that just to be able to describe a bigger or a broader spiritual condition that he felt uh uh you know in in his spirit that he was a prisoner what she had a prison of Jesus Christ not a prisoner of Rome uh not a prisoner of what was happening around him but he felt like he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ amen whatever that he was dealing with it was because uh the Lord allotted there to him praise the Lord and uh verse 2 to our beloved our fellow soldiers and to the church in their house grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now you will see here that as as uh as Paul addressed this you have to know when we get into the story the story is uh all about phalaman and his uh runaway slave onesimance but yeah Paul is writing the letter not only to phalaman but he's also writing the letter to the church that was in his house praise the Lord amen and I think there is a reason why the letter that was supposed to be a personal letter is also now addressed to the church one of the reason why is because this runaway slave is now returning back as a brother and he's going to belong to that church praise the Lord amen so even us as uh Parliament I read this letter it was delivered to him he will also have to give it to whoever was the minister whoever was leading the church whether even he was the one that was leading the church now he will now have to read this letter one of the reasons there also was to be able to destroy any form of gossip praise the Lord now we have to remember that Paul himself suffer from a similar situation he had a repetition of one that destroyed the church and when he got saved it was hard for the Believers to receive him praise the Lord it was hard even even when the Lord appeared to ananias and say I'm sending one to you ananias nor in the report of Paul he he spoke back to the angel of the Lord he said Lord you know this man destroyed the church how can you send him to me so Paul realizing the effect when one have an evil report and he sent among the saints praise the Lord amen so what was supposed to be a personal letter to Philemon Paul is now addressing it toward the Church told the church in their house praise the Lord told the church in their house now I emphasize on that as a church in their house because you realize that in Romans 16 5 the Bible also recorded that Paul sent greetings to a group of believers uh uh and and he and he used the likewise greet the church that is in their house amen in the book of First Corinthians Paul also used that same word the churches of Asia salute you aqualia and Priscilla salute you as salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their house praise the Lord and uh in in collusion also uh the the fourth verse Paul also used the same word when he was talking salute the brethrens which are in laodicea and the church which is in his house now I say this just to be able to to give us a little picture here because that's where the church the the gentai church was birth we remember as chapter 10 in the house of Colinas amen why Peter speak this word the Holy Ghost fed upon them so the early church as the Believers spread out and then and the gospel was was going out we realized that this was a common formula of the early church the Bible says they were going from house to house breaking bread praise the Lord amen this our setting of church was not the original setting of church now this will also give us a background when you go back to the book of Deuteronomy you will realize that Moses also instructed the children of Israel how the law of the law must be written on the adult post and how their their children must be taught at home and and it also goes back to to let us to understand and see the value that God puts on the homes of the believer praise the Lord amen the value that God put on the home of the believer the believer if God can give us a Godly home we will have a golly church amen if he can give us a Praying home we will have a Praying church if he can give us a home where the word is having its influence and preeminence we will have that same atmosphere in church praise the Lord Hallelujah and then uh uh uh actually this our setting of the church if you go back to church history after uh uh uh um Constantine and and and uh you know after he Associated himself with the church now you have to realize now Constantine was a big guy he was a a big God in the Roman army and then after he Associated himself with the church there was no way that he would go to the homes of those poor Believers you got to realize that most of the people that was making uh uh uh the the the the church in the book of us the New Testament Church just like this it was in different homes praise the Lord they were praying in John Mark home when Paul was really Peter was released from praising so that that is the formula of the church so we we realized that when Constantine when Rome start taking his influence over the church that was word now a place like this you know where they were Now setting out a place for the Believers to leave their homes and then come over to the church that was worth all out of there was birth where state was now having its influence over the church the state was the one that that that that employed the state uh appointed who can be the bishop over this church who can be the pastor over this church and and and and when a man was appointed to that position then the state pay him praise the Lord amen and and we see those were some of the things that God used the Reformation to break the church from that was what God started the Reformation move to be able to break the church from the grip of the state praise the Lord amen so when Martin Luther came out with uh the message that Josh shall live by faith you know uh every every other group saw him as a rebellion I mean he was he was he was rebelling against the state well it was God it was a move of God to be able to get his church his redeemed people because the church was not the building the church is a people that was called out amen so it was God's move to be able to get his redeemed people from the grip of the state and bring them back under the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord because when Jesus says I will build my church and the gifts of Hell will not Prevail against it he was not talking about a building praise the lord we know that he was talking about a mystical church he was talking about and redeemed people coming on of the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord so that's the formula that's God's formula Church begins at home praise the Lord Church begins at home that's God's formula are we together grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god making mention of being always in my prayers amen hearing of thy love and faith which thou have towards the Lord Jesus and towards his sins praise the Lord now so you have to think about it this way that that phalaiman was he was not just a a common person he was somebody just like uh uh Colinas in a in in the book of Arts those were men of authority those were men there was uh of a higher class for him to be able to have uh uh to be uh uh a slave owner and and also to be at this place so these were people there were there were a part of the ruling government at that time but you can also see that the the grace of God was not just only for the Common People the grace of God also went out and got men of high status amen like like uh uh uh like Nicodemus you think about uh uh uh uh Joseph amateurs that give his grave to Jesus those were men of high classes praise the Lord amen so even even men of high classes can be reached by the grace of God Hallelujah men of high classes can come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ Hallelujah praise the Lord so we see here that Paul is is thanking him he says we have heard of your love we have heard of your faith and uh and and and towards the Lord Jesus and the love and faith that you have towards all the sins of God praise the Lord Hallelujah that the communication of that faith may become effectual but but the acknowledging of of every good things which is in you in Christ Jesus for we have great joy and and consolation in thy love because that the vows of all the sins are refreshed by Thee the bowels of all the sins are refreshed by thee brother praise the Lord Hallelujah now we are coming to a very interesting place in this letter coming to a very interesting place Paul yeah they are commanding parliament of his faith and the love and the testimony that they have heard you know how he's a loving brother and he have opened his home for the Saints to gather there and you know and and all the things that he was doing and being of of a man uh uh of the high class he was also helping the you know the saints that were in need and all of that those were all things that were part of the early church but there is something that is coming here I want for us to watch wherefore though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoy the that which is convenient yet for Love's sake I rather be SD being such and one as Paul the age and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ now Paul used a very important expression here that that's what I want for us to watch as I was reading this I thought that uh this this will be very interesting for us to just read the one chapter together this Wednesday night so I left my notes aside and I said we will just go over it now Paul is saying here I could be born to you I could be bold to you and in my position as an apostle to the Gentile in my position as the one that led you to Christ because he's the one that led uh phaloman to Christ in my position as your pastor I could be born to you to instruct you which means to be direct to dictate to you what I want you to do but I'm not going to do it praise the Lord I'm not going to do it I'm going to allow you to use your faith in Christ and the love that you have for God to make the best judgment in this matter praise the Lord I'm not going to impose to you sometimes many times sometimes that's what and many times that's what the the the the the the Believers expect from the pastor just be direct just tell us what you want us to do praise the Lord but many times if those things are allowed and pray the song then the people comes back and says the man is controlling the man is the he said nikolita and he control the people and tell them what to do no the holy spirit is the one that that is the best amen he's the one that's supposed to deal with us my duty is to be able to preach the word to you to instruct you not to detect to you amen and so that's what Paul is saying here I'm not going to detect to you in this matter I have the right he used some very very smart words here praise the Lord he says we're fall back in verse 8 again though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoying the that which is convenient yet for Love's sake I rather be Siege thee being as and one has Paul the age he's talking about being being aged being older and also a prisoner of Jesus Christi for my son onesimus whom I have begotten in my bounds praise the Lord Hallelujah which in time pass was to be unprofitable but now profitable to be and to me is is very interesting here because onesimos means profitable that's the meaning of his name praise the Lord now so Paul is now saying I'm going to beseech you when it comes to this my son now realizing that phaliman was a convight of Paul definitely now it makes both of them brothers praise the Lord amen he said in time pass he was unprofitable today but now he's profitable today and also to me whom I have sinned again thou therefore receive him that is my own vows praise the Lord receive him as you will receive me praise the Lord that's that's word made flesh we can preach it we can talk about it but when we must experience it amen someone that have hurt you praise the Lord someone that has been ill to you for you to be able to receive him as you will want them to as he will as you will want to be received praise the Lord But realize Paul is living it in the hands of Parliament why because it's a tricky place it's the Rock and the high place if he comes back now let me give you a background in those days if uh if a Slave a slave could work for his freedom praise the Lord he can work and buy his freedom and also out of kindness his master who set him free but if a slave run away he gets on the on the record for wanted so wherever he is in the Roman Empire he could be arrested and he could be praising whether it was honor that condition that he met Paul we don't know praise the Lord but you think about it now he's returning back where there are many other uh uh uh uh people that have slave now so action to him put him in a place where If he if he just let him go you know just allow him to be free what are the other uh uh uh owner of slave or you know going to how high how are they going to behave and then if he comes and and and yet his uh attitude is indifferent to him affected Church praise the Lord amen it will affect the church now so it's a very sensitive area verse two of whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him that is who have retained with me that industrial he might have ministered unto me in the bounds of the Gospel now so Paul is saying I will have kept him with me praise the Lord but I'm sending him back to you which of course there is there's there's a lot of reason there because Paul being a prisoner uh unisimus who have stayed right there with him and uh uh and self him and all of that but it was not going to repair a lot of things because this man herself in phaloman house let's let's take Fatima have boys they they I mean they know they know him they got used to him and now every one of them they are hurt because of what he have done praise the Lord so in one sense keeping him away will not bring a complete healing he has to return back to where he have done the wrong praise the Lord amen you know brother Branham said that's the reason why he said because sin was committed in this body he says that's the reason why the unjust will be raised from the dead and in the body that they commit sin in their body they will be judged amen so Paul yeah wanting the restoration and he wanting the healing not only offer of uh of uh but also to realize that the the strength is going to bring to the church praise the Lord you see sometimes when we have some of these sticky things in church where people are talking about and people are talking about it just people you know this thing you know this thing happen and and those things are happening Church it happened every word but sometimes it takes how the Holy Spirit deals with those things equal strengthen the church praise the Lord how the holy spirit will just collect all the gossip from our mouths and all our personal opinion amen how the holy spirit will just gather all of that and bring us to see the bigger picture bring us to see why he allowed such a thing in the church praise the Lord recently there was something that took place I never thought about it it just came to my mind on the last communion service we had there was a lady that came into the church and I never even saw her at the time I was preaching I think she came in just at the time of the communion I never saw her so uh uh right right uh in in seven the communion you know uh you know well I mean we served the communion and everything but what happened was after that I called I called the Deacon in the office and we were talking about it and uh and we spoke about it a little bit so I was I was instructing him I was instructing him to to uh to get the lady uh or get one of the the elder sister to be able to to talk to the lady uh uh why the service was going on so after the Deacon left the office when I closed the door it was just almost like you know the Lord just brought Simon house with the lady that came to wash Jesus feet I was sitting right in the office there it just that just hit me because I know in myself in my own self I know how I would deal with it you know my I felt like my Approach was a little bit rough and the Lord just hit me with that so I stepped out quickly and I called brother uh called the the Deacon brother and I said just just leave it let's leave it let's leave it let's talk about it after just just leave it and now so I sat in the office I just prayed I said Lord uh uh you know forgive me for the way I taught thinking about this and just just uh we just gave everything to you and uh you know and then after this after the service I mean the talk just stayed on my mind for the rest of the evening I was just I was just saying to myself I wonder why the Lord allowed this because normally the Deacon will call the person if if they are a stranger and talk to them and uh you know when I when when I used to be radical I would even refuse the person right in the communion you know and I saw I was just I was just thinking about it all through the night I said Lord I wonder why you allow this am I never know praise the Lord and uh [Music] you know so it's it's just one of those things it's just one of those things the lord gave us gifts he gave us officers and he gave us his word the prophecy you know how to handle those things you have given Church order you are giving church discipline but sometimes when when those kind of a situation happen like I've always said uh sometimes if the law brings people you know that that is not up to our dressing standard and when the Lord allow people that you know that is not up to our believing standard to come into our mess sometimes is how the Lord is trusting us to see how we would deal with them praise the Lord the Lord told Brother Branham there's a test waiting for you he never told the prophet what the test was and then how could he test his Prophet with young people making love right in the service how could he do that how would the Lord allow that testing brother Branham for the greatest part of his ministry just before the airport and brother Branham says I'm roaring myself and I know him myself I will never allow that to happen but the Lord just got a hold of me and I said young man stop doing that and the more I said it the more they kept doing it I said this is the house of the Lord don't do that here praise the Lord just for the Lord to tell him that you have passed the test this was the test to your temple praise the Lord amen amen so Philemon yield is facing his tests how is he going to deal with this a man herself in his house his family got used to him and and his children and and even the church God used to him he was he was a slave though but uh but I mean he was he was he was the one everybody got new now he's coming how is he going to deal with this and Paul is saying I'm not going to detect to you I'm going to allow you to deal with this praise the Lord amen Paul is saying I could have kept him to myself for him to minister unto me verse 14 but but without the mind who I do nothing they are the benefits should not be as aware of necessity but willingly praise the Lord for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should have received him forever not now as a seven but above a seven a beloved brother especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord praise the Lord if thou counts mean therefore a partner receive him as myself praise the Lord I believe for father monies it's easy he had a lot of confidence in Paul he knows his testimony among the saints but also the people around him praise the Lord also the people around him how is he going to handle his family his wife and his children to be able to deal with this man that might have stole some things from the house and how is he going to bring this man before the church and say this is our beloved brother some of the responsibility that is in leadership Paul says uh verse 19 our Paul have written it with my own hands praise the Lord some of the reason why he said that is because most of the time they use tribes he will be detecting and they will be writing his letter well he wanted to to to show an attachment to this letter that he might change in my feathers I wrote this with my hands praise the Lord I Paul have written it with my own hands I will repay I will repaint it I I do not say to thee how thou owe it unto me even thine own self beside yeah brother let's let me have joy in thee in the Lord refresh my vows in the Lord having confidence in thy obedience are wrote unto thee knowing that thou will also do more as are saying praise the Lord Hallelujah but whether prepared means also a lodging for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you praise the Lord amen I believe there was some there was a uh how can I call it that was there was a smart way to be able to seal the letter in a sense to say I would come and see what the church has done with this situation so prepare the place for Me Maybe by your prayers I will come but Paul never came out of praising from this he stayed there in the dungeon that was that was word that was some of his last letter that he wrote now so we see here that uh uh uh this uh whole thought of this prisoner of Jesus Christ that Paul uh introduced this letter wave which which subject will be dwelling around a little bit here we see the whole context there and even when we take ourselves into the picture to realize that uh the father have to send his son in our place the Lord amen which is which of course that was the beautiful picture like if I says one have to die for all they have to give one so between Jesus and Barabbas the religious World truths Barabas but can you think what it was for Barabbas because he knew he was condemned he has started an insurrection praise the Lord he was condemned and most of the time those kind of for Crime it was not just like uh you know uh uh you know uh a petty crime that was something against the state of Rome so he was condemned for them to come to his praising and tell him you've been called out to go free praise the Lord he was you I guess he was wondering in his mind what has happened have we taken over the Roman government or what what actually has happened but just for him to get outside and realize there's another man and he's not a Roman either that is going to take his place social Redemption story and that's why Paul is playing out here I could have kept him to myself for him to minister to me because he has started to be profitable to me praise the Lord he has started to be profitable you see I was thinking about this as I was uh uh uh looking at this because you'll realize here that when Paul sent out this letter that was the very same time he sent out the letter to the Ephesian church and also to the church that was in laodisha and also to the collusion church and and the church in Philippa and then he had to send onesimance with someone that will protect him because you have to realize that he's a runaway slave so he's a man that is wanted he needed to be protected amen that he was going back to his slave owner and you know he was going to reconcile and all of that so I I mean I was just thinking in my mind because many of the times when Paul was writing these letters like I said he was in Chains so he will ask for the uh a stride and a man would come and sit down and be writing uh everything that he's saying and writing it just as he's saying in my mind I was thinking was that the was that the situation with onesimus that just by listening to the letter that is sent to the Ephesian Church all listening to the letter that is written told the church in in in in in in Philippa could be able to to to to create a conviction because Paul never preached to the man uh uh the the Philippian Jailer he understood that and when the man came he says yeah yeah we are I mean we have not gone and and the man looking at him and says that then what what can I do to be safe he said believe thou in the house praise the Lord you see those other believers they live with such a sense of consecration around him amen I mean people seen us were easily drawn into their presence just because of the life of consecration that that they believe praise the Lord that Paul will be able to to to to minister to this man and and and and and and he will be he will be so Earnest enough to to to to to start to tell all his life story how I got in it and and and and uh my master is is Philemon volume up from word say really you mean you were you you mean you stole from him do you know him oh yeah he's my son in the gospel really praise the Lord but such an atmosphere such a life of consecration the atmosphere that it created around them remember the prophet of God says those he says those Apostles they were men of few words they were not men that were arguing over the godhead or they were arguing over the seals or arguing over a Doctrine there were men of few words they were carrying such a present with them that they just had to say few words it was enough to be able to capture a man's heart praise the Lord and sometimes that's the thing that that that trouble us because we think we need to be able to explain the godhead before we can witness to Jesus Christ all all you need to do is to just have a consecrated life just telling somebody that God love you is enough to be able to draw that person to a life of conviction you don't have to explain the seals you don't have to explain that God sent a prophet all you need to do you just need to have a life behind the name amen because there's the light behind the name that make the demon tremble praise the Lord that's Paul doing a work of the ministry reconciling two men that one love one another I believe that father my love onesimus I say seven and being a Christian a slave master I believe that he was nice to all of the people serving him a man that He Loved Before the man that he he took into his home and and into the life of his family have now stolen something away Rob his home and gone praise the Lord but Paul knowing that the work of the ministry is a work of reconciliation praise the Lord it's a work of reconciliation that's the work of the ministry that's why the Holy Ghost must be doing in our homes reconciling us with one another reconciling us and then we can carry also that Ministry the reconciliation to people that are in need is not trying to find culture and trying to find scripture where we can break people apart and separate ourselves no a Ministry of reconciliation trying to reconcile a man back to his master because that's that's what Christ did for us he reconciled us back to the father amen praise the Lord so you see the responsibility he said I will send you back Onision he had a responsibility Philemon also had a responsibility praise the Lord he's going back to live in the presence of the very people that he have heard and to trust the grace of God to be able to heal the wounds praise the Lord maybe at a time he was not a not a Believer he might have said nasty thing about the church he might have mocked them he might have teased him are we together I'm going to read a few things here from Brother Branham and then we were close but I just thought that it would have been a good thing for us to go through just read that letter like I said I was supposed to be a personal letter but Paul had to address it to the church because the church has a responsibility praise the Lord the responsibility of the church is the mystery it is is the ministry of reconciliation amen where we where we can reconcile ourselves back and reconcile one another praise the Lord even even when uh uh the the order of discipline that is placed in the church that when a man is now living up to the standard of the word and he's trying to bring reproach on the church the Apostle Paul said he must be we must turn him over to Satan he must be as communicated what is the purpose of that reconciliation that's the purpose of that the purpose of that is that when he's turned over to the devil just like it was in uh uh First Corinthians chapter two of that man that was sleeping with his uh father's wife he was he was excommunicated and then when Paul came back uh uh uh he had repented and he was restored back to the church the prep was there is that when a person is as communicated that he will that his flesh will be dead with it would bring him back to to to repentance for him to be reconciled so the purpose of the church the ministry is reconciliation a Reconciliation is not behind the things we are doing we have missed the purpose of the church if we try we if if if if we are seeking to show that we are a straight group or We Don't Take No Nonsense I mean we are straight we are on the word there is no room for compromising year then and and and and and and we think that is the drive of the church where we're just burning ourselves out we are burning ourselves out because pretty soon we will be faced with all of those uh uh uh false energy that we put in the minds of the people the purpose of the ministry is reconciliation praise the Lord that is the purpose of the ministry that is the drive of the ministry that's what the Holy Ghost want to do but you see this is nothing that we can do in ourself praise the Lord amen this is not thing that we can do in ourselves a man or a woman has to be a prisoner of love you have to be bound by God's word you have to be in that confinement of the Holy Ghost will he directs your talks he overrules your feeling praise the Lord he can be able to drive you to his purpose not to our own will or our own feelings you see this this is this this that we have just read it's it's many years away from this time that we are living reading about uh Joseph being in factors of chains and iron is many years so it's easy to read these things from the scripture and even from the message and say Amen but when the word is made flesh when we have to deal with faith in our own life we have to deal with faith in a situation of a neighbor or a brother or a sister dealing with faith in a place of a wife of or a loved one or a family member a siblings praise the Lord sometimes that's worse the rubber meets the road because it's easy to preach forgiveness but when phaloman will see unisima is coming with a letter in his hands from Paul receiving it from Paul he having so much Covenant that if Paul was the one that taught this man I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm convinced that he have fully repented because Paul will not send some some Halfway Christian to me but it does not stop there he have his family Paul said receive this man just like you will receive me oh he's going to be more profitable profitable to you now because he's no longer not on it now Paul did not say he's no longer a slave but he's not only a seven to you but he's also a brother praise the Lord it goes to show that it is not just a slogan when we call one another brother God bless you brother God bless you Sister it's not just a slogan it's not enough for just a handshake what is the feelings what is the feelings what they what do we take to heart when you say God bless you brother they'll say I want to just stop in the handshake praise the Lord you know how easy it would have been for family man and Paul who have wrote him a letter your former servant that stole from you and ran away from you he's now saved he's here with me and he's saving me oh it would have been easy for that church to praise the Lord oh thank you Jesus read that letter in church everybody will raise their hands they would clap their hands for Jesus but he's coming through the door praise the Lord he's coming through the door he's going to sit right in the assembly with you he's coming through the door he's going to sit in there somewhere with you if he was a robber are we going to allow him to be alone in the house anymore or something is going to trigger in US watch him is that is that going to be the attitude are we going to count on what the blood of Jesus Christ has done in the life of a person or are we going to bring all our humans truth in and and and and our our critical thoughts and and drawing in our mind is that how we are dealing with the blood of Jesus Christ praise the Lord I say this and then I close there's a story that went around and uh I try to build it a sermon on that many years ago called the blood and Triumph and this story was how a pastor's son LED a girl that was a real world girl and she was just living a horrible life on drugs alcohol immoral life praise the Lord but this young boy led her to the Lord and uh and that's how she goes safe and she was growing in church and all of that and it turned out when he wanted a wife he fell in love with her but then the church would not accept him to marry her praise the Lord and when the and when the young man stood before the the others of the church he read Hebrew chapter 6. he was reading and then he told the people what we are talking about tonight it's not this young lady while we are talking about tonight is not just onesima what we're talking about tonight is the blood of Jesus Christ on trial we are putting the blood on trial how much confidence do we have in the work of the blood the person says I'm sorry please forgive me how much confidence do we have in the blood do you see how we can trample over the blood of Jesus Christ just for our self-gratification we want to be convinced we want to be satisfied he said is the blood on Triumph you you now put him in on trial I don't think you are putting this young woman on trial I don't think tonight we are putting onisimus on trial we are putting the blood of Jesus Christ we try it are we going to call the thing that God's blood has Center father he had Justified are we going to say it's not justified enough because it has not met our church standard or I have not met our our our doctrine of points praise the Lord let us never put the blood of Jesus on trial praise the Lord Amen Let Us never put it on trial because if you even try to put it on trial it would never fail because they have never lose its power praise the Lord it had never lose his power it can say sanctify the most worst sinner Brad Brown said they can take a person from the pit of sin and make them a sin in church praise the Lord and may God help every one of us in a way we deal with one another in the way we deal with our brothers and sisters praise the Lord even with the way we deal with the ones that are weak in faith let us not put the blood on Triumph let us not pour the blood and try it brother Branham said question and answer he says if if a sin let me make one of the worst state if a prostitute should walk through this door tonight and come to this Altar and give her heart to the Lord praise the Lord the prophet of God said before God she stands as Justified as every one of us sitting here tonight praise the Lord now when a place where you are older than heart is in your chronological age for the many years that you've been serving the lord but before God she's saying that justified God don't see one person more Justified than the other no God don't see that if he sees us Justified we are all before God the same praise the Lord but just like I said you have to be bound in the chains of love you have to be bound in the chains of God's love for you for you to be able to treat and not a sinner that is saved by grace just like the grace of God treated you you have to be bound in the chains of love in that filter of Love verb say Paul was bound in the theater of love anything less than that we're going to be so critical we're going to be so radical in our attitude praise the Lord let's buy our heads tonight I'm a prisoner of Lords our slave to you the master I willing later [Music] foreign through the Heat and the cold [Music] yes I seek no Rewards in this world [Music] and the baby will come please when the birdie kids I want to be a prisoner of your lord [Music] the master oh I willingly tall oh I will in

tonight may he help us tonight let's never put the blood on trial let's never pour the blood on trial let's never limit the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] Paul told the Philippine Jailer believe on the Lord Jesus you and your household will be saved brother Braham say the same faith that save you is the same faith that will save your children is the same faith that would deal with your husband is the same faith that will help your wife the same Grace the same Grace that is dealing with you don't limit it to yourself and grace is sufficient to reach out to anyone around you let not pull the blood on Trier when we become credit card and we become ugly we become suspicious that's the reason why we have to hold one another before the throne of grace believing that the blood of Jesus Christ never loses his power it can save the weakest believe her tonight they can save the more worse sinner tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I just told Lord God we should just read the book of phalaiman
