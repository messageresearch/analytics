because life outside is just so so so busy and everybody's in the fast lane and if you want to consider that you'll find a very good reason not to be here this morning but if in the midst of it all you have made way to be here then just be rest assured that God is going to meet you without a doubt praise be to God we are here to serve God we are here for his course we are not here to be seen we are here to lift him up the days are getting too ahead time is no more praise be to God and the devil knows it but it is sad that we that name the name of the Lord we that call ourselves children of God we lose sight of it we think we have more time when the devil our adversary knows he's running out of time and then we lay down our guards Lord have mercy Mercy just be rest assured that God is going to meet you why you need him the most when it's time to wake go to work when it's time to make the money make the money yesterday we met the preacher brothers and Bibi and myself and I just shared a little story depending on what the atmosphere was about a Sierra Leone man who actually was a truck driver and he had no house he has no I mean room he was a semi driver and he had this double cabin truck so inside there was his bedroom he would drive anywhere he reaches he sleeps in he did that for two years finished building his house in Sierra Leone walled rounded and then one morning he called a friend he had a friend called him or he called and they spoke and two days later nobody knew where he was so they said no the last time I spoke with him it was I think in Tennessee and the sister somewhere in New York called the police and they went to that stop lo and behold the car was parked there when they opened he was dead what account are you going to give we can only talk of today not even today we can talk of this moment and what is behind we don't know what the future goes so for every opportunity you have make sure that you are do make make getting the best out of it so we are in the presence of God just trust and belief that God is going to meet you somehow praise the Lord today brother Samuel Taylor is going to preach to us and uh he comes from Ghana I

I met him brothers and Bibi has known him for years and it was a nice time you know fellowshipping with him ahead of today's service and that he is here he is the pastor of one of the message churches in Cape Coast the central regional capital of Ghana and um he'll be taking the service this morning so just pray for him I hope you are prayed up I hope you are afraid of praise be to God so he is

Place anyone you have given something that the world cannot give and the world cannot take away from us we are thankful Lord as David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of

Spirit under my control in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father even those who could not make it today Lord wherever they are may they have their portion of the children's bread in Jesus Christ's name we pray with Thanksgiving amen so please open our Bibles to Acts chapter 24 and then we read verse 14 Acts chapter 24 and verse 14. acts 24 Miss 14. let's hear the word of the Lord by this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believe in all things which are written in the law and in the prophets amen and this morning he permits me I want to talk about the Faith of Our Fathers the Faith of Our Fathers and Paul is saying that this is his confession now the way that the people call heresy that is the way he worships the god of his fathers believing all things that are written and in the law and in the prophets the weather is called heresy now just looking at the meaning of heresy in the dictionary it says any opinions or doctrines at variance with the official or Orthodox position the second definition says I believe that rejects the Orthodox tenants of a religion a belief that rejects the autonomous Orthodox tenants of every religion then I want ahead to look for the meaning of tenets it is it's a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as the truth without proof so now what the out of those religion proclaims to be truth cannot be put they have without proof you know there's always the truth and the false food that's right all cannot be true and all cannot be false cannot receive the truth the prophet said every Revival brings forth or produces twins every Revival produces twins Hallelujah so there is always the wheat and then the taste and we cannot talk about the wheat without talking about the test because they go together Hallelujah in a message the seed of the nicotines or nicotanism the prophet said now to get a real meaning of what we are about to go into I must question you to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made of two trees which have their roots in eating more of the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt they are very branches intertwined each other thus in the official Church is that same paradox the church is made up of good and bad amen two Vines make the church so there are two vines that make the church the good and the bad the Allah the wheat and the test growing up side by side but one is the truth the other is false amen now God will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church both of them the truth and the fourth the true church and the false church God called them all the church they said and only the elect will really know what is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived Hallelujah I'm glad when brother Asante was Stephen was playing praying this morning he made mention of how we have to walk the way the apostles walked and that is exactly what I want to talk about it so it was just a Prelude of my message Hallelujah you know Paul was converted from Judaism and to Christianity he fiercely ah kind of persecuted the Christian religion of the Christians in those days and when he was doing that he thought that he was preserving the faith of his fathers and little did he know that he was rather fighting against the faith of their fathers and to his conversion he thought he was right he was so zealous for God he wanted to preserve the Traditions all the the better words the faith of his fathers now what's happening is that not only in our age but in all ages when anything new comes so-called new comes all the other people will say oh there's a new church this is a new doctrine uh I was born in maybe the correct church I was born in this and I'll die in it that the faith of my fathers this is that and that they will say so many things oh your church is so new how old is your church they made a whole lot of negative comments our fathers believe this and they have lived with it even today they have stickers I am proud to be a presbyterian I was born in the previous Presbyterian I would die Presbyterian fine they're all nice Hallelujah but you see they don't know that along the line the faith that was given to our fathers the apostolic father didn't run through along the line there were human interventions they added here they took away this way and that way so after some time it became adulterated no they were not having the true word it was known polluted right right if I I can say that it does not pollute it wasn't the true word that was originally given to our Apostolic fathers now a counterfeit had been presented to them and they continue to dwell or not and believe in that and all that is it they say that they say there's a saying that if a lie is told and continue to tell the LIE over a period then that lie tells to be or to seem like that's the truth so after many years when the truth is being told the truth rather sounds to be lies because they have been made to believe a life for so long they don't know that along the line there were some injections they injected their own words their own interpretations and many other things it's your summer so bear with me Hallelujah when lies are told over period the people believe that to be truth so one electron the truth is being told them no that one the truth rather becomes a lie and that is the problem that religion for that matter Christianity has had over the years praise the Lord now Paul was believing all things that were written in the law and in the prophets that was after his convention he was believing even before his Converse he was believing that's why he was behaving that way towards the Christians but he thought they were rather destroying the truth by enjoying chapter one we know Philip met Nathaniel they probably said Philippine Nathaniel were prayer partners they pray together they had the same ambition they had the spirit the same aspiration they were looking forward to fulfillment of scriptures and so one Philip met the Lord Jesus Christ he couldn't keep it to himself we have found him who of whom the prophets have written so it means that they were looking forward they were always in anticipation of these prophecies being fulfilled and so when this one prophecy was fulfilled before his own eyes so we have found him who him the prophet had told about him the scriptures that are told about him so we have found him that was the attitude towards those who were looking forward to the Fulfillment of scriptures always looking forward to that they said we have found him of whom just waiting before the Lord Jesus Christ Christ came long before in the days of Moses God made Moses right that the Lord your God will let me just open and then we'll read Deuteronomy chapter 18. verses 18 and 19. verse 15 says the Lord by God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy bredman like unto me unto him ye shall hack him in 18 19 God said I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethrenal like unto thee Moses I'm putting the music and we'll put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command them 19 and it shall come to pass the whosoever will not hacken unto my words what he shall speak in my name I will require it of him so God promised to send a prophet like unto Moses and when this Prophet like Auntie Moses came they rejected him because they were not watching they were not looking they were not ready for him so they rejected him so they said let his blood be upon us and upon our children Hallelujah and practically the whole nation of Israel rejected the coming Messiah and God scattered them around the world now say that practically the world of our day has also rejected the promise of God for this age they have rejected the promise of God of sending us a prophet in Acts chapter 41 13 41 it says I work and work in your day work what you will not believe though a man be classes unto you but Acts chapter 13 verse 41 say behold he despises and wonder and perish for I work at work in your days now what which is in no wise belief though a man declares unto you that is God speaking that he will work and work in our day and what we will not believe all the people will not believe though it will be declared unto them God is working and working all day and the people who have rejected it just like they related to the Lord Jesus Christ and just like they reject all the prophets in the bible they rejected each Prophet that God sent a rather followed the anointing oil prophet of our day in Ghana they sell Gary Gary is a Syria it's so for them to to receive their healings the the sugarcane they are making so much profit out of them all because of ignorance and all because they have rejected the true one worker work in your day a day I mean what would you not believe though a man declares unto you you know Paul was Towing the line or the path of the fathers of faith and no one that he was the first the messenger to the first 28th he told the path of the prophets or the fathers and so God also made him the messenger for the first church age at the gentle Church age God commissioned him to be the first a messenger or the messenger to the first church age now let's read something from the Ephesian Church age talking about Paul say his manner of ministering Ministry said the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to the pattern of Paul's ministering sets the pattern that all future Messengers were to aspartum and actually said the pattern for every true minister of God though he will not attain to such height in a prophetic realm as did Paul first of all Paul Paul was he said no Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality and was as follows first of all Paul was absolutely true to the way amen he never deviated from it no matter the cost Paul did not deviate from the past or the truth the Faith of Our Fathers no matter the cost if it meant him not having anything to eat so be it he's true with the faith he's through the truth this is a scripture he stood with the truth no matter how much it was going to cost him he wasn't going to lower down the bars he wasn't going to compromise amen in Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 and 9 as we may know Paul said but Bo we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that what we have preached unto you let him be a curse let that someone come and say I'm an angel from heaven this and that and if he brings anything contrary to what has been proved to you what Paul has been preached has pre to you say let that angel be kept as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be okay Paul was straightforward he was trying to set the records right that don't believe or accept or receive anything contrary to what have been given you Hallelujah that's why I say he was setting a pattern for future ministers for future Christians for us all to follow so don't take from here don't take from there no let your mind be set on the word of God well I'm reading something from Galatians Chapter 2 verses 11 and then 14. between Peter and Paul is that when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the faith because he wants to be blamed when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all you think take Peter to the corner and then say do you think this is good Lord before them all he reprimanded Peter and who was poor to reprimand the Peter when they were walking with Jesus where was Paul Paul is kind of acknowledge to be the head of the Apostles are you I'm sorry I mean Peter sorry yeah Paul who what were you nonetheless when he saw that Peter was wrong he straightened him up he didn't care how many years he had walked with Jesus right he corrected him when I saw that he walked not apparently according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto him before them all if thou be a Jew limit after the man of Gentiles and not as do the Jews why compelling down the Gentiles to live us do the Jews so here was Paul who had laid a foundation who has said a pattern so regardless of who you were he was ready to correct it First Corinthians chapter 14 verses 36 and 37 he said what came the word of God out from you all came it unto you only If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the thing that I write unto you are the Commandments of God Amen Paul is saying the thing that I'm writing to you is not coming from me but they are the Commandments of God so if you refuse or we reject them if you play God then play them you are done playing the word of God the Commandment of God Amen Hallelujah Galatians chapter 1 and verse one he said Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead so he was not taking instructions from any Bishop ask bishop genovacia or anybody his calling was of God an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ this was Paul he had laid a foundation Hallelujah he a little Foundation Paul said other Foundation can normally than that which is late which is Christ Jesus so he was certain of the foundation that he was placing there for all True Believers two servants of God two worshipers to follow and to build on praise the Lord see secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word so it says in First Corinthians 2 1 to 5 get bear with me for all the scriptures that's what we feed on anyway and all right Brethren when I came to you who came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in my trampling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and Power so Paul will not come and stand and then preach something just to to please you he didn't come with enticing words of men's wisdom but he will come with the with the word of God no matter how hard it is he will not burn it he will not twist it because he believed the faith of the father he was believing and serving the lord the way his fathers not biological fact I believe you understand the apostolified the way they serve God that was the way Paul was determined to save the Lord II Corinthians 11 and verse two he said for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ that I may present you as a treat virgin to Christ that was all that Paul was working for to present a people to God a bride to God a brother is chased and the bread can be chased I mean Chase only when she is like the groom because of the Bride like a woman is supposed to be born of the husband's born and flesh of the husband's flesh as it happened Ina and Adam said this is born of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh so if Paul is preparing the people as straight virgin for Christ then the Virgin or the the bride must be like Christ and who is Christ he is the weight then the bride must be the way otherwise you don't qualify to be a bride of Christ you might be like him to say I I I am I am jealous with over you with Godly jealousy I've expound you to one husband then I may present you as a change virgin to Christ the prophet had a vision or dream where he saw it's about it's about the preview of the Bride he saw three sins and the first one he saw a nice beautiful woman very beautiful in all things it was matching say what a beauty what a woman what a bride he was so happy to see such a woman such a bride and then that sin went off and then the second thing that came was a woman that a woman was vulgar very filthy nothing good could be said about her that was another bright in the scene a second scene and of course he wept so after all the preaching after all the fasting after all the struggles is that a kind of bride I'm going to present to my Lord he was so sad and broken down no after all the work is that a bride that I'm going to present to God but to the Lord then that sin also left and the first thing that came was like the first scene a beautiful bride a wet bride a bride that was to be presented unto the Lord so what happened along the line that he had a filthy vulgar woman or bride Church in that respect because the woman represents the church you know Paul presented a word to the people he's told by the word he gave him the word the unadulterated word and the people who lived by it they accepted they embrace it so they live by it so that is how come the bride that's the Lord the prophet saw the first one was so beautiful was so upright was so there was nothing wrong around here but I know what happened the second bride or the reason for the second by the condition the second brother was that now from Paul's time along the line as I said earlier the word of God was adulterated right they don't play the will of God they compromise on the word of God along the line even uh they were selling the word of God if you read even history when we're in the in the primary schools we read a book makers of civilization they had some of these things in it where people were made to pay Monies for forgiveness of their sins the sale of indulgence I don't know whether you have heard that before yes so if you will send this week maybe you pay some ten dollars and it covers yourself for this week you can pay maybe 50 or 100 to cover your son for the rest of the for the year you pay maybe a thousand or maybe 50 000 whatever it will cover your sins for the rest of your life this science history books Hallelujah and so so many things went out astray so many they changed so many things we know about the the nursing Council where they change so many things and so now the word of God was no longer pure it was no longer in this right state and that is how can they produce that vulgar woman call that bride but then in these last days hallelujah what go what Paul preached is being preached back to us me Hallelujah and so if one ball preach produced that virtuous bride the word is being put to us which is a repetition of what published will have to produce a similar thing Hallelujah so when the prophet used to say I I preach what Paul free it means that I believe what Paul believed and I stand by what Paul stood by and if we will follow that then definitely we're going to have that bride like the first bride I believe that's what we are we are all aspiring to be to be part of the bride of Christ not just to be part of a church or a group but to be part of the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ and that is possible only and only when we will believe and hold to the Faith of Our Fathers if we swerve or strain from that there's no way we can be that Hallelujah there's no way we can be that if we stray so Paul I mean Prophet said I preach what Paul preached means I believe and I stand by what Paul stood for God is not accepting just any faith otherwise he could have accepted Paul's faith when he was a Pharisee because they were strict concerned the law but that wasn't thing that wasn't it certain Faith they are all sincere but the prophet said you can be sincere and what sincerely wrong you can be very sincere fine by can be sincerely wrong because if it's not according to the weather but if it's not according to the precept of God no matter how your sincere necessary doesn't count you'll be sincerely wrong because in the days of June there were other denominations they were not as many as today but at least we had the Pharisees we had the Sadducees we had the heronians they were all denominations but none of their preachings none of the adopteries none of their beliefs could have prepared a people for the coming of the Lord that is why he sent John to prepare a people to make a way to prepare people for him for his coming because those that were preached they were preaching around could not prepare people in the same way God in the midst of all that nominations all the beliefs has sent Prophet amen what is pure word to prepare a people for his coming actually said in Malachi 4. we'll get to that Hallelujah Jesus was the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets but they didn't see him that way you see one thing that made Paul and heretic is that he believed all the things that please those in here one thing that made Paul a heretic is that he believed all that were written in the law and in the prophets he believed them all and so that made him special that made him I mean oh let me put it that way he it made Paul all because the rest were not believing the prophet Jesus reprimanded them he said which of the prophets was not killed by your your fathers they didn't believe the prophet that God sent to them you know Jesus said that because the people were saying oh if we were in the days of our fathers we wouldn't have killed the prophet say no that is not true all of them were killed by your prophets and you are just a continuation reason of what your father did because you are garnishing the supporters of your fathers so so Jesus reprimanded them but Paul worshiped the god of your of his fathers the way that was so contrary to the way the others were worshiping and I thank God we are watching God the weather is contrary to what the others think you could tell you oh Peter was the first pope they cannot they have no proof they can tell you so many things without proof they are failing to see come back to the word that's what the prophet was saying back to the word he didn't come to project himself if anyone tells you the prophet came to pray it is wrong it is a lie all he says back to the word back to the original that's all my Prophet came to tell me that's all your Prophet is telling you back to the word Heaven and Earth will pass away by this word we are just to live by this and nothing else I saw one time all the people left the disciple the apostles or the followers of Jesus left when he gave them a hard preaching say I tell you truly verily verily except you eat of this My Flesh and drink of my blood you can never make it there's no life as for this one we are not witches we are not vampires you were asked not to suck up your blood before we can have life is it it's it's a hard saying so they started Living one after the other they left and to the weather to the 12th he says 10 so they said will he also go and Peter said to whom shall we go Lord to whom shall we go you alone have the words of eternal life these words that you've spoken you spoke to us and Them All We don't understand it but we know that it's life we are not being called to understand we are called to believe we have nowhere to us to go whether they believe it or not whether they understand it or not whether they agree with us or not we have nowhere to go these are the words of eternal life that have been spoken to us [Applause] we have nowhere to go Hallelujah [Music] in the church age book Prophet said the word always came by a prophet and always will I hope you don't mind me quoting a prophet I hope you don't mind me quoting the prophet can I go ahead the word always came by a prophet and always will that this is the law of God is evidenced by even a casual search of scripture the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where the people has strayed from divine order so prophets come God sends Prophet I don't mean these quack ones but word-based major prophet when the people have strayed deviated from divine order so the prophets commission or Ministry it will come bring the people back Hallelujah you know what I was talking about the the the preview of the Bride when the third bride came that was so beautiful and was much in the procession the prophet said he saw some people trying to get out of the procession Out Of Tune so he says scream be light stay in line [Music] today we need that scream so much we need ice cream we should stay in line when the time is so short the hour is late anytime from now the Lord May Come we need to stay in line the people held the people who are straight from divine order that is a a prophet comes in every age where the people has trained from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word God always sends his Prophet or his servant to these people I've just submitted something in order to correct false teachings and lead the people back to God amen so if God has sent a prophet in our day all that is coming to do is to bring us back to God bring us from four teachings four doctrines and all that back to God Hallelujah preaching or presenting to us the faith of our fathers what Paul preached is what he is preaching in order to produce a bright light the one that was produced in the days of Paul amen you see that is okay so we see a seven eight messenger coming and he is a prophet so what are the what does he come to do say no this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malacca for he will turn the heart of the children to the fathers to the faith of the fathers Hallelujah so marker 4 a messenger or Prophet will turn our heart to the Faith of Our Fathers and the two is just like the first one we believe 10 7 then he will reveal the missiles contain the attendance which are the uh you reveal the Mysteries and the things that are contained in the seals which are containing suits he said these are the one that literally depends our heart to the father what do we need again if this is to 10 what to ten or what is it to turn our hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers and we have had it what are we waiting for again you know they drifted from the face because they didn't believe the prophets of God and All Through the Ages you know the bride of Christ the Gentile bride so it doesn't concern the Jews All Through the Ages the sermon Church ages called sins prophet and they are the seven stars that were in his sense in the Book of Revelations Hallelujah he released them as and when it was due and then they all come with a word of God praise the Lord to bring the word of God to us that this is the way as the scripture says this is the way walk ye therein this is the way walking they win but the people will say we will not walk in it that's what they said just bear with me very much Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16 and 17. that say the Lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old part the old part what is a good way and walk there in and he shall find rest for your soul but they said we will not walk there in get blunt gold is saying look for the all of the new the old path Walk The Wind that you have rest for yourself no no no we're not walking it and then in Isaiah chapter 30 because the world always want to hear smooth things exactly 30 verse 9 to 11 say that necessary rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the Lord or say to the Cs see not enter a prophet prophesy not unto us right things don't prophesy writings so you see all the prophets around false prophet that's what the people want to hear that's what they want prophesy on to prophesy not unto us right things pick unto us smooth things prophesy deceit I'm reading from Isaiah chapter 30 verse 9 to 11. Professor deceit get you out of the way turn aside out of the path call the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us so they want the the good Prophet to stand before them and prophesy good things them they want the seed they want to be prophesied to smooth things oh like maybe you are in Africa oh this year is your year you will get Visa to your U.S you get yourself to Germany that's what they want to hear oh your business will prosper that is what they want to hear prophesy they see to us don't tell her that they're good things we want Small Things think that that we want to hear and so they failed to hear from the prophets of God let someone stand here or may start the church with all these kind of smooth things people will flocking but don't worry that we are small in numbers God says fear not little flock it is our father's good pleasure to do what Hallelujah so he is with us God does not dealing numbers we are not saying that if we we have a good number is wrong no but God does not look to the numbers the word two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them [Music] want to go the Faith of Our Fathers or believe the Faith of Our Fathers we are praying that the Lord will help us not to drift especially in times like this and especially in your side of the world there is so much pollution there's so much filth there's so much deception that God is able to keep his own so the elect will not be deceived if it were possible but it's not possible so he his eyes are over his shoulder he is keeping us well then the prophet said soon they will come after us so you cannot meet like we have met they will close the doors no bad barricade or buy them I will not be able to meet so it is good that the word of God dwells in your ritually so if the word of God if he knew you will be able to face any challenge you don't have to come here for a preacher to preach to you before you are inspired no let the world of God dwell in you richly because there's coming a Time who will be persecuted and not I I I think a bit worse will be persecuted as individuals the time is coming that's right enemies after rest today who is it the world is now so I I you can't you can't understand you can't imagine them if whilst we are here and the Holy Spirit song on Earth and they are doing all these things just imagine the prophet said when we leave God takes us from here he takes his holy spirit and if we are gone by God's grace the Rapture and the Holy Spirit has been taken away just imagine how the world will be like if today they can have same-sex marriage they can have animals can lie with human beings if a brother can warning his sister mother can marry his son and all those foolish things if they are happening even now imagine what will happen when we are going when the Holy Spirit is no longer there now the idea trying to come out with all kinds of decrees and laws so even if one is going to check and it feels like having sex oh yes at the corner there just go ahead this is what is happening now many laws and things are coming out and they want to enforce these things they want to catch our little ones Young but God will keep them Moses said we will not leave our little ones behind not leaving the who's of our animals we are going with them we are claiming them all for the kingdom of God [Applause] will not leave any one of them one of these things were happening Paul said but I am not ashamed of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ wow so Brandon let us not also be ashamed any people can dress you know in in Africa I don't know what what they say but if you saw someone with a dress torn here and there it means there's something wrong here I mean there's something wrong here it's a past the person is a crazy man in Ghana if not the whole Africa or even at least I'm talking of um what I know if someone wears dresses that are torn here and there hmm oh immediately sometimes maybe they will just arrest you take you to the psychiatric home but today the devil said that is the fashion when more than modern world you see we cannot modernize Christ we cannotize Christianity we cannot change it that's why we have to hold on to the Faith of Our Father and I want to say this even in the mess we have lowered the bars seven days have crept into the message what should not be so when we came to believe a message how it was and how it is today we have added we have let loose so many things I don't want to take much of your time you see I preached last week elsewhere it was this Memorial day or whatever and then the pastor I was asking what's the whole thing is about and it was telling me the Memorial Day is the day or holiday where they set aside to honor the gallon soldiers um who fought who led younger lies for America to be what it is now so that is a celebration a yearly celebration for those people and then a pot came to my mind I was looking at Hebrews chapter 11. Faith of Our Fathers this truth for the faith if people had to lay down their lives for America to be what it is now for people to enjoy now I was looking at the faith of our our forefathers fathers in the faith in Hebrews chapter 11 how that some were Sun asunder somewhere burn to the stick some were buried alive somewhere fell to the Lions but before they did that they will give you a last chance whether you denounce your faith or not if you denounce yourself free if you stood by your faith then you went through the agony or that ordeal they are worth to be celebrated these people we need to honor them and how do we honor them by living or believing what they believe hold to the faith we wouldn't be having it today we will not be having it today brethren and in Hebrew chapter 12 says that we are Compass about with so great a crowd of witnesses those who have gone before us believers they are all watching us are the last but who have been handed with a baton they have run the race semi-release the first age they run the second took the Baton the third the fourth fifth sixth and now the button has been handed to you and I how are we running it we're running according to the firms and conferences of our day we cannot make it they run good Races they fought good fights and they are all looking up to us how are we ending it remember the scripture says they without us are not made perfect we are the funnel let us go back to the Faith of Our Fathers whole person to it we have not yet fought unto blood as the Bible says but some thought to blood you have to lose their lives they're because they believed the faith of their fathers just because they believe what God told them Acts chapter 20 you know before Paul left he said I have no son to declare unto you all the counsel of God verse 27 and 28. 20 27 to 20 29 for I have not done to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost had made you overseas to feed the Church of God what he has purchased with his own blood so he is he was cautioning the pastors or the minister the Shepherds and they see themselves for I know that that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock Grievous rules will enter in and they will not spare the flock but Paul said I have no chance to declare to you all that you need to know all that will make you ready for his coming I have told you our Prophet has told us all that we need he has feathers with all that we need to know to make us ready for the rapture Hallelujah and so we should take Heat said Grievous wounds will enter in who will not spare us Braden we need to be cautious of the time that we are living in just to make sure that we are keeping Pace with the word of God what shall be revealed to us now a day Jesus himself was considered a heretic and that is why he was crucified because the teaching that he was bringing looked to be a variance with the law of Moses a lot of Moses will say an eye for an eye a two for a tooth but he comes to say hey if somebody blocks one eye if he slaps one chin giving the other one if he does this man he's a law breaker you are he's not teaching the law of Moses but Jesus said I didn't come to destroy the law but I came to fulfill it but they were saying the Fulfillment to be a destruction that is why he became a heretic because what he was teaching look like different contrary to what they what existed for them and when a prophet came he hasn't said anything contrary to the word his only redirecting us back to the word by the way he presented like it is in the Bible they don't see that way because a liar has been told them over the years amen and they believe their life to be true and they believe the truth be lie Hallelujah we are looking forward to the coming of the Lord and the people who held onto the word of God but they look for a better Resurrection and we are also looking forward to a better Resurrection let us hold fast the confession of our face let that hold fast onto the word of God let us leave the word of God let's allow the word of God to to have preeminence in our lives let God have control in US Hallelujah I said many things have sneaked in into the message now but we should be careful we should be careful let's maintain you know that Proverbs chapter 28 or so and 20 verse 22 said we should not remove the landmarks the ancient landmarks that was said before I will tell yourself to get it that's the last question I'm quoting say remove not the ancient landmarks Proverbs chapter 28. all right I've changed I love you right it's rather Proverbs 22 and 28 not 28 and 22. I'm sorry Proverbs 22 and 20. removing all the ancient Landmark which thy fathers have said don't remove the ancient Landmark the boiler uh lines that have been created as a Christian as a Believer know your limit how far you can go the limits are there the boundaries are set for us within which we are to operate we don't have to go overboard we don't have to go beyond these boundaries but today Christianity said that Anything Goes you can address anyhow you can live anyhow as long as you go to church as long as you're a chorister even as long as you preach but those [Music] talking about the Faith of Our Fathers why they believe what they held onto we must not deviate from them keep yourself within the confines not to the Christians sometimes somebody dresses and Andrew he tells you she's a Christian I don't know oh we worship God from our hearts what is in your heart I want to see what is your heart when you go to the boutique different style different things are there who decides for you it is your heart that desires decide and then takes something so if you take me you are worshiping God from your heart I'm seeing you from the things I'm seeing your heart from what you are doing let us maintain the faith of our fathers the boundaries that have been set for us the ancient landmarks of our fathers must be maintained I need to be well with us amen there's a song I don't know

do with the word of God he says something for the Faith of Our Fathers some people had to die even even though they had the option to live they chose death and as he was preaching he said that the Baton has been handed over to you and me just imagine you are holding a baton that is stained with blood the blood of those that have gone ahead of us they stood and they refused to live they chose
