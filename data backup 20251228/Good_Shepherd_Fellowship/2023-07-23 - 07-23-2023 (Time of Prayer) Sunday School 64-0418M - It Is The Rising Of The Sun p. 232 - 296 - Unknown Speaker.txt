========================================

again at the Finish see when God looked down upon the body the spirit left into the garden against him and he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which is human flesh and he didn't and he didn't want to first God he'd never die that kind of death take your God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there which you in him crap God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw for male and female it was all redeemed that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the group speak to the right well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the group The Bride have to do the same thing has to be exactly what the word said she's being these last things so she had to return to the Malachi poor don't you have to be manifested like was the days of Sodom not the world has to be just exactly like it is n't these things a perfect identification of The World God made no one to the Francis I know I'm keeping a long time 15 minutes after dinner but maybe I'll get two but then but notice looking here what a perfect thing it is I don't know what to see it again look notice this but God foresaw the bride in the groom Hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her I didn't know what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see and Jesus took his wife's place and they can't stand for her remember he became you Mr Joy punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we deny how can we do anything but loving friends uh she could stay on her hours but let's move on real quick right uh the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in This last days This Promise is like the abstract to a tidal deed see now you can get a title sure you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back here come here and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows us everything it ever again to the struggle come back from the foundation is that right and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the Holy Spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract and every bit of that boss you and everything's all it belongs to you right when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title for the foundation of the world and put a name on The Book of Life that was born to a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost comes it was the abstract that everything that gets me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like a little epileptic child and prayed for if you didn't know that comes to you from the grandparents therefore if she fell down and upon the child I said but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything I'm a abstract amen well and it sure is a spirit quite dead I haven't that I'm part of that body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of word lit up just exactly like it did [Music] the abstract call my sins are struck out all your sins are stuck by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that God Gave Me by Grace by poor knowledge oh my God what's good about no wonder sets me around amen I'm either was dead and alive again and I'm alive River board at the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing beautiful let's go right quick the abstract type the debt is settled everything against it has been struggle uh Glory may I silly but I feel good oh an abstract D do you realize what that means you realize what that means brother there's nothing to take it away from you man I am a amen I have now cashed in or my beneficiary of his death burial in Resurrection even come to you that I might become him now he became a sinner that I might become a son amen have all the abstract deep or these signs shall follow them they're abstracting Now quickly before my team is Lord let us now notice quickly the quickening of the spirit I worship some signs don't you understand listen now watch what is this quickening power was my subject as the sun has raised up look how it's done on them at Pentecost what it did to them what's that quickening power did to them they're quick enough now let's notice what it did on Stephen 's is full of clicking power was that right see he was full of quickly power it didn't make him a scared he said you stiffness uncircumcised my heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost like your father did so do you which one of the prophets that showed forth to come into the just wanted your father's Soul oh my God done something to him I see the heavens open Quincy power was working I see the hell is open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God that's what quickly power done for Stephen notices another fellow had just quickly power his name is Philip is being cast out people's baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is having a real meeting and the spirit spoke to him oh the Dynamics come down it said lead this revival but while the minister say don't make any responsibility he's full of quickening power he had the gasoline and uh the dynamic the falling upon him they go out into the desert and he found a UniCare and baptized him in one man who took the message down to Ethiopia is that right and you've obeyed God it obedience to God if you've ever been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do it and watch your Britney's heart pick you up there see what Stephen's done this great thing in our statements the Phillips done this great thing to leave that great Revival and obey the Commandments of God only fulfilled my baptized in this eunuch and opiness to God he was so full of Quincy power to call him away it will Quicken your moral body if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead no he wasn't singing for maybe 150 miles or somewhere else or another country it quickened this Mortal body how did it so full of quickly well we can't stand around your own little sugar tits that we're nursing around here today we've got to be full it's played off with quickly power until the quickening of the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen [Applause] excuse that expression I think about a mother that makes those little factories too for the baby some of the old mannies remember the little baby gets his quality to take some coffee grounds and some sugar wraps up in a site and let him stuck on it just a passifying strength and advocating put caffeine in there and stuff a little sweetness to make him swear down he's getting caffeine we are tired of that stuff is that get back your egos back to the word of God be Burnley nothing can hurt your feelings never you're free from all the scandal of man whatever anybody says against you that just brings More Love [Music] come on away into the heavenlies the eagle is just flew above the chickens way up down or in the Heavenly places in Christ oh it was the old Phillips at quickening party boy let's take another man there was a man by the name of Enoch a head walk with every word of God for about 500 years hit him on that mechanic he didn't even have to die just don't know it started walking he said Mike Phillips he got to pull a quick entire instead of going over to the gates and going to another place where they found him up in the upper Coast is there instead of that way he was like well I said I'm an old man anyhow I just got too much quickly bars walk around here that sustained quickly car that we have right now see it will Quicken your mortal body is that right it's the quickly power Enoch was that perfect testimony that everything God told me to do I did it everything that I've seen he said for me to do I've done it and he become so full of Dynamics or or mechanics until when the quickening power stuck in the mechanic he just missing him right up he walked on out of the earth into heaven now now don't oh no idea I actually look Elijah that great prophet man is here's the excuse me brother sister in that day he had busted them painted face women then Jazzy Bell and they had and stood until and nobody looked like she stood with him and he rebuked and desired and stood out there and God is taking care of him and helped him in every place you know the old fella got tired one day you gotta get old so I just can't go far as it was going on I guess it's 90 years old three year old walking around there and he was so full of great and power you know what he looked across the yard oh God I can almost see the other side against you so full of equity power until he beat his chair it hooked over there some horses to fire charifier hooked to some tree over there he just walked across the river and went home without even gone the quickly power set called The Chariot to come down from heaven and take him up he pushed all these coats and thought it back for Elijah that's right now then that thought picked up that roll the time for the church picked up that road now he done twice a miracle which is the type of Christ in the church Elijah done four he done eight he would double the power of course he asked for greater things than this that I do shall you do see but he was so full of quickly power and everything until he done all these double what Elisha does more than he did he did and notice he lived the life on up to about 80 or 90 years old he got old and he died he died they took him out and buried you know that quickly fired many many years after this when the flash is all rotted off his bones he was laying there too and they were packing a dead man one day and assault the enemy and they just told this man on top of Elijah Told You So Much clicking power there was the hopes to a man just survive again oh you're Quicken your mortal body so scared and rotten in the grave and get that quickly power rested over that dirt Hallelujah he that raised up Christ off so quick and your moral body the Elijah back there Elisha and Elijah remember that dead man that prophet he can still lay hands on the street [Music] and remember we are flesh of his flesh Jesus Christ we are flesh of his Flesh and Bones of his bones oh there's no way out of here that's all you should arise that's all Easter means more than just a tradition it is also now our bodies are quickened with him and we're setting in Heavenly places and this body May rot in the sea it may rot in the ground they may not be a spoonful of Ashes raise up my Lord from the dead has quickened this Mortal body it's quicker your moral body and we are his beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life no one who says fear and Hopson he's no fault that therefore is your saved grave where is your Victory I'm full of quickening powers thanks be to God who gives us the victory to your lord Jesus Christ He Is Alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8. the anointed ones

Brown after 800 years old they did read Matthew I got a scripture in Matthew 27 51 you get right boys down when all goes back there that believe that he would come the Bible said here after he comes they were sleeping in the ground quickly Powers up on him and they were part of him them things they were part of him because they believed on him potency they had that line through the sacrifice of a sheep of propitiuation which can never bring Spirit of the sheep back up on the man how about now is the spirit of the man God himself how much more quickly power do we have but through the propitiation for Sanders offered a lamb and type what we have is not the type it's the anatype what are we scared about and those fellas who only had a tight party to his resurrection and went down into the grave with it Joe back there on great streams everything took away from him the devil said let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face and his wife even turned against me instead of
