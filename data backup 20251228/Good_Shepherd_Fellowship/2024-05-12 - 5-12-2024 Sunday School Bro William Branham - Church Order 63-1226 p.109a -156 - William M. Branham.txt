[Music] for [Music] got a question mark as many are riding the office and blaming you for the action on the tapes also about others around the church selling tapes if Mr Maguire has to pay royalties on them all right the tapes is by contract and by I don't know just exactly when a contract is expired but the trustees this belongs to the trustees not the deacons the trustees not the pastor trustees the trustees ever so often they they write a contract as I understand it if this this is wrong then the trustee's correct um these trustees has an agreement with the person who is making the tapes and the tapes are by franchise no one else can make tapes unless it be permitted by the person that has the franchise and it cannot be sold unless permitted by the person that has the franchise because that's the law see that the franchise holds it see and if the one who holds a franchise wants to let so and so make tapes that's up to him he wants to let everybody make tapes that's up to him he wants everybody sell tapes that's up to the person who holds the franchise he should have a a little written note signed from the holder of the franchise to make him sell tape because then he's clearing the law because you don't the man has a franchise on you be liveable yourself to if it be a a foul person that wanted to cause some trouble he could really do it you go over that franchise because that's just like a copyright see the same thing you're not allowed to do it it's a great find to do that so if the people are making tapes perhaps they have an agreement from Mr Maguire who who has who draws royalties on the tapes and now and uh I don't know about that cuz I'm not here enough with you to know who these things are who it would be referring to I suppose that Mr Maguire still has it because out there in California or Arizona where I'm at I understand they're still buying tapes from the California uh brother sofman the father-in-law of Mr Maguire which is our brother here in the church uh I think that Mr Maguire still has the the franchise on now there has been complains all along on the making of the tape now when there is a complaint on anything pertaining to the finances of this church it's Duty bound to the trustees to see that thing is cleared there should not by any means be anything I see here it says on this card here that uh uh they're writing to the office and blaming you frankly I've had many letters on it and want to know why they can't get their tapes now you know your contract with the one who has the franchise As I understood the tapes I want nothing to do with them myself if anybody can use the tape for furthering the gospel amen but first brother robers and them started to make him brother beer and several of them started to make him and then the two boys brother Mercer and brother gold made him for years and of course when each one of the man has made him there has been complaints on everyone but it's seemingly here lately there's been a great complaint about not getting their Cas people called me up from across the country and then another being retract tapes they'll be playing one thing one minute and play back on another another thing and then you can't even understand what they are now these people paying for these tapes should get a genuine tape I don't care what they have to do to get it we want to see our customers and our brothers which they are our customers and our brothers so forth they must have a a number one tape now you truste see to that that these people are satisfied if not satisfied their money must be returned to them immediately and someone's called me and said they've been waiting for a months for tapes I don't know how brother Maguire tends to this I I don't know about that it's I know nothing about it I it's none of my business to know nothing about that's his business with them and the trustees now I'm not trying to step in but I just telling you what the law of it is see the law of it is that these tapes from the time that they send for them them tapes are supposed to be on their Road within a day or three or four five days after they send for them tapes it's got to be in the mail or the franchise could be cancelled at any time when these orders are disobeyed see now and every six months or a year this is supposed to be renewed this agreement is supposed to be renewed you're supposed to meet on this certain date that this franchise says that you got to meet and then it's supposed to be that's other people are supposed to come in at that time and you're supposed to notify others who have been asking about the tapes and come in with their agreement and sit down and talk it over now these orders must be carried out see and it must be carried right because it is complaining it complaining with Leo and Jean it complain with everyone is complaining with brother Maguire and he'll be complaining with somebody else but let's find out what the complaining is now but when the tapes are begin to pile up boxes of them Letters by the dozens pouring in and they see it doesn't fall back to the tape maker it falls on me they're always balling me out about it now it's my duty as a Christian to see that the people get what they pay for and I want you trustees to see if they get it if they have to charge more get a better tape get a better machine we want somebody to make that tape who makes it right that's our interest the tape must be made right and the customer must be satisfied or stop the whole tape thing all together we won't have no tapes just let anybody make them it wants to but if they're going to charge for them let them see that they get what they paid for because that's Christianity that's the more than do when they come here to listen to The Gospel I want to give them the best that I know how to give them see and when they come here I want to see that everybody and everything's carried on that's the reason I'm telling you deacons trustees and pastors here tonight that you must carry this out to the letter because the people are coming here to find God and we got to have these things in order and also the tapes must be put into the place if they have to charge more if they got second class tapes you're running then get better tapes if they have to charge more for them charge more for them let the person get what they charge for I'm not interested in one bit of royalty not one penny and neither's a tabernacle interested I don't want you to be don't Beed interested in that and in royalties if they pay something I guess you'd have to take a little royalty on account of it being major I think that's something they said Mr Miller and him about the law we had to take certain royalties or so forth that's up to you all to see to that I'm not have nothing to do with what that set together you all take care of that I can't take care of all of it I'm just telling you the way it should be and must be run that you understood I said must be run so um we want this run out right and if you have to have a better machine to take it then get a better machine if it has to be now I said to them I said every Mi mission that I go into the field before I go I'll notify you what sermons I'm going to preach on out there something that I've already I promised you all which I'm going to retake back again Sunday night that before I preach any new message it would come from this Tabernacle first because it seem to get a better recording you remember that then when I come here preach my messages then go back out and notify tape man what services they asked me what one what should go preach I on this night go so and so and this night so so so they can have it made up and ready for the customer to get it right there got it right with them a better tape than to have out in the meeting because it's made right here at the Tabernacle where the Acoustics are good okay now now going into this great Evangelistic what I'm going to do now overseas and things I can't promise that you see I can't promise I'll preach my first message here because when you preach a round of messages you got to have something is it's get St to you it's B to get stale to the ones that's listen at it you've got to do something different see and bring just as the message is there but let them put a machine in the field or whatever it is that'll take these tapes perfectly and make a perfect tape and each tape played back and check before it goes or just stop the whole thing don't even have to do let every man make his own tape see but get it done right see so this complaint will stop we don't want no complaints at all if there is a complaint let's take care of it and we have it over with now I'll hurry as quick as I can brother got by two more questions here three then we'll be finished how far brother Brenham can or should a deacon go to keep order in the church should we keep the order or wait until brother Neville tells us what we should do that isn't brother Neville's job that's your job you don't tell brother Neville what to preach on how to preach it see that's your job deacons you're supposed to do that you take care of that that's nothing to brother Neville that's your job see now uh if a policeman's out here on the street and he sees a man stealing a property out of the back of a car should he call the mayor and say now mayor your honor sir I am working for you here on this police force I find a man up the street here he's um uh he was stealing some tires off of a car last night I just wonder what's your opinion of that man that would be sensible would it ner if he's doing something wrong rest him and if a man's doing something wrong here in a church or anybody stop them talk to them don't be irant but if they won't listen speaking way that they know what you're saying see see like you tell a child say walk back around and he's misbehaving Deacon St at your place but the four of stay two in the front and two in the back on these corners or somewhere like that and watch real close for Renegades and everything else come in like this you see you be on the guard you get your posted Duty and stay there that's your seat or stand right Bes side of the wall and watch everybody come in a deacon takes care of the house of God someone come in speak to them be there to greet them shake their hand that you're the policeman uh could we show you the cloak room or would you be seated could we hand you a song book or something or now we would like for you to enjoy yourself here and and pray and and we are happy you're here with us tonight lead them right down to the place and say would you like to be closer would you like to be back here or wherever more that's Hospital a policeman or the Deacon is a military police to the Army courtesy but yet with authority see you know what a military police is is actually if he carries out his rights I think he's just like a chaplain you see it's courtesy and everything but yet he has an authority he must minding see he puts these rookies get out there and get drunk while he puts them in their place and so as a deacon to put them in place now remember the Deacon is a policeman and a Deacon's office is actually more strict than most any office in the church I don't know of an office any more stricter than the Deacon's office I try because he's got a he's got a real job and he's God's man he's God's man just as much as the pastor is God's man certainly he is he's God's servant now the trustees only thing they're under Duty by God to watch that finances and take care of that the things that goes on I told you about them tapes and and about other things here goes on about the building and repairs and keeping up the finances and things that's that's what they are Trustee of the property finances and things the deacons has nothing to do with that and neither the the trustee have anything to do with the deacons office now if the deacons wants to ask the trustees help on anything or the trustees the deacons and you're all working together but that's your Dy singling out all right now no don't ask brother Neville if brother Neville ask you to do something then that's that's your pastor with courtesy and love and everything he'd say uh brother Collins brother Hickerson brother Tony or somebody um would you see what's wrong back there in the corner at the post of Duty like that you know as a real man of God remember you are not working for brand Tabernacle neither are you working for brother Neville or me you're working for Jesus Christ see you that's who you're and he's he's respecting your loyalty just as same as is to that Pastor or to anybody else he's expecting your loyalty and we want to show our loyalty now sometimes it gets hard it's hard for me to see a minister sitting there I love with all my heart just have to really tell him see but in a way of love I've got a hand out to help him but see and they come to me and say brother Bram you're just a wonderful person why can't you just compromise a little on that baptism and on this that and the other that's Security in this referenc SE I say brother I love you but now let's just T take the scripture see who's right or wrong see I've got to be able to oh now brother BR I tell you you're all wrong see goes flying out oh I say well perhaps I am then if I am surely and you tell me you're you know where I'm wrong at then you show me where I'm wrong and I'm willing to take the same thing hey you ain't got no business telling that child is set down now the Deacon is a is a custodian at the house of God God see now if you he takes care of the house of God and keeps it in order that's what the scripture says if you got anything else the Deacon should do you come tell me see that's the same thing but that that's your duty to do that yeah just back up and should ask nobody that's that's just your duty brother Neville don't ask nobody the church don't have to ask I mean if the trustees don't have to go ask brother Neville if he wants the roof put on the Tabernacle no no that's not nothing to brother Neville not nothing to me that's to you the deacons don't have to is same way to the pastor why you go to preach on I don't want you to do this they ain't got no business saying that he's under God see the pastor and then if U if if brother Neville he preaches a message that the Lord has give us and we're all together in this and if I tell brother Neville something wrong god holds me responsible for it that's right so God is the boss of all of it see and we're just working if his ambassadors you see down here in these office please next question and then I think we got one more and then we we'll stop please explain just how the gifts of tongues are to operate in our church I have did that when can the church be put in order as are just where the gifts are to operate we've just explained that just how many C h r i s t m a um could you see what they is instruments oh instruments um how many instruments are we to uh have in church besides organ and Pian well depends on if you had a String Band or whatever you had you see I don't know what you got what this means I don't understand it but the organ and the piano are property of the church now if the song leader would take an ocean to have a trumpets and carnets and so forth like that and somebody's coming to church and they play these instruments and they're in a band and and then of course then that's for your trustees to take it up with the trustees and see if they got money to buy their instruments and so forth or whatever like that I guess that's what the question is but if they have their own instruments wonderful if they don't have their own instruments and they're member here of a band not just the person runs in here and plays once in a while and runs out like that it's got to be a band in the church the church wouldn't buy uh a trumpet for a man that plays it year and tomorrow night somewhere else and somewhere else and drop in once in a while play a little bit no sir it's got to be a band right here organized band with the the leader then the church talk to them about buying instruments please explain just how we are to how we deacons can keep the people uh just in the sanctuary before or please keep the people quiet in before after church all right I would suggest this Brethren now there is a great thing wish we had more time to put on it or it's it's it it means something just now the church is not a if he wants to if you want to run this tape down some night and play it before the meetings that the people understand it let this be played this this part of the tape of no more this this any part of this that you want to play for a certain thing just keep running till you find it and then play it see because it's question now deacons of the church and as as I said are the police of the church but the church church is not a general Meetinghouse for for fellowship and friendship and frolic the church is a sanctuary of God we come here now if we want to meet one another let me come to your house you come to my house you go to one another's house and meet one but just to frolic around through the church and talking and things like that it's not right brethren we come here we get the whole thing off of our mind if we would come here look way we used to do it years ago sister dirty was a Pianist when I pastored here I would I had to be Pastor Deacon trustee everything else at once see but I I had to do it now you don't have to do it that way see because you got man to carry this out but when the I had ushers brother seart and all of them at the door they had books piled around there at the door sitting in a chair or something there when someone come in you show them a place to hang your coat or help them to their seat give them a song book and asked them to be in prayer and then everybody sat in their seat and silently prayed until starting time see and then at starting time sister Gertie The Pianist got up there and started the music before when the people were coming together I would suggest to have your organist to get up there with some real nice music if she can't be here put it on tape and then play it or something and have music music real sweet Sacred Music going on so and ask people and if people goes to uh uh talking and car like that let one of the deacons get up at the microphone up there at the desk and say sh like okay say at the Tabernacle here we we want you to come to worship let's not make noise now listen to the music get your seat sit down be Reverend see pray or read the Bible this in the sanctuary here is where the Lord dwells and we want everybody to be real reverend in worship not to be running around talking before the services congregate yourself and you come here to talk to the Lord see either be in silent prayer see or read your Bible when I went into the Marvel Church up there at the Norman Vincent Peele you've heard of it and I went into great psychology teacher you know and I went into his church I just thought I wish my Tabernacle do that again and Deacon stand right there at the door just soon as you come in they of course they hand you a Sunday school slip taking you right down he had to empty three times you only hold about 4 500 you know New York's a big place and he's a popular man I think they had to have one class at 10:00 and one at 11: same seron not over again same service exactly same sheet of paper but when they dismissed and they had a 5 minutes for the church to be exactly nobody else could come in until they got out and the deacons opened the way and the church filled up they had these old box seats you know they go in like that and sit down in the Pew where you open the door old fashioned it's been standing there for around 200 years I guess the old Marvel church had and you could have heard a pin drop anywhere in that church and everybody in prayer or at least 30 minutes before the first note was ever hit on the Argon the prud and just everybody in prayer I thought how wonderful it is now when I Minister that plude about I think it played one plude for about 3 to five minutes How Great Thou Art or something like that like that and then when they did everybody stopped praying and listen to the pr it give a change from prayer to the peute and then when they played that then the quar leader directed The quar then they had a congregational song in the choir and then they were ready for their Sunday school class see and then um and then when it was over there was nothing went on except Divine worship all the time that's what we come there for and I think it would be a good thing if our church and I'm just saying this we would do it see let's do it if somebody does anything is I think it' be a good thing if it's a good thing then let's do it see we don't want to put off any good thing we'll do it anyhow see and just go ahead and and stand up there and and if they start on a morning or something like that people busy just let someone one the deacons or somebody walk up there and say uh it's been made a rule in the Tabernacle here I don't know what they do they may may I'm never here you see I don't know I'm never here before services and when they come in and they start talking that somebody got and they sh just a moment see let let give the sister get her up there and get her playing that music if you don't put it on tape and get it out there see of the organ music and say now we there's a new rule in the Tabernacle when people enter here we're not the whisper talk but to worship now just a few minutes the service will be starting until then just either read your Bible or bow your head and silently pray a few times like that they'll all learn see see you hear somebody talking then it gets down for after a few times like that after while you hit a place where somebody say see somebody talking nobody else talking see well then one of the deacons walk up and say we uh we want you to worship dur time of the service you for [Music]
