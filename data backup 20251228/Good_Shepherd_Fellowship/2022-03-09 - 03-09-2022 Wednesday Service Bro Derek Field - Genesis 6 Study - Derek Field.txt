amen it still has the creating power and it's just it's beautiful to see the word you know working on our behalf praise the lord because that's that's what it is uh a sunday evening uh uh just before the communion service we we spoke on the inspiration of the almighty and and i'm telling you it's it's like the lord uh really wanted me to to look into uh you know the subject and then uh so uh i went uh uh i was actually listening to to the message uh spiritual inspiration that brother branham preached and uh and brother branham death into uh uh he was visiting a brother and uh uh and he just took that but i think the holy spirit brought it in such a way and it's always like that when you are not prepared that's when god is more prepared amen amen when you are prepared all your preparation get in the way that the holy spirit don't move so so you know brother branham says i went in and i told i told uh i told uh uh brother rules i said come and get me when there is service you see as soon as i got to my room i didn't even open my bible and brother was not the dog and said brother branham is service you know so he said well i had this thought on my mind so i'm just going to preach it you know and then he started talking about it but i mean there are some amazing things that he said in that message and and that's what i wanted for us to look into tonight uh i'm going to talk and talk continue on the inspiration of the almighty praise the lord and uh and and so i started gathering you know started putting some few things i was just going to stay right in there in that message and and look at some few things and uh go to service and i was just kind of doing some few things in my vehicle before i would come and i saw brother derek driving in praise the lord and i was just thinking about him a couple of weeks ago praise the lord and but derek is is one of our associate minister praise the lord so i told him i said i love surprises because whenever you surprise me i'll surprise you also praise the lord amen so i expect there to come in and and testify tonight so uh uh he will he will come and uh just bring us greetings from from his family from uh [Music] uh grace ministry and then whatever the lord have on his heart to share with us tonight since it's just a prayer meeting and and then we will trust the lord for this weekend brother boscow came in uh andrew busca from shiva flew in on monday from phoenix and he went yesterday down to wisconsin and he will be back tomorrow evening but we are having a weekend service next week with brother kenneth cops from north carolina which was already a plan service so this week i thought i would have brother boscow to preach tonight and on and on sunday but he's a good friend to brother joe piascoy for the model 5 they've been having uh they've been having um let me tell me like a campaign with the american indians and the canadian indians and also the eskimo people so throughout the year i think maybe it is just these uh cover years and months that have maybe broke their services but they have started having meetings you know and uh so i just thought that uh you know brother joe will also appreciate having brother boss castle we allow him to go and then he will be back and he's here with his wife and one of his daughter and granddaughter they actually went down to our brother doug baker meeting in tucson and uh so i was just in the week i was just i just taught on him and called him he says oh i'm down here in in tucson you know by the way i'm stopping over to berlin tonight i'm preaching for him and i said well okay why not stop and see us in minneapolis before you go back home praise the lord so albert andrews will be back in town tomorrow and then he will be preaching for us on sunday so again there will now be service on saturday the saturday service is next week next week i know i don't always explain myself praise the lord i'm still trusting god for the tongue surgery praise the lord and i know the lord is going to do it one of these days amen the day you see me speaking in tongues you might know my tongue surgery has come praise the lord because i only speak in tongues when i'm praying so when i'm start doing it publicly and i can't stop just know that god has changed his man tongue praise the lord so wow we we just want to thank the lord let just stand on our feet tonight and thank you for bringing your lake of fire on this cold evening and flaming our hearts with prayer with praise and prayer let's sing that song burn brim holy spirit bernie man we only sing the chorus of that song it has tenses i've been trying to learn the senses we are familiar with the chorus now so let me not teach stencils tonight but we will sing that and then we will hire better dairy calm [Music] [Applause] and [Music] fill me with [Music] make me like [Music] our [Music] [Applause] [Music] the price [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] let us praise the lord a

bless you amen god bless you uh brother one says it take me by surprise don't you think i wasn't thinking something like this would wouldn't happen but we're trusting that the lord will bless us this evening and he'll speak to us it's already been a blessing to me and that's the thing is when we get together with saints of like precious faith if you're not receiving a blessing then there's something wrong with your relationship with the lord i don't come to give a blessing if that happens that comes from him they come to receive a blessing amen and may the lord bless us this evening let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your love we thank you that you're the one who's watching over us in these dark and evil times and we ask you lord to come and be with us this evening and speak to us just a little out of your word lord that would encourage us that would strengthen us that would help us take another step with courage lord in the face of all that we face lord and it's not the david had no fear of goliath it was a fearful situation but he had an overcoming faith in this god may we have an overcoming faith and may our faith be strengthened this evening we ask in jesus name amen amen let's let's uh while you're standing let's grab our bibles thank you musicians uh and we'll just take a scripture and then i'll tell you where we're going when the scripture is matthew chapter 24 and it's a familiar scripture and i don't think there's anything that we're going to bring out of here that we knew or un familiar to you but would trust that reminding you of these things will be a blessing so matthew chapter 24 and we'll just wait on the sound person okay so and we'll take it from verse 36 it says but of that day and thou are knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of knowie were so or so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so also shall the coming of the son of man be may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and you may take your seats so i was walking down the road and how many of you actually listened to the bible uh anyone yeah okay and listen to the chapters and chapters at a time because sometimes you can pick up things that you can't if you just focus in on the verses and so i was listening to uh genesis and i heard in genesis where god was talking about noah and how noah found grace and i remember that jesus said that as it was in the days of noah and i thought to myself isn't that interesting if we looked at the days of noah and saw comparisons to today then we could tell are we living as it was in the days of noah so that's what we're going to do okay let's turn to genesis chapter 6 because it taught that's where we find and it's the same scripture the same bible it's the same history that jesus had that we have today as it was in the days of noah it's the same record except jesus had the advantage that he had a little more spiritual understanding than us he had a better relationship with god but you see he was called to be the firstborn among many brethren and so that means that he didn't think it was robbery to be to say i'm equal with god and brothers and sisters we should have that attitude within us as well and that's quite something to say do you think it's robbery to think yourself as equal with god okay well that's what we're going to if we're going to adoption that's where we're going to brothers and sisters i i heard a wonderful quote one time it said a man should walk around with two hands in in his pockets i don't recommend you do this but in in one pocket should be i i am man i'm made in the image of god and in the other other pocket it should be i'm man i'm nothing but the dust of the earth you see and we should have the the ability and the wisdom to whatever the situation is to pull out the right thing okay when satan comes to attack us and to say you're nothing but the you you're just the dregs you you're awful we should put reach in our hand and say but i'm made in the image of god okay but if satan comes to attack you okay and he comes a different way and this takes more wisdom to see because you come and he'll attack you and say oh you're doing so good you're such a holy person you're such a wonderful person look at look at all of those out there they're not worthy to be compared to you you are just a wonderful christian and then you got to reach in the other pocket and say well yeah but i'm nothing but the dust of the earth i'm just a sinner say by grace so we need that balance there okay but jesus he saw he read exactly the same scripture and so we're going to go through we're going to do a little bible study and he says it came to pass and i'm going to bring out some of the facts that i looked up and that i researched it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them well interesting men began to multiply on the face of the earth do you how many people know and we'll get interactive here if you if you like how many people know at the time of jesus what was the biggest city in the world anyone did someone say rome yeah that's right it was rome how many people were living in rome at the time of jesus anyone know that best estimate because no one's here today that was there then but best estimate is 800 000 to a million people so there was a let's just say there were a million people living in the biggest city in the world at the time of jesus okay a million people uh how many cities are there in the world with over a million people living in them well i'm asking anyone have a guess five more than five did someone say a hundred more than a hundred not quite as many as five thousand all right the answer uh according to said 500 well done the answer according to the uh to the un data in 1918 1916 there were 512 by 1918 i think uh or sorry 2016 by 2018 there were 570. i don't know how many there are today but there's increasing the multitudes that grew on the face of the earth this multitude is a very interesting word turn with me to psalms chapter 144 and just to you know sometimes you you get a picture of something from seeing a word that that's in the hebrew that's translated a slightly different way now how many of you uh for how many of you is english a second language yeah okay how many of you know more than one language yeah and you know you can take uh how many of you know more than two three by the way come on you should be raising your hand there and you know how how you can take a word in english and you can translate it into another language and it doesn't mean exactly the same thing but it's close enough that you can use it but then if you want to capture exactly that feeling and that that meaning of that word sometimes you have to use three four different kinds of words to say well it's kind of like this and like this and like this to build up a picture all right so that's what we're going to do tonight we're going to look in the scripture at these hebrew words that are used in genesis and we're going to try and build up a little picture of what it means and the first one we're going to look at is multiply and and in psalms 144 and verse 14 we find that uh we find that same word used sorry uh it's verse 13. all right and it says well it's a blessing and he's talking me of well we'll just go back to verse 11 he says rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speak its vanity in their right hand is a right hand of falsehood that our sons may as be plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as cornerstones polished after the cementitude of palace of a palace that our ghanas may be full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets that our oxen may be strong to labor that there may be no breaking in nor going out that there may be no complaining in our streets that's where we're going okay but if you ever feel a little bit like complaining it's because you've got to get more in god and less in the world but anyway that word let's go back to oh we got let's go back to verse 13. okay may bring four thousands and ten thousands okay that word multiply is there ten thousands how many of you have seen the pictures of like in new york where you just have crowds of crowds of people and it's like a flock of sheep just bustling down and and in japan where they they pushed them into well not so much since since covered but they would push them into the the subway and they would just crowd them in they're just all jam-packed okay that's what we're talking about like sheep and that's why it's talking of the multitudes of people okay and the sons of god verse 2 back in genesis 6 the sons of that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all that they chose okay and wives well i looked up this statistic and it says um this is from uh uh the institute for family studies and the center for disease control did us a survey of people that lived together and taking all that data they estimated that 65 percent of people in the survey had lived with at least one romantic partner before marriage okay and many i think it was 50 55 had said that they had had one uh at least one partner before the person that they were living with at that time and so we see that relationship between men and women is becoming uh well it's becoming evil let's think evil what is evil what is sin sin comes from a greek word and it's an archery word right okay and the archery you're aiming for a target how many people here have ever fired a bow okay and so when you fire a bow you're aiming for the center of a target and if you sin that means you missed what you were aiming at you miss what you were aiming at so what are we aiming at we're aiming at bringing the life of christ into our lives okay and so brothers and sisters this makes sin a lot more serious this makes sin a lot more deadly a lot with a lot more consequence because here's the thing you're you're there you're an archer you're aiming carefully all right and you're about to let go and and your friend comes along and he just jostles your elbow and the arrow shoots away i'm sorry you sinned right was it your phone no was that fool of a friend who decided to joshua your elbow just but you still missed the mark you still sinned okay you're aiming your arrow you're gonna hit the mark and you lose your arrow and just as you loose it when you've taken everything into account along comes a breeze of wind and you missed the mark you sinned and that's how it is in our life it doesn't matter what the reason is for us missing the mark if you miss the mark you have sinned that's right okay so then when you see that especially your young people and you think i i'm i get upset with my brother from time to time but i don't go out and rob banks and i don't go out and find old ladies and knock them on the head and take their purse i'm not a sinner well if you get angry with your brother like jesus said without a cause right how many have ever done i'm i confess i've done that why'd you do that there's something missing from my bedroom you took it didn't you i'm so mad with you and then a couple of days later it turns out that oh actually yeah i i moved there and i put oh i put it in the other room i forgot i was angry without a course okay i'm sorry you just sinned all right so you may not do anything that you think is really really bad or really terrible but if you're missing the mark that's right you've sinned and you need the grace of god all right so and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years and there were giants in the earth in those days also that after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children unto them they became mighty men which were of old men of renown you know that word giants anakim i believe it is that only appears two times in the scripture did you you knew that okay how many people know where it appears out in the scripture let's go there let's go to numbers chapter 13. i like this all right so this is going into the promised land how many people here want to go into the promised land into the fullness of the promised land you had a little taste okay and you know it's there for you but you haven't got to the fullness yet you know there's more and you want to enter in well there's something stopping you entering entering in and and usually that's something in your mind and let's have a look what was in the mind of these people okay from verse 26 and they went and came unto moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and to all the congregation showed them the fruit of the land and they told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people that be strong would be strong that dwell in the land the city's a ward and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there and the amalekites dwell in the land sat land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites the amorites dwell in the mountains the canaanites dwell by the sea by the coast of jordan what are the what are all those people representing okay so there's a battle to enter in to the holy land and the children of israel had to enter in but every step of their journey is a representation of a step in our journey and so every battle that they fought is representation of a battle that we have to for fight ourselves as a church as a church age and as an individual but sometimes it's easy to say oh we've got to fight as a church and that's wonderful and and you can think okay as a group as a church aide we're going to enter and praise the lord but where it really starts to get difficult is when you say it's me it's not anybody else it's me and i have my giants to fight okay so and this is this is something like i said this this is just a couple of weeks old and i've just seen something new here but i'll show it to you all right i have something to fight i have something to overcome i have something to and and okay how many people are looking at their lives and saying there's something that's a bit too big for me to overcome yeah put your hand up yeah talia if you're not putting your hand up you haven't looked at your life close enough okay because god didn't call you to overcome easy things all right so if something is easy for you to overcome you should overcome it god isn't going to help you with that he's already helped you with it most likely it's the hard things that you say i've got to go against this in the faith of god because i don't have any way of i can't stand against it myself but i i can stand against it with god's help because he is bigger than what the problem is all right so mul caleb stealed the people before moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and this is the battle and the battles in the mind you reference that okay and you're going to have i see the goodness i see the promises all right but i see how they can apply to me but the problem is they don't apply to me because of you know i'm not living quite right well what's that got to do with it right they don't apply to me because because my foot is really painful and it's probably i can't claim it in faith because what if i claim it in faith and and it doesn't get healed sure oh man that would be kind of awkward because if i go out and i tell people when nothing happens and there's a little voice that said no no no no we're able to you're able to possess it all right and then you gotta you got a choice to make and the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we they brought up an evil report of the land which they'd searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we've gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw are men of great stature and we saw the giants the sons of anak which will come of the giants okay which will come of the giants and we were in our own site as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight all right so basically what's it saying the the thing that you can't overcome is born of the sons of god and the daughters of men because that word giants that's the same one that's back in genesis what's that that's talking about serpent seed that's talking about fleshly religion okay that's talking about that mindset that says i'm walking in godliness in the flesh and we can't overcome that because i'm like a grasshopper and sisters do you ever feel like a grasshopper yeah yeah okay listen if you don't feel like a grasshopper you haven't been paying attention i'm telling you you haven't been paying attention twitter the social media platforms took the sitting president of the united states completely out of communication because they didn't like what he said and didn't like what he did and now i'm not here to agree or disagree with what he said what he did but i'm pointing out that using that kind of power now has a president it was unprecedented but now they've used it against the most powerful man in the world and said doesn't matter how powerful you are we want to switch you off we can switch you off we can switch you off okay how many people ever been to canada yeah nice gentle canada first world country people want to go to canada and then there was that that truckers and the the prime minister of canada declared an emergency situation and they they basically they said the truckers are loaded terrorists yeah you didn't see that oh look it up yeah jordan will tell you but uh and they said anyone who sent money to them we order we give the banks permission that if you even think that someone sent money to them you can suspend their account and they don't have any recourse yeah how many you know that how many people know that okay all right if you didn't know that then maybe you can start feeling like a grasshopper because all it takes is for okay how many of you support um the voice of god ministries i think we support it okay all it takes for them to say is you know what that voice of god's terrorist organization shut it down and go back for the past 10 years see anyone who's ever given money to them shut them down as well okay start feeling like a grasshopper all right there's nothing that you can do against that okay well but we're not called to be grasshoppers even if we feel like grasshoppers we're called to overcome but there you see these were the giants that were in the land in the time and they're in our land as well so move over giants so here's a really interesting one verse 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually oh every imagination and we think of imagination it's like ah i can imagine you know imagine one day if brother one really annoys me i can just imagine strangling him okay is that the kind of imagination we're talking about all right what does that word imagination mean that's really interesting how many people work in construction here anyone okay let's turn to uh isaiah 29. i'm going to give you two scriptures from isaiah just to try and talk about what this word imagination is because we think of imagination it's something that you know oh i wish i could do that oh i'm imagining doing something and we think that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil wicked continually they were always just imagining what bad thing they could do to someone else that's part of it but let's have a look at this part this is isaiah 29 uh and verse well let's start in verse 15 just to it says uh woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the deep and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us surely your turnings of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay for shall the works say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed serve him that framed it he has no understanding where's imagination in here next next one 16. where's imagination in here anyone care to venture no okay it's this word framed okay shall the thing imagine save him who imagined it all right but it's not imagined it's framed and how many people have seen the house framed okay and so what's the framework of a house all right it's it's the you've got the foundations and then you put up the supports on which you hang everything else and so you you've talked about uh have you ever talked about the way you frame a conversation the way you think about things the mindset that you bring into something that's the imagination that's exactly the same word as imagination back in genesis so when you say the imagination was wicked always it means the frame the point of view that they looked at the world it wasn't that oh i'm i'm imagining strangling somebody or i'm imagining robbing somebody it's the way you look at the world is always continually evil okay so let's look at an example of that just a real brief example of that uh there are lots of uh there are lots of examples that we could look at but uh we can just take our one cutting your hair as a as a woman okay and god says don't do it all right but how many people in this world believe that it's wrong for a woman to cut their hair very very few because it's everywhere it's in all the churches it's in all the workplaces it's in it's it's everywhere you look all right and so for a little person that grows up into this world that's just natural to think that way their imagination has been framed by their surroundings and framed into a world of sin okay and so we're looking at saying what's the weevil imaginations now what we have to do is we have to be careful that we don't get infected by the world's framings okay uh because i this is how we all like sheep have gone astray all right this is how stupid we are human beings you and me everyone okay they did a test and here's how the test went they stopped the person walking down the road and they asked him hey would you hold this for me while i tie my shoelaces it was a cup of coffee okay and then you tied the shoelaces thank you very much they tracked that person and they would invite that person to come and have a like a little survey and so a bit further down the road they'd say hey um would you help us out we're doing a survey all we want you to do is we want you just to read this description of a person it's just a paragraph and tell us whether you think they're warm-hearted or whether you think they're cold-hearted okay and so they gave their opinion oh i read this person he seems like he's warm-hearted read this person seem like he's cold-hearted how many people have heard of this experiment okay you can look it up yeah elijah's heard of it because he's heard me talk about this before okay that's my son elijah in the back so the trick was this right at the beginning they will either give them a cup of hot coffee or a cup of iced coffee and they would hold that cup of coffee just for a few brief minutes they will go down the road and about 60 or 70 percent i don't remember the exact figures of people that held the hot cup said oh that person he seems like a warm-hearted person and 60 or 70 percent of people that held the cold cup was like oh that that guy feels like a cold-hearted person okay that's how susceptible you are to your surroundings that's how much you need the grace of god okay all right we won't go on to subliminal advertising and all the ways that they manipulate you but the devil absolutely uses that against us and against you and every time you go into a shopping mall every time you go to school every time you go to church not here but you know to visit someone every time you interact with someone and we'll just we'll stick on that short hair just for a second that cut hair and you're interacting with somebody with cut hair okay and you're accepting of them because you have to be the devil is framing your mind into an evil imagination to say what's the difference if i cut my hair or not okay and that's especially true for your young people for the sisters young sisters that's true all right there are other pressures we'll just stick on on that for right now but you understand the imagination so what's the cure let's turn to isaiah 26 just back a couple of pages and you know this scripture okay you know this scripture [Music] isaiah 26 3. bring it up here for thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee that's right okay trust ye in the lord forever for in the lord jehovah's everlasting strength all right let's go back that will keep him in perfect peace whose imagination is stayed on you it's exactly the same word okay whose imagination is stayed on me so how are you going to brothers and sisters this tells us the essential importance of reading your bible and praying every day why because it frames your mind around the word of god stays your mind on jesus oh how long do you usually all right not what you think it's the way you think it's the way your mind is framed and the law and it repented the lord that he had made man on earth and it grieved him at his heart oh man so i want to take you into the mind of god and i want to take you into our minds for a little bit by turning to nehemiah chapter eight and this is this is a an amazing story and the children of israel come back from captivity and they're doing their best to [Music] to well i'm going to tell you the story and then we're going to read a bit all right they they get everybody together they get everybody together and they're rebuilding jerusalem they're rebuilding the temple and they say we need to get back to god and it's actually if you're if you're you can discern the seeds of the pharisees in this because this is the the pharisees took this idea too far we need to keep the law of god before we get kicked out of the land but they gather together ezra reads the law to them and the levites make plain the understanding of the law and they're all and he reads all day ezra the scribe and near maya the the uh the governor and the priests and they bless the people and they verse 7 so they read in the book of the law of god distinctly and gave them the sense and caused them to understand the weeping i understand the reading and nehemiah which is the terth shatter or which means the governor and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the word of the lord okay mourn it's the same as grieved all right so what is it god created the earth to be a place of joy for him to be a place where he could find relaxation comfort where he could find an equal someone to talk with you know because your parents know how it is you have to talk to your kids it's annoying i love you kids okay all right and your parents love you okay but you talk to your kids and it's all can i can i have this can i have this can i have this no why does that why does this why does that and you're talking from up here to down here because that's about how high luke is to down here that's how high tiffany is it can be difficult and it's like man ah can i can i just have some adult conversation please but think of it and there's a relief there and and there's a talking and that's that's a man and a woman and they're talking together as equal as husbands and wives and you're saying i understand what you're saying that's interesting and and that's that's what god created man for not to talk down to him and say i did you know but to talk as equals to him and to be hey come and have a conversation come let us reason together okay oh i love the way you're thinking you know um that you know what the nice thing is elisha and emma they're my two big ones okay they've got older they got wiser they start to mature and suddenly it goes from being like can i have this can i have why can't i do that why can't i do that like oh dad isn't it interesting that this happens and this happens like yeah it is what do you make of that well i think it's like i like the way you're thinking because now we're starting to talk as equals okay because brothers and sisters you're not raising children okay you're raising adults that's the goal is to have an adult have a functioning adult at the end of the process okay not to have a little baby okay you think you think you know what the problem with society is it's we're raising babies we're not raising adults raising people who still get told what to think and can't think for themselves so it's a source of pride for me that elisha and emma i can have conversations with them that are actual conversations i they still bug me sometimes but it's getting less and less you know but that's what god has raised us up raise you and me this is what creation is about for him to have that conversation and it grieved him because there was no one left in the world with whom he could have that conversation it grieved him and in our mind sometimes we read ah you read the book of acts and you see the great things god did and it grieves you so because where's my life in comparison to that where am i and god says now hold on this is the day of the lord it's not a day for mourning and weeping it's a day to raise yourself up to say you know what these are the promises yes that i can enter into these are the promises that i have this isn't oh what was me because you can get stuck in that attitude for sure and there's a genuineness to that and the people that cried and wept we haven't kept the law of god and the priest said no no no no this is a day of go eat the fat go drink the sweet and send portions to them who nothing is prepared for this days holy unto our lord neither be sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength that's where that comes from isn't that good so it repented me and he said i will destroy man from the face of the earth that i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast creeping thing the fowls of the effort repenteth me that i've made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and let's turn to esther chapter five and we see that word translated another way so brothers and sisters you you think of this for a moment all right the esther is a book in the bible that doesn't actually have the name of god in it okay isn't that interesting that god would say this is going to be my book and in my book i am going to have a book that doesn't even mention my name it just testifies of me without saying anything about me okay and so sometimes you get the idea that don't get me wrong here all right there's a balance in the scriptures the bible says do all things in the name of jesus in the name of the lord but esther is written without the name of the lord so sometimes things are a little different to the way we think we should they should be to the way god says let them come forth and so if you see something where god is you don't know if god is moving or not because it doesn't seem to be in the name of the lord just take it easy wait and see what develops because god works in so many ways all right but he here we are and this is well you know the story of esther chapter one it uh verse one and it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court now we'll stop there and and we'll pause all right because let's think about this situation here esther as she had said to mordecai and mordecai had agreed with her was taking her life into her hands by doing that we think of the king and queen you know it's like the king and the queen but it wasn't the king and the queen it was the king and the favored wife of many wives okay and so there's the king and he's in his core and he's running a worldwide empire he's running the biggest empire that civilization had known up to that point and there's some thought that's very interesting that esther chapter one the feast uh that he had was the feast that uh where he was planning the invasion of greece okay so he's called his captains together to have a feast and then to actually strategize on the world stage and how many of you husbands sometimes maybe you're not strategizing quite on the world stage but you're really focused in on something like i have to put this together for work and let's say it's important for work it's a project that you've been given you've got to do well and and you're at home and you're working on the project and you just 100 focused in and the wife comes she's like honey can we talk like i'm busy but it's really important but i'm really busy and you've already broken off my train of thought and i've really this is really important well honey don't you love me off with a head don't bother me woman this is important stuff okay so that's kind of funny at least for me maybe not for your sisters okay but that's the situation that was the kind of situation that esther was putting herself into it's like yes i love you esther yeah you're the best one of the lot that they brought before me but i had you know maybe 300 maybe it was a year worth of fair maidens coming into my bed chamber i liked you the best and i made you my favorite wife but don't think i don't have options don't bug me i'm busy i will call for you well just remember brothers that's not the way god ordained marriage okay so because very often it's that's when you're talking to your wife you've got to remember god gave her to you to help you find the right way and very often where you get so focused in on something and your wife is like ah this is really bugging me why is it bugging her sure okay because she's a woman of god and take the time to listen all right don't be don't be like off with her head no but you know where you know that level of frustration well that's just that's that's sin that's missing the mark okay all right but we're all subject to sin at the moment the giants that flesh that born within us that we should be fighting against anyway and when it seems so big and frustrating that's right you seem like a grasshopper but that's what you have faith in god to overcome but she's standing there between life and death do you understand that she's taken her life into her hands it's been so serious that she fasted and prayed for three days when was the last time you fasted and prayed for three days about one particular thing to make sure that when you stepped into the arena you were stepping with god behind you and you still didn't know whether it was right or wrong what would happen so don't think this is some kind of fairy tale this is esther took her life into her hands and she obtained favor in his sight and that's the same word as grace noah found grace esther obtained favor and so there was something about noah that said to god although the world is full of sin although the imagination of every man's heart is wicked although death is coming yet i can extend the golden scepter for noah to touch and to say i identify and i thank you not because i'm worthy but because you chose me and there's something in you there's something in you in god that says i like you no you ever had that conversation i have that conversation with my wife from time to time i like you why what is it you've seen me i don't know you're so annoying sometimes but i still like you okay what are you laughing at over there yeah okay cross cultures this is this isn't just all right this is the human experience and god says i like you there's something about you you are really annoying sometimes and you do need to be cleaned up sometimes and i do have to correct you sometimes but i like you what would you like extend that golden scepter let's turn to first thessalonians chapter five because if this is that day and i believe it is okay then what are you are you a grasshopper are you among them that are going to perish are you among them that the imagination of your heart is continually wicked or are you among them that whose imagination has stayed on thee but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety and sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify you one another even also as you do i don't think it could be said any better let's pray heavenly father thank you for your goodness thank you that we can recognize the signs of the times and we ask you lord that we wouldn't enter into the mindset of the world that would grieve you and take a thing of joy and turn it into a thing of mourning for you but we pray lord that we could be found those among those who have your favor who have your grace among those who extend your scepter to and say come partake of the ruling of my kingdom with me may we be sober may we be vigilant yes may we edify and encourage one another in these dark times what if i've said anything that's in error pray that you'd forgive me and let it come to your light the lord the words that you will have spoken may they sink down in our hearts and bring forth the fruit that you'd have of them even through such ears as ours and such lips as mine give myself to you in jesus name amen god bless you god bless you [Applause] praise the lord i just i sent a quote back there let's just read there brother branham says something and uh i thought it was beautiful i thought it was beautiful that's that's a wonderful hesitation praise the lord you know there's there's there's this thing about a about a preacher especially when you are in the office of a pastor whenever you have a visiting minister you you you uh you look to the holy spirit to preach to you to minister to you but then also you look to see if the holy spirit will be able to confirm that you know you are you are in you are in the in in in the china you are you know you are saying what the spirit wants to say to the church because you don't even you don't tell the preacher what you were preaching before you don't have no composition and then he comes because the holy spirit deals with every local assembly he deals with every local assembly even even as a family you know he has a dealing with us as a family and that's the thing that makes it wonderful because i'm not living with you in your house and you come to church and the holy spirit is able to speak to you exactly what you were thinking in your in your kitchen or on on your dining table or something just come out you know that's how beautiful it is so i just thought it was beautiful tonight but let's look at this brother branham years talk in the message confirmation and evidence he said to think that god who made the universe i thought that was a very beautiful thought about imagination the picture gets it gets it gets bigger amen anyway that brother dairy brought it tonight that was that was beautiful to think that the god who made the universe the god who made the solar system who made the heaven and the earth and created them by his spoken word remember a word is a taught express god taught it then when he expressed it it has to happen for the word was freemen praise the lord so it means that god had an imagination god came into a mindset of what he wanted to do praise the lord that's that's the same word and brother branham says it over and over and over every time when he talks about a word is a taught express god is not speaking over his thought he's speaking what he has thought of god came into a frame of mind concerning you and what brother branham would say he would say and that's the picture he took of you he came into a frame of mind he was caught in the thought when he thought about you being his bride praise the lord even when you think about the word just like just like what the scripture says he's quoting uh the apostle paul year and when he expressed it like brother branham says when god expressed his thought it has to happen because he have already created a picture that's what the imagination does he have already created a picture in his mind how that word is going to come to pass it has to happen for the world was framed by the word of god the things which that the things were made out of things that do not appear it was god's word his thought he taught it and he spoke it and it has to come to pass it's a sea that is growing and marvelously that has to bring forth in his season that's the reason why the prophet isaiah says when god words go out it don't return back because god has thought about it he has a frame of mind he gave us the promise brother i'm saying right here is in the seafoam growing he gave us the promise now we try to create in our mind we try to create our imagination of how god will bring his word to pass we see the promise but we do not catch the frame of mind that gods have until the world comes to pass you only have the promise you shall be changed you you will be adopted you will be raptured we have that promise but before god made the promise he have come into a frame of mind how are we going to get out of here praise the lord and you see sometimes in god's frame of mind he thought of bringing us to our best state through trials in his frame of mind i can get these people to be what i want them to be when i bring them through this but most of the time we are trying to approach the promises of god on our frame of mind we put our knees before god lord this is my need i need you to move in this area then we create a frame of mind when you are moving move like this move like this and move in two weeks before the end of the month you have to move then we stay in that frame of mind and as long as we stay in our frame of mind it's difficult to get over to god's frame of mind praise the lord that's the reason why brother branham taught us to look at the bigger picture to everything there is a bigger picture because god's frame of mind is in the bigger picture when he was thinking of bringing you to grace there are a lot of things that he taught about there are a lot of things he taught about praise lord i just think that that was beautiful tonight brother branham says we can take his word and see that he promised in the last day that he did draw his people out and do the very same thing he did like he did in the days of sodom and with everything that is happening around the world can you imagine that they were all in the free mind of god that's why nothing takes him by surprise he's not anxious because they were all in the frame mama the free mind of god that's why we have to trust him amen we have to trust him in and every every giving day is an opportunity to trust god every giving day we have to be growing in trust we have to be growing in trust we have to be letting go of of how we think things can be done and how we want it to be done and we have to be trusting in the lord musicians you can come praise the lord bless you brother derek that was beautiful tonight amen praise the lord there is a preacher to have men in pictures he preached with a lot of pictures let's buy our house together tonight be it unto me not calling to your word [Music] that's the reason why we have to embrace we have to embrace the promises of god let's not reason the word reason reason on the word let's let's embrace the promises of god say god you said it i believe it yes be it all to me i call to your world i call into your promises i can stand thank [Music] the truth that sets me free i call into your word oh lord be it on to me blessing it to the lord yes be it all to me let's stand on our feet tonight i call into your world oh i call into your promises i can't stand thank you oh god my heart the truth that sets me free i call into your word oh lord one more time now beat on to me i call into your words i call into your promises i can stay thank you oh the truth that sets me free i call into your word [Music] that's the reason why the potter the clay can

cast your key ears on him for he careth for you [Music] we throw ourself into his arm we throw our knees into his arm [Music] knowing that whatever we give to the lord he will take good care of it and he makes it better he makes it better when we put our knees in his hands we pulled our burden in his hands we put our life in his hands we put our health in his hands see we made it better [Music] whatever whatever situation the lord allowed the enemy always come to to make us afraid and bring fear and doubt but you have to see it that is in the free man of god that situation is just an expression of what is god what was in god's mind [Music] to bring us to a better place to bring us to the place of faith to bring us to a closer walk with him ever you know it's all part of the free man of god [Music] father we want to trust you father we need to trust you fire is not not just for the movement law not not just for what we are dealing with or what we really want but we have to

towards you they are they are not the thoughts of evil you say my free mind concerning you is not the thoughts of evil they are to bring you to an expected end [Music] father we love you tonight we
