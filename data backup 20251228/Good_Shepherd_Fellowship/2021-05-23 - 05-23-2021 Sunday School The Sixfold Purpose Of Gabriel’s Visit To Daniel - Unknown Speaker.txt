first thing the church will be what rapture will jesus come from the earth and walk around the grave and shake hands with papa and mama talk to us all here and go up no how will it be we say this to you by the by the word of the lord that we wish alive and remain second thessalonians 5th chapter we which alive and remain to the coming of the lord shall not hinder or prevent those that are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the deadly christ shall rise first and we which alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air amen will be caught away in a moment of the twinkling of an eye during that time that ends the church end then down here on the earth god starts dealing with the jews there'll be two prophets the 11th chapter will pick that up two anointed prophets like elijah and moses who i think it is and they'll bring great curses after they have seen that they have consolidated and rome has broken its covenant that prince in the middle of this 70th week it'll break its covenant with rome a roman will break it with israel and he'll cause the abomination again to scatter and there will be the great flood when the gentile remnant the sleeping virgin the dragon roam spurted water out of his mouth to make war with the remnant of a woman's seed that keep the commandments of god rome will do that a confederation church will consolidate them together and bring the jews into this confederation and bring them back to their own temple worship again in the just sayeth the lord out of the bible and they will have their own church they are walked down i just called it just now it's fresh they are now a nation recognized is that right but they have not their temple worship yet and when they establish the temple worship the church will be gone god will be dealing with the jews as a nation and then when they are brought into this confederation rome will break it in the middle of the 70th year three and a half years he'll break that covenant with them and cause the abomination and make a desolation to spread to the consummation amen then he'll take both protestants and jew and persecute them and at that time these two prophets will stand up and curse the earth and shall not reign in the days of their prophecy they'll call far out of the heavens and everything else you just wait we got a lot lately oh what
