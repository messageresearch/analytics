========================================

cool state of georgia down there where's the cool down there that tell me about this time i met a little fella outside i was coming off my interviews this afternoon and coming down to the church about an hour and a half ago and a little kind of a young fella outside he said i said hobby said it sure is i knew he's from georgia so he said show his hop down in georgia amen well we're trying to escape a hollow place aren't we that's what we're here for thank you so much friends for all your goodness what would i do without you guess what what would i do without you if i had nobody that loved me nobody that would listen to the message all my message would be no good at all i can't preach it to telephone polls and the trees they wouldn't understand it so it's got to be people like you all and come and listen to it and when you come and sit in a hot place like this and it's my wife said she liked to burn up back there this morning and to see people and sometimes sick people that's sitting in the meetings like that god give you a a beautiful lovely home and glory is my prayer and i just hope and trust that he'll do that now let's see my coat somebody tuck it over here and um i got to do a little reason tonight how many is enjoying the first parts of this off it just wasn't so hot we just keep right on going right on through the week with the the book of the revelation i just love it i just live in it and you pray coming for me this week because next sunday of the lord willing i've got to meet that uh place in those weeks together that's something that i do not know nothing about and so i'm just going to trust the lord that he'll have the answer for me and i i've read several different men who who spoke of it who's wrote of it i've read the footnotes you're on dr schofield a great scholar but certainly couldn't agree with him on his many of his footnotes because i can't see where it's got the it got to make the picture right now if you just put it like a jigsaw puzzle together and the first thing you always say well this goes up here and oh i'm sure this goes up here well you got to look over here at your pattern to see what you're doing and then if you if you don't you'll get your scene all mixed up now a lot of you was pick i had a picture of a great beautiful countryside and a cow picking grass up in the top of a tree now that wouldn't be right wouldn't cause you don't pick grass on top of a tree so that's what it is if you the holy spirit doesn't place that scripture together then you got the whole great picture of redemption that's what we want the truth and until we know the truth we'll just leave it alone and then when god gives us the truth so then i i'll speak of it you know what i guess brother roy slaughter and and some of the old-timers here it started back under a long time ago that was for about i guess the first three or four years of my ministry right here at the tabernacle i wouldn't even preach on the subject of hell because i i couldn't make out whether it was a burning place whether it was a grave and every time the word spoke grave i get the translations that hate these hades is the grave every time i spoke of hell hades the green and i just left it alone so i really found out what i was speaking up then i preached on hell so when i really found out the whole picture and seen where it was at because i feel that a minister is responsible to god what he tells that congregation amen because they're going to hold right on to them and so then what if i've got them holding on the wrong place and then the time comes up where that hope won't stand and then that vision the lord give me some time ago when those and millions when at one speaking to me said uh you'll be judged first for the gospel you preached i said i preached the same thing paul is and the rest of them all those millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that amen that was it right so i want to continue on tonight now so it won't be too long and don't forget now i did this morning i got a little notes here this morning i spoke on uh daniel in captivity gabriel coming to him uh and instructed him of the future that's what we had this morning the instruction of the future now tonight we're talking on the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel next sunday the lord willing placing the seventy of weeks where they belong in the time element and where are we standing now if we can only find that and make it sure positive then we'll know just the hour that we're living now we won't know when he's coming no one will know that jesus doesn't know it himself he said he didn't he said just the father only knowed that not even the angels know it none of us know when he's coming but we can tell that the hour that the time that we're living knowing just how close we could be now for a little laugh over because the boys are taking tapes of this machines are running back in the room and the tape scores are sent out everywhere now this morning's lesson as we reviewed back on the fourth and fifth chapter then we stuck the beginning with the ninth chapter of daniel and now tonight we're continue on with the ninth chapter before we approach it let's just bow our heads for a moment and speak to the author of the word our gracious god we are sure that you know the very intent of our heart you know why we're here you know that we never come tonight just because that we thought it would be a nice place to come to take a little relaxation for the afternoon father i do not believe there's one person here for that purpose i believe that we are here tonight because we are deadly sincere honest and wanting to know thus saith the lord we love you lord and we love your word if this place that you have provided for us just a roof over our head and these concrete blocks we are thankful to you for the place amen for we believe that there is a home beyond the sky where we are headed that way and we think of our forefathers that didn't even have this privilege and it makes us die our hearts and shame lord they even complain now father we pray that you open to us tonight the scripture come walk along the side of each one of us as we go down this road tonight speak to us like you did those going to emmaus from jerusalem that when the service is over tonight we might go to our different homes and say did not our hearts burn within it as we heard him speaking through his word bless the reading bless my feeble efforts lord open my mouth to that which is true and closer to that which is wrong and get glory to thy self and glory in our people that they might seize the hour that we're living in the near coming of the lord jesus while we ask it in his name the name of jesus christ amen amen thank you now to laugh back our scriptures for a few moments we find that daniel had been in captivity for 68 long years think of it i use your paper and pencil i didn't get it this morning mate pick it up tonight from 8606 to 5 38 take 538 from 606 you got 68 years daniel had been in a cafe no church to go to no sermons to hear nothing but he had some books and scrolls that a prophet before him had prophesied and was with jeremiah now while in studying all the scriptures he seen time was running out that the time of the 70 years and daniel solemnly believed every word that jeremiah the prophets fought and i say to this to my class tonight should we believe our prophets amen yes sir for the word of the lord came to the prophets they have thus saith the lord and a true prophet will never vary from the the other prophet's word they'll never make it say something that it doesn't say it they'll say just exactly what their true prophet said that makes them a prophet then when they get that and then they foretell what is to come knowing this with fear in their heart unless they should say something wrong it should lead somebody astray we never want to do that we want to be absolutely sure that we got the word of the lord before we say thus saith the law it must be an absolute direct message from the throne of god or we should never say it now while in studying the scriptures he's seen that the 70 years was running out so him being that 68 years left two years in the future until god would restore his people back to their homeland while in prayer we find out that there was a mighty angel came from heaven can anybody call his name abraham and he is the angel to the jewish church how many knows that everywhere it's gabriel gabriel is the messenger to the jewish church came to mary came to zechariah always it's gabriel and he's one of the great angels of heaven and did not he bring our brother daniel such a wonderful salutation from god oh daniel greatly beloved wouldn't that make you good to think that god loved you if i wasn't greatly loved i just like to know that i'm kind of loved a little bit up there with you sure just kind of he thinks of me once in a while just make me just want to scream to think that he even cares for me and we have the shirts that he does care for us because while we were yet sinners christ died in our sin brother and now have which we were alien from god now has made us not under god and has given us the earnest of our salvation that is the holy spirit and with the faith in there that lifts us up above the things of the world and we ride over the top of it that's glorious isn't it amen all right while in prayer gabriel come and told him that there was not only two more years before they were going back to the homeland but told him the entire destination of that nation thank god the entire destination every journey of earth gabriel explained it to daniel that he was sent to tell daniel this great thing how that prophet must have fell and he told him that there were 70 weeks determined upon the people unto the consummation that's the end time so it's all over the consummation he said there's 70 weeks some of them allows that to months some today some if it's just actually weeks is only about two and a quarter a year or one and a quarter years of it and they see you that's what we got to find to be truthful 70 weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose for what whose people wasn't determined upon daniel's people the jews and what was it determined for upon not only daniel but upon daniel's holy city see daniel's holy city now christ what was daniel's holy city jerusalem and now we're going to take maybe get to it tonight where was jerusalem who founded jerusalem you ever think of that who founded jerusalem when was it found we go get to that john who founded jerusalem boy it's a little bitty thing hid back in a corner but it sure tells it answer who founded jerusalem and when was it found all right and that's daniel's holy city and we do understand that that city which is now been a curse for 2 000 years will be rebuilt and re-established again hallelujah and the temple worship will be set up just like it was in the beginning that's right jerusalem will be now and there will be a sacrifice daily opportunity offered again just like it was in the beginning we're going to get into most of that i guess tonight or a lot of it now i want you to know friends that striking all these things i'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting it so that when the weather cools off for a little later when we get into those seven seals seven vials seven trumpets all these things that i can refer back and say do you remember on the 70 weeks of daniel do you remember the church age when it went up and what taken place i mean 70 weeks of daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space is what it covers now now not all of 70 weeks of daniel part of it 70 weeks are determined now there was a six-fold purpose in his visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there was a six-fold purpose of his coming now tonight i think we leave off over here in the scriptures of where that we was at this morning were that there was a six-fold purpose here we are now we find out that there was the six-fold purpose one of it now let's get the fourth chapter of fourth verse 24th verse of the ninth chapter of daniel and seventy weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that is all that the journey of the israelites will have in this earth they are determined 70 weeks is just determined that's all israeli to the jews upon thy people and upon by holy city therefore this 70 weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the jews and also to the end of jerusalem until there will be a new city bill ah oh i hope we get into it real good and deep tonight or to turn it upon my people upon my holy city what to to finish the transgression what did he tell him now he was trying to find how long it's going to be i know we're at the end time like we are now lord how many in this class tonight believes that we're at the end times amen thank you we are at the end now we're trying to find by god just how long that's going to be what day are we living that's why we're going back and picking up these prophets and so forth and trying to find out where we are and that's what daniel did he set his face to god how many read daniel 9 today raise up your hands all right to see his prayer high made his confession of his people his confession of himself he wanted to be sure that he found out when they were to go back because he wanted to get the people ready to go back now what i'm trying to do is find out when we're going up and get the people ready to go out and we've set our face to god through prayers and supplications to find out lord what's the hour we're living in we've seen all these different things happening we see the world in chaos we see the time at hand the sand writings on the wall everything that god said we hear our president speaking of another wall right now coming we hear prediction is in the often a few hours after war is predicted that nations will be nothing but volcanic dust and we know we got it so we know before that takes place the church has got to go so lord where are we at that's reason i believe that he'll let us know we set our faces to find out now first let's find out 70 weeks harder terminal 9 people holy city to finish the transgression making the end of sin and uh to make reconciliations for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy that was the sixth full purpose of the visitation of gabriel now let's start number one if you want to mark it you've got pencils number one to finish the transgression that's the first thing now to finish the transgressions of israel who transgressed against god will be the turning away of the ungodliness of jacob now to find this let's turn to romans the 11th chapter of romans and begin with the 21st verse of romans 11. now we're going to what finish the transgressions romans 11 21 all right far if god spared not the natural branch which was who israel take heed let's also spare not thee now i want you when you go home and read this whole 11th chapter in this reading this sort mark down the whole 11th chapter and read it spare not thee behold therefore the goodness sirty of god on them which fell but towards the goodness if thou continue in the goodness otherwise thou shalt be cut off also be cut off and they also if they abide not still enough if they abide not stealing unbelief shall be grafted in for god is able to grasp them in again amen see telling that there will be a time that when the gentile will be cut out and israel come back in again for if thou were cut out of the other olive tree which is wild by nature gentiles and were drastic contrary to nature we were contrary to nature aliens without mercy without god with no hope at all and god by his mercy to give us a chance cut off righteous israel because of transgressions and turned them aside throughout the tamil tree and brought in a wild olive tree contrary to nature onto a good tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree all right let's read all for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness and part of happiness of israel has this to israel until the fullness of the gentiles come in until god is finished with the gentiles israel was blinded they went off into sin and to transgressions against god because god blinded their eyes that we might be grafted in amen amen you get it 26 verse now and so all israel shall be saved amen amen god blinded them purposely for you and i they cannot see because god's blinded them and all israel true israel shall be saved what did the angel say lord they'll finish the transgression of israel i come to tell you that there all come a time when the angels transgressions will be finished amen god will cut off that wild branch and draft into that back that real branches amen or sometimes it makes my heart jump see i'm poor miserable people cut off i don't know not knowing where they're going and think that god in his mercy did that so i could be saved amen blinded their eyes from their own messiah shut their ears up that they could not hear him yet looked out of these miracles and looked at these miracles and things that he was doing matthew the 12th chapter 8 or 12th chapter said though jesus had done so many miracles yet they could not believe because god said they got eyes and they can't see in ears and they can't hear unless they would see with their eyes and hear with their ears and i would convert them but so that we could have a chance he pulled the curtain down over his own children's eyes amen turn these old children away from the table and turn them off the leanness of spirit that he might find that we might have a chance to live given us life 26th verse again and so all israel shall be saved that it is written there shall come out of zion they deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob amen yes he will come to mount zion one of these days upon the mount of olives they'll recognize him and all israel knows him the gentiles will be finished then that branch that's been grafted in god will take from it's the fruit that's been gathered and that wild branch will be and i remember all back in here as you read he said if that roots was holy and that roots was a holy root also the fruit that comes up from that holy root will bring holy fruit [Music] and if that root was jesus christ through his book ruth and offspring of david if that life is in him come up to the jewish generation and must call from them and their eyes blinded it we might see our lives will have to pattern with that blessed branch oh yes brother it's right amen god cut them off purposely and blind to their eyes so we could have a chance to see giving us an opportunity we walk around like when somebody paul tells him you're take heed how you do that yes man take heed for god's spare not the natural branch how will he have any more mercy on the wild branch that's already so we walk around say i'm presbyterian i'm methodist i'm baptized pentecostal that don't mean nothing to god amen you've got to be born again of that holy spirit but he come i remember he's not speaking of the gentiles i'm just throwing this in here so you see where the gentiles had their chance but he come to finish the transgression make a finish of it now if we go back into daniel again you
