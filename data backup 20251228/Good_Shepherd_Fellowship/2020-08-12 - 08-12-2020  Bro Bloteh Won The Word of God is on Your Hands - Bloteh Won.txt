[Music] praise the lord this wednesday night and we have a few prayer requests to bring to you we can pray about and we want to uh take a habit that when we we come on wednesday night we'll try to put in a little time of prayer to be able to pray for our needs and most especially with everything that is happening around us yesterday there were a group of brothers ministers that had a prayer chain around the country uh praying for uh the different needs and also most especially uh the the coronavirus situation and had a good time yesterday then and i mean just spending time in and praying for different need and it is our responsibility as a church as the sins of god to be able to to bring there before the lord every time we go to the lord in prayer we might know people directly we might know people indirectly that are dealing with base but it's our responsibility to be able to uh always always you know like paul says always making mention of those that are in need praise the lord we got a text message the sins down in tennessee our brother donald reagan sent out a prayer request he also had the cove fever and uh and i mean many of the saints down there i know brother tom crushing also and now we just want to remember many many many of the saints uh as we as we would bring this before the lord and we will talk a little bit uh in the direction of that tonight just for us to be able to to see and understand how how much this is important you know how much this is important that's that's what we will be looking in tonight you know and and us that the reason is because as as children of god you know as as the saints of god we don't want the scripture warn us not to be like the word you know not to have the kind of attitude the people are having out there you know but we have to we have to be looking at things through the eyes of god and the eyes of god is the word of god amen is the word of god through the scripture and the message of the owl that's the art of god the bible says the art of god go about for through the earth and that's the word of the lord and uh which of course uh if we want to make it particularly is a prophet ministry he has a seer he's uh so uh uh and that is the reason why i want us to you know uh i mean we we have to condition ourselves we have to we have to condition ourselves you know uh all of these things they are all uh exit of things you know we would look at that a little bit they all exit their situation and uh we know also in the scripture when moses was about uh and and the people of israel was about to to come out of egypt the bible says that many of the give them gifts in in waterview it was in one sense it was a way of appreciating them for taking the play from upon the nation because all egypt knew that what was happening it was because of these people praise the lord and and and and the the direct effect is because moses message was rejected by the leadership of that day we will be looking a little bit of that so when it came to the place where i mean uh you go back and you read in exit or there moses will say okay take the plague i will let you people go then he will come back and say no we are not letting you go then there will be another plague again i believe pharaoh and his counselors were having a meeting and meeting and we're telling him pharaoh let me this people go our people are suffering our people are dying so there was an attention all the egyptian knew that it was the god of the hebrews that was fighting for them all the egyptian news that there was the god of the hebrews so finally finally when it was finally said and done that pharaoh was going to let them go the egyptian brought gifts and appreciated them praise the lord because finally they will know that these people have spoken to their god and that god has rolled back the pledge from upon them a few of those things will look at tonight but before we do that i want us to just let just go to the lord in prayer let's buy our heads in our house tonight and [Music] all precious is the floor let's let's play there uh what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of jesus praise the lord let's buy our hands let's pray together let just thank the lord for his grace let's thank the lord for his mercy let us commit ourself in the hands of the lord let's take a moment and think about god goodness god

until it reached our home until it reached the one that is close to us when we go to god in prayer let us not just think about our petty needs when there is a great thing that is striking the world many families are out of jobs many people are worried about their children going back to school let us not just be complacent because we can go from our house to work or because we can come to church there's a church that is close tonight they are not having service because their pastor is sick [Music] you think about what it will be if it is in your shoes father we just pray tonight remember your children lord as we bowed our heads as we bought our hearts it's written in your word father that if the people that are called by your name the bride of jesus christ father if we will humble ourself

merciful be merciful jesus we love you we appreciate you father we glorify your name tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen [Music] blessed be the name of the lord jesus amen thank you father praise the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians let's uh go right into the world tonight listen to our feet for a wednesday night in a prayer meeting by the grace of god we try to approach our wednesday night service this way where we can come and just have a little time of prayer and praise the lord amen amen amen the name of the lord is a mighty tower the raptures run into it and they are safe praise the lord the name of the lord is the mighty tower the righteous run into it and they are saved we have had [Music] just like i said you know sometimes when things are very close you know that was what the enemy said to god concerning job he says well flesh for flesh it's a flesh for flesh bone for bone it means that when it gets on your flesh that's when you know it's real you know you can have a natural problem you you can still wiggle your head around it i mean uh you i mean you don't have a place to sleep you can humble yourself and sleep in somebody's palate you know but when it has to be something that you wake up every morning it's just upon you like pains in your body something that is just upon you when it's flesh for flesh that's when you know it's real then i forgot to remember my mother-in-law tonight she's not feeling well but we cover covered prayers for her as well and many of the saints uh the alice are settling down with the home situation so they are not in church tonight but here in acts we pray for him and all of these needs praise the lord let's look at a familiar scripture tonight in john chapter 10. it's in john chapter 10 it's in john chapter 10. i trust that the law will be able to help us he has been faithful and in john chapter 10 i want to make sure that i'm saying the right thing here sorry that says in john chapter 10 matthew chapter 10. i was looking there i was not seeing the verse so i was saying where am i matthew chapter 10 verse 34 matthew chapter 10 verse 34. matthew chapter 10 verse 34 think it not that i am come to send peace on the earth i am i came not to send peace but a swore for i i am calm to set a man at variance against his father and a daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's fault shall be they of his own house he that love a father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that thicket net his cross and follow after me is not wealthy of me he that founded his life shall lose it and he loses his life for my sake shall find it praise the lord let us pray together heavenly father in the name of jesus that's the portion of your word that we have read father uh this part of the scripture has created a lot of questions in the minds of father because you are the prince of peace and these were your very words lord so we need you to help us tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen if you ever if the lord bless you you may have your seed if you have ever taught to ask on that scripture i've received a lot of questions on it so you you might not be the only one thinking about what it means you know what it means that jesus said he come now to bring peace i would say to you like this and uh and the reason why i'm going down this road as we go along you will you will pick that up if not uh we will be able to drive you dear to that talk now you we have to know that jesus never came because of the kingdom of this world amen no he never came you know the the the jews ask him is this the time that you establish the kingdom of israel he says no it is not in my power to do it praise the lord so uh in setting in setting this just just to put ourselves into uh the context in the mindset of what we want to talk about tonight is that we have to realize that uh uh uh the jews were all were being suppressed by the romans at the time and and they were looking for uh for a deliverer they were looking for a moses to bring them out and uh yet it was a time of an exeter because at the very same time or in comparison uh uh pharaoh was killing the young children you know in egypt and yet herod also was commanding that the children from two years old down should be killed this was a time of an exeter but in the mind of the jews they were looking for a physical deliverer while jesus was on a spiritual mission praise the lord so he was on a spiritual mission are we together praise the lord so uh uh there was there was one of the places where uh the jews could see his work they could see some of the masonic sign they could see uh that no man can do this kind of for work except god be with him but yet they were also not seeing the national politics in jesus jesus was now partaking in the national politics he was not raising up a group that would riot against rome he was calling them to a spiritual kingdom he was calling them to a new birth and to prepare them for a prepared city that's what we've been talking about amen now we are we grabbing the the thought now of how we're going to drive down this you know so uh uh uh it's easy for for them for for a man uh or a woman on an individual that is that was so filled up with the politics of that day to year jesus making this statement and says yes yes this is what i've been waiting for yes yes this is what i've been waiting for we're going we're going i mean we would get on these romans but that was not what he was saying as he comes down to the end of his statement you can slowly see that he was driving to something different he that would not take up his cross and follow me he that loved his life would lose it he was coming down to out of death now so as we deal with all of this it will be it will be good as we uh uh talk on different things just to be able to keep ourselves uh in in in the right place prospective so we can know how to put our prayers before god so we can know what we are dealing with praise the lord no one nobody thought that covet would have been till now and now all the experts are saying we i mean we we are going uh you know uh we might be dealing with it towards the end of the year then who knows when it's going going away nobody knows praise the lord nobody knows when it's going away because it's a plague and every plague to the earth like this kind of a plague that is that is one of the things we want to we want to look at tonight and and and and bring ourselves to the realizations that this is end-time judgment this is end-time judgment a plague that will come upon the world to affect the world in this way and affect the economy of the world this is end time judgment praise the lord there are things other things i was thinking about i was i was really in between taught of what to talk about tonight just in the same context knowing that i don't have all of the time so i decided to go this way and and and uh uh brother branham told us about the last day's spirit he told us of laodicea's spirit and what it means the people right and we know all of those things have been around us people being i mean claiming for different rights and all of that but i will start up tonight it's just afraid i didn't get my coach in a decent order tonight but i try to throw them in let's let's start to read okay let's let's take this first this is the seven church age ages that is the cinco the the single copy brother brandon preached when he first preached the church ages uh uh before he went into uh you know preaching the exposition of the church ages this is the single copy now watch this statement because we have a few of them to read and we'll try to keep them in context he says and when the mystery was revealed this is 1954 he says when and when the mystery was revealed in the for the baptism of the holy ghost then if you go back and and and and study this you realize what he's talking about here the mystery being revealed for the baptising of the holy ghost he was talking about the pentecostal age amen he was talking about the pentecostal age when a pentecostal revival when the pentecostal fire fell let's say that way so when when the mystery was revealed in there for the baptism of the holy ghost and then the people then how the church did not move up and those who were moving refused to walk in in light and then they went back he says and the plague was open at that time and poured out upon the earth which was influenza that killed all the people as it did that the thousand times thousand and and and then coming down into this last age where we are here so this is his direct revelation to the church to the church the revelation of jesus christ told the church when they rejected the pentecostal revival it has it has been like that all through history when he rejected moses message there were plagues that follow it in the land of egypt amen we will read some few things from from the seals that will but i wanted to bring this out because gary said he's talking about the pentecostal revival he says when he reject when when when that mystery was revealed when god pulled out his spirit following the the the what he was doing through the ages with the reformation when when that mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost he says how the church did not move up and those that were moving refused to walk in that light praise the lord they refuse to walk in that light when you read when you read church history you read around the azusa street there were a lot of 10 meetings that were that were happening i i was reading an account of a man that that testified uh uh of going to to the tent meeting because all they were saying that those people in those 10 revival were spiritualists people were keeping their children remember brother branham his mother-in-law never wanted him to take his wife there because they were all afraid of that move they taught that it was some kind of a a a spiritual thing that was going on people speaking in tongues you know and and yet people were receiving their healing but they were not understanding that you have to know that the church has gone on this uh roman suppression the church lost its identity from pentecost amen they lost their identity from pentecost from the book of arts so all the church knew was just the quietness i was reading uh uh the history about uh uh josh muller he was he was he was he was a revivalist and and he was one of the man that that brought a change to our church order because those days in england the people that have money took the best seats in the church yeah the people that have money took the best seats they paid i mean the rich guy would pay for their family to be in the front because church was more like just like a theater when george muller came he rebuked the church for that because he found a place in the book of james and he stood on that word and he rebuked the pleasure for that many of the wealthy men stopped stopped coming to church because it just felt like they could not sit down beside the farmers in their jumpsuits praise the lord so god god raised up different men for us to be able to enjoy the labor thing i won't go into that but let's let's go ahead so what what what's happening here is the other he's uh he's trying to show us that every time as we get into the seals you will see that let's let's uh let's take another one here first see you brother branham said what is the wall part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god the angel of the church which is the messenger now not not fully yet revealed but he catches it amen but when he does he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes for to the people what does he do out there he brings a proclamation he bring he begins to proclaim that message and what does a stat a wall spiritual wall so jesus saying i have not come to bring peace i have come to bring swallow was not a physical war with the romans the spiritual war will be what the gospel amen the separation that the gospel would cause because all of these men peter james john matthew they were all attached to the synagogues they had relatives in the church system those days praise the lord philip come and tell natania he says can anything good come out of nazareth well they were all attached to their synagogues but when they when when the when the gospel message came they saw jesus uh not john a man before philip met you i saw you under the tree when he saw that he says wow peter he says your father name is jonas that was the thing that catches the elect the revelation of the word amen and then when that thing catches the illeg it makes them to see the era of the day the error of the system so now these very men that were loyal to this system announced preaching against it that's the wall that jesus was talking about these men grew up in the system they were loyal to this system but now the revelation of the hour has caught them she said wow i mean all of these years we were in my goodness then they go down and tell their best friend joseph said my friend you got to leave that church look there your finances and don't bring it to me now there they were good friends good fishermen now they start separating the revelation that they have received now starts to make them strange praise the lord that word starts to separate them no it is not them making their self strange is the word amen it's not they're making them say radical is the word it's the people that are outside that is misunderstanding what god is doing in the life of the elect amen praise the lord son will be against father mother and daughter in lord it is not it is not it's not on the physical it is not picking picking fuss on how you dress and how you cook no it's the word because when the revelation of the world comes and the elect grabs the world they will not be able to do the things that they used to do they will not go to the parties they will not go to their ceremony they will not they will not be able to do it because there is something that is happening in him even for the individual himself there is war now in his body spirit and flesh is fighting the desire of the flesh wants to pull you the spirit says no the man i used to be i'm not the same again so war is declared amen amen are we together okay sister fed i think i jump over the paragraph there let me let me go back a little bit notice what happened as we go along here is the plane of it watch this now the first thing happened there's an announcement in heaven first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfold see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds a declared war a plague fall and a church edge open praise the lord now these things don't happen in a way like yes the messenger comes yes this happened yes it is happening it's happening but the people with spiritual eyes grab it i mean like like like the believer that has that has accepted christ as a lord and savior and he realized that well all of these things are happening to them and and and and i mean the people that are loved for no reason why they hate them and and all of that so their spiritual eyes if their spiritual eyes don't grab it and understand it that is because god has started doing the work in their life then it's easy for them to turn the move of god as a set or a cut are we together so these things happen an announcement goes in heaven praise the lord it can be like jesus it was a constellation of stein the hot god announces birth by the constellation of stars so that was an announcement in heaven that a messiah was born on earth praise the lord and then the angel visited the shepherds on the hill and revealed the message to them because it had to be shepherds because he was alarmed so the the shepherds grabbed the message and go and sound the trumpet glory to god in the highest and peace to man on earth praise the lord are we together but their trumpet the sound that news the sound you have to know the trumpet for we the gentiles is the preaching of the world is the proclamation of the gospel or the message are we together and when the mess the the mystery unfold then the trump assigned and declared a wall a plague false and a church age is open you have to look at that look at that sequence a little bit there because i will have you keep it in your mind in the future to come there is something i will come back to and uh we will we will look at that together praise the lord then we we goes on uh uh uh what what is war par the the the anger of the church catches the mystery of god now fully revealed but when he does he catches the mystery of god and then he go forth to the people after the mystery has been given to them he goes forth to the people what what what does he do here he begins to proclaim the message and what does is that award a spiritual world he says and then god takes his messenger amen with the elect of that age and and lay them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who reject it a temporary judgment praise the lord now you can look at this you can look at this and you and you interpret it like brother branham said he takes his messenger and he led asleep so the he let the bride have to be aware here before we can call anything joshua you will be wrong you will be completely wrong because we realized that israel never left egypt before the judgment started falling they were dead when the judgments started falling before they got into the accident are we together amen you have to realize now keep in your mind is now for the good message but we we have to understand our time we are living for us to be burdened for the age for us to to to to be burdened for what is glory and what god is doing spiritually and what is happening naturally we we have to understand amen and when we understand these things then we don't look to the media we look to god's word we don't feed our minds with the thing running on media and all of that amen because we know what is happening amen and until you know what is happening you can never pray right you can never be able to direct your prayers are we together so let's travel a little bit here now he says he drops the plaque upon them who's rejected you have to underline that the plague is always because the word was rejected and when the plague is falling and the believers a year is a temporary judgment how we do are we together and then after that it's over then it goes on and they denominate and bring in denomination and starts off with that man's walk like wesley and all the rest of them praise the lord you know and and you know brother branham is trying to he's trying to put more picture to it so we can understand it because they rejected the word so they start denominating amen they start they start making an organization then he says here and another mystery comes what happened another messenger arrived on the earth for the church hc then when he arrived the trumpet sound a wall is declared that that is the same thing with all the church ages whenever a messenger comes amen and he brings a message a declared war because one the message will call the inlet out of the present system to the to the reveal word of the hour because the revere word is the living christ amen it will call the elect to the reveal world of the hour and then it will declare war because the church system will now see that uh uh some of their faithful dedicated members they are leaving then they will start destroying that group oh don't don't follow them they are following a man or or uh uh you know there was that so a spiritual wall so spiritual war going back to what jesus said i've never come to bring peace but as well which is war amen which means the word will always declare war on the enemy that's the reason why over and over brother branham says you know when a person accepts christ he says all hell breaks loose that's where your world starts from that's where the spiritual battle starts from are we together praise the lord so then another church come the same thing happened he declared war and and then what happened finally when uh he is cut away and then when he is laid away then pledged fall destroyed and spiritual death hit the church the church started dying out dying out no prayer meeting no revival among the people they just take an attack and stick it on their chest family of god we are in the message we have to know that this is the move of god amen and god is now go it's called the move of god because god is moving praise the lord because god is moving he's moving in a sense that he's doing things in the life of his people preparing them for a rapture things are always happening how can i overcome brother branham says to overcome means to keep the revival to be alive how can we be alive if we're not giving ourselves to prayer and to the word so that word can live through us you can take a message tag but we want the life of christ amen that's what the bride wants she won a life are we together now brother branham over and over he used this he's cut away then when he then when he is laid away it almost looks like when he is taken away when the messenger is taken away and and and we can and we can we can uh apply that but let's just say in what we want to say because my wheels might start turning here are we together again in the first heels he says he said notice trumpet means political disturbance and that is for the jews amen because what the trumpet is to the jews is what the seal is to the bride to the gentiles so trumpet when the trumpet gave an uncertain sound we spoke about it yet a little bit and talking about the different trumpets the one that called the people to an assembly the one that prepared them for war the jews were taught to listen to their trumpets our own trumpet is not a physical blowing of trump is the preaching of the word whenever the word is preached word the carcass is there where the ego will be gathered are we together now so he said trumpet means political disturbance war matthew chapter 24 jesus spoke of it said you were year of wars and romans of war see all the way down through remember jesus speaking their walls rumors of walls and romans of wall and and and plum on down to the end now that's the trumpet sounding now when you get on the trumpet you go back there and pick up each one of them walls and show you that they follow them churches show you they follow themselves wars and romans of war but trumpet denote political disturbance whereas seals deal with religious disturbance amen trumpet d with political disturbance c u's d wave religious disturbance csu is open a message is dropped and then the church is is is always so set up in its own political way yes that is that is one of the place where i want to drive to tonight amen let's look at this scripture let's look at this scripture that would be mark chapter 15 let's look at mark chapter 15 chapter 15 i will come back again to their statement mark chapter 15. amen mark chapter 15 verse 7 river seven year and there was one named barabas which lay down with them that had made insurrection with him who have committed murder in their insurrection now that was what barabas was guilty of now we talk we we now you will see what the jews said give us barabbas they actually did not ask for barabbas because barabbas was just they just wanted somebody they just wanted a murderer to be to be released to them but barabbas was he was he created a a murder he committed murder on the account of fighting for israel right in a sense that he created a riot he was ready to put bombs on himself and go right into the roman palace and blast himself up why because they they never wanted the jews to be i mean the romans to be ruling him so when you're hearing the people say give us barabbas is because he killed because you were fighting for us are you grabbing the picture amen he was not in a religious war he was in a political wall the church being caught up in the political world that's what brother branham just said you the people being cut under the spirit of the dead they are not following what god is doing but they have listening to the media and now they are caught up with a rioting spirit because of what is happening in their time praise the lord it is just because many many just just uh i mean taught the other uh uh you know if i i mean they were not on the street running with people rioting by the variety in their homes as they listened to the news they were rioting with things they were saying in your mind brother branham says our attitude today show us where we will abstain if we were in the days of jesus we will be in that crowd and saying give us barabbas why because everybody believed that what barbers did was right he killed a roman he never just went to steal are we together now you can see the picture he never just went to steal he was not stealing and he killed somebody he was not in a fight and he killed somebody he killed because he was fighting for jerusalem to be free they did not like the the romans ruling over them but what was that what was that what actually was that there is no promise in isaiah or in the old testament that said they were going to risk or swallow when god talked about the the the the jewish kingdom being redeemed he pointed to how the messiah will come amen praise the lord this is one of my favorite scripture year are we together tonight that's what we said over and over and you know and try to warn you people don't fill your minds with the media i'm not i'm not taking away your first amendment right you have a right to express your opinion but don't feed your mind because those things have an anointing praise the lord they have they have an anointing if you don't if you don't take time i mean you find yourself you'll find yourself rioting you find yourself jumping in the street hey hey hey you tired club on your head and at the end of the day ask yourself are you are you rioting for jesus to be lord are you rioting for his kingdom to come praise the lord man you can riot against the devil and his lies and his deception i mean you can riot against the devil standing for the word of god because we know we are we we we have a spiritual kingdom that we need to fight for that's the reason why the son of god was manifested to destroy the works of the devil where in this flesh to bring this flesh under subjection god manifests every son every daughter to be able to possess this lane and let christ reign in this lane in this body that's what we must be rioting for sometimes we get ourselves all into uh uh those things and even even talking about those things they will always provide an opportunity people talking about politics they're talking about the government as a child of god look for an opportunity look for a room where you can tell them about your kink we jump into politics and jump into politics and and we talk and we condemn this person and we talk and we talk about this other person we talk and we don't even talk about our king why the people are like dead because because they are losing hope there is no hope and you have a message of hope you have a god of hope praise the lord glory be to god let's pay attention here and uh and and and the scripture speaks about this uh uh isaiah chapter nine let's look at isaiah chapter nine look isaiah chapter nine it speaks here from verse five for every bottle of a warrior is with a confused noise and god man rolled in blood but this shall be with a with a burning and a few of fire which means this spiritual world when the messiah come unto us a child is born unto us a son is giving every battle is with confused noise and blood running down the street but the one that will deliver israel when he comes you're going to see those kind of a battle jesus was not gathering that is the reason why that's the reason why the uh uh uh uh us chapter five let's look there quickly we we're losing time here amen that is the reason why the the the romans they were keeping their eyes closely when when when herod heard the wise man uh we have seen his side and we come to worshipping where is the king of the jews he asked quickly let them kill because uh uh they were they were they were keeping their eyes on on these jewels they knew that they were up to something they knew amen they knew that they were up to something they you are dominating their people you are ruling them in their own land and you think that they will not be planning to do something the jews were always planning to do something they were always planning to be able to break loose that is the reason why over here in acts chapter 5 you will see that when gamilia was was advising the sanhedrin's council he said there was one jewelers that raised up and he took a hundred men into the desert there was this other one that rose up and he did this all of those people they were all creating an inspiration they were creating riot so gamalia was also saying where we see these other people they are creating their own group let's leave them if they are of god we cannot fight against him because let's remind ourselves there were other men that rose up praise the lord amen are we together do we have our picture together are you seeing where we going with this amen because because there is there is two spirit there is war in him just like in jesus day jesus was getting the disciple on a spiritual revival he was preparing him for a spiritual move of god a spiritual kingdom there's a hindrance counsel they were using the lord and the prophet to build rebellions rebellion against the jews look at this question when when they asked jesus about paying tax you know why they asking that question they wanted to see if he was going to rebel against rome they were trying to find an element in him they were trying to find an element fighting against the present government that's what they were looking for so jesus said bring me the coin whose image is this it say caesar okay let's give to caesar what is caesarean and then give to god what is god but the mystery here is that you have to find where is god image because caesar image is on the money and then where is god image where is god image god image is not on money it's not on car is now on building where is his image his image is imprinted on the life of his sons and daughters [Applause] when you cut that when you catch that revelation then you can give to god what is god are we together so brother branham says and then the church is always so set up in its own political ways and whatever more in all of his dignitary so it's that thing to watch it's that thing to watch amen so we see that and we see also in the scripture where the the the bible look look if you have time just take it down ask chapter 18 verse 12 the jews they did the same thing to paul we won a call they asked for his life because they believe that this man is speaking against the synagogues he's speaking against the law what we believe remember what jesus said they will even kill you thinking that they're doing a service to god look there are men that god has anointed for certain work let them do their work we have to find our anointing for our day our anointing for our work and do our work praise the lord amen you cannot be you i mean you cannot be the uh uh martin luther king you were not caught out to be martin luther king you were caught out to be the bride of jesus christ you were caught up to be a son of god amen all of those men you know they were they they had their time they were used in whatever they were used to do we must find our time our day follow our word for the age stay honor the word of the age because you have to realize that's the only way we can bring excellent sacrifice to god are we together so there are few things that we we we look at tonight and i want to go over them again before we close here when we have major pledge like like what brother branham talked there in uh uh uh talking about the the what is there now the influenza right after that happened the influenza pandemic was 1918. it was in 1918 when was the pentecostal revival when was the pentecostal revival hmm the pentecostal revival was 1906. amen and look between the time of 1906 and 1918 now you have to realize that god has a principle there is always a space to repaint so when the people reject the word god don't bring the judgment right away he gave them experience to repent when brother branham preached the message this uh recognizing your day and his message that was what he said right he said the people are asking for the great move of god yeah he says he said god has already he says he said the holy ghost have already run around the nations see all of these men a.a allen and all these men i was growing the gospel trumpet was going he said this period of time is a space to repaint if america will repent and recognize his name but then when the people don't make use of their space to repaint then the judgment comes after we together don't run me into end of the world theory it's not end of the word uh uh how you call it now conspiracy theory i'm preaching here amen it's not end of the world conspiracy theory don't don't put me into there praise the lord so it has just been just like it was in the exeter moses came and bring his word it was rejected he went back how many times he went over and over and over to pharaoh's house he never just went there pharaoh says no i won't let the people go okay let there be flight nope he gave them space to repent there are other elements that we will bring we'll talk about but let's look at this you know a pledge it has always been on the the full thing we identified from the book of ezekiel the last time is is a swoll pestilence you know what god used as a whip to whip a nation or to whip his people amen so even all of this must be able to grab the children of god attention instead of filling our minds with all of the lying theories on the internet we must be we must be putting our face before god we must be making our life right we must be lining up with the word of god cutting off the things of the word am i saying the rapture will come at the end of this year no that's not what i'm saying what am i saying get ready for the rapture because i don't know when it's coming that's all i'm saying be prepared be prepared don't get swallowed up in the last day spirit don't get swallow up under the politics of the day am i saying don't vote that's not what i'm saying go and vote praise the lord because people listening to this to this they don't grab the spiritual message that is in it pretty soon they say well he said this he said this he said this church you have we have to realize that all that we are doing here in this building as we come every time to church all we are doing is that we are building we are preparing an atmosphere we are preparing an atmosphere we are putting our mind we are putting our spirit into an atmosphere for god to be seen in our midst praise the lord [Music] amen i mean there are people that will spend all their time and you know uh uh uh at the puppet and talk about the politics of the day and go into the government and go you know i'm i'm i'm just i'm i'm so poor in speaking so i just stay with the little thing i know i don't i don't if you know me i don't i don't like preaching politics but there is a concern where where my concern is is that spirit like brother branham said the church goes into the politics that's where my concern is because that's the very same thing the jews were doing and in doing that they ask for barabbas and they say crucify the word that's what i'm pointing out to you tonight that if you get in the last dead spirit and the riot and everything you will be crucifying the world in your life because the world will not have effect the world will not be able to have effect and then pretty soon your mind is filled with racism you see it out there you see it in the church you see it everywhere you cannot believe god's word uh uh you can't believe god promises because now your mind is filled that they don't like black they don't like white they don't like blue because if your mind is filled with god promises you you will know that he says i will supply your knees according to my riches in glory not according to american economy that's where i'm driving tall because that's the spirit of the day that's where you yeah everywhere everywhere that's where you hear it all the movement is there all surrounding this race race we have to know we are a super race the bride is a super race musicians you can come for tonight we will continue praise the lord i don't have no political party to come and campaign for you behind this puppet you make your own choice a campaign for one thing is the kingdom of god we we sang this song one time i we tried a long time ago what i wrote it in that the the word of god is on your hand or the blood of jesus it's on your hand one of the two
