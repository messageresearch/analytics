e e e [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] bless you I got into something didn't I uh I want to thank the Lord real well for undertaking for brother caps' boy that U just so happened and this is a little time that I come back to Indiana I know you're not recording this I suppose not and so then don't see nobody in there so then I come back go squirrel hunt and so U I guess Charlie's going to have to put up with me him and Nelly and I'm down in Kentucky now for a day or two to squirrel hunt so uh I'd rather miss anything any other kind of recreation than come here on about the middle of August and go squirrel hunting with Charlie and Banks and all of them it's kind of a traditional thing with me and so um I took Joel when we was here the other time everybody got sick it Chang from that real hot cloud clim down to this to this cool climate you got here I know you think this is not cool but you come out to Arizona once it's 109 the shade when I left the other morning and then around midnight in the night when the cool air come down off the mountain is still 96 see that's at midnight when the cool air was coming down and so it's that place is all right in the winter time but it's for scorpions and lizards in the summertime not human beings even though all the animals take off for the mountains they just can't stand it and I'd been out to shootting my little rifle in uh somehow I just want to tell you about the little caps boy and I said and Joel I just have to give him the rifle cuz he can out shoot me we got it shot in and I I driveing tax 50 yards and I said to to Joel Joel said Daddy I believe I can do that poor little fell that had a headache I've been praying for him a high fever he went out the range with me uh any uh 2 over 10 boore and a 22 rif FP crosses its line of fire at 25 yards is in again at 50 just the same if it's 2 over 10 so then um and I shot it in 25 yards and so I had two more taxs and I and if Joe didn't drive both them taxs I didn't have any more tax so I put a little bit of piece of an old clay pigeon have been bursted there what Trap Shooters shoot at just about about a qu of an inch across and tuck it out on 50 yards and he cut it half and two and the scope was set for my eyes just a few years older than he was so he said you know what I've got to go by and tell Billy to keep off of my feet from now on so I said well I tell you what said let's go down show brother Norman that I said Joel and matches across the world I don't care who it would be nobody now the tax wasn't drove sideways they were drove straight through and that piece not over uh I guess a qu of an inch and a 16 thick and a qu of an inch high he cut it half and two at 50 yards I said there's no one in the world could have made a better shot they a Champions could have done the same thing but you couldn't have made three better shots than them the T's not B just a straight hold through the paper where the attack went through and it's just simply spread out you can buy anything out cheat lie steal everything else as I said a few Sundays ago and look where you're at nothing but just a crooked massive everything but a righteous King can make his own laws and you can kill a man you're no good politics that's all right you get out of it see and so it's it it the democracy is a good idea but it won't work you're like communism all things in it sounds good but it won't work now the God's way of having a king like David was was right and you got one mind centered over like one leader and a bunch of geese or so forth you can't take two or three of them then you mess them all together you come up with any kind of an idea so we find the conditions today ready for the coming of the Lord but while brother Neville and I and these other brothers are trying to Shepherd A Flock I've got something on my mind now that comes that we might talk about that is I got a letter the other day from a fine lady I never got it come through another person and she was certainly tearing me to pieces or trying to was saying did you ever can't you Christian businessman do something to stop brother said because that he's got this book out now called the lady of C Church age bringing out more and said he's just simply tearing Pentecostal Doctrine to Pieces said now he's talk about the initial evidence ain't speaking in tongues and said then he's against women preachers and this was a woman preacher and her boys some of the best friends that I got in the world she they're among the best friends that I got and she said now and this man and wife I was eating breakfast with him they said brother Braham look at this would you think it and pulled out a letter I said well sister she just don't understand the boys told me their mother was a woman preacher and and she didn't go for the message and now she says in here she said now he said women should not have authority over man said how about BBE in the Bible Bible Paul's helper certainly she was a seller of goods and uh Paul asked the people you think Paul would say let the women keep silent in the churches not permitted them to speak and turn around and say now feebe my helper in the gospel he should go to preach a few nights well he' contradict his own word and said then the top of all I believe it was Esther was one of the judges in the Bible said a woman was a judge in the Bible if that's not authority over man and this businessman that was healed right here in the church not long ago he said now his wife said brother BR that always puzzle me I said well sister how would that puzzle you said well here is the woman judge I said that's politics not the church amen I don't have nothing to do with the church Paul let it be under obedience as also saith the law right and the law can't put a woman up to be a priest can't put it up you never seen a woman high priest never seen a woman a priest nowhere in the Bible you never seen a woman a preacher in the Bible amen certainly some of them was propheus and so forth maram and different ones and Esther or one of them was a judge over Israel sometimes they were Queens over them and so forth like that king and queen the decease of the king the queen had to take his place to the elect of another king and so forth and Tu in Tucson Arizona we got a woman judge there in the city that's the reason the city is so polluted and we got a woman ain't got no business in politics she got no business in the O over any Authority in the church her place is a man's Queen at home outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth you'll never find it I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible and I know that after my going away from this Earth that tapes and that books will be living on and many of you young children are find in the days to come and this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord now we wonder how a woman that's a good woman and she is brought on this Earth by her loyal husband a good man some of the finest boys that I ever met their man that I've ever met and just quickly just as soon as they heard the message they were sold on it 100% now that can only come by for ordination the only way it can come now the question is here I thinking that see not why the Lord was bring me back and know it knowest know it not art naked miserable wretched blind and know it not before I get to that spot I might brief what I said a few days ago he in a message on I believe it was the uh God of this world blinded the eyes of the people that they absolutely worshiped the devil and religious Services did you all get that all of you understood it and then in that same message I brought the subject that a woman wearing immoral clothes indecently she is be judged at the Judgment bar as a street prostitute that sounds awful strange let me draw you a little picture now here is an attorney in the city of young and he's a nice man as far as as a politically I imagine he may be decent in his politics and then um he goes with a girl that's very popular they fall in love and marry they attend to all the parties and the great uh things and they all drink together finally she uh he has a nice home he lives in a nice neighborhood he's well thought of amongst the people but he both of them drink she wears shorts cuts her ha wears makeup everything just as sex beautiful woman displaying herself well she never goes to church at all neither one of them so moving next door to him comes a woman from the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church her and her husband now this woman uh let's make it methodists because the methodists go a little more on Holiness than the Baptist all except the New Testament Baptist they believe in Holiness but usually Baptists don't go for Holiness at all see they don't believe in such a thing so then now let's make it Methodist cause to believe in Holiness and uh then a Methodist woman moves next door to this woman on the same street her husband is um let's say he's a public accountant and uh or some office well this Methodist woman looks over to The Other Woman woman and when this lawyer goes out of town say his name is John say his name is John now don't presume on that now I'm miss taking fiction names now and his name is John well she used to go with Ralph and that's fix name all of it so you just so you get the story to make the picture well first thing you know at a drunken party Ral hugs her again well she gets all fired up because she's in love again with Ralph she thinks then after a while Ralph begins to meet her and she can put it over John pull it over his eyes and she thinks she's pretty smart duck because she can run with ralth married to John see the woman don't even have the very bearing of decency and she thinks nothing about that but this Methodist woman has raised up in another bracket she does at least go to church and she thinks that that woman is horrible while she says to her husband when he comes in I see that man go in there and meet her and when John's out on a Case somewhere Philadelphia somewhere he takes her out in this Roadster and they lay out on the beach I see him come home don't even pull the curtains down sometime kissing her and making love to her next oh isn't that awful she says to her husband well she's nothing but a public prostitute it's true she's worse than a public prostitute because she's a married woman and she uh This Woman This Methodist woman thinks that's horrible she never goes to church now this Methodist woman would not do [Music] [Music] a [Music]
