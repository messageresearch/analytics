Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord amen we were gone during the week as uh as uh we we announced last week and uh for uh the missions meeting over in uh North Carolina that's my my first time being there uh I've heard about it over the years and and uh now you'll realize that uh for many many many many years most of the time around this year around this time uh May June July August uh you will see that uh uh we have a lot of traffic of preachers that come through through our our church and uh uh uh some I'm I'm paying back for the days of my pilgrimage for the days of my pilgrimage so uh whenever they come most of the brothers that come they like they love to come and see us and uh you know sometimes it's h it's it's a lot of work it's a toll on us as a small Church to you know to sponsor uh lot of those brothers that come because we have to fly them in we have to fly them out LOD them while the year feed them while the year so it's a lot of t on us and uh uh but many of them come in that period of the year because of those missions meeting now brother uh Simmons there he has a uh uh a 10 meeting a camp meeting 10 meeting that he's been having for many years so it goes to the 10 meeting so the 10 meeting and the Min the the missionary meeting is just back to back you know they always have it one week the 10 meeting and then the next week is over in uh one week in South Carolina then the next week in North Carolina with brother Joe Green Joseph green uh we having sometime in September I think uh the te week in September he should come down Vis with pass now brother Joe Green took over the church from Brother Dan desley Dan desley took the church took over that church from brother Joe Green's father so Joe Green's father those were some of the early Pioneers that uh you know took the message to many parts of uh South America most especially he started to work back in Jamaica and uh you know and and many of these brothers so what the what the brothers would do is that during the year many of the brothers will send some form of missionary offering over to Bible Tabernacle brother Joe Green's church and the those those uh missionary offering that will be sent during the year brothers from all around the world will send their Church need uh uh building needs uh you know people want of uh uh most especially most of the brothers in the Philippines want a uh a Mite uh to be able to uh uh do missionary work uh and different things so there the All the Monies that will come during the year will be put together the needs will be read during every service they will they will call the different needs and they would give the sum that is needed to meet all of those needs sometimes the funds don't meet you know uh all of the needs but they will use the funds that will com in and then they will minister to the most needed there are brothers that will sit and judge and say we think that this need is most needed and this need is most needed and so they will distribute their funds to that need so uh I mean this is something that been going going on uh this year was the 51st 51 years 51 years and many many uh uh many of the churches uh around the world has been benefited from that many of the brothers in in po countries has benefited from that even some of our brothers in Liberia has benefited from that Nigeria Ghana and then just the rest of that so we I just wanted to go in and uh but also it was because there's there's a flot of uh uh brothers from from the aost that went for the meeting in Trinidad you know uh I thought that it was it was too much if I have every one of them come to see me it would be too much of unexpensive so I just thought I needed to go down and and just use one stone and uh I was able to hit I wanted to hit two I hit three so there's another family uh uh good family uh uh friend of ours in in in the message that I needed to see visit with them and just just to be able to help them on some situation so I also have to do that so yeah so it was good many of the brothers send their meetings I mean greetings brother Valentine uh he's around uh sister uni there he sent his greetings and uh Pastor Paul Pastor J all of those brothers from the a coast send their greetings and most of the other brothers that came in uh for the meeting they all send their greetings and uh uh one of the brother brother nick uh um brother nick uh uh what What's his soul name from South Africa and uh uh if some of you would remember a couple of years ago we we pray for the family that had a lust in a motor accident and uh they were coming from a camp meeting I mean a tent meeting uh uh and then uh they had an accident two vehicles and uh so brother nck lost his mother he lost his sister and he lost his brother-in-law and uh uh his dead survived the accident and I so uh uh he was also part of the meeting and he spoke uh uh Wednesday morning he spoke on Wednesday morning and uh uh he just testified he just test testified and and his testimony was really really tremendous really really tremendous he was speaking on on something uh and he said the supernatural cannot be explained he said you how can you explain something Supernatural all you can say is It's Supernatural you know the supernatural cannot be explained and you know and because of all of uh the margin of error that we have had around uh the church word it's hard for people to believe the supernatural praise the Lord but yet the God we believe he Supernatural amen so he was testifying on the Supernatural and uh because he just he just came out of a supernatural experience you know he's a farmer they they do farming there they have a huge Farm of of of cattles and and and Peaks so there there a there a form of drought there and and uh and and also the virus that was killing lot of their p with the drought they couldn't get he they couldn't get uh uh the amount of milk that he needed to Fe feed the the pig farm so and and he was about to to travel coming for the meetings and uh uh uh NE shenek yeah that's his name so he went over to one of the farm where they normally get their their their milk supply and when he got the farm told him we don't have milk you know it's been coupled of uh uh uh you know uh this whole weekend you know uh we don't have milk so he said he left uh the container he called the the you know the gallon and you know the continue he left it huge continue he said he left it there and just told the man if uh you know if there would be uh in because what they do is that uh you know they were they uh uh you know they milk the cows and then uh uh the process the milk is a milk processing farm and then the the SPO milk is what they gave over to the C the pig farmers and they go and feed the pigs with it so I mean they didn't hide in but he left his uh you know uh thing there took it down from the pickup left it there and went back and uh uh uh I think two days before he would make his trip to the states he decided to go back there you know called the man the man told him you know yeah we we don't I mean really we sorry we didn't have milk to to be able to uh to give you but what happened is that when he got back there the the the Contin he left a very big barrel was filled with water and he said for the first instant he got mad I was supposed to get milk why is it filled with water you know and uh uh so uh but then he asked the farmers to load it onto his truck and he drove it back to the farm so when he got back to the farm the you know the the wife he came with his wife and daughter you know and he you know told them this is what you know I don't know what what's wrong I mean they put milk I mean water into the the T and all of there and uh uh you know and the wife you know the wife told him well you know well um you know you just uh you just got to deal with it or just go and empty it out uh you know and something like that so he said well he was just trying to figure out what to do because I mean the paks were dying and uh but for some reason he didn't turn the water out of the out of the continer he just left it there for the next uh two days uh a couple of days that he had for for them to come and they were really praying they were desperate in need you know because their their livelihood was was perishing right before them you know and and out of the so he went uh uh uh the following day that I mean he in the the family they gathered to pray and you know they just uh committed things in the hands of the Lord believing that God will supernaturally you know provide for them so this morning he went down now to go and open what should have been the water in the continue now uh that that's that's not even the miracle when he went to open the gallon he realized that it was milk that's not even the miracle that's not the miracle so he he called his wife and he start you know he started yelling he called his wife and says and say uh uh uh is did you know he said because he said he opened he opened the the container when when he before he took it from the farm he says uh did the the water turn into milk okay so they they they started filling they the contining and started feeling the Peaks but the the miracle that is there is that the next morning their gallon was full again with [Applause] milk praise the Lord now so even if the farmer put milk inside and cover it with water who put the next one there the next day praise the Lord and he said they had abundant of milk it just took all the stress of him praise the Lord amen so all he was saying that morning I don't care if you believe it or not I was there praise it's up to you to believe it or not he said but I was there and that was just beautiful I mean he just he just fired the place up amen he just fired the place up praise the Lord amen and we were supposed to stop to see our friend brother jeun and he's not doing well let's keep him in prayer I wanted to go to see him but uh uh he was sick so sister vanisa uh said it wouldn't have been a good time for us to stop to see him so let's keep him in prayer praise the Lord let's get to the word this morning amen let's get to the word this morning and trust that the Lord will will speak to us amen we want to talk this morning take the book and eat take the book and eat it that's the way I title what I want to speak this morning and uh I follow the Wednesday night service I would just tell you that uh I enjoy the service Wednesday night you know and uh and I just think that uh uh uh the Holy Spirit was bringing back to our mind what we spoke last week because I was going to continue with that thought and I saw that brother Dan pick it up in a different way talking about Dimensions so I'm going in the same direction but uh we pray that the Lord will will make it special this morning amen take the book and eat so we read it in Revelation chapter 10 like I said the book that was open in Revelation chapter 5 no man was wored to take the book to even handle it to open it and the lamb came forth and took the book and he loosed the seals thereof now the book from the hands of the wealthy one the book from the hands of god let's say that that way because he's the worthy one he came down and gave the book to a messenger on the earth amen and that messenger was to bring us what was in the book bring us the mystery that was in the book The Secret that was sealed in the book now here it said now the book has passed from the hands of uh of the Lamb to the seven angel in in in Revelation chapter uh uh 10 verse 8 now John has to take the book so from the hands of the Lamb to the seven angel now John is the one that is telling the seven Angel give me the book book and John represent the church he represent the bride amen that's the reason why we repeated the phrase give me the book because that is what we supposed to be saying amen don't give me Creeds don't give me stories give me the book amen that that should be the bride response that should be the bride cry give me the book amen so yes said John took the book from the hands of the seven Angel and he was store to eat the book and when he eat the book it will be sweet the knowledge of the word is sweet but the manifestation can be better amen just to get the word in your head and say the Bible say the Bible say the Bible say it can be sweet but to live what the Bible say can be better sometimes amen so John at the book and he said it was sweet in his mouth but when it got in his belly it was bit Genesis chapter 2 let's go back to Genesis Genesis chapter 2 let's start in Genesis this morning I'm a little bit I'm a little bit a little bit amen I'm a little bit a little bit let me leave it like that amen praise the lord we won't testify for the devil this morning amen so I'm a little bit a little bit I I go went to see this brother the first time we we came there from the meeting brother V and myself we sat them up talking about things I mean talking about things you know uh Church things actually and different things until almost 5 a.m. in the morning then I went to see this family that I wanted to visit sat down until 5: a.m. in the morning I asked myself what are you doing and I'm supposed to go to the I have to tell the brother Abel please just give me two hours let me sleep because I need to I need to make sure I get out of here that I will not miss my flight amen so I'm a little bit a little bit amen so just pray for me Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 you know you know the story of Genesis chapter 2 verse one thus the Heaven and the Earth was finished and all the host of them Genesis chapter 2:4 this are the generation of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens praise the Lord are we together so now uh uh uh one thing I want you if you want to if you want to take a time and and just do your own personal study on it when you go back to Genesis chapter one you look through all the verses the Bible will tell you and God created and God blessed and God said and God said when you come to Genesis chapter 2 the Bible uses the word and the Lord God praise the Lord and the Lord God is two different manifestation two different manifestation you have to realize that the Lord God speaks of Jehovah that God's family name now he's dwelling with his attributes he's dwelling with his creation so the scripture is identifying him as the Lord God Genesis chapter one the word God there is Elohim the self-existing one amen that's that is just for your own Bible study if you just want to look through and just and just be able to pick it up there and uh but the the the creation is made Genesis chapter 2 here testify from from verse one over to verse three you know and God rested and then God is declaring this is the generation of the heavens and the earth when they were created this is everything that is made now this is the beginning of time this is everything that is made now he's testifying let's let's go a little bit let's drop down to verse eight that's what I really want to get you this morning and the Lord God planted a garden in the east east word of Eden and there he put the man whom he has formed praise the Lord Genesis chapter 7 God has just formed a man out of the Dust of the earth like we have learned before in the book of uh uh uh uh ecclesiastic the Bible says man was formed upright so man was formed and his toes was like root in the earth it was not like uh you know like we we we all see that God formed no man was formed upright so his toes was in the earth and God birth into his nostril and when the Breath of Life came he just kicked his foot off of the the Earth and started moving praise the Lord hallelujah now so man was formed in verse seven and God and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breath into his nostr and the breath of the breath of life and Man became a living Soul verse eight and the Lord God planted the garden in the East W and there where he put that man let's go to verse N Pay attention now and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the eyes and good for food amen praise the Lord are we together amen out of the ground the Lord God grow every tree that is less to the to the sight and is good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge good and evil so every tree that was good for food was made praise the Lord amen and here the Bible also will speak of two trees here which is the tree of life and where did the Bible say the tree of life was it was in the Mist it was in the middle that word mist mean the middle praise the Lord are we together amen I want you to pay attention if not is going to go over your head it will go over your head praise the Lord you know you know I'm not a good speaker so you got to pay attention to really grab where I'm going so trees that were pleasant and good for food was made and the tree of life was in the middle in the center of the garden and there was another tree that's was called the tree of knowledge good and evil are we together praise the Lord let's drop down to verse 16 let's drop down down to verse 16 verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it now he has a work to do and the Lord God commanded amen and the Lord God commanded and when we when we were doing our sub our study on the beginning if you remember this this was the first commandment in the beginning the first time the Bible will talk about commandment or command it the Lord God commanded this was the first commandment are we together I can feed you I know you you you on the edge you just just watching to see where he's going just stay that way and the Lord God commanded the man saying seeing the Commandments thatat of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou e eth thereof thou sh surely die are we together amen and and and in our studies if you can remember that was the first commandment and how many words it has how many words the first commandment has 39 if you count it in your Bible it should be 39 words of every tree beginning from of every tree to surely died it should be 39 words the devil only added one to make it 4ed and 40 is the number of Temptation praise the Lord is these things are not new we have we have taught you here before we wanted we want you to sing there we want you to know that amen the first commandment was 39 words are we together now so we see here God gave a commandment of every tree thou shall eat but the tree of knowledge and good and evil Thou shalt not eat for in the day that thou eateth th eateth thereof thou shall surely die Genesis chapter 3 verse one are you following me are you seeing the progression are we together now the serpent was more subti than any beast of the field which the Lord God has made and he said unto the woman yeah have God said listen carefully people it pays to listen it pays to pay attention have God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God have said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it least ye die what's wrong with that picture what's wrong with the picture misinformation that's a lie but uh where is where is the lie that's that's what I want for us to see because that's that's where I want to dwell on this morning if you go back over to to to chapter two it will be too much reading but you already know the verses Chapter two The Bible told us it was the tree of life that was in in the Mist are we together the tree that God told them not to eat it was never mentioned that it was in the Mist are you seeing the picture praise the Lord amen so the position of the tree of life was overshadow it is the treat of life it has life if they eat of it they will ever have life but for death to come the treat of Life had to be overshadowed so what happened here over time the devil overshadow the tree of life and put the church mind and put Eve mind on the tree of knowledge good and evil the Tree of Life That's supposed to be in the middle the tree of life was in the middle it did not lose its position it was just overshadow and now she's saying that God says we can eat of every tree but the tree that is in the midst no how come that tree got in the midst how did it came into the middle focus when our focus is taken from the important thing the less important thing becomes important are we together and what is important here is Jesus Christ what is important in the in our Christian faith is Jesus Christ but when the devil can take our Focus from on Christ and put our focus on church and on politics and on different thing now those things now become the center of our life the Tre of life is now overshadow the Tree of Life That's supposed to be the center that holds everything together is now overshadow are you seeing the picture praise the Lord but the tree of life has not lost its position it has n Revelation chapter 2 I don't want to preach this morning but you're making me wanting to preach because I'm I'm the preaching is coming a little bit Revelation Chapter 2 you love the Lord amen are we together praise the Lord ah yeah Revelation Chapter 2 let's let's look here in Revelation Chapter 2 and see yeah sh Revelation chap 2: 7 you got the picture you see where we go in this morning amen the tree of life has been overshadowed and that's what is happening in our life that's that's why we have the problem that we are having the things that are major has been overshadowed the less minor things is what is what is destroyed is what we are eating of or is what is eating us up now Revelation chapter 2 uh uh uh verse 7 the bible says are we together you love the Lord amen the Bible says here verse 7 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches for him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so the tree of life never left its position it was overshadowed Through the Ages but in the church age God that's that's what the seals is all about that's what the Beast and the anointing is all about is God moving the enemy liit so once again his children can be exposed to the Tree of Life praise the Lord amen the word exposing the devil to get him out of the way so once again you and myself can feed directly from the Tree of Life do you see the picture amen the Bible says of every tree you can eat the tree of life was right there in the midst in the midst of the garden so we see that this deception in Genesis chapter 3 happened over time it was not just a one day thing it was a constant conversation of the seent in Eve and all he was trying to do was just overshot out the Tree of Life why because he's a father of death he wanted to kill God's creation he wanted to introduce death into the human Ray so the best way to do it overshadow the Tree of Life let the people eat from the Tree of knowledge and evil praise the Lord and then they will die because the day you eat of that tree that day you will die and he achieved it because when he asked Eve the God say you shouldn't eat of any of these tree he said no no no he said we can eat but the tree that is in the midst why the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil have now positioned itself in the middle for her are we together glory be to God that's the problem with the church that's the problem with the church because we are eating from this overshadow tree that's what has happened that's the reason why every Revival died that's the reason why every church denominated because all the devil the the devil don't want to take your church away amen he just want to give you a form of godliness if he can take the power away from the church and just give you a form of godliness give you a church name you know H and give you some uh some things to observe don't do this do that don't do this do that that's all he wants that just all he wants to to keep you away from the treat of life he want to overshadow the treat of life in your home overshadow the treat of life in your life overshadow the Tree of Life in the church we can just come play church have F and never have access to the word get on the word talks about things that you know that that that concern us things that we are dealing with in our life then we get angry then we get mad are we together praise the Lord so you see the picture you see the picture praise the Lord or not yet do I need to develop it do you see the picture do you see that the treat of life has has been overshadowed amen do you see that Eve now has a wrong she has a wrong testimony amen the Commandment that was given to her she's testifying you're wrong she's telling a lie that's not what God Said and that's what the church is doing we are telling the lies by the way we are living we are telling the lies by the things that we are doing because that's not what God said his church would do let's go a little bit here you know I was I I was thinking about this this morning uh I woke up earli this morning and trying to find my bearings I was thinking about this and and then I thought about you know uh uh I just having it on my mind I'm going to talk about e the book now you will realize that you go back to history a little bit you will realize that uh books are made out of trees I hope you know that amen books I made out of trees I put some little history here from you the word paper derived from uh papers that's uh uh the Asian Greek for the Cyprus papers paint plain so that's where the r took that word paper from and uh uh and as as I I I was as I was looking into that uh this morning you know there just a lot of things you start looking into that a lot of things start coming to your mind you know uh uh Pap is a take it's a paper like material uh produced from the uh a p of Cyprus uh plant and all of that his first it first started back according to history uh uh that material started back in Asian Egypt Asian Egypt were was the first to be able to discover getting uh a form of sheet out of plant to write on but later on it it became more developed in China and uh I saw this one also the money that paper is made out of or the paper that money is made out of paper money today is made from a special blend of coton and lening fabric net trees so you see our paper looks a our money looks a little bit plastic like but before before they came out with this new type of money that they are making uh uh money was made from the mberry tree praise the Lord amen so do you see why money have wings do you see you see why money have wins do you know that the scripture say money have wins praise the Lord you have not found it in the Bible that money have wins okay yeah go go check for it I'm not going to check for it for you go and check for it you know money was first made out of the mberry tree and money have wins why because it was in the mberry tree that the anges [Laughter] came you know David was waiting on the mber tree when he heard the wings of the angels in the mbed he said Lord I'm not going anywhere until you you gave me the sign to go and the Angels Came Down in the mberry tree that's why money have [Laughter] wings please don't go and preach that uh but yes papers were made out of trees and it's it's it's beautiful because you can you can just see how almighty God the word of God don't make mistake amen God don't make mistake in his word his word is truth amen you just you follow the context of the word you just see it from Genesis to Revelation you follow it you realize that God word is truth are we together yeah there God there in Genesis God is telling uh uh uh his first son uh uh eat of every tree here in Revelation he's telling us take the book and eat it it's the same thing if you eat the book you are eating the tree it's the same thing are we together praise the Lord are we together now so that's that's that's where I I I want to I want to get our mind to this morning that we talking on take the book and eat it now if you look at the word eat the word eat I it has many many definition I take one definition from the many definition that it has the word it means to consume you will soon see where I'm going with that because you will realize that it is not only with the mouth we eat praise the Lord you consume things with your eyes you consume things with your mind it's a form of eating and the same way you cons things you consume with your mouth your body can benefit from it or it can affect your body that's the same way things you eat with your ey all your mind can destroy your body are we together and the reason why I think is important because this is in in this our age signs have got us to that place praise the Lord people consume so much with their mind that their body don't feel hungry especially with our information and technology age I mean they get so much into that that they even forget that they have not even eaten praise the Lord now you tell me now tell me if if we are consuming the tree of life like that if we were consuming the tree of life so much that we are not feeling hungry for physical food what a Victorious Life we will be living what an overcoming life we will be living I CAU you to the right place I take you around the block I think you ready for preaching this morning amen I try I'll do my best so here said that God in Genesis chapter 1 verse 11 the Bible says and God said Elohim said let let the F bring forth GES and Herb yelding seeds and the fruit trees yelling fruit after his kinds whose seeds is in it upon the Earth and it was so praise the Lord so the first time there Elohim the spirit of God moving upon the Earth God breathe upon the Earth and says let the Earth bring forth seeds let it bring for ples let us bring for trees are we together now over here in Genesis chapter chapter 2 the Bible here now will make us to know in verse 8 of that promise that God made that the Earth should bring forth seeds and bring forth plants God year in in verse 8 and the lord god Jehovah over Elohim planted a garden Eastward of Eden and there he put the man that he had form and out of the ground the Lord God grow every tree that is Pleasant to the eyes and good for food praise the Lord over in Genesis chapter one he prophesied he said let the Earth bring forth praise the Lord over here in Genesis chapter 2 he's bringing the prophecy to pass amen he's bringing trees he's bringing fruits out of the earth that is going to be pleasant to the eyes and good for food glory to God Amen Hallelujah and then right in the midst of that he put himself that's what Jesus said men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God the tree of life was placed right in the middle of all of those trees that were eing fruits and herbs and good for food and blessing to the eye right in the middle of it God put the tree of life in the middle that you will not miss it it's not in the back it's not on the far extreme it's right in the middle are we together glory be to God Amen but just as we as we as as we as we have discovered here in our in our Bible status you realize that the enemy overshadowed this tree because when God there in in in in in verse 16 and 17 when he gave men the first commandment you can eat of all of these tree but this tree of of knowledge good and evil the day you eat of it that day you will die the devil say okay I see how I we get them if I can just shift praise the Lord if I can just shift their mind take their mind off of the tree of life if I can just overshadow the Tree of Life and make them to focus on the tree of knowledge good and evil that this is where the problem is if we can partake of this we will be smart we can get a better word we can make this Garden of Eden bigger the tree of life never moved it was just overshadow praise the Lord it was just overshadow and that's what the devil does all the time Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but if the devil can make your problem to overshadow God you will never believe that God exists all you will see is your problem but God is bigger than your problem but why we make our problem so big why we make a situation so great when we are believing and serving a god that is bigger than everything but the devil would take one little insignificant thing and overshadow everything you know about God everything you heard about God everything that God has done for you he will take that little insignificant thing overshadow God and all you can see my problem my sick praise the Lord are we together my my my my you love the Lord this morning he's a wonderful God he's a wonderful God let me read something to you this morning so God want to provide a place of worship listen to this you will realize that it's not only in Revelation you go you go you go over to the Book of Jeremiah God told Jeremiah to take the straw and eat it praise the Lord so brother BR is going to bring that in a way for us to be able to to grab a picture here because we are told to take the book in Ed it a prophet is God's reflector amen as the old saying goes you are what you eat amen that's what the old saying says you are what you eat what you are eating will ref reflect on you we will see it through your actions you are what you eat a prophet is God God's reflector how many knows that their reflector doesn't reflect itself no the reflector reflect the one that is supposed to reflect amen if the prophet is God reflect ref leor than the prophet reflects God Amen your mirror is your reflector the mirror do not show itself the mirror show you when you stand before the mirror your your being is reflected praise the Lord let man see your good work and glorify your father so you are a reflector it's not supposed to be about you it's supposed to be about him if you are really a reflector it must be about him and not about you the reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector is in the reflection no he's not the reflection he's reflecting somebody the son of man Ministry was to reflect the reality of Jesus Christ to us it was not to reflect brother Brandon no he was the reflector that through him once again we will see a man turning his back to the congregation and calling people by names and telling them the situation in their lives because that's what Jesus did he told the woman at the word the things that she has done the reflector is not the reflection are we together praise the Lord am I on the word am I out am I out of track this morning praise the Lord because you know I didn't get enough sleep so if I out of track maybe I'm sleeping back here praise the Lord I hope I'm not preaching in my sleep is it real okay okay Glory back glory be to God many years I remember back 1994 the same thing I didn't had a go sleep and uh we were supposed to have service that evening uh uh the brothers were having some service you know I was back in the room we were using you know uh uh our house there and that's uh way back there the in Liberia and then I was uh I said let me just take a little sleep I lay back on my head and I'm what I was supposed to preach that night I'm preaching it in my sleep I'm gone now this this brother that came to open the door brother James good friend of mine he came he says I walk I listen I thought you were praying say I listen I didn't hear nothing I said maybe maybe brother one is praying he went back and they are singing they are singing I'm sleeping I'm preaching in my sleep I just woke up oh my goodness I preach 30 minutes in my sleep so I hope I'm not preaching in my sleep this morning if I'm doing wake me up please amen yeah just wake me up you if you if you say aoud amen I might jump up from my sleep but let's go together let's let's read it this morning a prophet is God reflected how many knows that there reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't the reflection there has to be something strike the reflector something has to strike it and that's the thing about Christian Life until God strik you you will never reflect God you can reflect your church you can reflect your tradition you can reflect your idea but God had to struct you when Paul said it is no longer that live but Christ that live in me because God struck him on the road of Damascus from his H something have to strike the reflector for you to be a reflector something have to strict you something must make a difference a church membership is not enough that's the reason why we have uh uh uh you know Church bnch bunch of ARS Fighters this word of God must be changing our lives this word of God must be bringing us into the image of Jesus Christ there has to be something struck the reflector reflector is made to reflect so it's a prophet it's a chosing vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with the reflector amen Jesus said I can do nothing but what the father reflect on me what the father Reve to me I can do nothing he says if you see me you see the father because why I'm his reflector praise the lord we want to reflect our tradition and reflect our ideas and reflect uh and uh uh our Hollywood stars and all of that why why we want to do that because the tree of life is overshadow the tree of life is overshadow we are eating from the Tree of knowledge good and evil but God come back in the church ages expose the devil and get him out of the way once again the church can eat on the Tree of Life praise the Lord are we together good I'm doing good praise the Lord now because that's what I'm supposed to do as a pastor I'm supposed to keep you together amen so if I say are we together you say yes I should say I'm doing good amen so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection God to reflect the image of Christ the word nothing else can do it praise the Lord nothing else can do it no matter how we try to impersonate it how we try to impersonate it so it is not the man it has to be that man being struck by the reflector praise the Lord amen we can impersonate it try to impersonate discernment try to impersonate Healing Ministry we can do all of that but if my life is not strucked by the one I'm supposed to be reflecting if God don't comes down and and and and and Strack His Image in the bin nothing nothing you just play the drama at the end of the day your fullness will be made known praise the Lord that's that's the reason why that's the reason why he got himself a church a bride because why the Bride is a reflector of the bridegroom she don't have an idea of herself praise the lord it's hard to get all of these independent churches submitted to the world why because they have their form of Doctrine they have their organization they have their Bishops to look to so you gave them the word they will not take it but the Bride of Jesus Christ she have one person that she submit to that's the Lord Jesus Christ she don't have her own idea that's what the marriage covenant is all about she don't have her own idea are we together she don't have her own Revelation she don't have her own understanding she's only it reflecting praise the Lord amen you go stand before the miror you see somebody you don't see yourself you stand there are you going to stand there you go look in the mirror you don't see yourself you see somebody can you stand there if you running then you lucky some will drop dead if you able to run from that room then you luck it which mean you are eating well some will just stand right there drop there yeah praise the Lord that's the reason why we have we have in dead churches we having people dying in the PE because we supposed to be seeing Christ we seeing bunch of confusion bunch of facets bunch of Divisions but he's in line with the with the reflection God to reflect the image of Christ the word nothing else can do it you are a reflector that's the reason listen now that's the reason the prophet hard to eat the book because you are what you eat praise the Lord you cannot expect Christ to come out of your life if all you eat is social media if all you are eating is social media you cannot expect Christ to come out of your life praise the Lord you are a reflector then that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the straw that's Jeremiah and even and and even what what John tells us there in Revelation he had to reflect that word for that age and if John is representing you and myself through the church ages and he's told to take the book and eat it why because you have to prophesy again that's what prophecy is you are reflecting what you are eat you what you are eating you are giving it back praise the Lord you see the the church we have come up with all sorts of form and you all sorts of program things so oh let's do this uh you know let's do this other program you know yeah so uh uh uh let's do rally you know let's uh uh uh let's do uh uh Feed My People well beautiful thing beautiful thing beautiful I wish one of these days I can just fill buggers in the back of my car go down there to Salvation Army and feed people in beautiful that's beautiful but it's not enough praise the Lord because many of the times we do those things for self-gratification praise the lord we want to post on Facebook how I'm feeling I'm feeding the neighborhood me and my children we care for the poor we are feeling in the neighborhood as beautiful and as wonderful it is it's not enough because it's not supposed to be about you it's not supposed to be about me it must be about him he's the one that we should be reflecting in our home in our marriages in the church at our work in the street praise the Lord you see the word is preached and and and and and and and and I mean we have gone from revival to Revival from service to service and and and the word is coming trying to stract the image but why why why is he not getting it because he's been overshadowed praise the Lord he's been overshadowed when the word is preached all the people looking for is knowledge they want to hear mystery praise the Lord they want they want to oh wow I didn't see that in the scripture oh wow so the treat of Life the treat of knowledge is is is standing before the treat of Life what the word should be bringing out of us is life if we can just get the treat of knowledge out of the way let the words track the treat of Life praise the Lord I will not say wow I would say God help me I would say God change my life oh glory be to God God you love the Lord the Lord is good amen he's good he's a good God hallelujah he's a good God I think we have struck the call this morning are we together amen praise the Lord hallelujah the tree of life is overshadow people is overshadow see the age that we are living in go talk about mother St they call you uh uh uh you know uh uh uh woman hater sexy they call you all sorts of name glory be to God hallelujah amen the media the media is lying to us it's filling us with lies I was just reading something yesterday and looking at some documentary how the big corporate system are behind the media they govern the media they tell them what to put out there they give the the the the the influence the narrative the influence the narrative and we listen to it and then we start fing with one another no they said this no but me this this this this praise the Lord L I was I was I was looking into something and uh uh just trying to bring uh talk on the strong delusion because definitely that's what the age is honor it's honor a strong delusion praise the lord we have been fed with so much lies that the truth can be staring right in our face our mind cannot turn over because our mind has been fed with so much lies that truth can be staring right in your face and there is no way to click over just to turn over just to turn it we can see the truth we can be told the truth we know that is the truth but because we have been filed with so much of our personalities to just accept and say yes that's the truth that's that's a that's a big thing we struggle we must defend ourself when you know exactly that what you have been told is the truth that's the reason why there is just they just want you to to to tell them tell them about the games tell them about the Olympics tell them about the new development and the new technology praise the Lord but you see that's that's what it was all about because think about it people think about it now think about it before Adam fell there was no sense of hunger so how was he eating why was he eating was he eating yes he was eating but you see as long as he kept the the the the his focus on the treat of life as long as he was consuming the tree of life it was easier for him to step out and be a Son of God and say I don't want this tree here I wanted this this place why because he was feeding from that tree of life just one taste from the Tree of knowledge good and evil he's hiding behind the tree he's hiding and that's what we do hide behind excuses praise the Lord so you see it was not it's not all about what soup you cook and what uh you know what you have on the on the menu that that was that was not what it was it was all about consum it what you take into yourself that get a hold of you that consume you praise the Lord that influence you that detects to your actions that's what eating is praise the Lord because sometimes you see even people that goes on diet if you don't get your mind right you can eat all the leaves you will stay the same when you are praise the Lord because your mind is not your mind is not in a positive direction and sometimes people get on diet you know where they are doing everything but because of the constant they keep telling thems oh I'm not I'm not what I supposed to be on they they they D thems to death praise the Lord so it's not just about what we put in our mouth our mind our mind is the biggest consume consumer of our being that we have because you could be sitting right under the word and the preacher is preaching yet your mind is consuming something else you are feeding on something else you just saw something online you need to buy that thing oh you need to do this oh you need to do your you're sitting on the preaching of the word but yet your mind is consuming something else in this mind it don't stop eating it don't stop eating praise the Lord it does not stop eating glory be to God you see that that is that is the thing Behind the B B you know the buffet the big Buffet that's what behind it that's the secret behind the buffet your mind is exposed to many option your mind becomes fulled when you go around with a plate chicken fish your mind is eating your mind have seen enough praise the Lord amen let me tell you the secret sit down to the table think on what you want to eat go for it bring it eat don't go shopping it sound funny praise the Lord oh these people they putting medicine in their food when you fin eating you take hungry no your mind has eating you have seen so much option and many of the things that you see you don't even eat it praise the Lord the love the Lord let just read one scripture here almost about time a little bit over time here I thought because I was tired I was going to stop at 12:30 but you're the one I Blame You praise the Lord are we together Amen Let just read one more verse here and then we'll find a place to close love the Lord Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24 now here in Matthew chapter 24 Jesus bring out this thing I just want to bring something to you as we close here Jesus last last Sunday we talk about the same thing when you talking about spiritual drunkenness but uh Jesus bring out something here that that that goes in line with what we talked about uh last week he says in Matthew 24 let's read from 46 blessed is the seven whom the Lord when he cometh shall find doing amen verily I said unto you that he shall make himself ruler over all his Goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord deliv his coming now we have had many many messages on the delayed I remember Joe funny preached the delay yeah I don't I don't remember whether it was the first message he preached here the first time I was in this church uh uh but he preached for us here the delay and we have many brothers that have preached the delay I preached the delay myself but there this is this is something of the delay I want for us to pay attention to uh uh Jesus says but if thy evil servant shall say it in his heart my Lord delayed his coming and shall begin to Smart his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the Lord the Lord of thy servant shall come in the day when he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware praise the Lord now so Jesus is making us to know uh something that we have to was for in the delayed year is there as as as the Lord delayed delayed his coming there there they are going to be there are going to be uh uh uh people that are going to use that delay as an excuse there are people that are going to pray on the delayed and also cause divisions you know and and and fces and smarting their friend forces fighting and all of that but then he also describe what puts a man in that condition praise the Lord amen what make him to start smarting and and you know fighting causing Division and all of that a spirit that will come on the edge the Bible said it in the same the same as it was in the days of Noah what were they doing eating and drinking when we talk about eating and drinking we just think that it's just too much food no they were consuming they are consum consuming things consuming substances consuming different things that's what is happening to our age this is the age where people are con they are just consuming they get they having substance for everything I'm tired I don't have strength let me find my strength pill praise the Lord I don't want to eat let me find my diet pill I'm feeling hungry let me find my appe P so Jesus describing what what put people into that unrest they put it's it's it's in a place of of of not not satisfied so we get to the place now he he's describing something here he says uh uh uh and he begin to Smart his fellow servant and to eat and drink with their drunken when we read about Moses h h h h last week what the Moses said amen are we together in the age of uh uh uh uh uh spiritual drunkenness I want to find a word that I can be able to bring bring back to your mind glory be to God adding drunk into thirst that's the word I'm looking for that's what Moses said when they say in their heart when they look at all of these things that have been said and they say in their heart that they are above the word of God they are just adding drunken to thirst now here Jesus says they are eating and drinking with the drunken praise the Lord this morning I was I was in my meditation I was I was listening to a message and I came across the story of uh of uh of T card the testimony of T card praise the Lord pray of God testified about this young man in uh uh a few messages he was an he was an Indian God he he guards people in the mountain in the woods and he was also a missionary so one time he got lost in Arizona he got lost in the forest he try all his garden you know tricks and everything he just couldn't find his way out but then he realized realiz that uh his H Keys carry him in a certain direction so he said he called the house I think uh uh what's the name there yes that's that's what he call her he says you have been a good friend to me and you have led me out of this why even though I'm lost but now I'm going to follow you I'm going to trust you praise the Lord because you see he was go he was depending on his his his ability as a God and sometime the hearse is going this way he put say no let's go this way let's go and every time he try he find out there is no way out what he didn't realize or which of course he came to realize is that that animals has instincts they are gathered by their instincts praise the Lord so he said this I'm going to follow you the rest of the way and as soon as he said that and surr himself they go right down to a water and he was thirsty they go right down to a water she just took a little Trail and go right down to the water he was saying Oh My Oh my he got some water to drink and while he was drinking there were some other Indians up in the mountain and these guys were so drunk so drunk on top of their head that they even t thought that day was July 4th and there were a couple of things that were mied with it because they have struck a gold mine and they have got some gold with them so with the happiness of that you know they just abused thems with alcohol so the the the guy took out his gun and and you know where and and point to Peter I mean uh Tim and says hey what are you doing down here he says what I got lost and then my you know my little friend just brought me down here to get some water because he was lost in the wood for a couple of days and so they told him well we having some some some food here venison de deer meat he says oh yeah he got up there he ate some food and they asked him you know uh if you would get some drink to get drunk with them he told them no I don't drink and the guy says well if our venison was good for you to eat our lakor should be good for you to drink and if you don't drink we blow your head off so he said well okay before you blow my head off let me tell you my story I'm not afraid to die but before you kill me let me tell you why I would not drink he says uh on my mother's dying bed daddy was a drunker he go and spend his money and to get drunk and pick him up and he die a drunker he died with his boots on his feet on my mama's dying bed she called me and said te promise me promise me you will not drink you won't take alcohol to your body he said just as a little boy my hands was in Mama hands she said told me all our life story we suffer you know we suffered in poverty and struggle because your father was a drunker says right there on my mother's dying bed I promise Mama I will not drink praise the Lord so just as he finished their story there was another cowbo that was hiding in the bush you know the guy had the the the the the drink in his hand giving it to Tim with a gun so there was another cowbo that took his pistol and blow the glass off from the guy hands and he had two guns in his hands but this guy boy he was was uh uh uh someone that have done wrong he he has ran away he was hiding in the bush and there was there was an amount on on his head he was a fugitive he shut the glass off and then he told those guys he said I've been following you guys because I wanted the god I was just waiting for you to get sto drunk I either kill you or beat you and take the gold praise the Lord he said but you know just like te I promise Mama that I will not drink but I got with the wrong crowd praise the Lord he said but I believe over the kenyons and behind the other side Mama heard my gun when I shot that wine bottle praise the Lord he said I believe that Mama heard my gun she heard my pistol sound when I shut that bottle because I remember my promise promise to Mama praise the Lord and right on that Hill little team led all of those drunkers to the Lord praise the Lord he led all of those drun us to the Lord why because he was feeding on the promise that he told his mother he kept feeding on it to remind him himself it would be nothing to him if he never kept reminding himself that I promise Mama this he would have rather beg for his life or he would rather just said well is it not just to drink these guys are drunk I just put this thing to my mouth even if I just put it to my mouth wasting on myself and play drunk but because he kept feeding his mind he kept remembering his mother lying on her dying bed and said this is what I told Mama even if I have to give my life for it let me tell you why I will not drink you can take the gun and blow my head off praise the lord we feed on lot of excuses lot of reasons why we must not keep our values we feed on those things this other person is this oh yeah but the other person today are they not Christian oh yeah the other person are they we Fe on all of those things that we don't even know ourself we don't have a stand we don't have a position because we want to be like other people and not not Desiring for anybody to be like like us if you want to you want people to be like you you have to have a stand you have to have something you are standing for they are eating and drinking with the drunken it's not just alcohol is a thing that is consuming the mind like I said last week consuming the mind of our people see all the the disgrace with the politicians they out campaigning and saying everything that they are saying you just want to get in off we get the same old thing and we feed our minds with those things praise the lord we have a
