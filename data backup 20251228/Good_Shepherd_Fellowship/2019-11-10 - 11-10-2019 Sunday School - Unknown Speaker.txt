========================================

that you may speak to us for when we gather we can't tell easily what is going to happen but we know something is going to happen we are so grateful dear Lord Jesus for being the author and the finisher of our faith we have now come this far leaning on the enticing words of man's wisdom we have come this far living on your word of life and they die put your trust in you you would never let her we are so grateful Lord Jesus that it is not by might nor by power but by your spirit we shall overcome there is no doubt about it we don't care what the enemy is doing our fate is in you our fate is grounded in you and we don't care what happens to our lives we know somehow dear Lord Jesus you are going to pull us through because we belong to you we come from you and we go back to you we are children of the Most High God you have taken a delight in us our lives are in your hands and absolutely nothing can go wrong we just thank you so much Lord Jesus for what you've done for us and for what you have done for our loved ones we give you the glory this morning we give you the owner we praise thee once again father and we worship thee in the name of Jesus our Lord and Savior once again father it is time for Sunday school we have the next 30 minutes to encourage ourselves far we've been talking of prayer for some time now and we under revision mode we pray dear Lord Jesus just come and ignite our Souls around your word this morning in Jesus name Amen god bless you saints so we are still in the revision mode so talking about prayer just gathering the pieces here and there and happy to see you guys once again last week I touched a little bit on this topic and I'm going to take it I'm just going to just touch it briefly and then we skip and go to something else I was talking about situations that provoked prayer and I talked about gratitude when you are happy about what God has done it provokes prayer you want to go to God and then thank you for what he has done and we said what that does as we took our scripture reading from Luke 17 17 where they're not 10 lepers that were cleansed and how many went back to the Lord Jesus to say thank you only one did and a Lord Jesus was so happy with what he did and we made it categorically very clear then whenever God does something for you and you go back to tell God thank you what it does is that it opens the door very wide for greater things to happen in your life when you show appreciation towards the little things God has done in your life it opens the door very wide for greater tends to happen so it's a situation that provokes prayer and we also looked at desperation and we took our scripture reading from Luke 22:44 been in agony talking about the Lord Jesus Christ been in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground we know that the life of the Lord Jesus all his life was just a timid prayer but one moment why he prayed and he prayed so honestly was when he was in agony desperation said in that is what happens to our lives when storms set in when a storm comes in it cause desperation it gets you to be in agony and we taught about job here and his situation as a god driven stone we said God can allow storms to come and we talked about job last week and we also said that you can create your own strong and we talked about something and we said Delilah was not some sense enemy the Philistines were not some sense enemy some sense enemy was himself he created his own stone now so going over this we said a stone can be a good thing and a stone can be a bad thing depending on where you stand where you are standing sure on the way what a storm would do is draw you closer to God and we also talked about John Wesley that he credited his prayer life to his wife not because his wife was patting him on the back that it is time to pray no but his wife had muscles and would beat the prophet of God around like a kid and that drove him more on his knees to seek the face of God praise be to God but when you are not standing sure what desperation would do is carry you away from God instead of bringing you closer it carries you away from God that is what a stone would do and we also said that when you are being carried away by a storm it is not an indication that you are not a child of God it could be but what it could also mean is that you are not standing where you are supposed to be instead of standing on the rock you are standing on a sinking sand so when the storm comes it takes you away it is not an indication that you are not a child of God what it means is that you are lost and easy oh praise be to God now when you read when you read first Corinthians 10:12 I have it here you can note it down because we have a limited time I'll just try to capture things and then I'll see how fast we can go first Corinthians 10:12 let he that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he falls if you think you are standing take heed lest you fall what it means is that examine yourself do an introspection examine yourself against the Word of God and make sure that you are truly standing lest you fall that is what happens sometimes you find people they are not standing but they think they are standing then when the storms come it creates a problem now we all have our high points and our low points in life we are talking about what desperation as something that would draw you closer to God and when you find yourself in the gutter somewhere that is not the end of life when the storm comes and they don't draw you closer to God and you find yourself being carried far away from God it is not the end of life because the Bible says revelation 2:5 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come quickly alik I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent so what it also means is that even when it does not draw you closer to God and it carries you far away from God God is still beating you it is not the end of life God is bidding you come remember from Wednesday at following get back praise be to God and as I have 1:18 confirm the story come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool so a child of God I don't care what it is that happens you know God allows situations to come away not because he hates us God wants you to get closer and if situations come and it don't get you closer to God and they get you further away it is not the end of life God is so bidden you come he has given you that great invitation come and let us reason together praise be to God so desperation will draw you closer to God now having said this I want us to look at a few factors that would cause desperation in our spiritual lives sickness is one we have talked a lot about the third of his Phoenicia woman whose daughter was possessed by evil spirit today I just want to talk about the woman that had an issue of blood for 12 years sickness would create desperation and it would cause you to seek God then when you get to that point you can't take that reproach anymore you can't take that shame anymore the appeal on what you are suffering from you can't take that pain anymore you can't take that sleepless night anymore you would want to cry out to God it drives you it makes you desperate and drives you on your knees and it gets you to places in the spiritual realms where you probably would never have gotten to bed for that's a condition press beauty god this one had an issue of blood for 12 years she may have done everything possible and there was no remedy until she said to herself if I can only turn the hem of His garment the gamut of the Lord Jesus I'll be made to go sometimes we think maybe she just walk straight and then went and talked to him of the Lord I mean the hem of His garment and then she was made whole the Lord Jesus was a crowd puller everywhere he went the crowd followed him and I see him go this way and there was a crowd push it down I see her bodies way and there was a crowd she couldn't get through but she never gave up that is what desperation does it would cause you to do things that you wouldn't do under normal circumstances until she finally touch the hem of the gamut of the Lord Jesus when you are desperate it doesn't matter what names they call you what I might be referred to as a dog I don't care how much in sauce they hip on you it will never dump in your spirit why because you are desperate anything about a Greek woman that is what aspiration can do it drives you drives you towards God sometimes we think that when you parade those nice nice nice waits in prayer that is when you are drawing your drawing closer but God is very interested in those national vocabularies those nice nice voice if they are not coming from your heart and you are coming from here God is not interested in that if they can come from the heart if you find your heart bleeding with those wastes in prayer that is what draws goes attention if you can find your heart bleeding with the ways the Bible says in psalm 51:17 there are sacrifices of God a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou will not despise now when you are so desperate or when you are driven to that point sometimes when you are praying you can't even make sense of what you are saying you can't make sense of what you are saying if you should join those pieces of voice you are saying if you should join them together they don't make any sense to you but that draws God on the same because the Bible says a broken and a contrite heart God would not despise if your heart is ruptured is your heart if your heart is bleeding with those voice wonderful it may not make sense to you but that would rock or down that is when you hit the point of desperation praise be to God the fear of death when you read Isaiah 38 1 2 5 it talks about the prophet has a higher the Bible says he was sick unto death I don't think that worried him so much because desperation never set in until God sent Isaiah the prophet to go and tell his Akaya that does say as the Lord got your house in order does say the law you would die and not live that was the moment desperation set in and the Bible said he turned his face to the wall and he cried out to God and God had him now deaf if you can smell death from its distance you will not sit down and wait for it to come praise be to God we know is the Word of God if Christ is in one way or the other we'll be living here this is not our home but God in His wisdom has made it a secret now you don't know when you're going to die you don't know how you are going to die if God should open our eyes to rates there will not be peace in this on this earth you have somebody that is left with one year crying and mourning already you have somebody that's left with ten years wailing already you have somebody that's like I mean don't be confusion on the land sometimes it's just happening the following day and then you are sitting with your loved ones oh god bless you god bless you see you tomorrow morning you go to bed and that is the end of the story you don't know when is coming it is a dangerous thing because the Lord Jesus being God and having seen what you're going to go through in advance it wasn't easy sometimes waiting because he was God in human flesh oh it was just easy it wasn't easy that was why he could pray and say let this cup pass me by because he foresaw what was going to go through that was why God kept it a secret and let me tell you I've been a prison officer before and there were prisoners that were sentenced to death I know so what is that what is that just one day it's because they have not seen death coming so they could say anything and one thing about those murder I mean before they kill you they will come and tell you we are coming for you tomorrow tomorrow is your last day what do you want as some would say I want a packet of cigarettes the light was agreed throw it away light another one throw it away because smoked a cigarette Sam was ok I want vodka so they want to drink I'm booths and I don't even know when they are being shot at they will drink the whole bottle of vodka hardly call it vodka and so never get pushed the whole night they are restless the fear of death can trait can cause desperation when you know where you stand and you can smell death coming you will not sit and wait for it you are going to fight it and you'll fight it on your knees we are talking about the factors that will drive you to a desperate moment with God then you will cry out to God and you know there is a God that is here in you that God becomes so real to you at that point in time that has ever been and you know that you are talking to a human being you are talking to a being a living being praise be to God now another thing that can drive you into a murder of desperation with God in your prayer life is persecution when persecutions rights church is no longer at your convenience it's a murder between life and death why because persecution has come to the camp God always wants you to dial that his hotline God has a hotline he wants to hear from his children he wants you to dial that hotline he was to have that intimacy with you as a child and when God is not here in it he got gritty situation that would ruin praise be to God so persecution you don't think about imitation of the Lord Jesus Christ and what do you want true how do you may have prayed and prayed and prayed asking the Lord as the Lord Jesus said oh if it is your will let this cup pass me by and I hear them pray asking God let this cup pass me by nevertheless not my will let your will be done now you know in times of persecution when you pray and you pray and you pray there are two things that can happen either God would take you away from that persecution or take the position persecution away from you oh you are still going to go through it but God is going to give you enough grace to go through it now even when you are going through it you would wonder people will stand and look at you how did he manage is this a human being it's because the grace of God is more than sufficient it is not as if when you pray body just went stored up in the kitchen he can do it he can do it but other times you allow it but he gives you enough grace to go through it praise be to God I see meshach Shadrach and Abednego when they were in Babylon there were not just some house boys these were men that Nebuchadnezzar set as hell over some of the provinces when King Nabucco Genizah made a golden image they knew about it the newest intention why because there were men that were on top day some of his right-hand men it did not take them by surprise on that day when he announced to the people said when they hear the son of the trumpet the sultry the musical instrument everybody should buy before the golden image and anybody that did not bow was going to be cast into the fiery furnace it didn't come to them by surprise they knew it there may have prayed they may have prayed because they foresaw a storm coming they may have prayed before that day Oh father don't let him see us we love you we are children of God we are not going to bar before this image but blend your eyes don't let him see us so we don't get into trouble but it didn't happen that way praise be to God and a son of the trumpet the musical instruments wonders founded and other people bought before the golden image meshach Shadrach and Abednego and there were some children's who saw them and then went and told the king now you know what you have made a decree that whoever does not watch you die these three children did not bow they said what he goes who angry he commanded them to be brought I'm giving another chance I they sounded the trumpet you guys should bow if you don't bow I'm cussing into the very finish wonderful praise be to God when you are prayed up when you are prayed up when you know you are living in the will of God you don't care what happens as Paul said for me to live is Christ and to die is gain it doesn't make any difference oh my I thought I was just coming but I have very little time it doesn't make any difference and at Orakei okay who would not be careful to as a you in this manner we are not going to borrow praise be to God because we know our God would deliver us and if he doesn't even deliver us praise be to God we are not going to bow he said okay he commanded his people to hit the finish seven times well they did and they bound them oh I can just hear them saying whenever binding them Oh once same to the other are you ready for this oh say I'm ready how about you say brother I am ready I ready to face this I am ready I prayed oh brother oh praise God I am also prayed up we are going to go through it anyhow we shall not live if we have to die for this course wish I died to praise God little did they know praise be to God the God Himself was getting ready for them and when they put them in the fiery furnace not other than the book I did I himself stood on his feet he said did we not country three people to the furnace where I see the fourth passing whose countenance is like the Son of God praise be to God and what were they doing they were just walking in the finish walking the world they were just walking and praising God when you are prayed up when you are prayer of let the will of God be done desperation desperation will draw you closer to God and as I said already where it sends you far away from God it's not an indication that that is the end of life it's not an indication that you're not a child of God what it means is that you are not standing on the rock you are standing on a sinking saying take heed where you are standing take heed examine yourself praise be to God in case you're interested in the story are you guys know it already is Daniel 3:17 about meshach Shadrach and Abednego yes so I think I have enough time to put in one one item so remember Fotis factors that would draw you that would cause you to be desperate in your prayer life with God sometimes we don't have to wait till we get there but the human nature is that when there is nothing happening we are relaxed as I said last week if we will give ourselves to prayer and then pray and seek the face of God there are certain situations that won't even come away at all but a child of God God is going to bring you in one way or the order because you must bear fruits let me see if I can put this in having the smell of divine judgment can also cause a storm can create desperation to smell divine judgment coming your way before the judgment of God comes God would fall on you Jaguars will not just fall upon you from from just out of the blues God is going to fall on you sometimes once sometimes twice sometimes three sometimes four times sometimes forever how many times nobody knows that God would forewarn you in one way or the order just think about Jonah in the land of Nineveh when your sins came before God and God was ready to destroy them and he sent Jonah D away we know the story I'm not going to go into the details I remember one time we're talking about it in the house in our devotion and was it gospel or Emmanuel who asked now why was Jonah selfish I said selfish he said yes I said why I said when he was running away from God and they threw him into the sea and they will swallowed him he prayed for God to have mercy on him and he wanted God to destroy the city of Nineveh I said oh I get it now yes when he cried again the city of Nineveh for yer evil and from the king to the seventh and not only the human beings that King issued a decree that nobody was going to Reno but was going to eat and even the animals were not going to eat they would not drink human beasts and their animals had to fast to seek the face of God praise be to God why because the judgment of God was coming their way it drove them into desperation they sat in such close the certain ashes and they sought the face of God in desperation and the Bible says God was pleased and it repented God that the judgment of God was paid you can be in a condition you can be doing this you know out of the will of God how does God want his children you come to the church the pastor preaches he goes right there is the voice of God coming to you you can take your Bible to read and then from nowhere something catches your attention is the Word of God coming to you you can you can be outside there somebody you don't even know God can use people on the different different situations to get to you and it is the voice of God praise be to God yes so I just have three teens here I think I have to lower the kitchen table we are just a minute above your time praise be to God okay god bless you I don't know how next week is going to be if is the will of God I think to go this way when we talk about this because I'm away we'll be doing something else I'm not very sure how the preparation is gone so if we don't get to talk about this God willing we'll talk about it someday but just don't forget these things they are supposed to help your prayer life you know we have talked about prayer we have made it very clear sometimes you pray you pray sometimes you'll even get a time to pray as situation happens why you just have to speak there is no time to pray just pick we have talked about going through that and sometimes there is no time to pray and sometimes the situation just comes you know and and you can't even speak you have the chance to say just a word the name Jesus is a prayer praise be to God I have seen the name Jesus and I am a living testament there is no time that the name of Jesus is a prayer I've had a story of a child I was falling from the bed a very high bed a little baby that was just coming down the major the murder just shorted Jesus and discharges suspended in the air praise be to God sometimes that you can you you can't there is no try enough time to pray and you can't even speak where you can't pray you can't speak - how the name go - take care of it praise be to God shall we pray our Lord and our master Jesus we are so grateful for having been with us every single moment of our life we have depending on your father all this world and you have never let us down as your word says you have promised that you would be with us alway and you have kept your way because you are a faithful god we are so very much grateful dear Lord Jesus that thou art great
