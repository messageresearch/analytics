[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm going to take in in my Bible and I'm going to mark it down or whatever more. You do as you want to and then I'm going to um I'm going to get you I want you then to um to uh after you do this, write it down. And then if there's any question, I want you to be sure and and um ask me now. Ask me. So if at any future time on this tape, if somebody would have to ask you a question, you might be able to come back and explain it. Now, in order to straighten these people out and to get these two uh uh down right, I'm I'm going to have to make to almost blend two subjects together. Now, uh in Matthew 28:19, now that's the last book of the Bible, the last book of Matthew, last part of Matthew. Now let's read the last verse 18th verse. And Jesus came and spake unto them saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. I wonder does he take all God's power then? Or all the power both in heaven and earth? is it is in him now. All the power in both heaven and earth is given unto me. Where's God at with his power? Now, could Jesus lie? He couldn't lie. If he lied, then where are we? Now remember, he bears this in mind that the church of the living God, not the denomination, the church of the living God is built upon spiritual revelation. You get that in St. Matthew 17 or St. Matthew 16, it is where he said, he said, "Who does man say I am?" He said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God," said Peter. He said, "Blessed art thou Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood seminary." Somebody else never revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven, thou art Peter, upon this rock I'll build my church. Now see, the Catholic says upon Peter. If that's so, then he backslid. &gt;&gt; All right. The Protestant says upon Jesus, but not to be different, but to make the thing straight. neither on Jesus nor upon Peter, but upon the spiritual revelation. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. Then the word that's wrote and parables and everything else can only be revealed. And the only truth will ever be known by is a spiritual revelation. And if your revelation doesn't tie it together, then your revelation's wrong. See, it must split. Like if you was putting a jigsaw puzzle together and you didn't have anything on the side here to to look, you'd get the scenes all mixed up. You'd say, "Well, I believe this goes here. I believe this goes there." That's a human mind. First thing you know, your scenery be wrong. Be a cow picking grass on top of a tree. See, so it it wouldn't work. See, but if you if you got something here to go by, to go by. Well, now you say, "Oh, God revealed to me something." think if it isn't according to this word and ties the word together, then your revelation's wrong. In the Old Testament, if a prophet prophesied, if a dreamer dreamed a dream, no matter how real it seemed, the first before the church ever would accept it, it had to be proven by the Yurum thundum. You know that that breastplate of Aaron where the life reflected. Now when that priesthood ended, the year of mathundum went with it. But we got a new year of mathundum. That's the word of God. And if your revelation doesn't tie, you say, "God revealed to me I should be baptized in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost." If that don't tie with the word from Genesis to Revelations to tie it together and your revelation's wrong. You say, "God revealed me, I should be baptized in Jesus name." If it doesn't tie with the word, then the son of them don't back it up. No matter how read it seems, this is the authentic word. This is God's thunder. Now, and Jesus, again, I quote, repeat. And Jesus came and spake unto them the 18th verse, saying, "All power is given to me in heaven and earth. Go ye therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Now, I want to ask you something. Now, I just that's Matthew 28:19. the scripture you're asking me to explain what we have in view here this morning. Now, let's read that carefully. Just don't don't run over it. Read it carefully. I watch closely. Go ye therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son. No, not in the name of the father, in the name of the son, in the name of the holy ghost. That's way people baptize baptized that way. That's not even scriptural. See, it isn't in the name of the father, the name of the son, in the name of the holy ghost. That's wrong. That's not scriptural. And it isn't the names of the father, son, and holy ghost. It's in the name. N singular. &gt;&gt; In the name &gt;&gt; name. Look up in the name. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now if there's any word that you don't understand, I'm waiting for sister uh Su there to find it. You got it there. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what this &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:19 &gt;&gt; 198 &gt;&gt; 19. Now, sister Sue, I believe you was the one question the strongest. Now, does that say in the names of the father? The son says in the name of the father, in the name of the son. No. In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. Not in the name putting a name before each one but just in the name of the father and of the son and holy ghost. Now now we realize then there has to be one name there because it said one name. Well I want to ask you which one of them name should we baptize in then? Now, is father a name? No. So, we couldn't baptize in the name of the father because father isn't a name, is it? &gt;&gt; Well, in the name of the son, then we say, is a son a name? I'm a son. You're a son. He's son. Son's not a name, is it? &gt;&gt; Well, holy ghost thing in the name of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We all got the Holy Ghost. Well, here Gentile word &gt;&gt; uh the um let's say the in the name of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is it a name? &gt;&gt; No, that's what it is. We're all human. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It is the Holy Ghost, but the Holy Ghost is not a name. That's what it is. We're all human, but that's not our name. &gt;&gt; Spirit is not a name. &gt;&gt; See, no, it's there's three titles then, isn't it? Well, then what kind of a thing have we got here? Then he said, "Baptize them in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost." Well, the father's no name and son's no name and holy ghost is no name. They're not names. So, you couldn't use that for a name because there's no name to it at all to begin with. You understand that? There are not names. Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They are. It's just like I'm They call me a reverend. Some people call me a prophet. Some call me a preacher. &gt;&gt; Well, now Yeah. I'm a father. I'm a son. I'm a human. &gt;&gt; But my name's William Brandon. &gt;&gt; But But Reverend, prophet, reverend, elder, and uh minister. That's titles that belong to me. Oh, then belongs to many other also like soul, body, and spirit. That belongs to me too. But it belongs to him, him, her, her, all. See, it's all the same. See, it's titled, but that's not my name. That's not your name. Soul, body, and spirit's not your name. &gt;&gt; That's not what that's what you are, but it's not your name. Or you are a lady, you are a mother, you are a wife, &gt;&gt; a daughter, &gt;&gt; a daughter. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All them things. Then that's that's just what you are. &gt;&gt; And say you I've always called you doctor. You was a nurse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Say you are a doctor. &gt;&gt; Well, uh you are a mother, too. But that's not your name. If I just wrote doctor, there's a lot of doctors. If I wrote nurse, there's a lot of nurses. See, but that's still not your name. So when anyone says they was baptized in the name of father, son, and host holy ghost, if they'd only think it's not even a mental, it's not, it's not even it's not even mentally right. A name of father, son, holy ghost. It's just like the Catholic said eternal sunship. The eternal sunship of Christ. How can the word make sense? How can he be a eternally be a son? son had was born off of eternal had no beginning or end. If they said there's an eternal hell. Bible said hell was created. Then how can it be eternal? There's no eternal hell. Hell was created for the devil and his angels. Not an eternal hell. Everything begin ends. Hell may burn for 100 billion years, but it has to have an end because everything begins end. That's the reason we can't die because we are part of God offsprings of his sons and daughters. We got eternal life. God's life. It never did begin, never will end. See, now this is pretty strong. If you don't understand it, I'm afraid I'll get you out on a limb here somewhere. I can talk to clergymen. Now, &gt;&gt; if you don't understand, you tell me because usually you talk to clergymen like this, you see. But um to you winning, you just ask me and you're my friend. &gt;&gt; Jordan, I wanted to know. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm trying. You're you're all educated and you're you're all smart and I I don't want you to take this because brother Vandom said so. I'm a human being. &gt;&gt; I want you to take the word. And if you can find anybody that'll down that word, you bring them to me. &gt;&gt; If you can find anybody who says there's a contradiction in the word of God, bring them to me. &gt;&gt; It just won't be. &gt;&gt; It won't even try because it ain't there. See, now how could anybody be baptized? I want to ask you ladies something right now. Our new man, how could anybody be baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost? How could you be baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost? Don't you see the bottom of it? There's no such a thing as the name of father, son, holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Just saying words over &gt;&gt; that's that's titles. &gt;&gt; Liy Valley just say Lily Valley, Rosa Sharon, Morning Star, Alpha Omega. It be the same. You can be baptized just as well. Said, I baptize you in the name of Alpha and Omega. &gt;&gt; The beginning and end be just as well. It's the title. I baptize you in the name of the little valley, the morning star and the rose of Sharon be just the same as title. But we know who it belongs to. &gt;&gt; But the there could be a lot of morning stars and lily of the valley and rose of Sharon. See, so &gt;&gt; not a father, &gt;&gt; not a father, son, holy ghost. is that our human soul, body, and spirit or whatever more you want to make it. Now, &gt;&gt; now there's something wrong here somewhere, isn't there? Now, you see that something's wrong here. We can't understand it then. Let's say now go ye therefore, teach all nations. Now, you're a nice little audience, and I I want to drill this so that you'll have a good understanding. See, cuz I don't know many of my brethren, I might hear this tape, I never uncize no man or person for their ideas of scripture. I base it up on if they're saved. They're trust in Jesus Christ. Whe they are Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or whatever they are, you're saved because you're born of Christ. But you've asked me a question. Why, brother Brand, would you baptize in the name of Jesus Christ? All right. And why would you disregard Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? That's your question. And as your brethren, as a servant of Christ, I'm duty bound to answer you. All right. Now therefore when you find out here to make this contradiction now just 10 days after this after Jesus said this Peter had the keys of the kingdom. Matthew 16 I not thou art Peter upon this rock build my church so forth and I say it th Peter and I give unto thee the keys of the kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth I'll bind it in heaven. What you loose on earth I'll loose it in heaven. Now that same man that had the keys turned right back around 10 days after Jesus said this and said, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ or your missionary sin." Did you ever stop to think that Jesus would give a man that would be that scrupled up, the keys to the kingdom that would turn around and do vice versa what he said not to do? the God of heaven manifested in flesh and would turn the keys over to a man that would make a mistake like that. &gt;&gt; The very first shot to do a thing like that, &gt;&gt; he didn't do it. &gt;&gt; I'm always bothered on that. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now just now, now notice he couldn't do that. But why did he give them keys to Peter then? He just plainly quoted it. Peter, you never learned this from some church or some seminary, but it was a revelation that come from heaven. And upon this same revelation from heaven to straighten out the word of God, I'll build my church. He know Peter e he didn't know mathematics. Peter didn't know algebra perhaps or neither did he know gerometry or or I think it said that he was an ignorant and an unlearned man according to acts the 4th chapter acts the third chapter I believe said perceiving that they were both ignorant and unlearned he and John had to heal the man at the gate called beautiful but taken notice that they had been with Jesus so you see he didn't lay it upon his seminary uh theology that he could reveal reve this to him. &gt;&gt; Not upon all his seminary experience cuz he had none. He doesn't yet today. &gt;&gt; No, I know. &gt;&gt; But he reveals it, see the one that had the revelation of it. Therefore, he could trust it to Peter. He might not have been able to trust it to Matthew or to John or to the rest of Peter had the revelation. So then Peter turns around and says, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, see for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the promises to you." The man that had the keys that unlocked the kingdom for the first time, turning around and doing vice versa, what Jesus said not to do. Now, it's either he was wrong. He made a mistake. He didn't follow out our Lord's or either he had a revelation of truth &gt;&gt; that the rest of them was which was beyond what any of the rest of them had. Now, let's just stop before we go back. Just a minute. If it would have been wrong, why did God recognize it then and command all the rest of them down to the Bible to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ? And every person in the Bible was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And every person up to the or organation organization of Catholic Church was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. It's an IC council. They formed this baptism of father, son, holy ghost making a triune God out of one true God to bring in their their trinity and as God in the beginning know that man would fall. Therefore, he put him on free moral agency knowing because he could display his attributes to be a father, to be a son, to be a healer, to be a savior. How could he save that something lost? And in God was the attributes before there even was an angel or a molecule or anything. God was by himself alone. But he wasn't God because God is an object of worship. There was nothing for him to worship. Nothing to worship him. But his attributes attributes displayed something and made an angel that he was God. Then he made a man giving free moral agency. He fell. Then when he fell, he become a savior. In the fall, he took sick sickness. So he becomes a healer. See, it's disciplining God's attributes. See what I mean? Now, he also know that there had to be a lost people and a saved people. There had to be a false baptism and a So he puts it here again, a tree of knowledge. Here's one. Acts 2:38 1 Matthew 28:19. So how was it revealed to Abel? Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice. He didn't have no Bible to go by. So it must have been revelation to Abel. There was both boys. If God only requires a worship, then God was unjust to condemn Cain. Cain made an altar, built a church, worshiped, and made a sacrifice. Every religious thing that Abel did, so did Cain. Is that right? But Abel by revelation offered to God revelation. He walked by faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A more excellent sacrifice. How did Abel know it that it wasn't fruit or the fields that Cain offered? It was blood that brought him from the garden. Life was not in the fruit. Blood brought the light. It was revealed to him. A revelation. Here's the same basis he puts us on that he did on them back there. A revelation. Now, there can't be a contradiction. Now, you all wasn't always Christians. You were born sinners. I imagine as a little girl, I I don't know you did or not, but I'm going to take all of us in the room to make an illustration here now so that you'll understand. Uh when you were little girls, say you read Love Story magazine. Most all little girls do. any kind of magazine would have to be a love story. Any store? Nice. Could not been a one of these modern bookstand stores, but any store even Romeo and Juliet. See, well, you um you uh you you read a lot of story and I'm showing you this way now so that you can catch it in a parable. If you picked up a story book and you [Music]
