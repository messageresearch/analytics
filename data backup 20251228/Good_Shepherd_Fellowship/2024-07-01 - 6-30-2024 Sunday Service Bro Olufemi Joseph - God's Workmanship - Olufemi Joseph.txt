what my little girl told me and uh she reads the weather better than I do and then on Sunday we will have uh uh a communion service after the uh the morning service and then we will also have a prayer meeting uh um after that communion service uh a couple of weeks ago we we met with uh with you after service discussing U the issue of uh one of the dear ones that comes to us to church here so we will address that after the communion service on Sunday and uh uh and then we we want to keep in mind our uh worship night with brother Young's from uh Tennessee that will be the 27th the weekend of uh the 27 July 27 so uh um if you want to put that on your calendar uh he be coming down with his wife and they will spend that weekend with us praise the Lord amen uh uh brother brother Samuel Coty the the brother from India that preached for us uh is preaching this morning in uh uh Ohio and uh he wanted to wanted me to bring his greetings back to the church and and uh say he enjoyed that short time of Fellowship that he had with us and and enjoy fellowshipping with you on Wednesday night and then uh before we get into some prayer needs here we want to use this time to greet uh uh Leah that's name Leah good to see you yeah thanks for coming to fellowship with us praise the Lord I hope you're having a good time so far it's okay she said so good so far so good praise the Lord and uh uh like uh job reminded us uh man born of woman is a few days in full of trouble this going week uh uh uh we had to send one of God soldiers home brother Samuel Dale in Georgia went to be with the Lord and uh so brother Samuel that preached for us on Wednesday night was actually supposed to go down to preach for brother Samuel and uh when we got a call that he was rushed to the hospital and then uh he went to be with the Lord so because of everything down there we had to we had to change things around I I wanted for brother samel to come and another time but when he called me then I said okay let's see how we can be able to work this out so uh this morning brother fam Joseph from Nigeria is uh a good friend of ours and he's familiar with us here I think the last time he was here was 2018 so it's been a while so he was actually supposed to fly over on Wednesday night but with the change in schedule we we were able to talk with brother Benny Perry to and preach there in South Carolina while we have brother Samuel come and speak for us just to be able to accommodate the brothers and then uh uh so brother famy came in and uh uh Thursday night but Samuel flew out on Friday morning to Ohio um to to leave with the Saints there this morning and while we were getting ready for service this morning I got another call uh another good friend of our us and uh our brother uh John badugu if uh some of you will remember he uh preached for us here before and I call him uh uh I call him brother I call him Big John Big John a very big brother uh he was getting ready for service this morning and uh and then he just he just slum it took a while for his family to know that he was he was not I mean he had slum up or thought of and then when they got to him he was unresponsive so they called the the ambulance and U tried to resuscitate him and took him to the hospital and pronounced that he went to be with the Lord now uh uh brother John did did a lot of work in Togo and Benin that's that's two countries there in West Africa right between Nigeria and Ghana and uh he really work in the rural area so uh this uh this is a really blow to the the group there you know because he was he normally come over and be with his son in South Carolina just to be able to do some of his medical checkup so that's why he was around for and yet it pleased the Lord to take our brother home so we will just uh let's just bow our heads together and we just want to remember these different wants and these different needs um um yeah this is just came um so shocking this morning a whole lot of people going home Heaven is sounding sweeter all the time amen Heaven is sounding sweeted all the time let's buy our house together now dear father Lord Jesus what a weit lord we feel on our body Lord when once that we know has left us lord it's it's a it's a odd feeling in one sense Lord himay I mean uh uh knowing that they are gone to a better place we should be rejoicing

and uh to minister the word of God and as I always say coming to Minnesota is not you know to preach the word of God but just to come by and see brother one and the family amen so God bless you and uh we've been having a wonderful time together since I came in I think Thursday night or so and I appreciate the family and uh Mama suppose she's here this morning God bless you and um greetings from

something you know when we are here we can go and go and go and go and go Hallelujah but let you know the DI will let me know maybe they you pull my jacket or something or write a little note God bless you and I was happy to to see sister joy j here God bless you amen the world is a small place sometimes you meet where you never thought of or dream that you ever meet in this world but we are God's children and someday we spend eternity together amen and then uh tral blocks and fences and colors and all that will be a thing of the pass the prophet said will speak one great big language in heaven amen then we have the same tongue and all will blend into eternity amen see the world is a is life is enshrouded in Mysteries things that we can't even understand but we always submit to the will of God Amen things happens around us and uh we don't the prophet taught us not to ask God why because we are God's children because we've been taught that all things works together for good to them that love the Lord amen and are they called according to his purpose and sometimes if God will open our understanding to know why certain things happen Hallelujah you crawl from here on your knees to your to where you came from this morning even if it's 100 miles with your hands up say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and yet is not pleasing to the flesh but is the will of him that knows tomorrow which is God Almighty and we always submit to his will and we keep on clutching to the word of God because that's the only thing that is setting today that's the only thing that has life that's the only thing that has the attachment of Eternal reward any other thing that is contrary to that is fut cannot be dependent upon everything is a sinking sign the whole world is sinking amen America is sinking Nigeria is sinking but God's kingdom is not sinking no amen so we keep on holding on to it and someday God's mercies will deliver us at the golden corridors of Heaven Hallelujah and then it will be worth it all when we see Jesus Hallelujah God bless you let's read from the scriptures Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians 2 amen God bless all L Brothers cou is going to be with the Lord someday we meet at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we'll take from the book of Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians the 2 chapter from verse 8 we just pray first dear father we thank you we want to read from the scriptures and because of our elementary education we can pronounce the words put together but Lord the word of the Bible are Supernatural we just pray Lord we need a quickening to get into the portion of the scripture this day that father our coming to be worthwhile because you were in the service with us byass the preacher and just be a blessing unto us in Jesus Christ's name we pray am amen God bless you Ephesians chapter 2 from verse 8 the Bible says Ephesians 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith that's the only thing is by grace and Grace means an unmerited fail amen something you don't deserve and God give it to you yes Lord by grace through faith he Save You by grace and you are holding on to it by believing that it is so yes nothing else you can't prove your salvation other than that I can't prove it other than that there's no physical element we can use to prove as a y stick that I'm saved you are saved we are saved by through faith believing that we are saved all right and uh and that and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his what workmanship we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them if be seated why will take Revelation 3:14 amen Revelation 3:14 the Bible also says and unto the angel of the Church of the leans right these things sayth the amen hallelujah the final the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the creation of God spoke hallelujah amen so this morning just a little uh thought or word of encouragement and that is uh God's workmanship amen preacher have a lot you know maybe not speak from this speak from this and they just need God to help you to be able to pick out one and it's the spirit of God that is the mother of the church that know what the church has need of the preacher in his physical element doesn't Hallelujah and sometimes you can even pick your title and the Holy Spirit change your subject to suit the need of the people and we all we only trust in God Almighty so this morning trusting that we have our undivided attention we want to uh speak on God's workmanship Hallelujah now uh workmanship sometimes we like the man that built this Pulpit the his pay sometime we call his pay or his payment workmanship but that is not what we are talking about this morning yes maybe he charge $100 or $1,000 you see that's the amount money he want to charge for this the money we pay him is also known as workmanship but that is not a definition this morning Hallelujah workmanship means something that is made something that is affected something that was created right yes so back to the pit this pit now is the workmanship of the carpenter that made it right and as he made it he trust his own skill he beli in his own work and after he finish making it did he come condemning it no maybe the pastor gave him the specification he want social Dimension the width the length the breadth the height everything and he made it according to his specification or wherever it was made right and after he finish making it he will look at it and he will admire it oh this is better than the other one I made for suu church you know this one is here the angle he will look at it and he will admire it he will love it he will appreciate the product of his own skill amen he will appreciate the very work of his own hand he won't condemn it right yes and if the pastor the trustees are trying to condemn the work he will convince them to believe that his work is perfect he will never agree that his work is is not good Hallelujah and if man will not condemn his own work how much more God do you think God will condemn his own work Hallelujah and here the Bible is telling us that we are God's workmanship in other what God made us yes right and if man what man made he will not condemn it do you think God will condemn what he made come on brother it's not possible and here is God the Eternal he knew the End Amen he knew the end right from the beginning right and is the word of the Living God is the provision to overcome every Temptations and trials because God knew the end he saw you know he saw the end right from the beginning and he saw every activities of the devil how the devil will rise up against the church therefore he made the provisions in his scriptures to fight and overcome the enemy because God saw Satan before Satan moved yes then he could profer he could make something to counter the activities of the devil and that is why we always hide ourselves behind the scriptures behind the word this is the only fortification we have praise the name of the Lord that's the only fortification we have no other fortification anywhere praise the name of the Lord so workmanship is something that is affected something that is made something that is produced the act or skill of the work man the art a t the art of a Workman amen the art knowing how to do something praise the name of the Lord the out of uh playing the keyboard the art of preaching the art of carpentry the art of uh you know artist painting sculptor and all that so the art of a Workman the prophet says we only come to remind us of what we had already known not bringing any special thing hallelujah or anything new now the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work sake if they could project it for us where is our screen no screen BR W answer me now I thought you said they will project just go ahead go ahead I should just go ahead yes all right God bless you amen and God bless all our friends Hallelujah from Steve God bless you sir and BR used to sit here right amen so the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work sake no I'm asking because if it's there I could see it I'll just read and I'll be free from this but all is well Hallelujah the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work sake you know when Jesus came believe me for the very work's sake he put an emphasis on his own works that's Jesus Christ here we go to St John chapter 10 St John 10 from verse 37 and 38 St John chapter 10 we see what happens there St John chapter 10: 37-38 if I do not the works of my father sayth Jesus he say what believe me not because Jesus came here preaching the word of God doing good Healing The Sick raising the Dead isn't it feeding the hungry and yet it was difficult for them to believe him and he told them look if you can't believe if you can't believe me he said for the very sake of the works that I do these works are not natural they are Supernatural you should believe me because of that work and Jesus Works meant a lot to him because the prophet said he placed a lot of emphasis on his way you can't believe me you believe the work they testify of me they prove that they show that I came from God and I'm going back to God and Nicodemus said you said look nobody can do these works except God be with him and it was still difficult for them to believe and then he told them believe me for the very work sake Hallelujah so now in believe I do believe I do that's 38 though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know that that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him Hallelujah so the prophet say Jesus emphasized his work his works why he was here on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him amen hallelujah the work that Jesus did for God by God inspired faith in Jesus for example the song leader let song this morning he was working for God right working for the church he was a blessing to the people that we encourage him to continue so as Jesus was working right and God vindicating it inspired Faith yes right yes you are preaching you are doing whatever you are doing for God and it it inspires faith it gives you the whatever to continue serving God so Jesus emphasized his own work now it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship I love that thought for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus onto good works not unto bad works not onto Fear The Works which God has uh before ordained that we should work in them Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they will show forth that that that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him amen now let's continue we read Revelation chapter 3:14 the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the beginning of the creation of God right and of course these are things we've heard in our in the schools and preachings and all that and the prophet said that the that word does not mean as it sounds it say it means as it sound it to mean that God created Jesus and then Jesus created other creations the prophecy is not so because Jesus is God so if God created Jesus and Jesus created other creations the universe and everything it contains it to mean that God created God and then God started creating other creations it's not so this is a distinct creation from the finished physical product right now so the B said the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus say he is hallelujah Jesus said he is the beginning of the creation of God mhm now if it sounds the way it means or if it means the way is sound then something is wrong because Jesus is a man of 2,000 years I'm talking about the physical body he a is's a man of 2,000 years but creation was about 6,000 years ago so that cannot imply that cannot mean what uh what he means right so he is a is a been of 2,000 years and uh the the the world is about 6,000 years old so it can't mean that that Jesus was was the very being that God created hallelujah amen that's Andrews you've changed brother God bless you amen so it does not mean as it sounds this is a distinct creation from the physical creation and Jesus happens to be the beginning of that wonderful creation and I believe you belong to that family this morning Hallelujah so now we you see just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitude of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead and Jesus is the fullness of the godhead bodily Hallelujah then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible these words are he is the beginner amen these words are the prophets giving us the understanding in seven Church ages he said these words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God and what is a beginner beginner means one that begins something so Jesus is the one or was the one that begins this creation of God a distinct creation started or began from Jesus onto this day apart from the first Creations Hallelujah we'll get it as we go on we are lay the background I know to lay the background of a building is not very easy hallelujah amen you move rocks you move sand you move this you move that people will come around say what are these people doing but you have the image of what you are building in your mind so we will get there by the grace of God so Jesus is the beginner or the author of this creation of God now and uh what is the author you say author means one that originates or create something one that a source praise the Lord am so he is the beginner all the author of the creation of God now we know for shorty that Jesus is God Amen we know Jesus is God right and the prophet said very God Amen Hallelujah he Tau it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah and that was why the Jews pick up Stone to Stone him he said you being a maned to make yourself God what did he say when he said I am the son of the Living God and they knew the meaning of being a Son of God Son of God means God In the Flesh that's mesiah that's right they are Jews were Gentiles we're Idol worshippers so Jesus was God very God he is the creator amen Jesus himself is the creator so how come that he was created being the beginning of the creation of God no sir hallelujah what was created is the body called Jesus that the thing that was begotten by God mhm but it was not made of the of the Dust of this Earth if the body of Jesus was made of the Dust of the earth then is part of the Cur Earth then it can't redeem any of us amen amen you hear what I said amen if Jesus body was taken from this Earth as yours and mine were taken from this Earth then Jesus body is part of the cursed earth right then he will not be qualified to redeem any of us so he came from that Holy region where there was no curse God alight spoke the cell and the egg into existence and fertilization took place and he infused it into the home of Mary that is why Mary was a surrogate mother she was just an incubator Hallelujah it was an Immaculate Conception no human touch no human nothing no emotion no human emotion it was perfectly Immaculate holy to begin with that is why he could redeem us and that is why he could be the beginning of this new race and I'm grateful to God to be a member of that race praise God Amen so now he is the creator Jesus is the creator John 1 John 1:3 St John 13 says all things were made by him Hallelujah and without him was not anything made that was made that's right so how come then there him being the beginning of the creation of God mean that God created him no sir it doesn't mean that Hallelujah he is the one of whom it is said Genesis 1:1 oh thanks be to God in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth it also it says in Exodus 20111 for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day so there is no doubt that he is a Creator Jesus is the creator the logos the eternal spirit that indwell that Tabernacle was a Creator and the flesh bore the image of that which was inside right amen and sometimes Jesus said My Father which is in heaven then he confused trinitarian teachers how will his father be in heaven and he at the same time he is God praise the Lord the eternal spirit inside was God uh-huh and the body is the body is the mouth is the voice that is calling the eternal spirit inside father amen we understand that is the body Hallelujah because the body was begotten somebody made the body somebody created the body this my body came from somebody it came from a man and a woman and I can call them mother and Dad isn't it so somebody brought Jesus and he could call the person father somebody brought that body but who brought the eternal spirit inside who brought the logos that was inside that was God Almighty himself the great Pillar of Fire that say I am that I am right that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness amen thanks be to God for the prophet of the age that God used him to take our understanding back to the scriptures and our eyes has been anointed with eyes and we are seen by the grace of God Amen so now there is no doubt that he is the creator hallelujah amen he was the creator of a finished physical creation let's have that at the back of our mind the prophecy that Jesus was a creator of the finished physical creation let's have it at the back of our mind later we bring it to the front Jesus was a creator of what the finished can we say it together he was a creator of the finished physical creats he created the Mogan your tick wood right everything the irons the petroleum the Earth the moon the star the sun right your cheetah your Lions your sea your fishes your Dolphins mention them he created that Jesus was the creator Hallelujah they were they are his workmanship and the man that made the ppit did he condemn it no God will never condemn his creation come on church so God help us now having uh go this so surely we can see what this word mean now to have any other interpretation mean that God created go how could God be created when he himself is a Creator now um but now he is standing in the midst of the church he he as he stand there revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God and brother Bram says this is another creation distinct from the first Creations distinct from the physical Creations this is another creation we are talking about God's workmanship now so this is another creation this has to do with who with the church this creation has to do with the church Hallelujah this creation has to do with the church remember the devil spoils God's work in the beginning and God is radical say God is radical not a radical radical and a radical is an accomplisher a radical does not start to do anything and stop it unaccomplished he must finish it and that is God and from the beginning God determined to have a church without spot without wrinkle so nobody can spot his work when the devil seems to M his work God went back to work again to make sure that he bring that church to the position that he meant it to be from the beginning thanks be to God so as it stands H this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself so the beginning of the creation of God is a special designation of Jesus it's a special designation is the beginning of the creation of God now I will jump he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride at the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which the body was born I jump this now now Hallelujah we it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human o Supply by Mary no sir Jesus was not a single cell of Maries over or egg never it will be imperfect to bring us to Redemption we all born in sin shaped in iniquities we come to the world speaking lies all of us is the message of God through the blood of the Lord Jesus that redeemed us right and God knew that redeeming nobody blood alone is not enough he need to keep a force in us which is the holy spirit right to keep us constantly on check to keep us constantly on check if he just redeem us and leave us like that we will go back right but he put the holy spirit inside Hallelujah to put our body under subjection to The Obedience of the scriptures every step of our of our life even though we go back Hallelujah Redemption by Redemption by the blood mhm so now of him it was said l a body has th father prepared for me not God not Mary provided that body let's go on now Mary was a human incubator and she carried her holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation thanks be to God Amen was Jesus born the way were born no was Jesus born the way we are born no no sir he wasn't born the way we are so he is of that new creation and that's so made him to be the beginning of the creation of God remember Adam amen procreation was not to be by sex we are believers of the message procreation was not to be by sex that was not God desire at the beginning but the devil came to break God's program right and she sold the article to the woman and the woman bought it amen and when the husband came back amen the wife sold the same article you understand what I'm talking about sold the same gave the same proposition to Adam and Adam saw the I don't know you know he saw the troubles and the headaches and the anguish and the problems that were attend to his progeny on Earth but he could not do a away with a wife he sold L to death and sin and all kinds of mysteries in life in order to have his wife which you know is Christ in time amen it's Christ in time so he so L to that Adam was supposed to give bir to another Son of God who was Adam Church who was Adam he was a Son of God am come on a Son of God supposed to give bir to another Son of God and not Son of God supposed to prod another Son of God but Adam could not produce another Son of God come on and that was God's concept from the beginning and now why Jesus had to come the way Jesus came was the way Abel supposed to have come to the world Amen but they bypassed that concept amen they bypassed that concept but God was determined to have his church God was determined to have his generation God was determined to have that new creation amen hallelujah so here in the New Testament he came through the womb of a woman and he had that spoken word seed Hallelujah that the Bible called the second Adam why was Seth not the second Adam why was Noah not the another Adam why was uh Canaan Abraham Isaac why were they not Adam no sir because Adam gave bir to his own image hallelujah amen God created man in his own image Adam was in the image of God but Abel was in the image of Adam and that is not qualified to inherit the kingdom of God a man born by man is not worthy to be in heaven that's why something had to take place to correct his hybridization to correct his hrid birth something had to take place why was it that when they die in the Old Testament they could not go to the presence of God the Bloods of bulls and good was not was not strong enough Hallelujah to appease the sinful man to to know to to to pave the way for mine before God until Jesus Christ had to come that Holy Blood Hallelujah a there was nothing present that was why God said kill a lamb to atoned for your sin but that was weak until Jesus blood was shed praise God amen amen now men and God met and joined he was the first of this new I'm feeling good in my heart now and I I feel we should Fellowship together so Jesus was the first of this new race who was born like he was born who was born like Jesus was born nobody Hallelujah but if you are filled with the Holy Spirit you were born like Jesus was born come on now we now not the physical man and God met in join he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race H Allelujah Colossians 11:18 say and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation is that not the Bible if you are in Christ you are a new creation that's the creation we are talking about all things all things have become new used to smoke you don't smoke anymore you even hate to perceive cigarette odor all things have become new amen you have your wife at home and you have 10 other women outside you can't live like that anymore come on Church you love the world you don't love the world anymore all things have become new the prop say a brand new unit in an old temp is see the same Brother Joseph is it the same brother Steve is it the same brother one but the characters are changed Hallelujah said things are different now something happened to me when I give my life to Jesus now this new creation is not the old I hope I'm not shouting amen I just have one hour with you I will hand you over to your pastor this is my own style God bless you hallelujah amen so you bear with me amen this new creation is not the old creation made over it's not a patch up or it could be it could not be called New Creation I we understand the church thus far all of us were to have come to the world the way Adam came to the world the way Jesus came to the world rather right of course God gave adam a wife what was the wife for for procreation but Adam could not wait the woman could not wait the devil got ahead of God and when Jesus no church Adam did not learn to believe God Jesus did not learn to believe God it's me and you that learn to believe God come on church as Adam woke up he realized himself a human being he woke with Faith No Doubt anywhere right Adam did not believe that if you speak he will not come to pass he was not part of him and when Jesus woke up he did not wake up to theow himself a human being a man with doubt doubting God he was not part of him it's me and you that byass all that then we had to learn how to believe God we had to learn how to have faith we had to learn how to go to church it was automatic for Adam it was automatic for for for for for Jesus right right and look at it when the angel Gabriel came from Heaven to give the announcement to John I mean to Zariah in the temple he said your father I mean your wife will conceive and have a son right yeah he said uh what was her name Elizabeth was about 80 years old and Zachariah the pr the servant of God the pastor the prophet call it whatever you want to call it was he able to take that miraculous message Zachariah in the temple doubted it right that was when Angel Gabriel introduced himself because he was not used to doubting God in the place that he came from forever oh lord your word is settled in heaven once God speak we break came from it is here and a no doubt but he was a preacher in the temple when he told him old woman he's going to conceive I have a child he doubted it and Gabriel told him don't you know who he's talking to I'm Gabriel I come from the presence of God I'm telling you sometime you are doubting it he say you be dumb until the baby is born hallelujah amen but give the word to Jesus he will never doubt it doubt was not in his soul Hallelujah but we were born without adamic nature which is doubt to begin with which is sin to begin with which is death to begin with so we must come Hallelujah something must happen to us that will take us back Amen to that new creation the creation that believe God the creation that don't doubt God the creation that believe the supernatural the creation that believe in signs wonders the creation that believe in the mystery of the Bible the creation that can take the a the prophet in this generation that's what we are talking about you can't believe the Mery by your flesh and blood we can't learn it in University it must be given to you by divine revelation and is by is by predestination you must be in the program of God right because something must be inside to make you believe God in the absence of that you will not be able to look friends the message may be simple to you but it's the most difficult thing on earth to be believed you hear what I said I said the message may be simple to you because God had revealed it to you but I said is the most difficult thing on earth to be believed okay let's march on now God bless you so now this is exactly what he says it is New Creation it is another creation distinct from the old one is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is it dealing by way of the flesh amen Jesus God is no more dealing by way of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation Hallelujah he is the first of Jesus is the first of that creation and that's why you saw him the second other he could walk upon the sea amen hallelujah he could walk upon the Sea and the one that was not of that order of that new creation order was who was brother Peter you understand the church and when Peter saw Jesus on the water he was even in doubt because he he looked spooky he looked like a spirit he looked like a masquerade and he said Lord if that be you what did he say be me to come and Jesus say c o m e come by th Spoken Word by the power of the word and he had faith in it he started working to upon the water that was a supernatural act amen it wasn't natural a mortal man to be walking on the Water right Hallelujah that is why you man don't swim like this man swim this way because under your foot you know it exer more more pressure than when you lie down upon it are we in church and when he saw the stor blly what did Peter do doubt started enterry Jesus saw that same storm but it did not perturb him it didn't disturb him because he was of that new creation amen he the beginning of that new creation amen and all element of the earth must be subject to him right Jesus didn't need to pray to say peace be still M everything are subject to Christ amen but God made all things to be subject to us through prayers yes right so the man that was born by flesh the man that was not of that new creation Hallelujah he started thinkinking but the one that was of that new creation he was walking upon the water and while Peter was going down what did he do he held him by the hand thanks be to God but on the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost Peter had an entrance into that family now why he could walk and his Shadows their Shadows was Healing The Sick and The Afflicted they could take handkerchief and apron from their body and the disease were delivered because they of that new creation let's move on now let's leave this background Hallelujah now let's go to Genesis chapter 1
