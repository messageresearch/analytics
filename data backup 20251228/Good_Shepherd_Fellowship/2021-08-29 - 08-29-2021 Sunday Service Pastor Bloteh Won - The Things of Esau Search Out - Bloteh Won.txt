thinking okay i'm just going to talk about this and then right from there the law starts dealing with you and let's go to the book of malachi chapter 1. malachi chapter 1 praise the lord malachi chopped one malachi chapter 1 let's read together the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you said the lord yet yes say wherein have thou loved us was not easter jacob's brother said the lord yet i love jacob and i hate it easter and laid his mountains in his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness whereas edom said we are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thou said the lord of hosts they shall build but i will throw down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the lord have indignation forever and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel praise the lord a song honored his father as seven his master if then i be your father where is my honor and if i be a master where is my fear said the lord of hosts unto you all priests that despise my name and he and he said we're in half we despise thy name you offer polluted bread upon my altar and you say wherein have we polluted in that you say the table of the lord is contaminable praise the lord we will stop there you can read the rest of the chapter if you have if you feel edified but then let's pray heavenly father in the name of jesus we just want to thank you oh god that we still have the opportunity lord of opening your book opening the bible and reading father lord and we have done what we can lord jesus with our human ability but father god the breaking of the word and speaking to your people father the losing of god father lord of the world this morning the releasing of

this morning but lawrence and his household of god we just left all of these ones in your hands so father we love you we appreciate you oh god we pray bless us now in your presence in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord praise the lord we uh stay on the uh the subject year of easter and jacob praise the lord we came down this road talking on the birthright and last wednesday we were talking about the bitterness of easter and uh [Music] you know all of this came down from the visitation of [Music] our dear brother brother peterson brought a wonderful message to us and i mean it just it just tailed the water and we just we just dash right into it praise the lord since that time we've been right in it swimming amen and i hope it have been a blessing to you praise the lord so as we got down talking on the subject we read from uh from romans you know reading uh paul where he mentioned this and then uh there in the new testament he he mentioned uh what the angel said to uh to rebecca to rebecca that uh the older one will save the younger one and then and then he also mentioned what we just read in malachi and and he said as it is written so which of course you can find it somewhere in the world praise the lord every time the bible says as it is written it's written some word or as god will not say it is written praise the lord so uh you should watch out for that as you are reading your bible and studying praise the lord and that i you know i i remember uh you know reading that last week and uh and then when we read from romans i i i mentioned that there is no word in genesis where the bible talks about uh jacob i love and ease or i hate and then uh right away i saw you know some some bible students picking up their bible and they started making some search i said well holy spirit make sure that i'm right now amen praise the lord and then uh you know and then i went on that so but then uh uh malachi said it you know that uh uh jacob i love israel uh i hate then i had a uh a big amen i knew that it was breathtaking praise the lord amen you know and that's the way you keep the preacher in line you know praise the lord amen so we want to look at this subject uh this morning we we deal with uh the bitterness of easter you know talking about bitterness we will come back to that a little bit but uh in the future but i think on this subject we would like to progress a little bit and what we want to do this morning uh uh is to is to uh get back here in the book of malachi and show uh on this burden of malachi we know that malachi was one of the prophets dead in israel after the return from babylon amen after the si from babylon and the people came back he was one of the prophets that that brought a lot of comfort to the children of israel i mean he talks about their tears how god put their tears in the bottle of remembrance he talks about uh you know uh you know the forerunner of the messiah and all of this but yeah we realized here that malachi in his book here now if if you read this and if you really get get the taught in the right context of what the prophet malachi was trying to approach here you will see that uh uh you know the the prophets of god uh uh many of them the the the speak in in a kind of how we say the language of inspiration sometimes is almost like uh like a parable or like a radar or like a perm in a way that it says certain things now if you read this and you just said right here you know either was his brother they said the lord yet i love jacob and i hate easter now if you read that and you take it in the in the in the human sense of how we express if somebody says i hate you you can see it from their face you i mean their face their emotions i hate you you know hey and praise the lord and if you take that in that sense it kind of puts your mind in a place and says uh is there hit in god praise the lord but then if you go back and you look at him you and you and you read uh you know uh the context of of malachi message you see that he's trying to bring the people to remembrance he's trying to show them now remember now israel had just come out of uh uh you know captivity from from babylon that they have been there for many years and now when all of these things you go through trials and different things in your life it's hard for you even though the bible teach us you know that's how god built character in his people but it's hard for you to really be able to see the love of god in your triad at a time that you are going through it is hard for you to be able to to to see how can that be love how can that be love with the people going through phonics of fire and and and being raped and being killed how can that be love praise the lord so malacca is bringing an argument here that means let me say this way an argument here to prove to israel that god's love is not like human love praise the lord amen i have loved you said the lord yet yes say wherein have thou loved us how can you say that this is love and we were taken away from our homeland and carrying into captivity how can you say this praise the lord i believe most of the people whether this was being said in the synagogues or in the temple or malacca was on the street preaching i believe most of the people stood by and you know and and just listened to his message there's a documentary from the holocaust called god on trial you know and it also bring the saints the same sense of uh you know those those men there you know in in the coming and being killed and all of that and then they come together and they argue with the rabbi that was in the amaze how can you say that how can you say we are the people of god and i mean they just argue with him and and they hire god on trial you know and all of that and he's trying to defend them and you know reminding them about egypt reminding them about god being the deliverer and all of that now so uh uh uh uh but here malacca is going to express this wherein have thou loved us was not easter jacob's brother said the lord god now responding to the question of the people malachi malachi alone speaking but he's speaking for god and he's also picking the thoughts on the on the minds of the people amen and he's answering back to it was not he's or jacob's brother and the law said yet i love easter and i hate jacob praise the lord amen now malachi is saying this but like i said if we go back to the genesis story genesis chapter 25 the i mean there's there is there is nowhere in that in that conversation where the lord is talking to rebecca there is nowhere in that conversation you'll be able to pick up this kind of a language praise the lord amen but yet you know the word of god is so beautiful it's so beautiful like paul said in hebrew everything that is made was made by him there is nothing that is existing under the sun that never came out of god's creation praise the lord like solomon said there is nothing new under the sun now so all of this is heard out of the richness of this story god hate is some word in the scripture and that's why we want to look at this morning by the grace of god the book of obedience there's one of the shortest book in the bible only one chapter in the new testament is the book of philemon also have one chapter but it has more verses than the book of obedience let's go to the book of obedient the lord right after the prophet amos now the bulk of obi dire i was searching are these at the one time brother brandon mentioned ob diet and he says we don't know nothing about this prophet and scala also says that it says we don't know nothing about this prophet and uh but you will realize that ob dyer was one of the prophets and he the little message that he had the vision that he had the vision of obedience thus said the lord concerning edom this vision that this prophet obidia had in his vision is he the secret of ether now god laid out things in the word and things been happening since the day of isaac and rebecca and it goes down through all the ages and different things are happening you know like we said uh uh uh uh let me let me step back a little bit here let's go to genesis chapter 36 let's go to genesis chapter 10 it says before we come to obi dai let me just take my marker yet and put it right to genesis chapter 36. genesis 36 says now these are the generation of easter who is edom so he is the father of edom we know that edom started with him right there when he took the red portis that's what it was called edom the bible says verse 2 isa took his wife of the daughters of cana now let's go back to genesis chapter 28. i want to step back a little bit so we can be able to well i hope now i get a lot of scriptures reading down here genesis chapter 28. now genesis chapter 28 you read here you know uh and isaac called jacob and bless him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan now you see why i'm coming back to this because chapter 36 told us that easter took his wife from there are we together drop to verse six when esau saw that isaac has blessed jacob and sent him away to padam aram to take him a wife from bench and that he and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone down to pandaram and he's seen that the daughters of kenya please not isaac his father you see what is breathing there is defined you see what i'm going down in this thing is because we can just read it and talk about it and preach about it god i love israel jacob i hate and never get to see how how the root of hate which of course it was something that was in jacob that god was identifying are we together so you see here that easter now is is going to defy his father amen he's going down to defy his parents he's doing this the bible says and he's seeing that the daughters of cana please not isaac his father then when israel unto ishmael and talk untold him wives now right there it it kind of for it in in a sly way it takes an identity that looks like well isa i mean he he realized that that did not please his father so he just went down to the to the ishmael night and then but you also have to realize who where the dwellers of canaan you have to realize who were the dwellers of canaan chapter 26 let's go back a little bit i thought we were supposed to start from 26 and go up it looks like we're going backwards now praise the lord i hope i might not be preaching to you looking in the rearview mirror chapter 26 chapter 26 uh recover steady fall and isa was 40 years old when he talked to wife judith the daughter of bira the hittites now so you realize that the hair ties they were all part of the dwellers of cana are we together and the bible says it goes down and and and in verse 35 and the scriptures say which word a grief of mine onto isaac and to rebecca so isa in one sense he was now on a pain back he he did not own it i i i i was better against jacob but he was bitter against his father he was bitter against his mother and he was ready to be very defined and i'm i don't care what anybody says this is my life i'll do with it whatever i please you see it is that thing of always wanting to have your will always wanting to have your will and when you can have your will you will have it anywhere and anyhow praise the lord are we together oh glory be to god we have to understand his dealing we have to understand what is happening here how this whole thing you know started cooking up now easier is now taking an attitude at first it was almost like he was not happy with his brother jacob but now more as we look in the scripture he's taking it on the parents he says how can you sit down there can you tell the difference between uh isaac i mean jacob and me this is a conspiracy your plan to do this so nobody tell me anything and when the parent says i don't like this he said that's what i would do i would do the thing that you don't like and let me see what would come out of it a spirit of defiant and that's the age that we are living in a age that has the spirit of divine am i allowed to preach so may god help us let's go to the book of opidious people talk about it's not fair it's not fair when it's not in our favor then it's not fair praise the lord now so god giving obi-wan a vision and this prophet is going to have a vision that holds the secret of easter and edom it holds the secret of easter and edom are we ready let's read the vision of obedience said the lord god concerning edom we have heard a romance from the lord [Laughter] amen and an ambassador is sent among the headings arise here and let us rise up against her in battle behold i have maybe small among the headings thou i greatly despise god is talking about edom now the pride of that heart have deceived thee that was easier first problem the prayer of that heart which of course is something that is very common with first born it's something that is very common with first born i'm your big brother they're quick to tell you i'm your big brother you're listening to me praise the lord it's very common first born quick to put it in your mind that uh i'm going to take over when papa mama die i'm going to take over and pretty soon they start making planes in their heart they start hiding things they start trying to find out what is this and what is that the pride of thine heart praise the lord you will soon realize here as we study together and uh uh uh you realize how this whole thing is tied to uh uh the first thing that the devil uses to destroy a man or a woman is the spirit of pride the first thing that he uses to destroy a young person is the spirit of pride the prayer of that heart have deceived thee thou that dwelleth in the cliff of the rock whose habitation is high that sir in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground though thou exhort thyself the pride of heart and that's that's what it would do all the time the pride of heart will never make you humble the pride of hearts will just make you you are better than this person you are better than you can compare to meaning and and you see the thing about it it is just you alone in your prayer heart that is thinking all of that no thou has sought thyself ask the ego and though thou set the nets among the stars a complete parallel to isaiah chapter 14 a complete parallel to isaiah chapter 14. let's go to isaiah chapter 14 and see what satan said praise the lord i'm digging the grounds i'm making foundation i've not started preaching yet so please don't start counting the time i'm just laying foundation isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 how are thou falling from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how are that cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou have said in their heart only you alone in your heart the proud of heart you have said in your heart and that's why he said that he was not telling his parents no i was married where you say i should imagine when you talk to him he talked in his heart thou have said in the heart are we ascend into heaven i will exalt my thrones above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation which means i would cause my influence over a group of people in a side of the north i will ascend above the heights of the cloud so yeah he's controlling all the information in the clouds [Laughter] praise the lord no wonder modern science is going to the clouds that's their father domain and i will be like the most high god and if you wash this you will realize that satan have almost six eyes here in his heart which is the pride of heart the first thing the very seed of eight he says i will ascend into heaven i will exult my throne i will sit upon the congregation i will as i will send above the clouds and i will be like the most high but you know what the seven is praise the lord who can guess what the seven is that shall be brought down that's right oh man praise the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord so that's just just for the foundation back to the book of opidious now amen you enjoy reading the bible praise the lord i always believe that if you don't fall in love with the bible this message will make no sense to you it would just be rules it would just be all the prophets say the prophet say the prophecy but when you fall in love with this bible and you hear what the prophet said you just love god i mean what the prophet said just throw enough light the place is just bright wow i see it you don't have to struggle because you are right in the pages of the book the prayer of the unheard verse 3 have deceived thee that dwelleth in the cliff of the rock whose habitation is high there that said in his heart who shall bring me down though thou exult thyself as the ego and though thou set the nets among the skies whence will i bring thee down said the lord listen to this if teeth came today if robbers by night how are they cut off would they not have stolen till they have enough if the grace gatherer came today wouldn't that leave some grapes how are the things of esa sesh out that's what we're talking about this morning the things of easter sess out how are the things of eso sesh out how are his hidden things sought out by this vision of obedience god is beginning to search out and expose the hidden things of ether praise the lord how many people read that scripture in the bible they just get so offended the bible says before even the child were born they never even had they never even make a choice the bible says god god says jacob i love and he's people get immediately offended i mean you don't even get the child no choice but let's sort the hated things of esau you realize that god don't make mistakes god don't stumble in his words when he speak his languages are plain how are the hidden things of eso sesh out the things of ezra and how i either hating things his hating things sought out are we together praise the lord so you try you go back to genesis and you try to see in this board was he proud oh yes there's a lot of things he could be proud of you mean that he will be a guy that his father will always wait for his catch his kill his venison soup there are a lot of things and sometimes sometimes which of course sometimes is uh is uh uh unconsciously word by the odds of parents we contribute to putting certain things in the mind of a child that makes them to think that they are special praise the lord but with the things of ease of being sought out here we will go ahead and read it's just one chapter so if we read the book and prayed and go home it would not be a bad thing amen if i don't get to preach today i preach another day praise the lord amen but if we go back and see how the things of israel are searched out it makes you to say wait wait let's go back let's go back and look at this boy and look at his attitude what make him careless for him to say what even meaning the breath right to me what make him careless is because he had in his mind that he was a special child praise the lord if you want to break fry you can take it it still does not change our position in the family i'm the firstborn praise the lord now i'm i'm saying all of this trying to build a natural picture but the thing about it there is that this thing is more spiritual than just natural praise the lord amen it's more spiritual than than just natural let me let me let me bring it in a sense so you understand what i mean it's more spiritual last week on wednesday i talked about the the the the two seed i talked about the two twins the first twins two separate seed in the same one amen the mystery of the first twins is two separate sea lion which is the seed of god the seed of the woman and the sea of the serpent amen two separate sea lion birth in the same earth praise the lord the mystery of the second twins is from the same womb come two different seed or two different nature and the mystery of isa and jacob is the mystery of the believer because right in this body is the seed of god and then you also have a nature that was birthed between the second and eve so in the word as a gender as the word in general that's the the the the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent in the word in general but in the believer paul says the two dogs are always fighting praise the lord in the believer from that same warm from that same life sprinkle forth a nature of god that is growing in you by the new birth and you also have a nature from your first birth that is always warring against the nature of god are we together praise alone am i making you scared we are sorting out the things of esau praise the lord we are sorting out the things of esa because paul paul there with this with the church of galilean when he talks about you know uh uh the work of the flesh when he talks about the work of the flesh and he talks about the work of the spirit we will look at that as we travel the law but so we see this so it goes back it goes back right to the father of all lives the god of all evil which is the devil right from the beginning pride was his problem the proud of heart praise the lord brother madam said in the message pride oh pride such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride i did this i would be better off i would do this i i i no place for christ isn't that the picture today i would do so and so i would join the church i would do this i would do that god have mercy on us it's what brother branham called the sticky nature that comes from our first birth praise the lord amen praise such accursed him proverbs 6 solomon says 16 the lord god hate the first thing he mentioned pride praise the lord verb random question and answer on genesis he talks about demon powers listen to this he says and two third of the earth is in sin and more than that which two-thirds of the angels were kicked out now remember now in isaiah uh uh lucifer said i was set upon my congregation which means i will have people to influence that begin with these two tears of of angers that were deceived praise the lord amen he says they were kicked out and those demon spirits though those angels that were kicked out now has become demon spirits demon power in the earth they are once he says there was once exalted and they came they come to the people and give them a nature jesus cast seven of them out of mary magdalene and the first thing that brother branham identified pride praise the lord the first thing that he identified pride the first thing that isaiah identified pride the first thing that obi dies identified prime all god's prophets will see the same thing praise the lord the things of ether sesh out the little thought the little thought when sit on break to eve where brother branham said she stopped where she shouldn't have stopped to listen to him he said god knows that the day you know this wow there is something that i don't know she conceived a thought ignoring something before adam she conceived a thought of having a better understanding than adam that's what brother branham said the desire of knowledge let a man get a little understanding in the word pride kicks in his head and now he thinks he's a bride he's saying he's revelated when the true revelation of this word will make you humble all the time if the revelation of this word don't bring tears from your eyes they have not struck your heart yet if you just receiving the revelation of the word if they don't humble you and bring tears from your eye and say oh god how can you reveal this to me lord if you don't bring tears from your eyes they have not hit your heart yet because i love brother there are what he says when god squeezed your heart the juice would come through your eyes by the way he sent his greetings he's still looking looking on his calendar to see when he can come down to minneapolis praise the lord are we together oh pride such a curse thing is an awful thing it's the root of all evil is the root of all evil believe thou this brother branham said he says that's what the matter with the church today god too starching too much pride let let down you sorry you are in six foot of dirt anyway that's right god saw i got a sword got to meet god some days that's what the matter with our pentecostal church all holiness churches which of course that's what we're supposed to be in the message they get up too proud they get a good church and a nice people and then they that they think we want to partake after the world that's where god's people always got in trouble when departing after the rest of them he is our partner he is the one that gave the pardon to moses to build the tabernacle praise the lord are we together we are searching isa out a little bit wednesday night we talk about the bitterness that he had which bitterness has has now gone down to his generation that's why all the nations around israel hit israel is because of that and that's the reason why every desire in your human body hit your soul it hit that sea of life every desire of the flesh the desire of the flesh will speak loud oh i'm hungry my clothes are too old praise the lord when the desire of the soul say now i need more of jesus in the state small voice i don't have money then you're running for money i'm hungry then we're looking for food by the desire of the soul saying give me jesus give me jesus just five minutes in his presence praise the lord paul said there is nothing good in this flesh are we together amen brother brown said something here i caught my eyes as i was telling shepherd of the sheephole he says i found out that something fell because of the ladder the woman and i found out that saw fell because of pride as i was telling that last night i got stuck in my boat [Laughter] i said oh yeah i need to go back let me go back and visit sword a little bit let me sort him out a little bit oh yeah he just visited with the prophets with the prophet samuel he was anointed the next day he's prophesying among the the prophets pretty soon he thinks he's spiritual he thinks he knows the word now that he's even challenging samuel the prophet when samuel told him don't do it this way just because of one gift experience he had to prophesy pride kicks in hebrews exposition brother branham says here he says when judas fell by transgression by the love of money and the pride of life he fell from grace and went to his place when he failed by transgression by the love of money and the pride of life praise the lord he corrupted himself by the status of being among the elites he could find his way to the sanhedrins and talk with those guys and reveal the secret of the church are we together now so we see here that a proud of heart is the attitude of life that makes a person to think that they can live without god it's the attitude of life that makes people to think that they can live without god and let me say to you this morning it's not only the people in the world even the people in the church that's why people will not get the holy ghost that's why they will not cry to god for the holy ghost because they're telling themselves i'm born in this message they're telling themselves you know i listen to the message i read a call and they just get i mean the message i'm in the message i'm in the message and the message is never in them the prayer of heart is the attitude of life that makes a person to say they can live without god that's what makes a man wake up in the morning never acknowledge god oh i'm laying for what oh my goodness my chi i never acknowledge god in their ways never kneel by the side of their bed or laid in the bed and say almighty god thank you thank you for the breath of life the attitude of life that makes you to take your job important in god that makes you to take anything important in god it's a prayer in heart it's a prayer of heart praise the lord and on the wednesday we were looking at that scripture that in hebrew what the bible talks about easter being a profane person and a lot in that word profane means pro means to be in front or to be against and frame means the tempo so a profane person is anybody that is against god anybody that is against god now you have to watch this we talked about it before in the scripture the characters in the bible there are many of them that as they play out as god used him in certain things they are actually it looks like it is let me say it this way is god in the second place or god in the second person praise the lord amen let me let me let me explain myself it's you know i preached the message uh uh the bloody hussman it's almost like uh uh zepora is saying to moses you are a bloody hustler to me praise the lord now you can take that as a poorer statement but then you can also take that as christ in bright form we speaking to our christ that he has become a bloody husband for us so you see many of the times when the prophet says that was christ in david which means david was speaking in the first person what had that forsaken me but it was not him david that was being forsaken it was christ that would commence on the cross and say my god my god why have thou forsaken me praise the lord so when you when you read the scripture and look through the life of the patriots you realize that god used him like brother branham said that he even knew that know that they were used by god by the things that they did and the things that they said praise the lord so in this in this place here uh isa defying he defying his parents he might just think that he's defying his parents but what actually he's profiting god he's been against god why because it was god that raised up abraham isaac and jacob to set the cornerstone for the patriots that's the reason why when uh when uh uh uh uh uh where is his name abimelech talk talk seraph god stepped on the scene why because abraham was representing faith in that age and anything that would happen to sarah would contaminate the promise so god have to step on the scene and rescue the situation praise the lord abraham had at least idea of what god was doing to him he was just looking for his child god said i would become the father of nation he never took it serious like we take it today to be called cease of abraham praise the lord amen abraham but never uh imagine how or his children are going to be the fathers of uh you know the rest of the world so when god using the patriots or using men in the bible he might just be reading the story and says and david said unto his son but david being the father put him in the place of god speaking to his son that you are and david called his son before his last birth and he said solomon show yourself a man let me tell you how you can reign in the kingdom and barbarian says that was a perfect time of god in christ because it speaks all the way to the millennium kingdom so you see that is the reason why sometimes we stumble over biblical principle because we just think oh no that thing was moses and aaron i was talking but you have to also bring into context the place of moses in the scripture place of a father in the scripture when the bible speaks of a father you have to bring that into context because every biblical father every father that was that was in the right context of father was representing father god praise the lord after they say the lord if the lord help us and we stay keep in this i want to talk about the difference between a son and a bastard and then you will understand what i'm talking about but let's travel in this praise the lord are we together amen glory be to god amen i was listening to brother branham this morning uh uh why are we now denomination paragraph 1 25 there he says something i thought i was going to copy that and put him in my nose but i can just i can just refer to that because i wrote that down and then and then later i i saw that he he said it but we will come to something that he said there and what i was dealing with here is that when you look at all of this you bring it back to the original you know you try to think about it you know as you as you sought isa out here you know when and uh you know it's it's it's it's almost the same you know i mean a man is going through things you pray for him you commit him in the hands of god you know and and uh i mean you just you just pray that god will be gracious that god will be merciful you know uh [Music] that the law will help him so as you look into this and you try to put this thing in the right place for us to be able to understand what malachi was actually expressing him you will see that you ask yourself a question what choice did i have in being on earth praise the lord why choice did you have been born the day you were born what was your contribution in whether you should be a male or female that was exactly what i heard a prophet of god saying this morning so you see let's go back here brother branham why are we not the nomination he says he said israel i hate and jacob i love before either one ever had a chance to prove what they are or what it was because he knew what there was he knew he knew everything he knew what you did do before you were born and when the world began now let's travel with him yet a little bit now look what god date and and then you will love him i love this now i love this let's read this now he says he says look what god did and then you will love him then you will go home and in the morning you will sleep a little late [Laughter] go ahead you will sleep in brother scott when you keep thinking about this thing you will sleep in praise the lord amen if you just think about think about it the thing about it there is that we are living in a generation we're living in an age where like i said it's a it's an age of define you know an age where men want a god that they can detect her praise the lord amen a god that they can detect her and they think that they have everything they think they have their destiny in their hands that's why it's difficult for them to freely accept what god has given just like i've said over and over the difference in the love of god to you and somebody in the world is because you have grace to lift up your hands and say lord i accept your love and another person is struggling to accept it why because they are looking at their life if god loved me why do why i have to suffer why i was born by these parents why this happened to me so they're looking at all of their life to accept god's love but when the bible said for god so loved the word it's true god lord the word there is no partiality in his love the difference is your attitude to god's love if you understand that then you will understand the love and the hate part when we get to it listen to this brother branham say you will sleep in late a little bit here amen now if you sleep in late tomorrow and then get laid for work don't blame me praise the lord get a job and tell the boss my pastor say i'm a sleeping late that's not why that's not what i said to you please praise the lord i'm not giving you a commandment i'm telling you something that you fall in love and when you keep it on your mind it might be difficult for you to fall asleep if you just if you just understand this and digest it in the way the holy spirit bring it here look people young people i'll tell you with many of the people that are struggling with this message and struggling with brother branham ministry is their own fault just like i said they never loved the bible they never fell in love with the word of god praise the lord because this prophet of god with the ministry that god gave him the grace that he had to be able to bring the word of god to us praise the lord if god just gave us grace to to receive it not to make make our own thing out of it praise the lord because that's where the problem is a lot of the time we make our own think we want to take the word a little extra mind no because if i relax no we got to be strong on it you don't have power than god and i'll say that this morning if you struggling with a message and the messenger say something we will help you we will help you i will do all i'll quit my job and do everything i can to help you praise the lord amen and that's why people don't understand you know the thing that we don't talk about brother branham yet a lot praise the lord we don't we don't talk about the man we talk about the word i love the word is the word that i saw sorry i never saw the man i love the word i love the message i love the word oh i love the word i love the god of will and brandon i love thy gift because it rightly divide the word of truth you can have the man give me the word okay let me read the thing that may make you sleeping late he says now look what god date and jen you will love him look what god did and then you will love him and you will go home and in the morning you will sleep a little late you will love him more than ever now god is a contractor he's trying to bring it in account for humble sense now i was thinking about that you know i was i was studying last night and and uh i was just thinking about it it just brought the whole picture about jacob i love is what i hate you know it brought a whole picture so beautiful to me praise the lord amen okay let me just leave it let's read the word here amen now god how many knows there he is a builder all right listen real close now god look younger we are going to take the chronologic idea of it god a hundred billion years ago when he was going to make the world well he just started praise the lord he got an idea in his mind he got an idea in his mind praise the lord amen it's just like i said to her brother you want to go to phoenix you have an idea to make a trip to phoenix praise the lord your primary thought is i have to go to finnish i have a purpose i have a business to finish that's your primary thought now you then you start to gather thought how am i going to get to finish where should i drive or should i fly those are after taught whether you fly or whether you drive is just to accommodate you it does not have much to do with the purpose the purpose is i'm getting down to phoenix to get business done are we together praise the lord god's primary thought was his elates yes how he will make himself known unto his illite where secondary thoughts that's where the devil comes in he's an afterthought are we together let's travel here with this a hundred billion years ago when he was going to make the world well he just started he got an idea in his mind now you are going to say if he's that great brother branham how did he ever permit the devil to make sin why because it was just to accommodate his attributes it was not his primary thought his primaries thought was his illets and how to make himself known to his elites praise the lord amen i'm a young man i'm talking to this uh uh sister over in california i'm going to make myself known whether i drive or whether i fly whether it is spirit airline delta airline they don't have nothing when i get out of the plane i lived them they're not part of my mission my mission is the person that is on my mind [Laughter] oh my praise the lord my mission is the person that is on my mind you say how did he ever permit the devil to make sin well he knew before the devil was ever created that he will be the devil he will be the vehicle the bicycle the rollerskate the boat that god will ride make himself known oh gloria you said the writing my sister glory brother branham says i feel religious oh mine he knew before the devil was created that he will be the devil and he's just a vehicle he's not even the vehicle he's a rotoscape praise the lord oh i use him for the bicycle now you ask what's about that you say why did he let him to be the devil that he might be proving to be god that's why he did it praise the lord why was there ever unrighteousness why which was first the savior or the sinner the savior was first yes the savior was first praise the lord amen that's the reason why no matter what your problem is it's never bigger than god before you ever had a problem god has the solution he has the answer then why is your spirit cast down praise the lord why is your spirit cast down why not lift on your hands and praise the lord anyhow and said glory be to god amen which was first a healer or a sick person the healer was first why was there permitted to be sinner then because there was a savior why we keep arguing over this thing because the attribute of him is a savior if there if they never being a sinner he did never be known as a savior that's why paul said he made all things for himself it's for himself to display his attributes are we together hallelujah he can make all things wane around to his glory can the potter the part say to the porter you made me douse who on this wheel who got the clay whose hands is it in paul said oh foolish man then he said he raised up pharaoh raised pharaoh up for the very purpose raised pharaoh up hiding his heart for the very purpose so he can make himself known praise the lord now watch this now watch this principle see how pharaoh god had him every time moses came he defy egypt the first time he came he threw his role down the magician came the trophy us down it was equal equal nobody was intimidated in the second moses rod swallowed the ass look at one another praise the lord amen moses went back the next time he came he sees something and defy them so every time that moses came and he gave a word to the people now watch this now see how pharaoh had god had it the rejection of letting the people go every time he rejected god's word his heart god hiding it's not god putting a stone in his heart but every time god showed his love and his mercy and you reject it your heart gets hardy so the bible says he hiding he raised pharaoh up and hiding his heart it just looks like god just put a stone in pharaoh i know it's every time you reject the word of god your heart gets hiding every time isa will reject little instruction you always want to be out there running around he will never help around the home come and do this and every time he did that little by little it was building stubbornness and rebellion in his heart if you feel that nobody can tell you something only your parents you better watch that every time he rejected because every time moses came he was not coming with a challenge i would do this again no he came with one message let the people go let my people go and every time he rejected it his heart got more hiding his heart got so hiding that he did not even care for the life of his firstborn until he saw him dead until he saw him dead on the bed praise the lord god was expressing how he saw his love in jacob's heart in in easter there was no place for love because ezra has filled his heart with anger revenge defined pride in heart he he filled his heart with all of those things there was that there was no place for love in his heart malachi was trying to bring the to the churn of israel love is in your heart that's the reason why no matter what god takes you through there is something that keeps bringing you back to him that's what malachi was trying to show them even though you you are you you you are still thinking about what happened to you and you bringing your sacrifices that are not po you know you you you still have the table but in the midst of that there is still something in your heart i want to do right but your mind is keeping you in the conflict why am i going through all of this and i still praising god i still going to church your mind is going through the conflict with what is in your heart that's what maraca was trying to tell the children of israel isn't either jacob's brother but there was no place in his heart for love he was profane he hated god he hated god for the fact that the breath right was an oddness of god for him to disperse the breath right he was despising the god that gave that ordinance if you despise the holy ghost you are despising god you can keep all your religion it will not save you because you need the holy ghost you need to be born again are we together are you seeing the beauty in the world amen i'm trying to bring it in the way church because what i believe what i feel feel in my heart i feel that god is dealing with our heart as a church and if we open up our heart and surround to him he will give us a visitation this is not just uh uh a message because uh you know i wanna look super smart seeing what the holy spirit did on wednesday night the way he came through this building and searched our hearts if you still holding things in your heart you are using that very thing to dig your grave praise the lord but i just believe that god the same way obedience searched out is alive he's searching out our lives i might be preaching all of this but i believe the holy spirit is dealing with you and going to your life if he's not dealing with you you better cry and say god yeah i am you better lift your hands and identify yourself praise the lord he said he raised pharaoh offer for this very purpose i will read i'll just read this i have other quotes but i will read this and find a place to stop here so we can pray certainly he knew it before there was a word he knew how thank you brother yeah they have a bunch of them on a year brother jody i'm not just paying attention he knew who who be what and he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness that he might be a healer he let there be hate that he might be loved so he did his god and that's his attribute and he has to have something to display his attributes how will you ever know there was a night how will you ever know there's any if it was all daylight how would you ever know there was a night that's a night so it could be proof daylight show there is a man now he comes back to this co uh uh uh talking about this contractor now he went on talking about raffle i'm not a hunter i don't know you know i've you know he went on talking about raffle and guns and all of that you know and and how to zero your gun and hit the shot and all of that it was beautiful i enjoyed it but let's get back to the contract i can make more sense of it what was he doing like a contractor laying out all of his two by fours his two by eights his cheating his he he knows just how many building he he was going to build praise the lord i saw a little bit of that yeah we're doing what we were doing down here you know we go there by by the way and and you know uh uh uh brother jordan says well we put the heater up there in the ceiling i just need two by fours and all of this and it's all in his mind he's talking all of these things all i want let's go buy the plane let's bring it do it i would see it praise the lord i'm not in his mind you know and then he's yeah he's telling me right that and he's describing everything brother let's go and buy this thing that's what i'm saying in my mind why he's talking to me because i have no idea how he's going to do what he's going to do and you go and buy the two by four and the eight by four and and everything [Music] then you see the contractor he has a measurement you mean he has a measurement of what would fit in a setting space but you see when he goes down to buy the wood he don't tell the person that he's bought in the wool you know i i want two by four but give me 16 inches and and and you know and and call it like this and call it like that but even if he did that you will realize that the the peace that he will cut and take will have to be the one that fit that space praise the lord but you see the thing about it there is that the the contractor he don't look at the world and says i hit this end i hit this end i love the middle no when he goes to bother who he loved the entire world he looks at it from up and down and he turn it around and looks ahead and and yeah this is what i want this one praise the lord but when he comes to do the work he takes a measurement praise the lord then he takes the rule running on the wall cut it at that place now because the measurement is in his purpose so he takes that measure piece and put it right in between you and say it fades praise the lord if it's a little long he take it up again you go down he saw it then he come and bring it again what's wrong and they'll get it inside okay he goes back again and and cut it now so you see there is that the part that he's cutting out he does not hate it are you understanding the saints he does not hate it if he pay money for it just like jesus sheared his blood for the sin of the world he paid money for the wood he paid for the entire long hood but it's just that the extra piece was not in his purpose because in his purpose he needed just two feet to fit right in their space praise the lord are you going to say well that the guy is wicked he hid that good piece that peace would have been the better piece but he hid it no if he hit it he would not pay his money for it he bought it but it's just that in his purpose he had a distinct measurement that he needed are we together praise the lord so he get his sheet is sliding and then just many buildings he won we may he says we are made out of 16 elements of the earth and he was making us all and lying us out there before there was a war you know better brandon said this last night it just it just spring out to me that's the reason why he just called things from the earth because you already lay right in the earth that's why he said let there be because it was there are we together might have been uploaded at a time i don't know what it was what what was his making gold or copper or brice or water and all those stuff for he's the contractor he's the builder he was laying everything out hi everything caught in faction brother branham described that in the same in in the same trace with the peace praise the lord you take your cloth to the sintress or the tailor to get you a shirt or the dress you don't buy the centerpiece you don't go to the store and say take my measurement and then measure the piece only that piece that make my dress that's what i would pay for you don't do that you buy the whole piece and when you love the club you love the whole thing i love it it's a pretty cloth it's going to make me a good dress your mind your your expression to it what is in your mind is your dress praise the lord what is in your mind is to have that dress sprained out because you already get a shoes that would go with it you have a bag that would go with it praise the lord praise the lord that's what is in your mind is the dress oh man thank you jesus thank you jesus he was laying everything out he had everything cut in faction when he got it all made it was just a great big volcano eruption he led them over canada's blood up there for a hundred million years praise the lord to make some captioning in what what he said is part of you and then before there was one speck of life on the earth our body were lying here before one drop of mustard ever come on the earth we were lying here praise the lord it's not just ephemera author when the preacher takes the dust and put it on the remains it's a biblical order before there was just one monster ever on the earth we were lying here when adam walked up and down the garden of eden we were lying here when the turbines the morning star signed together and the sons of god shelter for joy we were lying here just waiting for the breath of life praise the lord just waiting for the breath of life to quicken us up i was here he made me have my body lying here praise the lord the musicians can come a lot of things going through my mind and it's it's making me emotional i have a father i have a maker he knows my name okay [Music] so the lord bless you will continue in the thought [Music] he for my heart oh jesus before even time begins [Music] let's sing that again amy oh yes lord you form my heart [Applause] my [Music] you he knows my [Music] every time [Music] yes [Music] he knows my name he [Music] knows my name [Music] these seeds each year's downfall and he yes me when i call lord you are my father oh yes [Music] cause you [Music] thank you lord thank you jesus thank you father [Music] hallelujah jesus thank you father he sees oh each [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes jesus [Applause] [Music] will you call me [Music] you never leave me [Music] he knows [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knows [Music] we look at the universe you look at the mountains you enjoy the lakes you see the rivers but we never argue why that lake is not a lane for me to be in my house we never argue and say oh god why the mountain did not become a plane or what are they we enjoy the mountain when we see the mountain we enjoy it we look at the mountains oh how pretty it is oh how beautiful you look at the lake you enjoy the lake you take your boat on the lake or you walk by the lake the same girl that choose to pour the land in certain places and choose to put the lakes in certain places and choose a field
