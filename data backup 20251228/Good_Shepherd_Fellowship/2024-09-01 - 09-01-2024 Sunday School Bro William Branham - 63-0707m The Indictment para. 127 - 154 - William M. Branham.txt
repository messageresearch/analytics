[Music] [Music] what did he class him a fanatic a crazy man yeah they found fault with the man who was the word he was the word St John first chapter proves it in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the Living Word of God because he was expressing God through himself he was so completely to surrender to the to the word of God to him the word was a saint and that's exactly what the church ought to be today that the word of God is the same how can you be part of that word when you deny practically all of it and the reason it's done is not because the people that's the reason I think God spoke to me about calling his people the Ricks and ricettas it's because of these selfish denominations has got those people living out there in the way they're living They Crucified the truth and the people call it a blasphemy and they make it blasphemy rather they call it fanaticism and so forth and not knowing that they're blaspheming the very God that they go to church to serve therefore I indict this bunch of clergy today I indict this generation in the name of Jesus Christ under the authority of God's word you're are crucifying him again notice he's the same yesterday day and forever God's word are Vindicated in the man compare the two calvaries and their acquisation remember because he made himself God we will not have this man rule over us what was the acquisation that they could find in the council that morning uh when crucified Jesus that he made himself God he was God and he broke the Sabbath and he was the lord of the Sabbath they condemned him because that he made himself God you have no right to do this you have no right our high priest if anything is coming come through our priest now compare that with the calvary today when God it so pleased the father God the spirit to raised up his own son overshadowed the Mary by the Holy Spirit and brought forth a body that could serve him and serve his purpose to the God was in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily in him reflecting what God was to the people letting the letting the whole world know what God wanted each individual to be a son and daughter he took one man and did it and because that he didn't jar with their organizational ranks they condemned him in crucified now compare that Calvary with the day because of organizational Prejudice yes because of indifference between Scholars who ought to know God's word and plan because of this God can take a little group of people that he can work to somewhere and refect himself who will humble themselves to the word and they cannot say it isn't so they could not say he didn't do it for their congregation was witness of it it was before them they couldn't deny it they couldn't deny his claims because the very word that they said they believe was the one who prove that he was because God took the word that was supposed to be the Messiah and show to a man and they had to get rid of him so the only way they could go on was get rid of the Messiah and they did it through blindness and ignorance regardless of their education they were smart intelligent worldly speaking as we compared the other night when the light struck the rich rung ruler look what he did he rejected a smart man Paul another smart man the light struck him what' he do he accepted it it he forgot all he ever know that he might know Christ am that made his life worthy of the Gospel last Sunday night's message there it is today it strikes maybe some little a man is went off had a call of God he felt went to some Seminary and learned some Creed he must live by that Creed or give up his Fellowship card if he does he's black mark nobody else will have him because once he belonged to something else and now he don't belong to it they figure there's something wrong with that man and they will not have him in their congregation when the congregation are only looking for one sign that is if he believes what they believe if he's got a card if he's a Methodist if he's a card he belongs to another fellowship or Wess or trinitarian or whatever it might be Church of God or in the Pentecostal ranks all those ranks if he packs a card that feel that the headquarters has uh looked him over and tested his mind and give him a psychiatrist test and see if his IQ was high enough that he could speak before him if you don't they turn him down that's right but you see the congregation ought to be watching the hand of the Lord see whether God's giv his ordination or not that's what we ought to be looking at Hallelujah but today they crucify the the the Son of God aresh when a man is Able by the grace of God be called of God to let God reflect himself through him the works that I do shall you do also he said notice what a day that we're living in they they take they they take the the very Calvary we can this morning and the very reason now they know that was truth but because of jealousy Prejudice what did Jesus say to them if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God then who who do you cast them out by let them be your judge if I by the Finger of God cast out Devils now it's like you heard them say can you prove it's a finger of God I'd like to I'd like to heard that question nasty they were too smart for that notice because that he made himself God and he was God and we will not have him rule over us but now the thing the same old cry comes again that Bible was written by man they say we don't have to live by that that's God's that's God's word it's God himself I was talking to a man you I saidwell some man might have wrote that Bible I said yes it was his name we know him as God it was Wroten 4,000 years apart almost the scriptures back from Job all the way to the New Testament and wrote by hundred by by and hundreds of years apart and was wrote by different man and them not knowing the other in different parts of the country and not one word of it will condemn the other right I dare anybody to come under the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any promise in there God's obligated to take care of it but they won't do it they'll come say oh Lord I want to do something give me a great gift Hallelujah Lord glory to God I believe I got it Hallelujah it'll never work you might bring forth a lot of psychology but it won't work God's got to recognize that repentance God's got to do that we could say a lot along that line but I hope you're you're understanding look but now they won't have the word rule over them I say every one of you returned back you're baptized wrong you're baptized in the Catholic Church who are you to tell us that it's not me it's a word well I tell you we we believe I don't care what you believe it's what the Bible says well we don't have to live by that you do not or you're under the Judgment of this Bible for whosoever shall take one word out of it or add one to it the same will be taken out of the part of The Book of Life let him be Minister clergyman whoever he is you you got to come under the rulership of this word for it is God the Bible says it's God we won't have it rule over us they take their Creeds and denominations and their little petty things that they believe in has been adopted by councils of man and take it instead of God's word what did they do they tuck a barabus a murderer instead of the Son of God at the day of the first crucifixion and today they're taking some man's word which is a lie and the way of death and refusing to take the way of life God's word I condemn this generation and died in the word of the Lord that they're wrong they're guilty of crucifixion or trying to Hallelujah crucify the spirit they call for Revival everywhere how you going to have a Revival when the word itself can't work to the people I'd like for somebody to answer that for me how can it do when you deny the very Revival itself amen well did the prophet speak of them forms of godliness their own forms back there deny the Word of Life their own Farms today deny the thing that can bring them a Revival their Creeds and Farms yes sir they take the denomination and their Creeds instead of the the word and that crucifies his word and makes his word of no effect to the people when they see the word of God so vividly in it just Place itself that God made the promise he would do this and here he is doing it and they make fun of it and get away from it it's blasphemy and they try to crucify the word itself why do they crucify they can't crucify the word no more they could crucify God they could crucify the body that help God the Son of God they could crucify that but they can't crucify God he had to be that time on account of being the sacrifice to bring in many sons that's predestinated to eternal life they had to do it then but they can't do it now they can't do it for the word itself will live on but they what do they do how do they form what are you saying that preacher how you building your platform here that they crucifying that they're crucifying the effects of the Gospel upon the people by their Creeds amen yes that's a crucifixion that where the public set these big margs called churches denominations and draw a line of creed and that had the word of God can't have an effect upon it because they they condemn the very things that Christ said would take place it just don't come according to their Creed and neither did Jesus come according to their understanding of him coming he come in the way that God sent him and he come exactly with the word no wonder he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it the baby such as would learn Hallelujah do you understand oh they have crucify the effects of the word I got a bunch of scriptures here I might just quote to a three of them they crucified you say how do they crucify the word when Jesus said that he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 they say in such a way he is all right and the Jesus said his last commandment to the church go ye into all the World Mark 16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe all the world to Every Creature it ain't half reached yet and his millions die every year that don't ever even heard the name of Jesus so it's still the general orders it's still the Commandment of God all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and they say that was for that generation and they make the Commandment of God of not effect to this and they crucify the effect of the word to the people amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost with the keys to the kingdom of Jesus had just G whatever you say here I'll say it up there and on the day of Pentecost they asked what they might do to receive the holy spirit that they was so enjoying it watching others acting uh what they would call uh silly stagger and jump and fall and acting like they were drunk and they say these men are full of new wine but there was a man stood up by the name of Peter who had the keys to the kingdom and said these are not drunken acts two as you supposed since the third ey of the day but this is that which is spoken of see right back to the word again showing that the spirit is still word the word is still Spirit yes the word of God and it shall come spoken by the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall come to pass in the last days sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh listen to that Prophet stand there look at him Fearless standing there upon that bunch and condemning him amen indict them said this is the scripture this is that that was spoke of by the prophet I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy all my handmaids and Maid servant I pour out of my spirit now show signs in the heavens above and on Earth fire and pillars of smoke and Vapor proven it by the word that it was the word and they laughed and made fun of it and they went to judgment and the city was burnt and they eat one another children and today there are scattered people throughout all the world showing the Holy Spirit Still Remains the word of God to bring this word to make it live Jesus Christ was the person man God hallelujah amen he was the manifestation of God he was God in a body form to reflect the word of God for that age to make that age see God's promise for that age am and the Holy Ghost is the same thing today it's the spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove that he's the same yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever see constantly trying to find its way to reflect itself and they could not do it the people thought so much of their denominations their little Nest that they had and so forth call their churches so they wouldn't listen to it so do they do it today same thing crucify aresh Peter on the day of Pentecost he said you man that dwell in Jerusalem in Judea hearken to my words these are not drunk if you'll stand still I'll show you what it is and he goes ahead and explains to them one of their hearts is pricked when they heard this say what can we do to be saved what can we do to receive this we're convinced that your word is right he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift the Holy Ghost for this is to you and your children them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call this is what they got to do repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and today the Roman Catholic Church adopted father son Holy Ghost to take that place instead of that a communion Li out a tongue and take a wafer and the priest drink the wine and you're one together the communion instead of being the Holy Ghost called Holy Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a trinitarian baptism was not even spoke of in the Bible amen amen the name of father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and when you show that to this honor generation as Peter said save yourself from this honor generation when you show it to them what do they do make fun of it and say our church don't teach it that way then you're guilty you're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by taking the power of God away from the people you crucify the very word to them and you condemn yourself with your congregation lead him into a death trap as I said about that Minister last Sunday there Martin Luther King down there with them precious people leading right into a death trap oh somebody could only talk to that man wish I could just for an little uprising of the school proposition see some what difference my goodness if the people ain't got hard enough to associate with a man because of his color they're condemned and dead anyhow amen the nation gives right don't fight against it don't what if somebody said all the Irish or somebody all the German or somebody else had to dissociate that would never bother Christians and move right on and that man's a Christian is is a minister he shouldn't lead them people into a revolt against that they're going to cause Millions to die it'll start another revolutionary and it's a shame to do that the same thing happens right here exactly the same thing again that's right see the people how that they'd only look at truth and see what truth is our church don't believe that we got some other way well it ain't the right way it ain't the thing he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins now they won't do it oh then what do they do now that's just one thing upon hundreds we'll get to maybe as fast as we can now the second crucifixion then if a man accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the name what does he do to the people he crucifies the effects of the word to the people when he says that Mark 16 was just for that generation and God said himself right there Jesus talking to him said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them how for every nation every Creed every tongue every race every people the same gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe am and when a man tries to cut that out of the Bible he crucifies the effects of the Gospel to that congregation amen hallelujah so I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you're guilty of murdering the Lord hallelujah the church hated him why he was their very God they hated him and denied him to be their Messiah no sir they didn't want such a messiah as that and today the church does the same thing it denies a word they don't want it it's contradictory to what they've been taught to believe by their reads amen and the word is the Messiah you believe that what the reflection of the word then is what amen a reflecting the Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's reflecting himself try not too worry if he find a lamp that he can look through it ain't smoked up with Creeds and things he can give light through remember they Rose and trimmed their lamps and washed out the chimneys but it's too late so when a man sees these Lutheran Presbyterian methodists trying to come in these last dayses to receive the Holy Ghost why you know they don't get it that's right oh they might speak in tongues and jump up and down but Watch What Happens they absolutely it's a Time sign that she's over we're at the end most any time the the church could hear the challenge to come on high amen amen just exactly setting us in the order the Holy Spirit here making Jesus Christ a reality through the ones that he can work through proving himself come down takes his picture shows it makes signs te talk about it everything else proving just exactly what he said he would do doing exactly the things he said he would do scripturally not not some Creed or some man's worked up idea a lot of blood fire and smok and stuff but a scriptural Messiah evidence got a lot of impersonations and impersonators and and so forth but that only makes a real word shine its best that's right that's people who are spiritual who can judge between right and wrong denies him denied their Messiah we didn't want him the same thing they do today well if I had to go down there and act like that bunch I don't want it at all all right then you don't have it at all that's all same now although he was properly identified they didn't want him they hated him why was it we call their pastors a bunch of snakes he said you bunch of whiteed walls you're nothing but a graveyard the out of his polished with robes and turned around collars and the insides Dead Man's Bon he didn't pull no punches one a little bitty galileon a carpenter son but he didn't pull no punches he told him don't think John said the Forerunner of it said he's another didn't pull any punches he said don't come around here saying now you got Abraham to our father God's able to these Stones R children of Abraham yes sir the axes laid to the root of the tree and every tree that don't bring forth fruits HED Down cast Into the Fire yes sir God is strict and firm and Stern with his word yes sir notice Jesus proven by the scripture do you hear me am Jesus was identified by God through the scriptures that he was Messiah is that right we get to Peter's indictment a few minutes you'll find out where that was he was thoroughly identified that he was God manifested in a man called the Son of God that's right although he was properly identified and Vindicated the promised word that he was Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he comes he'll be a prophet and all these things will take place the little woman with the stand at the well and all that dirty condition that she was what that symbolize that God in these last days would pull out Outcast remember last night at the wedding or the other time I preacher at the wedding supper he sin how they said I've made a great feast and so forth and all these men I bit them and each one had an excuse I can't do it because it would ruin our Creeds I can't come because I have a uh uh my married a wife she won't let me come my I I got married to a church down here my mother was Methodist or Baptist or Catholic or I just can't stand for that he said and you won't come and you won't taste my supper but get out there and compel prostitutes and harlots and drunkards and whatever there is bring them in I'll straighten them up Hallelujah I made my supper and my guest my table's setting there going to be somebody [Applause] there they didn't come just condemning them Jews what about today Hallelujah I belong to the Presbyterian I can't me Luther I'm a Oneness I'm a Tess I'm a this I can't I can't there you are you won't be there then amen that's exactly what he said all right properly a Vindicated Messiah properly a Vindicated the word the promised word the god that promised the word that this what the Messiah would be here he come and stood exactly and he said to him now where have I failed if you can't believe me as a man believe the works that I do for they are the things that tell who I am they're the ones that says I'm Messiah you don't want to believe me because you think of Joseph over there and I was born over there and that little Hut and and my foster father here is a a carpenter down there and and you when to come into Galilee there they and was going to make he said here who is this fellow who is this well this man isn't isn't joy and all them his brothers here isn't his sisters with is his mother called Mary and his daddy called Joseph where to get a guy like that what school did he come from he has no Fellowship card he don't have any credentials where did a guy like it where did you get this it anyhow and the Bible said he was a is offended he said many mighty Works he could not do and just turned his back and walked away from him he said a prophet's not without honor except his among his own people in his own County watch or in his own country there he is properly Vindicated the Messiah took no credit of his own he said I can do nothing but what I see the father doing and he challenged them to asked if that was the Messiah and look at that [Music]
