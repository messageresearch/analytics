[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] we deem this such a great privilege to Stand Here among the saved and can sing this glorious old Hymn of the church Lord I believe to see the Faith of Our Father still living in the hearts of his children down Through the Ages and as the song has just told us we are on our way to canaan's land we pray father tonight if there be some here who has not made that decision yet that's not not come to the place that that they can just only believe the word I pray that this will be the night that they'll make that final say and accept Christ as Savior be filled with his Spirit we thank thee for this group that's called the Full Gospel businessman and for what it stands for for righteousness we're happy to know that in our land is man of in the business world who takes time to serve you to tell others spending their their money and their time to help others along the way becoming citizens of the kingdom of God we thank thee for our Minister Brothers here tonight those who are holding the torch light to show this darkened world that there is a road that leads to glory for every member of the Church of the Living God and for those who have come in Lord newcomers we pray now that as we Endeavor to open the word that you will divided to the people as we have need of and when the service is closed tonight and we go home May there be newborn babes added to the kingdom or maybe there's someone here tonight Lord who's very sick and needs the touch of the great physician may they receive it tonight Grant it Lord and we'll humbly give Thee the praise for we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen be seated [Music] it's [Music] a one of the greatest times of my life is when I get to stand before people to speak about the joy of my life Jesus Christ what he means to me and then to have the privilege of sharing this Joy with someone else who has never had this Joy uh speaking the other day I'm used to be a boy preacher this is 33 years in the ministry and I lived upon the reputation of a boy preacher but now I passed that time and now I'm becoming the old preacher but each day he as a song said he grows still sweeter than he was the day before as I begin to cross over the halfway mark and looking towards the setting of The Sun Christ becomes more to me day by day and when I have these privileges stand before businessmen and women of the communities and to speak to them about something that means more to them than than anything in the world that is eternal life amen I do not think there's anything any greater and the that I could think of than eternal life when you're young you begin to think about well as a boy you're playing tops and a little girl is cutting paper dos after a while it's your education then or you go to marry the girl with brown eyes or blue and then the house is to be paid for the children's to be educated and where you at but I'm so glad that there's something that real after this is all over then you enter in to something that means more than these other things which they are they are essential certainly they are to who's going to be the mother of our and father of our children and our homes and so forth and the education of the children but even that all perishes it goes but life eternal is the greatest thing I know of it satisfied me when I was a young boy it satisfies me now while I'm a middle-aged man and I'm sure when the curtains are falling around my life I'll be happy to go meet the one that have spent my life for now to brother Tony the the president of the chapter here and I'm happy to be here with him in fellowship tonight with brother Carl Williams and other chapter uh Executives or Representatives and with all you visitors with us we're happy to be here one time I was speaking I believe was at Little Rock Arkansas in the robis Memorial Auditorium and there had been a man healed had been several years on crutches sitting on the street selling pencils and he could all just twist his limbs was paralyzed and get around people felt awfully sorry for him one night he come into the meeting and he got a prayer card and got into the line and was healed and the next day he had his crutches on his back walking up and down the street testifying and I was trying to speak and and uh after a while he raised up and he said uh brother brandom he said I'm kind of wit sins he said when I heard you speaking he said I thought thought you were a Nazarene that's what he was and he said and then I seen so many Pentecostals around he said somebody said you were Pentecostal and then I heard you say that you were a Baptist was Arin in the Baptist Church said I get it all mixed up what are you I said oh that's easy I'm a Pentecostal Nazarene [Music] Baptist together when I I come among the Pentecostal people a few years ago which the Lord sent me over when he are dained that I should pray for his sick children and the own denominational church that I was with at that time didn't believe much on praying for the sick or Divine Healing it was foreign to them they told me I'd become a Holy Roller and well maybe I have become a ho I don't know but I'm awful happy and whatever I am and someone said I'd lost my mind I said then just leave me alone because I'm more happier this way and it was the other way so I I just feel good this way and I it's been joy unspeakable but when I had come among the Pentecostal people I I thought there were only one group of them and then come to find out there just about as many groups cut away in them as it was in the Baptist Church that I came from then I wouldn't take sides with any groups I tried to stand between all of them and say we are brothers see and that's been my attitude ever since to see the great Church of the Living God United together in faith and prayer and effort and then when the Full Gospel businessman's uh set up their organism because they are not an organization they're an organism and that took in all groups and it gave me a place and they tuck me under their wing and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to speak for the Christian businessman because there I can express my belief among all the groups at the same time and it's been a great thing to me and I belong to one organization that's the Full Gospel businessman and to do that there's now in Africa where we are planning going right away down in South Africa where the lord gave us one of the greatest meetings that I suppose he ever did give us was down in South Africa where we saw 30,000 blanket natives received Christ as Savior in one afternoon service they registered 30,000 the next morning while Sydney Smith the mayor of Durban called me on the phone which was with at the meeting we had some bought around 200,000 at the stadium or the dog or the racetrack and he said go to your window and look out the window and there came seven van loads and them great English trucks is practically almost across this room full of crutches and Wheelchairs and and things that the people had laid on the day before and they were walking behind the trucks singing with their hands in the air the song that you sang a few moments ago only believe all things are possible and I my heart I said Lord this will be a Memorial Day to me and the few days the day was only to be there three days and that's where I'm returning back again now and there are three days and I I just don't know what all taking place that come about by just one Miracle the Lord did at the platform give a a boy that was walking on his hands and feet like a dog restored him to his right mind and straightened him up before the people and the day before those people had to be fenced off because they were having tribal war and now they were at peace walking with their arms around each other singing only believe all things are possible I tell you the grand old gospel though in its Simplicity has never lost its power when it preached in the simpleness of the resurrection of Christ and uh it grows dearer to me each day and if you're a businessman here tonight and you haven't come into any businessman's Fellowship let me recommend this Full Gospel businessman you don't have to belong to any church or or every church that you're in It's Perfectly all right it has a title Full Gospel businessman but it don't have to be a full gospel man to do it Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterians even Catholic priest whoever it is there you know I believe Jacob dug a well and the Philistines running away from it I believe he called it malice or something he dug another one they running away from that he called it strife and they dug the third one he said there's room for us all so I think that's what this is there's room for all of us here and we'd be glad to have you in this Tucson are you here to come in and fellowship with us and then don't forget the Phoenix meeting and now I know we're not supposed to uh give advertisement from the platform here because we made that a policy but being this is all connected with the Full Gospel businessman I'm to have prayer for the sick and preaching 4 days prior the meeting at the remata this coming December January the 193r 19th to the 23rd four day I'll begin on the 19th is that right I begin on the 19 and then I have 4 days meeting and to you toon people next Sunday night I'm praying for the sick over the Assemblies of God grant way brother Arnold Max church if there's someone sick and like to come in I'll be speaking there the Lord willing next Sunday night praying for the sick and now may the blessings of God rest upon you and if you have your Bible I would like to get quickly to the word because I know many of you work tomorrow and uh will speak to you tonight from a scripture that I want to read out of the book of Romans Romans the 8th chapter and we want to begin at the 28th verse and read down the 32nd verse inclusive Romans 828 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and to whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word and now I want to speak on the subject of pardon the Bible said here tonight that he gave us all things well we certainly could not speak on all things but we will take one thing that he has given us and that is pardon and I think that's a glorious word to be pardoned because we are all guilty of sin we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God and God through his son has pardoned us from this guilt of iniquity and sin and a pardon reminds me of a story I read once of a in the Revolutionary War I believe it was that there was a man a soldier foot soldier that had did something that was the had found him guilty and he was sentenced to be shot I believe it was neglecting his poster Duty in time of battle and he um he was going to be uh killed by a firing squad and one fell felt so sorry for this man until he finally made his way to the uh the great President Lincoln lincol being a Christian gentleman they said he was riding up in his Carriage when the messenger met him and he fell up on his knees and said Mr Lincoln president of the United States kind sir he said I ask Mercy for one knowing that you are a Christian and know that you have tenderness in your heart for the weary he said my friend was at the post of Duty or where he was stationed but when the guns was roaring and the cannons firing he got scared and he left the post of Duty Mr Lincoln you didn't mean to do it he's a good man and now in a week from this day he must die by a firing squad there's no way to save him except you will sign his pardon Mr Lincoln with tears in his eyes pulled a piece of paper from his brief and wrote on there I Abraham Lincoln pardon this man of such shall not die and signed his name to it and the man gave him God's blessings and returned back to the prison and said to his friend I have your pardon and he pulled it out upon a piece of paper to show him and the man said don't mock me here I'm fixing to die and then come with such as that I do not believe it I just can't believe that isn't so any man could sign his name Abraham Ling he said but this is the president's signature said you are pardon and he turned his back and walked away and the man died under the firing squad and then here is a a a release from Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States to release this man and yet they shot him so it was tried in the federal courts and here was the decision a pardon is not a pardon unless it be accepted as a pardon Pard so this tonight that I read that God gives us all things and he gives us pardon it's pardon to those who want to accept God's word as pardon but it only just to read it it doesn't mean that you are pardon it means that you've got to accept it as your pardon that God gave his son to die in your stead and then it's a pardon released from guilt is what we wish to place on this a pardon from God is a release from guilt not the Turning Away by psychological doctrine of some sort that might in some way give you a little feeling that you have uh done what's right but joining church or taking up some Creed but it's a release from your guilt by the power of Calvary something has released you there's no more guilt the Bible says I believe in Romans 51 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now a man when he is released from sin man or a woman there is no more desire in their heart to walk after the things of the world he is freely pardoned and becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus and his affections are set on the things that are above where Christ sits at the right hand of God he's freely released he doesn't have to uh have some priest to tell him or some minister to tell him he knows in himself that he is pardoned because he's as accepted up it upon the grounds that God sent it to him through Jesus Christ what a feeling it is to be free from sin I was told when the emancipation of the Proclamation was signed for the slaves in the South many years ago that the set time that they were free was it sunup on a certain morning and they all got out from the old plantation and many of the young men climbed way to the top of the mountain because they could see the sun uh come up first and then the older man a little beneath that and then the women and children at the bottom and they were waiting a long time before daylight called slave belts hard trials had marked their life with sorrow and they long for that day that when they know that they were pardon and the emancipation of proclamation said it this certain day at sunup they are free and they were longing to see that out when the sun come up so anxious till they climb the mountains oh if Sinners tonight could only be that anxious to know that you're pardoned you're pardoned the minute that you accept Jesus Christ as your savior then you are pardoned they said that the young man waited and as soon as the sun began to shine in the East they scream down to the older we are free and the older down to the women and children we are free we are free because the sun was up oh when man has sold out to sin and when the Son of God came up out of the Grave that morning for our justification I think it ought to be a scream across the Nations we are free from sin and shame freely pardoned by the bonds of cow no greater thing could be given to the human race when man sinned in the Garden of Eden he crossed a great Chasm separating himself from the Eternal one man at that time was eternal with God he had no sickness sorrow or death man was not made to die hell was not made for man hell was created for the devil and his angels and not for mankind because they were created on Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God but when man sinned and stepped across the boundary line between right and wrong he separated himself from God leaving himself no way back he was totally lost he could not come back because he had sinned but God rich in mer Mercy accepted a substitute because he had said the day you eat thereof that day you die God's justice and his Holiness uh requires death because it's his word and he must keep his word in order to be God and now the love that he had for the human race and yet had to see them separated from him and the fellowship that he had with his children children in the Garden of Eden and that heartbroken condition that he's had to be in all that time because his word said the day you eat thereof that day you die then we can rely upon this whatever God says is true it must come to pass God cannot take his word back see because he's infinite and he's Eternal and his first decision is alltime decision he doesn't have to to take it back because he learned more about it he's infinite to begin with and therefore When God says anything it's perfectly that way it can never be changed because it's the perfect decision and then the way God acts upon uh the subjects that accepts his decision it will forever act upon every subject that accepts his decision that way therefore if he made a way for a man to be saved the first way he made has ever remained the same way am and if God promised healing to the sick upon Faith to believe it it ever remains that way he cannot take it back he must ever remain the same way [Applause] [Music] [Music]
