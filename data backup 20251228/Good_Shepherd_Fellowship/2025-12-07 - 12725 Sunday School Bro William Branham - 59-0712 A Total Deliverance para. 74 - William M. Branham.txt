[music] [music] [music] swelled out like an inflated inner tube and they've been trying to cut them out for a long time or was going to and he wouldn't let them. Finally, he found an interview. THEM INTERVIEWS WE STAY RIGHT WITH IT TILL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG. And the man had no more coming. So the Holy SPIRIT WENT BACK DOWN TO HIS LIFE AND CALLED OUT SOMETHING HE DONE WHEN HE WAS AN ALTER boy in the Catholic church. He said, "That's the truth. That's the honest truth." &gt;&gt; Said, "Do you mean that was against me?" I said, "That's the only shadow that I can see in your life." WENT BACK UP AND TOLD THE DOCTOR SAID, "ALL RIGHT, GET THINGS TOGETHER NOW. WE'LL have the operation." The doctor said, "We'll check that old ticker again." AND WHEN HE LOOKED INTO IT, HE SAID, "YOU DON'T NEED THE OPERATION." AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; if our hearts condemn us, &gt;&gt; we want complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; We don't WANT TO BE HALFWAY CHURCH. WE WANT TO BE A REAL CHURCH &gt;&gt; or no church at all. WE WANT TO BE REAL CHRISTIANS OR NO CHRISTIANS AT ALL. We want total deliverance from our habits, from our sins, &gt;&gt; from our EVIL THINKING, FROM OUR EVIL DOING, FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE, WHATEVER WE'VE [screaming] DONE, WE WANT TOTAL DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; So that when people come into this church to be prayed for, there will be just this little group, MAYBE NOT OVER A HUNDRED OR TWO SITTING HERE, BUT THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY IN THE HANDS OF GOD. And when we pray, then God will hear from heaven. &gt;&gt; God wants somebody that he can hold in his hand. &gt;&gt; Somebody that he CAN SAY, "I GOT CONFIDENCE IN. &gt;&gt; I can send this my sick servant to the Brandon Tabernacle Jefferson." THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE ONE [screaming] ACCORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Something will happen. Well, look what HE DOES FOR US IN THE CONDITION THAT WE'RE IN. &gt;&gt; What would he do if WE WERE ONE HEART AND ONE ACCORD? &gt;&gt; The only way we can do that is unify our hearts together with brotherly love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Obey the offices of the church and THE PASTOR AND THE PASTOR OBEY GOD. &gt;&gt; THEN GOD WORKS THROUGH THE PASTOR THROUGH THE BOARD DOWN INTO THE CHURCH AND ALL TOGETHER ARE ONE unit &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of God. Then God will hear &gt;&gt; when we have A UNIFIED GROUP. LET NOTHING BOTHER YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISMAYED in anything. &gt;&gt; Now that's the kind of a person that God ordained to take the land. Moses was complete. He was a man that wouldn't compromise. If there were stews and fusses and so forth, he wouldn't compromise. That's what God wants us now. Pharaoh wanted to agree, said to Moses, "You all CAN GO. HOW ABOUT YOU LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN behind or leave SOME OF YOUR CATTLE back here? That's the way the devil wants a Christian to come. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO JOIN THE CHURCH, BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FORGIVE JONES. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU CAN BRING IN YOUR IF YOU CAN GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR SMOKING, your drinking, your lying, your stealing, your fault finding, backbiting. You don't have to give THAT UP. JUST JOIN THE CHURCH. But Moses wasn't a compromise. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED COMPLETE DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WE'LL NOT LEAVE ONE HOOF BEHIND." AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO US &gt;&gt; when we go to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the way the church ought to be. &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE RIGHTEOUSNESS. WE'LL TAKE HOLINESS. WE'LL TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT. WE'LL TAKE A UNIFIED GROUP. WHEN WE GO TO the altar, &gt;&gt; we'll be a real group. WE'LL LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND. WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; There won't be one hoof. Stay back here. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when people can pray in such a way to the devil had to get in. &gt;&gt; That's the way Moses and his group did. THEY GOT OVER THERE AND GOT UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; You notice until they got under the blood, there was no total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; MOSES HIMSELF, HE WAS UNIFIED WITH GOD, BUT ISRAEL WASN'T. THERE STILL WAS SIN. AND THEY MURMURED AGAINST Moses &gt;&gt; and THEY SAID, "WHY? WHY DO YOU DO THIS? YOU BRING MORE TROUBLE UP ON US. CUZ PHARAOH JUST DOUBLED their tally of bricks and so forth. That was Moses. He was completely in the HANDS OF GOD. TOTALLY DELIVERED FROM SHEEP HURTING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They hurt God's sheep. &gt;&gt; He was totally delivered himself. But the people wasn't delivered because they were still murmuring among them. One night WHEN GOD ORDAINED THAT A LAMB SHOULD BE killed type of Christ AND THE BLOOD WAS DIPPED IN hass which is wheat common humble and put over the little of the door and on the post THAT'S WHEN ISRAEL BECOME COMPLETELY DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; With not a HOOF LEFT BEHIND. ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WAS DELIVERED. THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR LOVED ONES, AND EVERYTHING WAS DELIVERED. WHEN THEY COMPLETELY COME UNDER the blood, &gt;&gt; that's when the church should be completely delivered. When everything comes under the blood, &gt;&gt; when your sins come under the blood, WHEN YOU'RE SMOKING, WHEN YOU'RE GAMBLING, WHEN YOU'RE CHEATING, WHEN YOU'RE STEALING, WHEN YOU'RE LYING, &gt;&gt; when everything is brought under the blood, &gt;&gt; then there'll be a total deliverance. &gt;&gt; You wrong somebody, make it right. You can't bring that under the blood, it won't stay. You can't bring it, something won't let you do it. When yourself is completely totally brought under the blood, THERE WILL BE A TOTAL DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then you'll have a freedom like you've never known before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When everything's brought in the blood, brought in submissive to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Then there will be a real deliverance. Jesus was completely totally man. He could cry like a man. He could eat like a man. HE COULD BE TIRED LIKE A MAN. HE WAS COMPLETELY TOTALLY man in his physical being. And in his spirit HE WAS COMPLETELY TOTALLY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he was tempted in all manners like we are. HE WAS MAN, NOT an angel. He was a man. He had desires AND TEMPTATIONS JUST LIKE WE DO. THE BIBLE SAID HE DID. &gt;&gt; He was a man, not an angel above temptation. Hebrews 1 said that he was uh HEBREWS 1:4 SAID HE WAS MADE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS. &gt;&gt; He was man COMPLETELY MAN. THAT GOD TOOK A COMPLETE man to BRING TOTAL DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he filled him with his spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was in him without measure. &gt;&gt; And he was tempted like we were. And he was completely God. HE PROVED IT WHEN HE RAISED THE DEAD. When he stopped nature, the roaring seas and the mighty winds, when he spoke TO THE TREES AND SO FORTH, THEY OBEYED HIM. HE WAS GOD INSIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he could have been man or he was man. But he totally AND COMPLETELY DELIVERED HIMSELF AS A man into THE HANDS OF GOD FOR THE service of God. And he is our example. &gt;&gt; We are men and women. WE'RE ALSO CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OF HIS ART EXAMPLE, LET US COMPLETELY DELIVER OURSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; We might be subjects of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Totally man. He was totally God. &gt;&gt; But he surrendered his natural parts to his and his physical parts and his own thinking AND HIS OWN DOING AND HIS OWN CARES. AND I DO ONLY THAT WHICH PLEASES THE FATHER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There you're totally delivered from human beings. &gt;&gt; The priests come to him, the great man, and said, "Rabbi so AND SO AND TRIED TO BRIBE HIM into their affiliations and denominations, BUT HE WAS TOTALLY delivered because he trusted in God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Did not the psalmist say, "Thou will deliver him for he has completely trusted in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER MY DARLING FROM THE DOGS BECAUSE HE HAS TRUSTED IN ME. &gt;&gt; Some hour when we come to THE END OF LIFE'S JOURNEY, I want it for mine. I know you want it FOR YOURS. I WANT HIM TO SAY, "I'LL DELIVER HIM OUT THE JAWS OF DEATH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR he's trusted in me. &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER HIM FROM THE GRAVE ON THE RESURRECTION MORNING. TOTALLY. DELIVER HIM BOTH SOUL, BODY, AND SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Because he has trusted in me. &gt;&gt; All Jesus works was complete. Everything was complete. Total delivered. He totally delivered the leper from leprosy. He totally delivered the woman with a blood issue from her issue. HE TOTALLY DELIVERED THE WORLD FROM SIN WHEN HE DIED AT THE DAY OF THE ATONEMENT. &gt;&gt; HE TOTALLY DELIVERED EVERY SIN. &gt;&gt; He delivered THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE. THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE IN A DEFEATED STATE BECAUSE HE DEFEATED THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; AND TOOK ALL THE PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS AND SUBDUED THEM UNDER HIS FEET AND THEY HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS TO RULE OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; We are CHRISTIANS &gt;&gt; FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; We don't have TO DICT THE DEVIL dictate to us. &gt;&gt; Christ delivered us total deliver us. delivered us from evil, delivered us from sin, delivered us from habits, delivered us from talking, delivered us from black guard, delivered us from ALL KINDS OF SMUTTY THINGS. HE TOTALLY DELIVERED US AND PUT US INTO HIS HOLY HANDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A complete total deliverance. He delivered our sickness. He delivered US FROM SICKNESS. FOR WE HAVE AN ABSTRACT DEED TO THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS, WITH HIS STRIPES WE WERE HEALED. &gt;&gt; He is our healer. &gt;&gt; That's why that poor little polio WOMAN TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF A CANCER DYING HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; She walked into the rims in THE PRESENCE OF GOD. SHE HAD FAITH AND SHE THE DOCTORS HAD DONE ALL they could do. So she followed God's instructions and was totally delivered. &gt;&gt; The disciples had total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Absolutely total deliverance. WHY? BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. when you just a church member and shuck the pastor's hands or some had some kind of a little experience the jumping shouting or speaking in tongues or something other and still have malice in your heart strange acts telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting after women there's something hasn't happened yet &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG FOR HE THAT LOVES THE WORLD OR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD THE LOVE OF God's not &gt;&gt; you've been misled led by their fruit you shall know them. &gt;&gt; We all want to be unified together with the Holy Spirit. Every member should be unified one with the other. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. It cleanses us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are delivered from the things of the world. Jesus said, "This will all men know that you're my disciples when you got love one for the other. When one member loves the other member so MUCH THAT THEY WOULD DIE for it. When one evil thing starts the outside world, some of the women come along and say, "Now look dear, it would be better for you if you did this or do that, wore this or did that or done this and got away in that bunch of holy rollers or so forth like that. WE ARE SO UNIFIED WITH BLOOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Brown, it's an awful temptation." BUT CHRIST DIED FOR THAT PURPOSE. The devil is defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. WE WANT TOTAL DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; We want a church that's pure and clean AND UNADULTERATED AND WASHED IN THE BLOOD AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND SIGNS AND wonders and miracles. Deliver everyone. Dear God, you don't take things unless it's totally delivered. YOU CANNOT RECEIVE A SACRIFICE WITH a blemish on it. &gt;&gt; You would never receive a prayer &gt;&gt; that there's sin back in the life of that person. &gt;&gt; You just could not do it. Lord, you didn't do it. The ages gone by and you can't do it today. &gt;&gt; But the sacrifice must be without blemish. Lord God, AS WE LAY OURSELVES ON THE ALTAR, &gt;&gt; A SACRIFICE LIFE, take from us, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; all blemishes of sin, &gt;&gt; I completely lay my soul AND MY BODY AND MY STRENGTH and my efforts with this church this morning on the altar. &gt;&gt; Cleanse us by thy blood. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND FORGIVE US OF EVERY SIN THAT WE HAVE DID. &gt;&gt; And may the great Holy Spirit so richly abide in us in his presence go with us from this tabernacle this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we'll know within ourselves &gt;&gt; that he has forgiven us. &gt;&gt; And the prayer will be forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Grant it, Lord, be thou near us now. Bless us and keep us until we meet again at the evening service. May we come in with clean hands and a pure heart that you'll not turn down. For we want a complete and total deliverance from anything, Lord, that would keep us from being the light of the world. A candle that's set on a hill, not a bush alone, but a candle that sets on the hill that gives light to guide people's feet in the way that's right. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Father. We ask that in Jesus name and for his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask Doc, I think he's back there, one of the deacons is present that the church might read. Doc, come put this on the bulletin board so the church can see this to go out and then brother Collins if he's sure is brother Collins then give him his other and we'll see what had someone wanting an interview. That's always granted. Uh we are glad and I have interviews. You see, the thing you do is call our number out there. We we had so much trouble up the house. The church knows that this isn't strangers. Um the church knows about it. There should be a little piece. I'll have it placed here in the church too for homecomers. You see, there's so many that we can't take care of them all just as they come by number. And we and if you'll just call Butler 21519 Butler and any of the members that sees anyone that wants I'm always glad to see people but we have a regular system as some already called several see and we just come by one by one as we come down used to be we just had kind of a halfhazard hit anyway skip hop people went home disappointed and everything now they have everything just in order and that's what we're trying to speak up now see everything in order just perfectly. I'll be glad to see this dear party if they'll just call Butler 215191519 and Mr. Mercer or Mr. Goldwan will answer the phone and tell you just exactly when you can have an appointment. We got a place out there airond conditioned and ready to receive the people and pray for them. We're only happy to do it. Now, the reason I don't come to church that people thinks I try to get away from the people. It isn't. I'm trying to to be exactly in order. See that's what I want to be. Just won't show respect the person each person anybody anywhere anytime. See color creed has nothing to do with it. We come right there and meet the people and if they have a need we stay right with God until it's solved. If they want to know anything about meetings of course we take care of it and follow it. That's only the leading of the Holy Spirit. And that's that way I think it's just it does everyone just exactly the same. Therefore there's no respected person. No respect. Was there any peoples that come to be prayed for this morning that was sick and want to be prayed for? All right, there's not. Then let's sing a good song for the for worship. What can we sing this morning? What can take away my sin? You know what, Teddy? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can &gt;&gt; you pray for her now? I'm going to pray for that lady. Lay hands on this woman here. Would you bow your heads with me right? Dear God, there's a lady that's very sick. Our sister has her body even to take cancer from other standing to preach for us. But you deliver her from that few days ago when those things were known. Just let her find it out herself. Lord, she'll know that it comes to you. I lay my hands up on her and ask for mercy for that other woman. &gt;&gt; May the grace of God, the power of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There any evil in our hearts, Lord, reveal it to us first and we will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we know that we have favor with God, we have peace with God, we get what we ask for because we have no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord in Jesus name, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. But the blood [singing] of Jesus. Oh, nothing but the blood of [singing] Jesus. over his face white as snow. No other blood. &gt;&gt; How many feels that all your sins are under the blood? Let's sing it with our hands on
