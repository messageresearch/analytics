tonight appreciate brother latte for the invitation and he's asked me about three years now so we finally made it work but it's good to be back in Minnesota again first time I've been here when it was warm so I didn't know there was warm weather here so I tell you I've told the story many times the first time I come up I'm cold natured anyway and it was December and so we I got in the car with Brother Scott and after church and I had on my suit I had an Overcoat I had a hat on we're driving down the road and I was shivering and he's just wearing a suit coat he's fine and he looks at me he says are you cold and I said yeah he said well maybe I should turn the heat on [Laughter] [Music] I said well that would help amen we love the Lord tonight and if we could let's just turn over to the book of Ephesians chapter 3 amen thank god brother but they said it best he said that in this hour what a freedom we really have it's the Freedom by the son of man you know our freedoms in this nation are getting taken away you know little by little they're taking everything that that has been given to us they're trying to take our god-given rights but there is something that has come to us that is a freedom that no man can take away you know I was talking with brother Prater yesterday and we're looking at you know uh the Revelation that has come in this hour and so you know there's got to come a final Revelation that changes this body but we know one thing that the soul has already been changed and we know that the spirit has already been changed and so no matter what the government does no matter you know they can take this body but one thing about it the soul is already raptured so we're thankful for that Revelation in this hour amen Ephesians chapter 3 verse 1. for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ and you can be seated this evening all right I want to take for a thought tonight something that may seem uh Elementary to you but it seems like in this hour when we are we should be at the peak of Revelation that many people are starting to turn away from the basics and turn away from the original truth and so I I just want to take a simple thought tonight on the proper channel for revelation the proper channel for Revelations as I said this is this is going to be basic um but I've never claimed to be a deep preacher but I just want to look at this you know uh uh uh it seems like people are falling away from the fact and I don't say just the truth but it's a fact that God sent us a prophet in this hour and you know that all Revelation all scripture Revelation must come through a prophet and so I just want to take and where I draw my title from the proper Channel brother Brandon was speaking about the upper room and he said so when they got completely surrendered God came down again in the Shekinah Glory and filled all the house where they were setting he said what did God do like the ark dropping into its proper sockets for the message of that day God dropped back into his proper Channel so understand God has a certain channel that he operates in God has a certain way that he does things and so if you can ever find the channel in which God operates then you'll know from that day forward this is the way he's going to do it God doesn't change his tactics brother Branham says in one place he said God always uses the same tactics he said and so does the devil so if you can understand the way the devil operates and understand the way God operates you become more than a conqueror now let's go back through this Ephesians 3 1 for this cause I want to look at the calls now the prophet of God said that Ephesians parallels Joshua Ephesians is the placing of sons I believe that's where we're at today is we're in the age of the placing of sons and he said for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ I want you to look at this I apologize he's saying this starts with me I'm a prisoner but it's for you now watch this if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given where it's given to the messenger of the age the Revelation does not come through some preacher somewhere the revelation of the age comes through the messenger of the age but watch I says it it's given me to you how that by Revelation he made known unto who come on now he's showing us the channel in which Revelation comes how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote it for in a few words whereby when ye read he's he's showing us this this channel here God's giving it to me I'm giving it to you God done it to me but it's for you this came to me now I'm giving it to you and now he says it was made known unto me for one reason that when you read that you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so Paul is showing us that when a messenger to the age comes on the scene all revelation will come through the mouth of that messenger Acts 3 22 says for Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me and him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which shall not hear that Prophet watch the way he says it it's not just hearing some word it's it's not uh Every Soul that that you know doesn't believe uh uh that Jesus died for their sins you know we we it seems like even around the message we're starting to kind of preach achieving the gospel you know that we don't we don't put emphasis on what God has done in this hour and I do think that if you're a real son and daughter of God you want to see everybody make it but you've got to understand there's one provided way in this hour to make it that's right amen praise the Lord and he said in it shall come to pass that every soul which shall not hear which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people see understanding Noah's in Noah's day there was only one way to get over there was only one way to make it and that was through the ark and in this hour there is one provided way there is one way to make a Rapture it is through the rapturing word brought To Us by the mouth of Malachi chapter four [Music] you know when I think about this why why do we not share this to the world you know this message people are afraid ask a Baptist person what they believe they'll tell you once they've always saved I'm a member of the Baptist Church ask someone that's a Pentecost what do you believe I'm UPC We Believe speaking in tongues it's initial evidence of the Holy Ghost but ask a message believer what do we believe and what do we tell them is this foreign to you come on now sometimes we're afraid to say I believe that in this hour God sent a prophet to the age there's got to be a boldness within it how is the world going to know if we that have the Revelation do not share the revelation remind of a story one time brother Billy Paul told he said he went to his dentist and he said I've been I'd been going to him for years and he said I was sitting in the dentist chair and he said he put a book A Spoken Word Book around in front of me and he said Billy is this your daddy and he said yes it is he said then why haven't you told me about him before he said Billy if I had a daddy like that I'd tell the world about him I want to tell you I believe that if we really understand what the message is and and not has stood for us the lips could not stay close but we would have to Rejoice we would have to tell the co-workers where we go to school we were in a restaurant look what God has done in my day really beautiful [Music] so you might say well I'm afraid of rejection Luke 17 25. he says but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation now we are the light of God to the world and now he's saying that if you are like Christ brother Bynum said one time he said you would say you want to be christ-like he said get ready to be crucified so said he must first suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drink they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered the Ark and the flood came and destroyed them all hmm now look at this it's important to follow the voice of the messenger and I think sometimes that we forget how strong that that messenger's position is we've come to a point where men decide now I I I've got a revelation and brother Brandon was wrong I'm going to tell you when a man says brother Brandon was wrong you just don't listen to anything else he's got to say I heard I heard a man the other day claiming this message got a large Church in the message and he stood up and he said brother Branham said this but he was wrong there and then he proceeded to tell what he thought was the right Revelation and I thought my goodness where are we coming to listen in this hour of all the billions of people that are walking the Earth and have walked the Earth since 1909 God picked one man out of those billions of people to bring his word to this generation I say he didn't get it wrong the man God picked done a good job [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah I want to show you how much power there is in a prophet's word one time the word comes to Isaiah he said go to hezekiah's house and tell him he's going to die thus saith the Lord he's going to die I want to ask you can thus saith the Lord be wrong so the prophet Isaiah goes to hezekiah's house and he says Hezekiah thus saith the Lord you're not going to raise up from this bit now Hezekiah believed in the word Prophet for his day Isaiah so what he done is he got fear in his heart and he dropped to his knees and the scripture said he turned his face to the wall what did Hezekiah do he began to repent to God and beg God for his life and the scripture says that when Hezekiah was still in the court yes right in other words Hezekiah was still in his front yard that God excuse me Isaiah was still in the front yard that God heard hezekiah's prayer and he tells Isaiah go back and tell him he's going to live now a word Prophet has said thus saith the Lord and five minutes later God says go tell him he's not gonna die so now the word Prophet comes back to Hezekiah it says Hezekiah had the saith the Lord 70 years have been added to you he said what thing would you ask of the Lord to show you that this is his word what did Hezekiah ask he said let the sun thou be turned back 10 degrees the sun thou at 10 degrees on a sundial is about 15 minutes now God's word profit cannot be wrong and thus saith the Lord cannot be wrong so the prophet tells him thus saith the Lord you're going to die walks out of the room and God says go back and tell him thus saith the Lord You're Going To Live and so for that word to be true time was turned back so that the word that has a cut that Isaiah told Hezekiah it was now before the time that he ever prophesied let me say it this way they could have came to Isaiah and said Isaiah at 7 30 you said he was going to die and he could say it's only 7 25. we've not even got to 7 30 yet I want to tell you when a word Prophet speaks God will back it up foreign [Applause] there might be things that brother Branham said that looks like it contradicts don't worry about it don't let it confuse you [Music] brother Branham said one time he said when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood he said he said it to throw the unbelievers off you understand Jesus wanted the crowd thinned out we're in an hour where where people are starting we want to build bigger churches and we want more people to come to the church I want you to understand I believe we need to get the law saved but we're in an hour where the unbelievers are going to be thinned out God came to Gideon one time and he said Gideon you can't fight this battle you Gideon said why he said you got too many you got too many soldiers God says so if I'm going to show my glory we're going to have to thin the crowd ah let me move Amos 3 7. surely the Lord God will do nothing I looked at this word nothing now I like to look at words you know nothing means says not a thing not a single thing not anything or Nothing at All I read this to the church and I said so that means you know we we sometimes we think about that well God won't do anything like you know some great big no God's not going to do anything at all that it didn't already come to the mouth of a prophet so if you want a revelation about marriage and divorce it's the prophet you want a marriage you want a revelation about uh uh the opening of the seventh seal it's the prophet you want a revelation about Christmas it's the Prophet come on people get all these Revelations and you know what I find I find churches start splitting because of little ideas when if we would go back to the word our church I I'll just tell you I'll share with you one of the worst things that's ever happened in our our local assembly it was devastating there was a a real uh uh a real trial we went through here a couple of years ago and and the church split and you know what I found it was over opinion there wasn't any word no one could they couldn't even manufacture where word wasn't preached correctly right but it was how I think it needs to be this way and I think it needs to be that way and so you have to understand just like there's a proper channel for the Revelation to come there's also a proper channel in the church that's right yes well I'm gonna preach like I'm at home because I I fly home tomorrow anyway so God did not ordain everyone in the church to come up with how the church should run God brought it through the mouth of a prophet and it's passed down to a pastor of the church and it is then filtered out to the people but what I find is one brother decides it should be this way and one sister decides it should be this way and now there's conflict in the church so you want to know why there's no Revival too many opinions all right he said he'll do nothing but he revealeth that he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets brother random says now remember this nothing can be revealed God will do nothing at all until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets and before he does anything he reveals it he said if you ever fail to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful Satan is his Sly and as slick as he can be he said put it with the word of God and consult your pastor you know what we want to do we want to consult our favorite preacher all right I can tell you that's the reason our church split people didn't go to the word and consult the pastor right man it's it's tied in here tonight now I don't know what I don't know who's devil I'm stepping on but listen it we're going to keep stepping okay but when you get a favorite evangelist and then the word has to be filtered through his mindset his idea listen God didn't ordain any other evangelists to operate and pass to this church so when you consult the word you go back to your pastor [Music] see now watch this he's showing us how the channel of Revelation comes now got to come through a word prophet Malachi chapter 4. says behold I send you who's you I'm going to tell you it's me I told you I'm free I'm going to preach simple but these are the basics that people around this message are leaving we should still be excited that God did this for us I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now we understand brother Branham fulfills more than just one part in scripture brother Branham fulfills Malachi chapter 4 but he also fulfills the seventh angel Messenger to the Church of laodicea that's right we understand that now I want us to look at this Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven cold with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not why couldn't he ride them because it had to be revealed in our hour because those Revelations laying under what the seven Thunders uttered was what would Rapture the church and God was not going to let there be a premature Rapture there had to be a bride to come into maturity so God said you got to seal it up if John would have let that out there would have already been a Rapture in the other ages but it had to be saved until this hour and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that they're in are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets I want us to look at this we have to understand the channel in which the word comes but brother Branham he tells us about one time when he was up in Sabino Canyon now watch this the mighty Angel comes down with a book open brother Branham catches the book Hebrews chapter 10 says lo I come in the volume of the book so the coming of the book is the coming of the Lord [Applause] he says and the angel which I saw stand upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven now watch this there's a mighty Angel Christ the word descending but there's an Angel that's standing on Earth with his hand in the air and let me read it to you this way brother Brandon said one day in Sabino Canyon I was standing with my hands in the air praying and a sword came into my hands here's the prophet of God wanting to bring Christ to the bride and to bring the introduction a sword comes in his hands he said you know that I stood there and looked at it just as natural as my hand is now not knowing what it meant and it was left me with a voice that said this is the sword of the king and then later when the angel of the Lord reveal it it was the word in the hand you have to understand that God could not break his word so for God to come to the Earth he promised that he would come with a shout of voice and a trumpet but for God to come to a bride first he had to come to a prophet I think we forget sometimes how great the revealed word is but this revealed word is literally Christ himself all right we are not feeding on the thoughts of a man we're not feeding on ideas of man but we are feeding on what the prophet said what's unfailing body word of the son of man Jesus said unless you eat my flesh this is his flesh [Music] he said the mystery of God should be finished and the word mystery there means a secret Doctrine as he hath declared unto his servants the prophets and the word Prophet there in the Greek it means an interpreter of the Divine will of God God would whisper in the ear of one man what he wanted it makes me think of one time a little girl named hadessa she came before the king but before she went before the king she had to come through one man a Chamberlain and the scripture tells us that the king told the Chamberlain this is what I want in a bride and so the Chamberlain told all of the virgins of the land what the king wanted but they didn't want to listen to him right the scripture says they could go in with whatever Jewels they wanted and whatever garments they wanted but little hadesta when she came in there her name was changed her name was changed from hadessa the name hadessa means Myrtle which Myrtle is a tree it is an earth-bound object and he changed her name to Esther which means star which is a Heavenly object you understand when the word of God the scripture says that in there was a new name written and when God gives you a new name it takes you from an Earthbound creature to a heaven-bound preacher little Esther she comes before the king and when the King Caesar it said that he loved her above all other women but I want you to catch something out of the Scripture it said that it said that haggai preferred Esther and the word preferred there in the Greek means he changed yes sir and I began to think that it wasn't he himself that changed her but when when when uh when haggai begin to speak to Esther and tell her and reveal to her the heart of the king then Esther begin to Adorn herself in the heart of the king so when Esther presented herself in the words of the Chamberlain she presented herself in it and the King saw her and said she is my thoughts expressed [Applause] power there was a word Prophet only one man that God Whispers in his ear and said this is what I want in a bride and when we dress in that word we become God's thoughts expressed oh he said the mystery will be finished so the seventh Angels Ministry is to complete all of the mystery Revelations 10 8 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth so now the book the word Christ the word is back on Earth brother Branham says we're told in Revelation 10 that there will be a messenger in the last day that will gather up these little ends and bring them together and went and then the mystery of God would be finished at the sounding of this Angel which was a messenger of the Earth then one came down from heaven with his hands up rainbow over his head and swore that there would be time no more an angel taking an oath Alaska says this he says and when we see this thing materializing oh how sincere we should be and the word materialize means to cause to appear in bodily form and in our hour we have seen Christ appear in a bodily form let me put it to you this way brother Branham was not the one that preached marriage in divorce right exactly at the end of marriage and divorce brother Brandon said I forgive you of your sins brother Branham was a man born of sex he had no right to forgive any one of their sins that was not William Branham standing there preaching marriage and divorce but it was Christ in body form I was talking to a brother that was there when brother Brandon was preaching when he called out the folks behind him and he said he said brother Brandon was preaching he said there was a curtain in front of him like this it was two two separate auditoriums there was one facing this way and one facing this way and he said so brother Branham didn't have anyone behind him he said but when he began to prophesy he turned his back he literally made a show Almost of what was going on and if you listen to the prophet of God he says it this way he says he turns and he says now there's a woman sitting behind me just like Sarah was behind Abraham in the tent what was it showing that Melchizedek once again had picked up a flesh body and was speaking to Abraham and Sarah what was the word of Melchizedek you're going to birth a son that's right there's going to be a birth in you that the promise is coming through you and our Melchizedek came again in this hour to tell a bride there's a birth coming and it is coming through the church that's right II Peter 1 19. it says we have also a more sure word of Prophecy that's right a sure word this is not something we have to guess he said where unto you do you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation that's right right this word private means of one's own self so I'm going to go back I want to go back to what I said earlier when you begin to find someone that's bringing Revelation and they don't have a quote to back it up that is a private interpretation when you find someone preaching something and cannot back it with the messenger of Malachi 4 it is a denominational Spirit on the man [Music] I want to say to you we have we have blasted denominations that say Methodist on them right we have blasted denominations that say Baptist over the door we have bashed the denominations that say Pentecost over the door but I'm going to tell you there is denomination of polygamy and denomination of return Ministry denomination of Joseph Fowler there's many denominations around this message let me tell you how the nomination starts one word brother bam said it was only one word okay let me just stop a minute go back to the scripture in the Book of Genesis it said that the serpent said to Eve did not the Lord say you can eat of every tree of the garden now I want you to watch when the serpent told Eve when he asked her didn't the Lord say this it was verbatim What the Lord said and the way that the devil will trick the church is he starts off with reading Quotes come on Church the devil does not come in and say William random is a false prophet no he knows better than that but he comes in Sly and he says did not he say and Eve says oh yes evangelist he sure did yes he says that is exactly what he said now the serpent and Eve are having a word conversation [Music] and then he says but wait a minute there it is maybe just that one word maybe maybe you surely won't maybe that's what he meant I'm gonna get in trouble with latte but I'm going to tell you I don't care who the man is or how big the message preacher is when a man steps behind the pulpit and says I know brother Branham said this but brother Branham was wrong he should be voted out [Music] come on I say it's time that we as Believers take a stand Joshua Joshua stepped up to the captain of the host and he drawed his sword he said are you for us or are you against us you are either in the message or out of the message [Music] and the prophet of God said this he said to disbelieve one word you might as well disbelieve all of it [Music] we all believers here foreign don't listen to these preachers that come up with these ideas it's the nomination trying to creep back in it brings death the word brings life one word change brings death brother Branham says I want you to see this so bad you cannot slightly doubt any of it not any of it hmm brother cliff you know there's things that he says that sometimes it don't look like it it really adds up don't slightly doubt any of it [Music] well you know brother Branham sometimes says things that it sounds like this and it sounds like that well it don't matter what it sounds like you just believe it man it does not it does not matter what it sounds like it does not matter what it looks like reasoning is where what got even trouble you do not reason with this word God does not need a church to reason the word he wants a church to believe the word thank you brother he said you've got to take it just as it is it needs no interpretation there was a brother in our area I hope it's okay I'm just I feel free tonight okay there was a brother in our area that he he got up and he preached and he said now brother Branham talked about the white dog and the black dog right which one you feed the most that's the one that wins he said and he said that was Paul after his conversion he said but that couldn't be right he said you don't have a black dog after your conversion so he begins to tell his thoughts on this thing you know and I thought my isn't that something Romans 7 was before Paul's conversion so I got to looking and brother Brandon said to y l Moody was reading Romans chapter 7. that's right and I think about Dwight Moody as being a man that maybe in his heart he was right but he was struggling with the flesh nature but brother Branham said when the white Moody read Romans 7 that he ran out into the streets screaming do you know Grace Amazing Grace and I asked the church back home I said how could a man see grace if he wasn't converted yet it worse after Paul's conversion see it may not look right to your mind but just believe it [Music] foreign the Bible says that the word of God is of no private interpretation God don't need any of our schools to interpret his word when he vindicates it it makes it live that's the interpretation of it and I told our church back home I don't see the picture here but we got the picture brother Branham with a pillar of fire over his head and I said you know people could ask why do we have a picture of brother Branham in our church and I said we don't Hallelujah we didn't get the picture of brother Bynum we don't put up pictures of dead men in the church come on thanks [Music] but we live in an hour where everything's political right Joe Biden he wanted he wanted everyone to know that Obama supported him you know if the Republican men that are running profits they want them to know they want everybody to know Donald Trump supports me and so what do they do they get their picture taken with them sure and when a man gets his picture taken with someone in a political rally it says I back this man that's right and so brother Burnham said I was so honored God let me get my picture made with him so God says let you have this picture so that you will know I'm backing the ministry of this man that's right in the political Arena they put their hand on their shoulder and they say I'm backing him and there it looked like a cloud the scripture said the size of a man's hand and over brother Braden said was a hand it was a Halo and he says I back this ministry let me tell you something until another preacher gets that picture over his head I say cursed be the man that preaches anything other Paul said if they preach anything other than what I have preached let them be a curse [Applause] [Music] brother Branham says he said that Reverend best he wanted to debate brother Branham and prove him to be false when he agreed to it Reverend Beth said this he said go down and take six glosses of me while I go down and skin that old man I'm going to skin him and rub salt on his hide and Tack it up on my door for a memorial to Divine Healing this is what Reverend best thought about brother Branham right so brother bass he begins to denounce brother Branham as a Healer and what did the scripture say agree with your adversary quickly so brother Brandon Walks to the pulpit and he says he's right I'm not a Healer he said I'm no more a Healer brother best than you are a savior that's right [Music] but I like this he was told to take six pictures six is the number of a man but the photographer took seven of them and the first six did not develop but only the only the seventh wasn't a Divine Vindication of where the word was standing [Applause] not like this the picture was sent to the FBI and this is what George J Lacey said he said based up only above described examination and study I am of the definite opinion that the negative submitted for examination was not retouched and I want to say to you the word does not need to be retouched that's right man he said nor was it a composite nor a double exposure negative god brother Brandon said God makes science back up the word that's right George Taylor said this further I am of the definite opinion that the light streak appearing above the Halo was caused by the Light not a lot he said it was caused by the Light striking the negative even science said what was in the picture was the light [Music] I found I found this later on there was a news conference and George J Lacey was asked to speak about that picture and he said to my knowledge this is the first time in all the world's history that a supernatural being has been photographed and scientifically Vindicated Mr Lacy added Reverend Branham you will die like all other Mortals but as long as there is a Christian civilization your picture will live on I don't want you to understand when people begin to leave the message they start taking down the pictures of the prophets George J Lacey said that the picture on the wall is representation of a Christian civilization watch this when men begin to turn away from the message they begin to pull the pictures down and it is proof that they are turning away from Christianity [Music] praise the Lord the picture is proof of a Christian civilization let me go to the next verse I stop there he said known this no Prophecy of the scriptures of any Divine interpretation that's right for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and that when you read this in the Greek Lexicon it says it this way no prophecy has ever come that was by human will it was not the will of man it was not the thought of man but this word that we have is the very word the very essence of Jesus Christ himself we have a sure word of Prophecy the word sure means in the Greek it says to walk where it is solid brother Jordan if I got a quote it's solid I'll just share this with you I was talking to a I was preaching at a church and I I ministered about the pastor being the headship of the local assembly and a lady comes to me after church and she said I don't I don't like that and I said well it's a quote sure so I read her the quote and she said that's just one quote I said well let me read you another one so I read another one and she said that's just two quotes I said do you want to know what two quotes from my Prophet is it's one more than he had to say one is enough for me let me tell you something if he said it I believe it it settles the matter [Applause] to walk where it is solid the word sure means firm it means unshakable absolutely dependable or giving guaranteed support it means worthy of confidence because it is based on a solid footing as I prepare to close tonight just want to say that one time the scripture said all the people shall rejoice when they shall see the plummet it's in the hand of the river Bell now brother Branham tells us that cerebral Bell topped Christ but I want you to notice something when you hold a plummet in your hand you can put it on a string or whatever you want you hold it up it stays exactly straight all the way down that's right and so you understand that even though Paul preached he preached along with where that plummet stayed and so we come down to the solid footing and the revelation of Malachi chapter 4. watch what brother Branham always said he said I preach what Paul freaks the plummet was not in the handle of the Branham and the plummet was not in the hand of Paul but Christ himself held the plummet and Paul lined up an irania signed up seven Church eight Messengers lined up so what do we line up to the word of the hour and when we line up we can look all the way back to the book of Acts this is the planet this is the word and it is the proper channel of Revelation would you stand your feet with me praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus thank you [Music] Hallelujah the rest of what it says about sure in the Greek it says it is worthy of confidence because it is on a solid footing therefore it is fully secure and therefore can be trusted to give full support I want you to know if you don't hear another thing I say I want you to hear and let the world know cliff farmer is in full support of the message of Malachi 4. and if you deviate one word from that I am not in support if you deviate one idea or one thought I am no longer in support but if we stay with the message what is God coming for brother Berlin said Christ is coming for his word and if we line up with the word and we feed on the word we become the word and become the rapture Hallelujah [Music] we know that song Can't You See why I'm happy oh can't you see why I'm happy I've accepted [Music] are you happy tonight [Music] wow I'm so happy oh [Music]
