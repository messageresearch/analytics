brother brother Brooks and uh uh brother John Simon from uh Canada was preaching there this weekend he sent his greetings as well and brother Brooks and sister Ruby asked that we send uh their greetings to everyone and to the church so uh we had a go we had a good service there I mean just wonderful wonderful preaching wonderful preaching he's a he's an old man about 80 years old uh a retired preacher and uh one of those men that have successful Yul turned his church over to a young Minister that came under his ministry and I told him I say I compliment you for that because uh I think uh if God can can be able to to bless us and uh in that way where we will have people that will be patient to labor and support the old man while he's you know hanging on and then uh you know so but it was a good service very good service and and it was good to see the see the Believers there I think they should be maybe about 2 3 years or since Co I've not gone there you know to to visit with them so uh it was good to see them praise the Lord and uh so uh that's the greetings from uh from De Mo and then uh uh uh Friday no Thursday Thursday uh I was at working and uh sometime it was just about it were just about 10 10:00 between 10 and 10:30 I I I just fail to call brother Bill Young because I have not talked to him for a while to uh to uh to see how his wife was doing she was uh sick with pancreatic cancer we've been praying for her and I sat down to call him and then I thought about brother Clay farmer he too was not well so I decided to call brother Clay but I didn't get him I left a voicemail and then brother Bill Young went for my mind so uh uh when I went back to the office I thought oh yeah brother darl W also was now well let me check on him so when I called brother darl he's doing well stay coughing and he having a Shar pain in his chest he asked that we continue to pray for him and uh he also sent his greeting to the church and then right in the conversation he told me oh brother one uh uh uh I just got a got a uh someone just called my wife to let me know that sister Shelly has gone to be with the Lord that brother Bill Young's wife so she left her uh when I talked to him it was just 11:00 so I thought calling him between 10:00 and then just 11:00 she passed away and uh uh so they will be having the funeral tomorrow we want to hold them up in prayer and I trust that the Lord will will we really strengthened him it's I I was just I was just thinking I mean I was so I was I was just uh so overwhelmed until I just have to close work and and and come home but I was just thinking about just the past year brother Bill was so sick I remember the last time I was there for the funeral we had to literally told him in the cheer the brother and myself we had to T him up the hill you know to the gravide for him to do his pastoral Duty and then we have to T him down the hill he was sitting in the chair you know I was helping the brother Donnie and we were we we told him I mean he was so sick that every time sister shot would say to me she would say brother Wong I don't know what I would do if they'll go if they pass away she said I would just I would just lose it you know they were they were teenagers when they got married and uh so I was just thinking about that I was say I think the Lord it pleased the Lord to just flip it around knowing that she might not be able to handle it maybe the Lord choose to call her home sooner you know and uh but that was just my thought and uh it could be thousand miles away from the truth but uh uh they were they were very good very very good friends very very good friends I came to know them in a short period of time but uh I was so welcome in their home I mean I go and preach we would sit down at their table 2:00 a.m. in the morning they keep telling me stories you know when they were young when they got married and I mean all sorts of things and uh yeah so I I really miss her I really miss her and uh uh so we would just we just remember remember brother Bill remember brother Bill in uh uh in the church uh there was something else that was on my mind ah we got back this morning almost about 2: a.m. in the morning so if you are not hearing some of the things I'm saying I might be sleeping so you got to you got to shout your amen got to be strong to wake me up I remember I remember one time during the co my friend down in South Africa asked me to preach one of their online service and Ariel was doing the setup for me to the house and we kept waiting we kept waiting I thought it was going to be maybe about 10:00 or 9:00 we kept waiting 12 1 a.m. then the brother called me and we ready brother one I mean my body have already went into sleeping more so I wore my shirt with my coat half dress with my pajamas trousers they were not seeing that one so I S and and I'm preaching and you know I'm I'm I'm speaking on something I can't remember what I was

amen praise the Lord thank you musicians amen amen amen praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning let's just take our Bibles and uh and we will we will read uh um Isaiah chapter 53 let's go to Isaiah chapter 53 praise the Lord praise the Lord amen Amen brother brother VY and myself we laugh about that all the time I say I might be I might have been speaking in tongues brother V but I really can tell tell you what I was saying praise the Lord Isaiah chapter uh 53 uh let's let's just do a kind of a responsive reading and we will all read verse 5 together who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hate as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteem him that let's read together but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chasman of our peace was upon him and with his strives we are healed amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 8 Matthew chapter 8 praise the Lord praise the Lord Matthew chapter 8 let's read from verse 14 and when Jesus was come into Peter's house he saw his wife mother and sake of fever I don't know how the Catholic can read this and think that Peter was the first pope or first priest because yeah he was married he had a wife his mother-in-law was sick and he and he touched her hand and uh and the fever left her Jesus touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and Minister unto unto them when the evening was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirit with his word praise the Lord the preaching of the word is always the casting out of spirit amen he cast out the spirit with his word and heal all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sickness praise the lord we ask God to add blessings to the reading of his word in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen you know I I just I just learned uh recently uh that uh uh the the Jews the they normally will prayed after meal we pray before meal I learned that they normally pray after meal so I was thinking about it I say I say how how how fitting it is that uh you know we pray at the beginning of the word and then we pray at the end of the word so we f faing both Jews and Gentile approach you know we are praying before meal and then after meal and uh uh now so I I want to catch I want to just hold your attention on the thought that I want to go then I go into my you know my my uh uh uh a talk that I want to get in before I come to preaching this morning we just read Isaiah chapter 53 and Isaiah chapter 53 was talking about the atonement amen he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the CH tement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed praise the Lord it was a prophecy talking about the Fulfillment of the atonement everything that the Old Testament sacrifice represented was going to be fulfilled in Christ but this is what I want us to see y said in in in uh uh uh before Jesus died before the atonement before the lamb was crucified before he was hang on the cross the atonement was already in play are we together he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity but he had not been wounded yet on the cross he had not been bruised yet on the cross he had not been Smitten by God on the cross but yet the atonement was in place are you seeing the picture amen so just just hold that in your mind just keep that in mind I'll come back to that again because that's what I want to that's what I want to talk about and I'm continuing my uh my talk from Wednesday night uh where the water cannot be gathered that's what I want to continue uh uh this morning and really trust in the Lord to be able to help me to go in uh in a direction I will be able to edify you like I said Wednesday night if I came across like an angry preacher I was not angry you know I thought about that and and uh you know uh uh I mean my my my my children remind me all the time you know Dad why are you angry I say I'm not angry now but you talking like you angry praise the Lord so I mean I was I was not angry at all not you if I was if I should be angry it must be at the Devil amen I heard a preacher that says I wake up in the morning and I take all my anger on the devil before I goes out so uh uh uh I'm not sorry for what I preach but I sorry if my if my Approach came you know uh um different to you I have no reason to attack you from this poopy uh there is one thing I must be chasing must be uh devils not people amen you are God's Heritage you are the Sheep of his pasture and uh uh so uh uh Wednesday night Wednesday night if we if you want to throw your thought back a little bit Wednesday night we talk about Psalm 119 who all remember there who all went back and and look over s nting you know and uh uh uh did you did you enjoy it if you did it praise the Lord I see I saw uh hands going up there and and that's that's good and uh we were just talking about how beautiful that is the longest chapter in the Bible and uh uh uh the p is in that Bible uh beside two verses every other verse in that 170 something verses in the Bible are all praises and the PSAL it used the Hebrew alphabet he broke it into 22 section of Hebrew alphabet eight verse a peace so so H H more com commentator thinks that uh uh it's a kind of a music thing that he did because a cord on the piano is done uh uh with Eight Keys when you do your D it's it amen oh my goodness my music thing is coming praise the Lord amen I can't wait for it to come I'll turn the preaching over to somebody else amen so uh you know he did it in in eight verses and it's it's very very very beautiful and uh and the the thing about it that is that the inspiration behind that is that uh there are there are many millions of different ways that we can we can lift our hearts To God In Praise millions of different ways that we can be able to you know uh uh uh send our prayers to God I knew about a young brother that uh came from a Catholic Family back in the aage course his parents used to used to give him hard time for coming to church I mean he used to sneak out of the house he would come and spend some few meetings in service some service and of that and then he will go but he he was he he had he just had his very beautiful uh Talent of writing p in every service he would write a word to the Lord you know he was he would give it to the deacons he says I want this to be read to my Lord you know he would just Express his gratitude you know and uh I mean it was just it was just beautiful it was just beautiful it was just beautiful and I and I think that's that's what God is calling us into now so when he did that I I I promise you that I was going to if if the if the technician can just throw my little picture up there I quickly caught one before I came out of the office I thought I had it in my in my in my note but I I didn't have it so I got I quickly screenshot it if you can just uh uh uh uh deem the light here now so you see all of this is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet and what is beautiful here is that uh uh if you if you notice here you will see that uh uh you will see that uh the the the the the uh English we write from left to right okay Hebrew is reading from uh right to left and uh if you look at it actually you realize that all language go back to Jerusalem because uh you will see that uh the Nations that are west of Jerusalem they write from left to right like English Latin Spanish Russian they all ride from left to right and the the the Nations that uh uh east of Jerusalem right from right to left if you actually go back and study uh uh you'll realize that uh uh uh uh you go back in Genesis chapter 5 it talks about all the descendants of Adam it talks about uh uh Enoch and uh you know uh history says uh he's he he's the originator of language okay that's that is just uh you know uh uh a side piece so the the Arabic The the S strip of Egypt and uh uh the Hebrew all of them go from right to left and then English we all go from left to right so they all meet at Jerusalem so uh uh now so like I said uh this this is the first first uh letter in uh in uh Hebrew alphabet and the the sist were so determined you know this brings out that the story of that little boy that we we read on on Wednesday night it brings it out more more clear to us you know and and you you would think about it that brother Brandon mentioned that story and uh uh yeah I don't know whether he he you know uh uh uh he related to this I've never seen it in in the quats before but just to know that God himself had a design like that in his word that's the beautiful part that is the beautiful part you know so I mean it's so it's so beautiful it's so beautiful when by inspiration you know by inspiration you can be able to to find and design a unique way to commute to God praise the Lord amen you can find a you know of uh uh a beautiful way to commute to God uh uh uh you know uh but Braham says the heaven is so full with reality for us to subject ourself you know to to uh uh a substitute and most of what we have in the church is a substitute we see somebody doing it we do it praise the Lord amen we see somebody doing it we do it you know uh uh but God want to bring each and every one of us into uh a unique way where we can be able to we we can be able to talk to the Lord and I mean really communing with God really communion just imagine that a person would write hund and and uh 70 something verses just all praise just all praise praise the Lord amen we we we we did on this before but Revelation chapter 5 let's go there quickly Revelation chapter 5 let's go there quickly I'm coming to what I want to talk about this morning Revelation chapter 5 we all love this and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel proclaiming who with a loud voice who is watered to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man and no man in heaven none in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look look there on sorry I'm trying to reast it and I'm choking myself and I wept because I wept much because no man was for wed to open and to read the book and nether to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep n Behold The Lion of the Trap of Judah the root of David has prevailed Prevail is a very very significant word in that in that verse prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and beheld and Lord in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the ERS to alarm as it has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes uh uh which are the am I getting something wrong here that is bugging okay uh having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirit of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he have taken the book this is this is where I want us to see now the book that no man was wanting to look on to read or to even touch when the lamb came and took the book when the lamb came and took the book pay attention now uh he came and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he have taken the book The Four beasts and the 24 uh uh and the and the 20 and4 ERS fell down before the lamb having every one of them Hops and Golding Vines full of others which are the prayers of the Saints like when we talk about this before the first thing that was revealed after the book of redemption the first thing that was mentioned when the book of redemption was taken is now mistress the first thing that was mentioned was your prayers it just show how prayer how significant prayers are the first thing that was mentioned prayer and worship that was the first thing before the lamb even start loosing the seals and giving it to the effle uh Messenger to bring it a message to us and and tell us the things that were lying on the seals the first thing that was mentioned God made it so important to make us to know how our prayers are so important to him that when the lamb took the book from him that sat upon the throne the first thing that was mentioned when when uh when when when the 24 uh H ERS fell the the the the four Beast uh and and and uh uh uh uh the the the the Bible says Oh Praise the Lord amen they had HS in their hands and Golding vows for of the prayers of the Saints praise the Lord amen that's how that's how how much prayer is important praise the Lord a man may not know how to read one verse in the Bible but a man that can come on speaking terms with God a man that is able to to get down on his knees and he know that he's not uttering vain words but he's having communion with his maker praise the lord we talk about sister jimama and and we all get excited about the story but that story will have never been wrden if she was not a woman of Prayer a woman that can be able to get down on her knees never have H H anything that could be distrib like this word home she had a little place that was decent rating God bless our home that was what was on the world but she knew how to talk to her maker and so much that God will give her a word God would give her a vision and describe a man of God you think about it it was in the time of segregation it was in the time when the nation was dealing with that but it did not matter to God God had a prophet on the land and God had a daughter of God that had that had a need God had a daughter of God that beli in him I am that shiming that woman where is my Elijah praise the Lord where is my Elijah she don't get time for all your message politics she got time for what the Bible says she could identify herself in the scripture and say I am that Lord I am there I look right in your word I'm theing that woman where is my Elijah praise the Lord yes the prophet of God that can see the Vision that can tell people the day they were born what happened in their life he had no idea not one idea of what was going on a a poor woman Faith was controlling him he had no idea that's how much prayer is important people let's not throw down the important things and start running after things that we can't grab this is what we must stand on you stand on Prayer by faith to be able to understand Revelation if now it just become a head knowledge it frustrates you because when you think you understand it then you read something else again it confus you the first thing that God will mention under the seals it's not the name of Elohim it's not the UNR name of God is the communion that he has with his children the love letters that he received from your heart he kept them under the seals praise the Lord praise the Lord you wake up in the morning and you say good morning Jesus good morning Lord to some people it's a never seen way to pray and we we must go through the seven Redemptive name you are Jehovah jarra you are Jehovah yeah he is I mean but if you saying all of those things just to show how how much of Redemptive names you know and it's not really connecting you you're not feeling the personer you're not feeling a personal that I'm talking to somebody then you just reciting words you are just reciting words praise the Lord I turn on my pillow when I spot the daylight I get so tired in my body like it was this morning just going in and out of sleep just I lay right there and I remember many years back the thought trouble me I always used to say to myself Lord what what happened when it ever gets to the place that maybe something happened to me and I you know my knees is bad and I can't get on my knees because I mean uh as a as a young believer I spend many time many many hours on my knees I were influenced by the by the book that I read by Ian bounds power to pray I I would stay six hours on my knes praying but it it was all it always used to bother me because when I lay down on my bed to pray I get so distracted unless I take that position I don't feel comfortable but then I always say to myself Lord this should not be the only way I should pray I should be able to lay down I remember going to seon one time and brother Elijah and myself travel and we were coming back I was so tired so the brother that was taking us back to the Border because we went through the Border uh uh so we we we got to a place that we were going to sleep that ran a hotel and uh uh uh and I was tired so I told Brother Elijah and the brother they wanted to go walk around the time I told him no I'm I'm tired I'm not going anywhere y' can go I will stay right here and for the first time for the first time I will lay down on a pillow and I will have such a communion with God for the first time I will lay down on the pillow and start praying and and feel like I'm praying I'm talking now my mind floating all over the place I've really struggled I'm telling you I'm telling you something it's a it's it's a real thing because in my mind I I thought that no I mean uh kneeling down yeah is you you are being obedience you are worshiping the Lord but I mean uh it should not be the only way to pray the Bible says let men stand lifting up holy hands so standing is also a position to pray praise the Lord whether the person can sit whether they can lay it on the floor whether they can kneel on their knees praise the Lord it is just that place where a son and you know I mean just just like we all do it there is now one position for you to be in for you to be on your phone talking to somebody you can be cooking you have your phone right here okay yeah uhhuh yeah yeah hello hello are you hearing me praise the Lord glory be to God in the same in the same sense you can also be staring theart and say Lord Jesus I thank you I just commit the situation in your hands whatever it is I don't want the devil bothering me Lord I know you are in control but it's just to show show us how much prayer is important to God the Bible says he inhabit the Praises of his people you can know all the Mysteries if you don't have a Praying relationship with God is for nothing it's for nothing and without a Praying relationship with God you just have ha knowledge those things can never be made manifest in your body it mean that God has a goalen vse to put my prayers Malachi he says I have a bottle of remembrance where I put your tears praise the Lord you know what you know what uh uh in our our uh uh Liberian coloa when they tell you say you get dry face when they say you get dry face and that's that's that's how the church is becoming becoming Christian with dry face are we together what am I talking about this morning Psalm 119 put me in all of this praise the Lord amen but I hope I'm saying something that is a blessing to you I'm hope I'm saying something that is a blessing to you praise the Lord because you see uh Jesus let us know this principle that he don't cast uh uh uh uh prayers before swans he don't give precious things Wednesday night we took uh uh uh invisible Union where brother Brandon make us to know that prayer is one of our sacred virtue it's a sacred virtue it's a trust God trust to meet you he trust to commune it's just like having a time and and he coming down to meet Adam and Adam was not there it was a trusted time that he would meet Adam for communion and that's why he made us because the great inent of God was tired of being alone he wanted his attributes that he can commune with and in such a based and loudish age God has sent a word to call you and myself that in the business of all that is happening we can be people that can get down on our knees and say Lord I don't know what's going on father there have been too much aircraft that are crashing I don't know what's going on you mean you can't take something from the news and talk to God lord I don't know what is in the air I mean there's flu virus is going father send Grace Lord send the inkhorn angel to to to to to to Mark the head of your children from all these demons that I keep floting in the earth when you see something that that have break your heart don't just oh wow oh man what is that when you don't know what is it you have a father you can talk to the same way you CA guess what you you you saw this on the news you can also say the same thing to God it's a communion that's that's what it is we we have we have box it in religion we have just made a Rel ious thing of it we come and do our religious Duty you are alpha and omega you you you are the first and the last L Lord there is that that you are the one that go over every bridge and and and and and you are saying all of that just from your mouth your mind is all over the place he want people he can commute with praise the Lord you think about it if we are in such a communion with God wouldn't that make it easy for God to give us messages praise the Lord wouldn't not make it easy for God to give us messages what about dreams what about Vision what about whatever Supernatural way these things are there they are not they are not only they were not only done for it to be written in the Bible and just read in the Bible it's written in the Bible because the same God of the Bible that same God can do it in our lives praise the Lord driving by last night we were playing the music of a brother and brother AEL was telling me the testimony what a tremendous testimony this brother he's s and and and I mean he's he's been personing he's been bewish and he's almost died he say he had one of his heart block out it flew him to South Africa and another brother in another country praying and God put that brother on his mind and say pray for this brother because he's about to die that same God is living that same God is alive amen pray for the brother because he's he's about and the brother prayed he goes back to prayer it comes back on your mind have you ever been in praying you really you want to pray about something but what you want to pray about something else keeps coming to your mind somebody else keeps coming to your mind you are saying this but you are thinking on that person the best thing to do forget about what you want to say pray for the person on your mind when the doctors was about to do surgery and all of that and and and after two or three days this brother praying he just felt that that that that that that uh uh impression on his heart to pray for this brother and and you know uh uh and and he prayed for the brother and the Lord told him that the brother is well call the brother the very day he was going to do the surgery pick up the phone and call and the brother is saying yeah brother I you know I was feeling well I mean I was not feeling well I went to the hospital and uh and uh uh uh uh uh the doctors told me you know I'm I'm doing better brother told him brother few days ago the Lord impressed you on my heart for me to pray for you when he was thinking that he were having heart problem that brother was able to tell him you will be with that's him God is alive the reason why we think he's too far from us asaiah let us know our iniquity the little things we allow in our life we make them so major and God has become so minor in our life he's the last one we think about when we have problem he's the last one we want to consult when we real thing that we are dying that's when we need God when he should be the first one we must Pi talk before even we pick up our phone in the morning I pick up mine first too to look at the time or maybe when the alarm wakes me up that's how much prayer is important communion that's what we made for he expresses attributes in every age to have people to commune with and people will spend hours reading through the Bible they want to understand they go from one verse to another and gather courts and cours and they don't even have enough time to spend on your knees with God that's how much prayer is important just listening to something this morning he ounds a prayer he said this infection disinfecting he says it cast out Spirits from the church praise the Lord come through come through uh Church ages where the people how you know I mean the the as the age detera and comes down they have taken the look just look just look uh uh uh uh uh uh in the scripture that at a gate called Beautiful the Bible says that was the third hour of the day that was the Jewish prayer time which is 300 p.m. that was the Jewish prayer time which is 3 p.m. when it comes to our time uh uh uh comparing it it goes down to the Tabernacle all of the men praise the Lord even in this country I can bring I can give you the history where we now have Wall Streets and it's all about pointing dollars and and how the money is working and all they were talking about there it used to be where businessmen at a new time of the day I saw that thing the first time in Lagos in uh just in the 12 12: noon you know the you around one you know the Muslims are going to their MKS but 12 noon right in the heart of Lagos uh uh uh uh eia that's one of their uh Center business place there you know all of those businessmen they leave their market and they just go in the place they had a little place of their devotion there you know man they had a preacher that would preach and they we prayed you know asking you know committing different things in the hands of God that was something that came out of America history many years back people will shut their store their business places they would close their office it became it became a Revival they would go one hour but now they shut their offices to go and drink beer shut their offices to go and do drugs and then come back to the office and you can't even get no work out of them we use all the work time for smoke break but what am I saying when the lamb took the book the first thing the first thing when he took the book from him that sat on the throne in the message we make a big deal out of it but we need to pay attention we need to pay attention to the details we need to pay attention to the things that that are important preacher by Revelation 5 you know people would take their shoes off of their feet they will hang their foot in the Airy Hallelujah and after we finish doing all of that we can't go back to God and say Lord thank you for revealing your word to me thank you Lord God praise the lord we do the same thing you know I mean uh uh uh bless your heart some some of our uh Saints have to go to work those that work at night they come Sunday morning get home and rest thems all hour comes to work they are tired they want to be in church and some has to leave in the middle of uh service you know well uh I mean since uh I I just keep preaching and preaching they can never stop they have they have to go to work man we can't say uh uh no you have to go to work but think about it this way let me give it to you you're not listening to me you're having a communion with God Amen if you want to leave his present do it a decent way sit there say Lord I have to go to work I'm leaving the service now just bless me it's almost like you in someone's present because it's communion we make this thing like you listening to me I'm not the center person he is the center person he is the one that we all have to deal with you will not just leave his presence like that if it was you and him just sitting down and you have something to do you will say well sorry I'm enjoying this conversation but I have to go that's how we grow in relationship that's how we grow in communion dear father thank you for the service today thank you for your word I have to go to church to work now and I mean that's that's that's that's that's Christian discipline but sometimes we get so mad they preaching long I have to go to work and and you just boiling in yourself after you make the sacrifice to come and then sometime we stor on our sacrifice no we have people that drive a h uh hour 30 minutes and two hours and come and come to church I mean if you can make it to to be in the service and you are there you're following the service online you know that it's the Lord that you have to deal with you want to commun with him you want to be in fellowship with the word treat it like you are in church praise the Lord because what you're trying to do is there in Heavenly places you want to support what is do what what is happening in this building you want to be with us in spirit praise the Lord don't be with us in spirit eating old meals and drinking Coke will will you do that in church treat it like you are in you are you are supporting what is happening in church create that reverence are we together am I preaching like I'm mad okay I think you you have you have dealt with me the whole lot now so praise the Lord so when when when the kids asked me daddy why were you mad I would tell them the people say I was not mad so don't ask me praise the Lord uh that's my babies I love them amen now let's just go to our talks so we can be able to pick up here we back to Isaiah chapter 53 I hope I hope you been you've been able to to appreciate what we were trying to bring to you amen it's it's very very important since I mean it's very very important brother Bram compare prayer to astronauts is prayer when the church become a Praying church that's what take take us off the ground praise the Lord if we just fing about Doctrine or I mean I mean uh uh uh uh he's he's quoting this he's quoting that we just the prophet of God say we in kindergarten he says it's in kindergarten that the children throw papers at one another college students don't do that it's prayer that takes a church off the ground it brings responsibility to the people the people know that they are they are responsible for what they are coming to do here remember wasted water cannot be gathered that's what that t woman told David wasted water Cann now be gathered make sure that every meing you are spending in this place you are now wasting time when you leave your home and come and make sure that every second you are spending in this building you are not wasting your time because that time you can't get it back are we together but let's look at this asaiah said he'll be wounded for our transgression he will be bruised for our iniquity the Chas of our peace will beat upon him and by his tribes will be healed are we together glory be to God and Isaiah the prophet he was he was summing up all the Old Testament sacrifice the totod dos the Sheep the scapegoat the Bulls praise the Lord amen you read you read that it's it's it's it's uh it's uh Hebrew that you will read where Paul will says the Bulls and goat have you read that in Hebrew the bulls and goats Paul Paul will be the one that will bring that to us you know what what it was the bulls and goats the Bulls was the high priest sacrifice amen the gods were the people sacrifice when the high priest is bringing the sacrifice everybody see it that's why when something happened to the preacher it blows up that's how God designed it his sacrifice has to be big he has to put more time to praying more time to studying the word more time to paying attention it's not just h h h the kind of a car he ride the house he drive the suits he change no he must be able to put more time into the service of God that's how God design it so his sacrifice is the bull when he come across the street everybody say he's going to he's going there they know that he's going to confess his Sint praise the Lord you can skip with your owner go behind the behind the building maybe a little one you can put it under your arm and hide yourself but you can't put a bull on your arm you got to walk through the city with it that's the reason why when a man don't live up to the word of God and you bring H uh disgrace to the word of God it's spray out the neighbor who knows it everybody knows about it that's how God designed it are we together what am I talking about so asaiah summing up all the Old Testament sacrifice and he's nailing it right there in Isaiah chapter 53 that this is the Fulfillment of everything that was done in the Old Testament as a sacrifice he was wounded for that was transgression he was bruis for our iniquity the Chas of our Peace So the Fulfillment of this prophecy say was Calvary amen are we together the Fulfillment was Calvary so here said now that even before Jesus went to Calvary people was were benefiting from the atonement amen he was casting out Spirits amen amen he was setting the oppressed free before even the atonement was paid before he died on Calvary people were benefiting how much more that he have already died praise the Lord amen if he can if he can heal a a Peter mother Lord praise the Lord that's what I says I mean uh I mean uh uh uh the the the uh uh the people in Rome will have a hard time to defend this because Peter can never be their first pope he couldn't he would not he would not even uh H H uh be qualified to be a priest in the Roman church because yeah the Bible says his mother-in-law if he had a mother-in-law he had a wife praise the Lord that's what happen when you build a Doctrine without scripture they will always run in conflict with the scripture are we together the scripture is the foundation for all our our doctrinal principle if he cannot rest on the scripture don't hold to it amen because it's not on Rock it's on sinking sand I we together so y said now that so this whole thing I'm bringing to you uh came about in a conversation with uh h h h h a preacher that was trying to challenge brother brandham on Divine Healing and was telling him that that you know uh uh uh uh the whole Divine Healing thing is a HX you know uh uh he's he's reading the people mind and and all of that so he's he's challenging brother Bram on Divine Healing why because he's using Matthew chapter 8 to says that the the the the the Fulfillment of Isaiah 53 was before Calvary so we cannot point to the atonement because yeah Matthew said when Jesus prayed for for Peter's mother-in-law so it will come to pass what Isaiah said and where he was pointing to was Isaiah 53 are we together amen so let's just let's just read this we shared this with you some time ago but let's go back to that again God's provided way he said well Rend brandom I want to ask you something he said if I will prove to you by the Bible that asai your prophesy prophecy has already being fulfilled and done away with he said talk our infirmities and so forth and bruis for our iniquity and I said yes sir he said all right Matthew chapter 8 that was where we read said that when evening was come they brought to him the multitudes and people that he might heal them and he healed them all which was to fulfill W which was to fulfill which asaiah the prophet said himself took our infires so he's trying to prove that that's what fulfill asah prophecy that's what fulfill uh uh uh Isaiah 53 that was before Calvary so why after Calvary are we pointing back to Isaiah 53 are you are you getting the argument amen why after Calvary are we pointing back to Isaiah 53 when in the Scriptures it says that according to Isaiah 53 it was fulfilled praise the Lord amen you see that's why prove that when God when God has done something because he did it he can do it as many time he want to are we together because he did it he can do it as many time he want to amen God is stayed in the saving business praise the Lord if the grace of God has saved you thy Grace can stay safe sinner on the street Hallelujah that's the reason why in as much as it is truth but yet it's a horrible thing for when when we say this message is not for everybody if you think it is good for you you must believe that is good for somebody else if you could be saved God can save people also in as much as it is truth that yeah it's not for everybody but it's not something for us to hold to and throw to people face where this message is not for everybody are we together Let's Travel a little bit here with this amen see when we take things in our life things that we are struggling with instead of bringing it to the throne of God and crying to God to deliver us when we find reason to justify ourself and live wrong remember wasted water cannot be gathered if you waste the grace of God if you waste God's mercy there will be time that you will need it there will be time that you will need it if God has given you Grace and brought you into communion with him that your heart Can Be Touched by the word of God you better cherish it if you start pumping your heart and say God blow me and see if I will feed it because now you are wa you are lifting weight you spraying your chest let the preacher preach and see if I if I will feed it there will come a time where the word of God will mean nothing to you no matter how hard a preacher we preach it will mean nothing to you you will just say there we have heard it I have heard it I have heard it that's how we are in church people just shook their shoulder wasted water cannot be gathered let's let's let's move a little bit here are we together amen thank you I'm not sleeping yet amen I'm not sleeping yet so yeah he's he's trying to prove his point here and uh uh he took our infirmity you see brother Brandon that prove Pro that it was fulfilled right there because the Bible said that it was fulfilled so which mean if God did it he can do it again how small is our God how small is he that when he does something he can't do it again when he do it one time he can do it the question question yet to be asked the question really to be asked is that why is the blessing of the atonement on this side before Calvary that is the real question to ask because Calvary is the Fulfillment of Isaiah 53 you see that is the reason why the Jews have problem with Isaiah 53 for them to accept Isaiah 53 is to accept Calvary praise the Lord amen the believe that the prophet said it they believe that it is the Messiah that will fulfill that but it will still struggle and say no it was not Jesus praise the Lord it was not Jesus let's go ahead here and take this down so we can close up here are we together brother you mean to say uh uh uh that you believe that asai your prophesy he was wounded for our transgression bruis for our iniquity so far and with his Tri we are healed the healing taking place there th fulfill it he says that's what the Bible said I said then the atonement had more power before it was made you see because this is the side of Calvary that we are talking about so the atonement has more power even before the word was fulfilled praise the Lord you remember that story about The Bible school boy that says uh you know in the bible school we read that Marx 16 is not inspired his own mother shall glory be to God if God can heal me with an uninspired verse what will he do with the inspired one amen if the atonement can have more effect on this side what would it do when he have already been fulfilled and we believe it are we together glory be to God said then the atonement have more power before it was made then after it was made after it came in effect because that was a year or six months before Jesus died are we together the atonement having even been made so how could it be that that is the real question that he was supposed to ask that is the real question because if when the Bible say he was wounded who was wounded Jesus had not been wounded yet but yet they're enjoying the benefit blam Baus enjoy it the woman with the blood issue enjoy it amen the Widow at now her son was raised back to life Lazar came back from the dead all of this happened before the atonement are we together you love the Lord amen are you enjoying the word hallelujah that's why we must do we must enjoy the word there two men had had not even been made yet so how could it be well I said I want to ask you something brother he he got in using big words and I said now don't go to speaking in unknown tongues for me because I can't understand it you just speak plain English amen just like uh uh uh just like youed here in the King James uh Bible I we together glory be to God will you admit that that that Divine Healing is in the word is in the word I just want to say see be no yes in the word but the atonement is over the word praise the Lord amen the atonement is over the word what what does that mean how does it how does it come to us the atonement is what over the word amen are we ready now so you will see here that uh the Bible led us to know that the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the word are we together amen so even before God created A World Before men were called in sin before people will get sick God has already made a provision amen so you see the power of the atonement he have already made provision that's the reason why no matter what the devil tried to hang over our life it can never take hold you must never allow it to take hold water is a habit you are struggling with whatever it is praise the Lord tell the devil it can never take hold because before I was born there was a sacrifice in the mind of God so they are two men having more power are we together now let's go ahead here Mark 16 is not inspired okay whatsoever thing you desire you pray uh believe you receive it see whatever see yes it's the word but uh but uh it's not in the atonement glory be to God Amen let's drop down a little bit brother B will says here I gave him a little Parable now brother random now is going to behave like the woman of teoa that we read about you remember the woman gave David a parable amen he's now going to give this intellectual preacher a parable I said brother one time there was a king and he had a great Kingdom and and in this he he made a Ru and the atonement and so forth required death and so he called the slave up and it was and and it was deaf praise the Lord so there wasn't nothing for the slave to do but die so he said what can I do before I kill you now this slave man uh did something that was wrong praise the Lord and the Lord of of the king require death when you do this you have to die praise the Lord amen now the king called the man and says you're going to die tell me your last Wich what what you really wanted to do before you die if you want to take a trip around if you even say I want to ride in the king char will give it to you praise the Lord are we together I feeling I feel like preaching now all the sleep has gone away amen and the slave said get me a glass of water what glass of water is your last wish people want to go to to to uh uh Disney Land and your owner wish is just a glass of water praise the Lord amen but this this looks like this was a predestinated slave they this was a slave that knows the power of the atonement this was a slave that know the power of a promise praise the Lord he was not carried about with all the flashy things around and I me you want to ride the king's Chariot I mean what what what a privilege to sit in the president lemon in but that was not what was on his mind he said give me a glass of water praise the lord gave me a glass of water and so they brought him a glass of water and a pour fellow knew he was going to die so he was shaking so hard he couldn't hold the glass in his hand and he said now wait a minute for I take my life amen the king says before I take your life you drink the water before I take your life and I'm and I'm not going to take your life until you drink the glass of water and the slave threw the water on the ground praise the Lord I'm not going to kill you until you drink the water praise the Lord he could have gone Drive in lemon Zine when he finish doing oh wow oh wow and you do heyha praise amen he could have gone through ho all over the place he took the glass of water he Wast on the ground praise the Lord the word was you drink the water after the water you be killed that water you requested oh I I I think they brought him a fancy Trail a goaling all of those things did not matter to him he was looking at the power of a promise the power that is in the king's word the power when the king promised when the Kings speak the prom the power that is laying in the pages of this F he took the water he pulled it to the ground amen I said now what is he going to do i h h h if if he's the man of Honor he has to keep his word no matter the law says he got to keep his word so you see you see the parable the parable that that that was happening here what what what what brother Brandon was trying to bring him to understand is that even though the H H he Jesus was Healing The Sick but God had to keep his word to go to Calvary amen because he was Healing The Sick it never stopped him from paying the ultimate price because that's what his word said are we together amen and then when he paid the ultimate price he was the water on the ground and he said what it is finished what is done is done there is nothing that the devil can bring against you because wasted water cannot be gathered that's the reason why the devil accusation against you can that hold because Jesus said it is finished praise the Lord there is nothing that he can bring against you that can ever hold the reason why it can hold is because you believe him and you don't believe the word you don't believe the promise you don't believe what Christ have done for you you believe what the devil is pling your life with he spilled his blood on the ground that was the Wast of water and when he did it he said it is finished what would the king do the king said if you drink the water then you'll be killed for the man to drink that water the king must leave his throne gather on the ground and gather the wasted water but wasted water cannot be gathered oh glory be to God oh sweet Jesus oh sweet Jesus if we were just want realize praise the Lord even though the devil is trying to slip this book out of our hands amen and say we got a Bible on our phone that's okay but how much importance are we putting to the promises that is in this book to realize that everything that concern our life and everything our life is involved in there is something God has written in the pages of this book that can answer our question that can heal our sickness we are feeling on what the society is giving us we are feeling on what the age is giving us we are feeling on the devil's lies instead of believing God's word he wasted the water and he's standing there looking at the king the king looking at him praise the Lord the rope that is supposed to hang in is hanging up there the guys that supposed to hang in they all standing up they're looking at him praise the Lord and he's standing there he's looking at the king praise the Lord you see how you make the devil powerless amen when you realize that Calvary has taken all his teeth from his mouth he can only bite but he can bite you make him powerless when you are able to to open the word and say you devil is written right here in the pages of this Bible that by his tribe I'm Healed I don't care how you afflect my body but that's what the word says and I believe it you know brother Brandon says there are people that the devil will not know what to do to them and there are PE those people are the people that knows the value of what is written in this book praise the Lord he will slap you on every side praise the Lord the next morning he see you you bounce back your hands up in the air he don't even know what to do to you because you know the value of this book wasted water cannot be gathered what God has done is done if he said by his tribe you are healed he not coming back to to do anything he have already done it it's already done it is for you to cash it in is for you to believe it until it become real to you praise the Lord if he has saved you you are save praise the Lord all the devil can do is Rob your mind abuse your mind and have you to live on privilege but yet you'll be safe amen amen at the end of the day other people will be testifying about the joy of the Lord how the Lord and you you will just be there why because he abused your mind so much that you can't even believe you get there and you are surprised that you are even safe praise the Lord you are surprised that you are oh I'm safe that's thought I was lost because one day I'm Justified yesterday I'm not justifi and Sanctified and I I didn't even know if I have the Holy Ghost praise the lord it's a finished work it's a finished work but many are not enjoying the joy of their salvation because they have put so much theologic in their mind that is abusing them praise the Lord what is done is done praise the Lord what is done is done he's not coming back to save you he's only coming back to take you home praise the Lord he's not coming back to heal you because he have already done it butam say if Jesus was here this morning wearing my suit he will tell you Isaiah 53 have you read Isaiah 53 that's the question he will ask you because I was wounded for your transgression I was bruised for your iniquity praise the Lord amen you see that's that is the power in Catching in the word instead of running around and looking for some kind of a Superman to lay his hands upon us there are people that are gifted no doubt they are gifted because God gave them their portion praise the Lord but Divine Healing is something to every child of God praise the Lord and let me tell you let me give you some a secret let me give you a secret Jesus said Jesus said for such is the kingdom of God you was talking about little children and the prophet of God will come tell us that little children have so much Faith why because they are innocent if you make them to believe that they can pray for you the Bible uh David said out of the mouth of babes will come Praises amen praise the Lord hallelujah when you are Shake call your little child to pray for you say honey come pray for me amen all the thing that your mind goes through oh I I committed if God forgive me and you know I a get Faith yet a little child don't think about that Jesus bless my mama so mama I can feel well amen that's very powerful that's very powerful that's that's that's inocent and precious words Hallelujah you know the church teach us they says 12 years old is the age of accountability so the child must be 12 years old you wait to abuse the mind of the child expose the child to the place where the devil will start making them to sense the changes in their body in order of that you weaken their faith when a child is Young and and and that little desire is in their heart to be baptized pray for them and baptize them their innocent Faith Can can believe God more than your intellectual Faith because many of the things that we parents have is just intellectual Faith you are looking at the child little mistakes innocent mistakes praise the Lord and you think that oh they're not orderer yet to be baptized I'm not I mean those things are left up to parents I'm not are you amen I'm just preaching but you see all of these little ones that you drag to church you might think they are just little ones they are there and and they don't hear nothing they are just in the church you know uh uh maybe they're just making you to go out and come back and be grateful for them praise the Lord because because of those little children many times they are they are Gathering angel is protecting them and because you are close you are also protected glory be to God hallelujah that's our responsibility to teach them for them to come to that place of the fear of God glory be to God amen Peter says if they have a good conscience towards God that's what they need to be baptized is to have a good conscience towards God that's why the Bible says so you teach them to have a good conscience towards God are we together you love the Lord amen but you see Wast of water cannot be gathered that's why the tech woman said to David what has happened has has already happened don't hold the kingdom down David don't hold the kingdom down asalon is dead the people are waiting for you to get back on the throne there are things to happen we must not allow things that you know the the the devil used in the past and 10 years and all that don't let it to hold you down forgetting those things in the past Paul says let's press onto the mark of the High Calling praise the Lord hallelujah you see because the thing about it there is there the devil cannot use nothing in the future to bother you because he don't know your future amen he can't use nothing in the future if he ever want to bother you about the future he goes back in your past and say because this thing happened to you that time so if you go to that place it will happen again he's using your past he don't know your future he don't know nothing about what will happen to you when you step out of that door but he can only make you afraid when he can tap into your past and have you to start reasoning and as soon as you fall on on it then you are afraid to step into your future because you are captivated by the past you are impraise him by the past you are trying to gather waste of water that cannot be gathered man it's a good thing to come to a church that is prayed up I feel like you all been praying this weekend amen I feel so much faith in the in the in the building that I can't even feed the tiredness of my body praise the Lord amen or maybe I might have Dr drank too much caffeine this morning glory be to God Amen but I know it just it was just a a half cup of coffee I have the half there on on my table there praise the Lord just just to make sure that I'm not sleeping until I get to church amen because I I tell you many of the times I come I'm so tired this is my bed I lay right down here amen I said Lord I lay myself down to sleep glory be to God Amen I laid there praying and before I realize I get up and I'm asking myself where am I amen you love the Lord but you see wasted water cannot be gathered the man has wasted the water there's nothing the king could do amen all he could do was to sign his pardon that's all he could do praise the Lord amen and you know if I was the king I would promote that man to come and sit on my right hand you know why I would do it because I have found a man that believe in my word I have found a man that have so much faith in what I have said praise the Lord you love the Lord are you glad that what is done is already done amen the devil can't hold nothing nothing he can hold against you he's just a bluff he's just a bluff all he have to do is just keep reminding you keep reminding you keep reminding you until you believe it but he does not have no power he does not have no legal right he's not basing on anything all he's trying to do is to just kill you praise the Lord oh yeah you have done this so you going to hell just continue to do it that's all he can tell you why because he want to he want to play Down the atonement that you don't have no more faith to go to God and say God I'm sorry cleanse my life and that's what make people they get stuck in sin well because I've been praying I've been praying and this thing can't go away it's because you're not believing in the promise that much you have to believe it until it gets so real to you you love the Lord let the musicians come let's sing that song It's Already Done amen it's already done the Battle Is Over the price has been paid the blood has been shared praise the Lord Hallelujah you see you see people H they do those things and and and they go and play on God and you know they played on God they they get away from church and and I mean if God has saved you there is nothing evil you can do for him to make you lost you know what is going to happen you're just going to lay bunch of your years in regret because you will go around and go around and you will come back to that place again and God will keep dealing with your heart he keeps dealing with your heart and then you will just sit there you
