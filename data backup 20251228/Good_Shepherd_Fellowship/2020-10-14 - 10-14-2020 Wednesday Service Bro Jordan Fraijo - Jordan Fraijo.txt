and by faith we're already in that number it's not wanting to be in the number or looking to be in the number or hoping we'll be in the number but even now we can start looking around and we start counting and know that we're a part of that number as we speak it's not something we hope for it's something we identify with amen we're going to go ahead and go right into the service here the ministering of the word musicians go ahead and be seated let's just stand for the reading of the word and we'll get right into it if you'll turn with me to revelations chapter three let's have a little thought tonight revelations chapter 3 verse 20. and it reads behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's pray heavenly father lord we just come before you once again here on a wednesday night just thanking you for this opportunity lord to be gathered together with saints of like faith father lord for we know if nothing else that where two or three are gathered together in your name you said there i'd be also so just by gathering father lord we can come with a confidence knowing that you were here already because you came ahead of time anticipating knowing we would be here father so lord we just surrender ourselves into to your presence father both the speaker the hearer father may you take control of the body the mouth the lips the thoughts father lord may you catch the attention of the listener father lord that not to anything that would be said by man but father something that you would speak directly to the heart lord we just thank you for that in jesus name amen you may be seated i'm just going to take a minute and relax myself just a little bit tonight i just want to take a simple well i just want to take a thought and i hope it's simple and i just want to talk about recognizing the voice of god and acting on it and what i first began to think about was listening versus hearing now here in revelations we see two points here that both reference hearing but it's not just in hearing but you actually have to be listening to understand and the reason why we know that's important is because there in verse 22 he said he that hath an ear which would be everybody there isn't a person that has yet to be born without an ear maybe they genetically could be born with only one ear but as far as i know everyone has a ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now this is very specific it's talking about hearing what the spirit is saying and it's not just the words but it's to catch the revelation or the understanding of what's being said for the age and for that time now if you know what's going on here in chapter three there at the end is actually speaking to the church of laodicea and it was during this time here you can see where jesus is specifically talking to the church of laodicea because he comes here and it's only in this church of laodicea where he comes and he says behold i stand at the door and knock so he's knocking there's a sound already that anybody should be able to hear but now there has to be an action related to that sound that that is heard in order for it to have any type of effect on the on the life it says and if any man hear my voice so you hear the knock it catches your attention and then you hear his voice and when you hear his voice then you have to open the door if you get that for far he says i will come in and will sup with him and he with me now you have communion you see but it's it's not just something so you'd think that something is so simple but we want to take a look at a couple of things tonight differences between listening and hearing we want to take a look at hearing god's voice all those saints throughout the ages who have heard god's voice some who have heeded and some who have not and what that entails and why is it those that heeded why did they heed and those who did not why did they not because we want to take a look at that and see the patterns throughout scripture because we know that there's patterns throughout scripture from the very beginning and we know that the voice of god has been in play to the believer speaking to the believer from the first verse it says there in genesis in the first verse it says god he spoke and that is what began to bring the light to pass it wasn't until god's voice actually spoke that anything began to change but it took they that heard it to understand the meaning for it to take an effect you see creation has no problem with the voice of god when when the voice when god speaks and creation hears it it acts it doesn't matter what it is only man has ever thought he had a better idea than what god was telling him to do when god spoke in the beginning and he said let there be light immediately there was light light didn't argue about how it should happen when it should happen it just light was there and begin to speak to creation and create it and bring it to pass and tell it how to function and what it should do and how it should go about in in the this creation that he had created what its role was no problems it wasn't until he got to men and he gave them specific instructions and man said you know what i think i know a little bit better you know because they heard but they weren't listening they weren't paying attention it's like kids right we you parents that's the common thing you say i told you and they say i heard i'm listening and then they go and do the opposite and you said i thought you said you were you you heard me well they did they heard you but they weren't paying no attention well guess what you know god lets you experience that because we've probably done that to him a few times so he's trying to teach us something you see if you just listen the first time i know what's best i'm giving you the my first plan that i told you in the beginning from the start that was the best one now due to lack of listening lack of understanding you're in the mess you are okay so let's take a quick look we want to take a look and see where with god speaking examples of god's voice in scripture um real quick turn with me to job 37. i would just use the overhead but i let the dog chew on my glasses and everything back there for me is a little bit blurry so i'm going to go the old-fashioned way and just turn through the pages of scripture so in job 37 1-5 and we're wanting to know learn more about this voice of god it says at this also my heart trembleth and has moved out of his place hear attentively the noise of his voice so it's calling you to attention and the sound that goeth out of his mouth he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earth after it a voice roarth now you notice he talks about lightning going out but that had nothing to do with the voice there was a sign going forth but the voice came after okay and what we're doing is we're looking for patterns in scripture we want to see how do when god speaks how does it happen because we want to be aware so that when we will notice and see when it happens and we'll start catching the signs being like aha i see it if god is still the same yesterday today and forever which we know he is and if we believe that's true then if we see the signs coming then we can know he's about to speak now pay attention okay but if you don't know the signs you don't know and then you'll see through scripture people who didn't recognize the sign that he was about to speak they heard the sound they heard but they couldn't listen they couldn't understand no understanding after a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellence and he will not stay them when his voice is heard god thundereth marvelously with his voice great things doth he which we cannot comprehend so we see here we realize that lightnings and thunderings are associated with the voice but don't forget they're not the voice you see that's that's the thing that most men have done throughout the ages is they've confused the signs with the voice and they've run off after the signs and then the voice le it just left the voice behind and then they they find themselves crashed on the side of the road and they wonder what happened i was following it and no you were following the sign that was to lead you to the voice but if you simply run to the sign you'll never get to the location that's pointing you to you see you come driving into town and you see the big sign says minneapolis if you run over to the sign you're at the sign that tells you you're going to minneapolis but you're not there yet as long as you stay around that sign you'll never get there okay so we have some characteristics of the voice of god okay now we want to see parallels through scripture we want to be able to track it because bibraham told us he said if you can't see it throughout scripture from genesis to revelation whatever it is that you're thinking whatever kind of theory you got in your mind whatever kind of thought you thought was an inspiration if you can't take that inspiration and be able to track it through through from genesis to revelation he said go over and start over your revelation your thought is wrong so many times we do like like science likes to do and we take and we try to force something to work because we through our theory believe it should be right but you'll find out just like science they eventually either have to either they have to give up or they start they have to sell it as a lie and they have to start back over at zero they call it the scientific method but you'll realize that they they stole the scientific method out of the scripture because what they say is they say i think it should be this and then they go through all the steps and say is it this and if it doesn't then they have to call that thought debunked and throw it away and start all over again and so it is with our thoughts our abilities what our understanding if you take it and you begin to go through the scripture and you can't see a parallel with that thought then it's no good toss it out start over because the truth is here but the problem is is if we try and make our thoughts and our narrative fit the scripture instead of i'm sorry i said that backward if we try and make the scripture fit our thoughts and narrative then you're always going to have a distorted vision you're always going to have a distorted revelation and you know whose revelation it is it's yours but not from god it's from you your own thoughts your own ability and now you've gone back to where they failed at the garden of eden you're in that same standing that same point because the standing wasn't an action of sin because brother random told us he said sin has nothing to do with the actions that we call sin sin has to do with the unbelief that then allows for the actions to happen because before that unbelief the action would never manifest you see but as soon as we take our own thought our own word and we don't compare it to god's word to see if it's a match then we're going to find ourselves in that same place in a state of unbelief well believing that we're believing and fooling ourselves okay so because we want to see this throughout scripture then let's turn to saint john 12 28 and 32. okay now here jesus is speaking to the people and he's giving them a parable of his death and resurrection and then in 28 he says father glorify thy name then there came a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people thereof that stood by and heard it said it thundered others said an angel spake to him jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sake now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me now there's some key things to take away from this first of all it was a difference of understanding and revelation that changed what the people heard everybody there heard something everybody in the group just like right now everyone in this room who hears the sound of my voice everyone is hearing something right now if you were somewhere and the speaker was speaking in a language unknown to you would you still be hearing him yes would you have any understanding of what was being said no so therefore hearing is based on your level of and the hearing but the understanding is based on your ability to understand the speaker and not just your ability to hear because here everybody heard the whole group and some said it thundered they heard to them it was thunder you would never be able to convince them otherwise middle of the day it was a phenomena they heard a thunder kind of strange kind of weird they can speculate on it maybe it had something to do with jesus maybe it didn't maybe it was just something else maybe they were mining somewhere close by but but they heard thunder they really heard thunder and it's still the same today you know many people within the message they still go back and forth seven seals seven thunders seven seals are they opened are they closed is it a mystery is it not a mystery well i tell you this to those who tell you it's still a mystery it is it's a mystery to them you know why because all they've heard is the thunder all they're hearing is the thunder they have not heard the voice because if you heard the voice then you would have understanding and it's no longer a mystery you know jesus would do this all the time with his disciples he would go out before the people and he'd speak in parables it wasn't even a different language because we know that because in scripture it says that the common man heard him gladly so the hearing and the language was fine but now the understanding was even greater there needed to be a greater understanding even beyond that because he had pulled his disciples away and explained to them the parable and he said i talk to them in parables because it's not for them to know but it's for you it's for you you know but even with that some of the disciples were still confused they still didn't know what he was talking about they still did couldn't put all the scriptures together and see prophecy being fulfilled we know that because it when it came to gethsemane there peter attacked with a sword and everybody else fled if they had a real revelation of what was going on there had been no reason for fear they would have just seen prophecy being fulfilled prophecy being fulfilled okay now something else to pay attention to 31 now is the judgment of this world okay now shall the prince of the world be cast out so the word has gone forth god has spoken some heard thunder some actually heard the word spoken but once the utterance has gone forth all those under the sound of the utterance fall under judgment you see once it's been spoken whether you have the ability to understand or not you're under the same judgment you see now now is the judgment of this world and now shall the prince of the world be cast out because once god speaks it sets things in motion and it cannot come back okay so now we can see we see job and we know jobs although job is in the middle we know job to be the oldest book in the bible so here he is he's it is a historian speak i believe that job is even from a time that predates abraham so here we can see something that predates abraham in the book of genesis okay and here's god's way his voice and how it's identified and we can see where and what people identify with and when the voice comes and now we come all the way into the new testament and we can see the same one more example okay that way we can be sure what should we be watching for uh first kings 19 11-13 make sure i have this correct okay yes so here elijah has just had a tremendous victory against the prophets of baal and after this great victory he did like most great men under great inspiration do is he went into a big slump he had he was he was under the inspiration and power of god and well under that inspiration nothing could stand in his way he he would face anybody face him off and and tell him what for but the minute the spirit left him the guy just crumpled and and brother branham says under the threat of a woman he went running off into the wilderness here was a man who had stood there on mount carmel and called and seen fire from heaven come down and not consume just the offering but the stones of the offering in the water and then he had slain he had slain the 400 prophets of baal and yet now after that inspiration drops off he is just the man and under the threat of a single woman he just he just killed and slew 400 men under the threat of one woman he goes running off into the wilderness and says lord what uses it uh is it that i'm even alive take me take me now and and we know the story of how the angel comes to him under the juniper tree there and and and brings him sustenance and then without his knowledge and you know he just sweeps him off and takes him to this place in the wilderness away from you know he sought refuge in the wilderness but god took him to the place under the rock because he knew he would need a greater revelation going forward from here than what he had under that tree okay and we get here into verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and before and the lord passed by ah let's actually start in verse nine and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said what dost thou hear elijah so god comes to him and said elijah what are you doing hiding here in the wilderness what what's what's going on and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altar and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what dost thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant and thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when they'll come us anoint hazel to be king over syria and that's going a little bit further and here the lord begins to give and give him instruction as to how to proceed how to move forward but you see the servant of the lord even in this state that he was in could recognize what was and what wasn't the voice of god you see and the reason why we know is because the minute that still small voice see he'd been in the presence of the angel he'd been in the presence of the angel and he'd heard his message that was previously and it was the angel who told him to go out to the cave he'd been in his presence he didn't cover his face now he goes and he stands there at the mount and said the lord passed by and when the lord passed by there was a great stir a great wind and it caused a great commotion but that still wasn't god speaking to elijah then there was an earthquake and still wasn't god speaking to elijah and then there was a fire and it still wasn't god speaking to elijah and elijah stood there he was unmoved the wind didn't affect him no no effect the earthquake no effect he was told to stand on the mountain and those distractions were not going to shake him from standing where he was told to stand it doesn't matter what it was but the minute the minute god began to speak you see how he was in humility he covers his face and the lord begins to speak to him and instruct him you see but these were all signs leading up to what was to come you know it kind of reminds me of another place in scripture it reminds me of there in the book of revelations of the end times of earthquakes and floods and and tumultuous times and and wars and famines get god's voice it's not in any of those things you know you see people affected by them running to and fro in fear every day something new is happening and and the nominal church world is is looking to these signs and and looking for meaning in them the god's voice isn't in the signs god is already speaking god has already spoke and many just heard thunder many just saw signs and miracles many have just seen lightning and many have just seen healings many have just seen the dead raised and they run after these things they run after it this way they run after it that way some great man some great miracle and they run after it and then it peters out and dies and they say there was nothing to it there was nothing to the voice of god and the problem is they never heard the voice of god they never heard it because they didn't wait for everything to settle down in the midst of the storm in the midst of the earthquake in the midst of the wind hear god speaking to them you see because if they had just like elijah they would have been they would have began to see what god was doing and what god was planning okay now we're talking about listening and hearing and differences i want to just read you a few things here i don't want to keep you too late either faith has informed me previously that i have the ability to share more than is necessary so you know if it starts getting late then somebody from back just wave at me but there's a study you know listening being able to listen and listen well and understand what it's being said is something that people have studied and re-studied and and taught and tried to re-teach and find new ways to come at it and look at so what i want to do is just take a look at what man has probed at because man probes at what god already knows and starts to identify things that god will already tell you but through some of it sometimes we can pull out the little nuggets and see how they reflect even into scripture and see how they reflect in the natural and the spiritual so i was reading i've actually read quite a bit about listening i think uh every time you turn around when you're in in college they're trying to teach you something new about communication but yet seems like nobody still knows how to communicate so i'm not sure it takes because i think nobody is listening and that's the problem so there's something called i don't want to read this whole thing to you and i just want to pull out the highlights and i thought i highlighted them but okay ah there's something called confirmation bias and what confirmation bias is is when we listen but we listen to affirm what we already think we know confirmation bias okay and they say the problem is with lag time in the brain they say the fastest somebody can speak is about 100 somewhere between 100 and 200 words a minute said that the brain actually has the ability to process between 600 and 1000 words a minute when it's functioning correctly so what happens is that the brain is only being fed a minimal amount of information and you have all these thoughts and ideas yourself and the brain goes on a trip and now the brain is doing everything it can to figure out what's being said and whether or not it agrees with it and then he begins to pick it apart as best possible and what it does is it picks out facts or aspects of the conversation that you support already and then it hones in on that so what basically what it does is it takes what's being spoken and creates a tunnel vision on whatever is being told you and now all you're capturing is what you already know so this point in the listening process you have stopped learning and you've actually even stopped listening to what's being said because you have already decided what's being said and once you know what someone is saying there's no need to listen anymore if you know what's being said or what's going to be said what's the point it's like how many of you have ever been in a lecture or in a class and they have bullet points and an ongoing powerpoint and you begin to realize that the teacher is reading verbatim from the powerpoint and you have access to the powerpoint about how long after you realize that does your attention span shut off for me about like 30 seconds because then i take i take all of the power points and i'm like if this is all the teacher is going to give me i'll just read the powerpoints myself i don't need somebody to read to me i want someone to teach me so i have a better understanding of the material i'm reading not just read to me material i already have because many times and this is true of scripture as well because that's what happened when philip was there on the road to was transported there on the road with the ethiopian eunuch the eunuch had no problem reading the scripture but he philip came up to him said do you know what it is that you're reading he said i'm reading it but i have no understanding does the prophet speak of himself of someone else and here is what a great teacher will do if philip jumped in he didn't say well give me your bible i'm going to read it to you as many times as it takes until you understand it but no he took and began to break down the scripture in a way that the unit could understand and catch a revelation of it and then on that revelation he could now act because it's not just about hearing it's about listening and understanding and then true understanding and a belief will bring about an action okay so confirmation bias it's when we already think we know what's happening what's being said and we've decided whether or not what's being said is true okay and then it says we're distracted by our own thoughts and opinions and our tendency to pick out facts or aspects of the conversation that support our pre-existing beliefs values or perception in other words we only listen for what we want to hear you know we've come a long way in this message and unfortunately the biggest scarecrows in the message are the false doctrines that are so close and we've been so burned by that we do exactly this i know i come from one of them organizations i've been there and that's exactly what happens we've been places where doctrine no things were taught incorrectly we've been places where things were fed to us as the truth right and now what we do is this exact thing is we sit in a service and we listen for key words that trigger our past experience and when we hear that keyword it sets off all the alarm bells and when it does we lock up that's it no need to listen to a minute more of this service i know exactly where this is going i've had enough i'm checked out done and now we're in a place where god can no longer speak to us definitely not with that minister or definitely not that service because we've already due to past experience decided no good done now don't take me wrong we are to be in the word you are to know your scripture you are to be in the message to a point where if something was actually wrong you would catch it you see but brother told us many times and he did this to for the denomination because he wanted the denominational believers to continue listening when he said things but it's still a truth he said now if you're eating cherry pie and you run into a pit the seed of the cherry and you bite down and it's hard well he said spit out the pit but keep on eating pie you see because you may run into something that hangs you up and maybe it's wrong maybe it's not maybe it's just that key word that that false teacher that false prophet used incorrectly you see because it's not a false word you see if if we can find it in the message or in scripture it's not wrong but the understanding that we were taught it by was incorrect it was a false anointing on the true word so that word is still true so it behooves us to go well if i learned it incorrectly then god either teach me or bring someone to teach me what is the truth behind that word you see because we need the entire word in order to get out of here it's an entire revelation it's not it's not bits and pieces but it's that that was spoken for a reason and if it was spoken for a reason then it behooves us to understand it it behooves us to ask god for revelation of that word and not let us scare it let the devil scare us off by the use of a word that some men used incorrectly you see so i i just thought that was so good um now they said when you're listening the best way to catch what's being said is you have to come in with an understanding and assume that what's being said is true because if your first step an assumption is that what is being said is false you'll discount and discredit everything that's being said why would we bother to continue listening to something that is false okay now what happens the minute you begin to think that something is false you you drop into what something they call competitive listening where you have a negative reaction to what's being said and want that set into place once that begins rolling it'll stay that way for the entire rest of the time that that person is speaking so what you've entered into now is everything that's being said you're trying to find the error in it you're trying to find where is it wrong how is it wrong but now you're also you're doing is you're going back to your past tendencies your past experience to find what's wrong with what you're well you're listening to but if the thing that scared you off that false use of a term the false use of a word the false representation is still possibly a part of your current revelation then how do you know whether or not that's true without giving god a chance to reveal it to you you see so many times we we run our first you know it's fight or flight fight or flight is the reaction and people think of that as just a physical reaction but it's also an emotional reaction and it's also something that happens in services on a daily basis is people either choose as what's being spoken comes forth to fight it or to run from it and that's been something throughout scripture you'll find that when god spoke to his children you'll find that's usually what they did first i mean look at moses his first thing was he tried fighting he killed an egyptian which was not what god wanted him to do and then his next thing was to run out into the wilderness for 40 years and try and hide from it one he picked one or the other and then he tried both i mean look at jonah he did the same thing god came and spoke to him here's first thing flight run i don't want to deal with this i'm running but as you begin to see throughout scripture begin to think about it think of all sons and daughters of god who god has come and spoke to and this should give you some reassurance the fact that they most of them tried to either fight it or run from it and in the end it still ended up working out for god's will and god's perfect plan you see that gives us comfort because we can know if god was trying to speak to you and you missed it the first three or four times don't worry because god knew you were going to do that and it's still going to work out for his good just try to pay a little bit better attention the fifth or sixth time okay so now where where you have to listen and believe something is true you see here enters in faith in order to believe something is true you have to have a faith that believes that that is a truth being spoken so faith enters into the equation now other things that get in the way sometimes they're physical things or sometimes other things surrounding us to being able to listen simple things like there could be a distraction in the back right now some child could all of a sudden go into a fit or throw a tantrum knock over a chair and all of a sudden all of our focus to the back and you got to be careful because the devil uses those types of things to try and break an atmosphere you see because we know that brother branham made a statement and this is not verbatim but he said if something happens in a service to disrupt the atmosphere more than two or three times he said the presence of the lord the holy spirit will leave the building and may not come back that entire service okay but and i know many of us we we get really you know nitty-gritty into that with church order with you know the slightest thing and someone doesn't seem like they're paying attention or that person is sleeping or the baby is crying in the corner let's get all these people out because we don't want we don't want any distraction or disturb the spirit but really has more to do with those around giving attention to it because brother random said we have the ability to create atmospheres so when those distractions are happening you right next to the distraction and further out have the ability to create an atmosphere that whether or not that distraction continues that god takes control and you'll see a move on the scene you see because we saw where there was a distraction in a service where there was a young couple making out in the front row god's presence didn't leave due to the fact that the man of god gave god preeminence god came in and took control of the situation and you know they didn't ask them to leave when god took control it brought repentance and they stayed in the service same thing brother branham talks about setting an atmosphere in your home he says you know that time he talks about when he was home with mita and the kids and the kids were fussing and mita was upset about something he said i just put on an apron and went over to the sink and started washing dishes and singing songs and within a few minutes the whole place was just peaceful you know many of us i would dare to say would not react that way and i'm not saying that brother branham always had that reaction but he'd come to a place in his life where he understood how setting that right atmosphere changes everything changes everything and i know that because listen to the messages listen to the message especially at branham tabernacle how many times can you hear a small child crying how many times can you hear something in the background all that tape on top of all the distortion on the noise you know at the church where i was at in phoenix there was a sister there actually who was a child in branham tabernacle and when the tabernacle got real full they would have the young children leave their seats and come sit on the front of the platform now you know who who would think of that as not being something that would be a distraction but you see but they kept the right atmosphere and under that right atmosphere i'm not saying no one ever misbehaved but i'm saying they weren't focused in on the distraction they were focused in on the voice so here we are in our seats wherever we're at and it's up to you to control the atmosphere around you where you sit because brethren made a statement he said that someone with an evil spirit can affect the rose five in front of them and five behind them and that's exactly our reaction wow that's that's that's a lot of influence but we also know that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world so if the one person under the influence of an evil spirit has the can control the atmosphere five rows in each direction ten rows fan how much more someone fully yielded on the influence of the moving of the holy spirit who is listening and hearing god's word speak to their heart directly how much influence should there be in a room one person in the middle of this room should be able to control the atmosphere of this entire room fully surrendered fully focused in on what god is speaking to your heart maybe not with the minister not what the person at the pulpit is speaking it may not be the physical words but if you came desiring to hear from god god is obligated to come and speak to you in your need it doesn't matter what the minister wrote in his notes it doesn't matter what scriptures he wrote doesn't matter what slides he has doesn't matter how many hours he spent studying if you came and not only did you come expecting but you came and you brought that atmosphere with you then god is obligated to meet you there and meet the desire of your heart and speak to you directly and he will all right now one thing that they say about being able to listen and pay attention and understand is you have to get rid of all outside distractions you have to put everything down and shut out everything else and focus you have to focus on the voice being coming to you has to be as if you are the only person in the room you have to you have to lock in and draw it out of the speaker you've seen it many times i'm sure you've you've sat with someone and speaking in dialogue and whatever it was you're talking about and and as they sit there listening to you they make you just want to say more and say more and keep talking and say more because they're so focused on you that they're just drawing it out of you it's not that they they're saying anything they might be like oh yeah uh-huh wow that's amazing you know and a little maybe a little bit of encouragement oh wow but but they're so intent on listening that you just it just keeps coming out things that you've never meant to say and that's what you do every time you come into a service is if you came prepared to listen then you will draw that out not just of the man you'll draw it out of god himself coming to speak to you to speak to your heart individually but the question is are you listening the question is why did you come did you come to listen why are you here why are you listening and what do you want to hear did you just come to hear something that make you feel good did you come to did you come brother talks about if you come to find fault you'll find it did you come to find fault in in the speaker and his did you come to find fault in the grammar did you come to find fault in perhaps how something was said what what was what was your purpose when you sat down what was your purpose you see because in scripture we we have an example of someone who had the wrong purpose who just took get paid no attention but when it came time to speak over god's people he could only say what god allowed him do you know who that was that was balaam you see israel was coming across the land was camped outside of balak's territory and balak wasn't happy about it and he sent to balaam because balaam was a prophet you know we people want to put him outside the message or put him outside of the church but balaam was a prophet god spoke to him the problem is balaam was not good at listening balaam wanted to hear what he wanted to hear because the first time the king says messengers tell him hey all these people are here we need your help you're a great prophet see they begin stroking his ego we know you have the ability to do this come help us and balaam first time around he does the right thing he says look it i got to pray over this tonight and i'll give you an answer in the morning and they said okay he prays all night and the lord tells them don't go these are my people they are blessed do not go you think for anybody else after you just talked to god you asked him about going and cursing of people and he and he says these are blessed people i'm blessing them by the way you'd be like if god's blessing them i don't want nothing to do with no cursing because that puts me on you would think just basic reasoning god blessing them i try and curse them god's not blessing me at that point and he he tells them and they go away well guess what they heard what they wanted to hurt here too because he said god told me i can't do it and they went home and told them the king they told the king hey he's not going to come i don't think you're offering enough yet he said he don't want to and so he sends he says he sends more important more mighty men more princes more mightier than those of before p men of greater influence back to him and they come again and say hey look it you won't even not just your we won't even just flame your ego here but there's riches that you can't even imagine that we're gonna hand your way instead of going look guys god already spoke there's nothing i can do he says hey maybe god will change his mind he said oh let me pray again and he goes and he prays again and you know what he got told the same thing surprise surprise but now we're going to see here and the now that the princes have been turned away twice the elders of moab come to him they come with rewards of divination in their hand and they spake unto balaam and speak unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you a word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam and god came up to balaam and said what men are these with thee he's like balaam what are you doing in bad company again i already told you once and you're still associating you know we do that too in all different ways in careers in people we associate with in places we decide to go we have that gentle tugging of the holy spirit saying hey don't do that don't go there and then we go and do it and god comes and goes what are you doing what are you doing who are these men that you're associating with it's not just like in the garden of eden where he said adam adam where art thou it's not that god didn't know where adam was at and it's not that god didn't know who these people were he's like balaam come on get your act together and balaam said unto god balak the son is the poor king of moab had censored me saying behold there's a people come out of egypt which covert the face of the earth come now curse me them per adventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balaam arose in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuses to give me leave to go with you and here they come again and he said unto him came to balaam and said unto him thus saith balak's son as the four let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for i will promote thee unto very great honor and i do will do whatsoever thou sayeth unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if baalik would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more now therefore i pray you carry ye also hear this night you see doubts entering in and the the thoughts of his career being elevated to a status right under the king that's really pulling at him he's like look it no matter how much you offer me i can't do anything unless the lord lets me but let me talk to the lord again about it because it's getting better maybe the lord just wanted me to wait until the offer was right you know now therefore i pray you tarry ye also hear this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee thou that shalt thou do now listen there is a key thing in here or balaam heard but he wasn't listening okay and it said if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them okay and immediately in the next verse it says and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab nowhere in there does it tell me that they came again unto him they had gone they had heard him three times say no and then tell him no matter what you offer me i can't do it the lord won't let me and they went oh well we tried and they're on their way home balaam talks to the god about it and god tells them if they come again to you you can go with them but you will only say what i allow you and what balaam says heard was go with them and i'll you'll only be able to say what i allow you right he just the part he didn't want to hear right that whole part that we put in their past experiences what you want to hear is what you do here he heard what he wanted to hear and boom he was often down the road running but at this point a prophet after choosing his own way he has now become so desensitized to the presence of god moving he doesn't have a clue he's pushed and pushed for his own way so far outside of the will of god he doesn't even have a clue of when the presence of god comes down we know because here he is he's riding his his donkey as fast as he can go and first the donkey tries to run him off the path and then the donkey crushes his leg into a wall and he's getting mad at the donkey and he's beating the donkey with a stick well prior to this three nights worth he was sensitive enough to hear god speak to him and now there's an angel of the lord standing right in his presence and he can't even recognize it he is so pushed for his own way so pushed just disregarding everything that god has spoke to him see he didn't have no problem hearing and the first few times he had no problem listening but when his own gain and his own ambitions got in the way now his understanding was clouded and here he goes and here now he stands right in the presence of the angel not once i believe three times and it's not until the angel completely blocks the path where the donkey can't get out of the way and skirt around him in fact balaam is so blind that the angel tells him he says that what if it wasn't for your donkey i would have slew you if it wasn't for the dumb animal you'd be dead already you've become so desensitized and yet even in that this desensitized prophet still goes on his way thinking he's still going to try and gain some honor and glory still thinking he can still use god to curse his own people he is so his understanding is so his understanding and his judgment is so off he just keeps driving forward you see he still thought god would curse them that somehow god allowing him by to continue on was god's blessing on his journey it wasn't god had tried to correct him once correct him twice three times four times on the fourth time he sent an angel and this point god said okay you're gonna do what you're gonna do but you're not gonna like the end result and he still keeps driving forward but he's still trying to follow the precepts and understanding of scripture in order to bring this to pass against god's chosen people let's not ever find ourselves in that place where we've taken and we've turned scripture we've turned church order we've turned these things that are to be good things they're god's chosen way and yet we take them in and pervert them and try and use them against our brother we try and use them against our sister we try and use them to bring cursings instead of blessings you see and balaam was still 100 sure it was going to work because each time as he goes up for cursing he's got the seven altars he's got the the right sacrifices he's got everything just in order he's got his church order perfect and he comes up and he gets ready to curse and it happens just as god told him it would as he goes up to curse blessings pour from his mouth you see because it doesn't matter who is against you if god is for you none can be against you because god's word is true and what he's spoken has to come to pass you see there was already a word of blessing spoken over the children of israel and nothing could change that in fact even in attempting to curse them balaam simply added blessing upon blessing upon them it was only way he got to them is when he got them out from behind the word that had been spoken to them you see they had received a word and a prophet that brought that word and an understanding but balaam came to realize as long as i stay within the word all i can do is bless these people because they're god's people and god will never bring a curse upon his people only blessings now you may go through trials that you think are curses but they're actually blessings you just aren't understanding because you're not listening we're not listening we're not understanding because if you were listening and you were understanding you would see that this is not a curse this is this trial is not a cursing this is a blessing because then you would see what god was doing in your life just like elijah standing there at the cave and you would be able to see how god was working and he you would be start getting the instruction you need to move forward in the journey but as long as all you can see is the lightning all you can see is the thunder all you can see is the earthquakes all you can see is the turmoil around us all you can see is politics falling apart all you can see is countries falling apart wars and turmoil all over all around us both on global scales and community scales it's it's war on in the streets as long as the devil can get you to focus there look at this look at the evil look at what's going on look at what's going wrong then he got you distracted from the voice of god that still small voice coming to speak to your heart and bring understanding you see and so balaam realized that he had to bring a distraction to the childrens of israel to their understanding to the revelation of the word because only by getting them off the word because he pulled god's hand of protection off of them and so is it with each one of us no matter what trial you're going through no matter what the opposition stay with the word get into the word get deeper into the word ask ask him lord help me to understand this trial i'm going through help me to understand what it is that you're trying to speak to me to my heart directly help me to understand what direction it is you're trying to guide me help me to understand your plan for my life help me understand your plan for this situation because until you do you you'll you'll do the same thing you'll just wander around the sign but you won't get where you're going all right what time is it so here we have we can see someone who was able to listen but at a certain point had no revelation of what god was speaking to him okay now reasons for listening why are you listening you see in the book of acts stephen the first martyr of the church there when he was dragged before the council the men who dragged him there dragged him there because they were so angry because he was his words were so eloquent they couldn't get around them they couldn't beat them the eloquence with which he spoke was so revelated they didn't stand a chance so they brought together false accusations and dragged him before the council with those false accusations when they got to the council the council had no desire to hear and understand what stephen was ministering they had already predetermined why they were listening and that was for judgment they had already already predetermined what he was speaking was a lie so as his eloquent ministry poured forth and he walked them all the way from abraham bit by bit by bit all the way to jesus he showed them each of the signs he showed them the prophecy it was all falling on deaf ears they had already decided he was a blasphemer their reason for listening was simply to find fault and cast judgment okay another one jesus in matthew the scribes and pharisees it specifically says the reason they came to ask him questions was to entrap him under the law and find fault that was their reason for listening they they weren't looking for the truth they weren't thinking that jesus might have something that to share with them that they would be able to understand or that would open up their understanding every time he responded in a way that was true to scripture they simply discounted it and said well he made it out this time but we know he's wrong we know he's wrong and we'll catch him next time we'll catch him next time he's just really sly you know just like the devil that's what they called him the alzhebab he said he's healing people by the power of beelzebub because just like there with the disciples when they dragged him before the sanhedrin council and they asked gamalio for advice he said brethren be careful what you do with these men least you find yourself fighting against god he said if this is of man it will fall apart and go away but if it be of god you cannot win you see but even there they weren't listening they had already made a decision they had already decided and they had gone too far to turn back they were so sold out to what they believed even when they heard the truth and saw the truth they refused to believe it they'd seen all the miracles the scribes and pharisees it says that the at the gate was at the gate of the temple these scribes and pharisees probably walk by him all of them once or twice a day crippled from birth miracles signs and wonders they hadn't seen them in a long time it wasn't like there was miracles happening and somebody else came along and and there was just another miracle every day happening look another another crippled man walking no big deal that wasn't the case there had been no miracles for years just like we stood in this day when the pentecostal age came on there had been no real miracles in the church for years that's why they had come to a point where they said that the signs and wonders it was the of the times the apostles it's not for us now even as brother branham was entering the stage in the early part of his ministry the pentecostal church of the azusa street revival had already come to a place that's why brother abraham said in 50 years you have gone further than the catholic church did in 2000 because they'd already come to the point this was not the the presbyterians and the catholics telling him the days and miracles are gone but it was those of the apostolic pentecostal church who are saying it's over it's over it's done they'd already decided and here it was now god comes on the scene and signs and wonders following like he wasn't looking for you to follow the signs and the wonder but he's trying to catch your attention to the word but only those who are listening in the midst of the turmoil in the midst of all the going on in the midst of the thunder in the midst of the lightning in the midst of the earthquake in the midst of churches falling apart in the midst of those falling away you're still listening to god still small voice because you weren't paying attention to any of the thunder you weren't paying attention to the lightning you weren't paying attention to the earthquake you weren't paying attention to just the sign but that whole time you focused into the voice you focus into the voice and the voice hasn't changed maybe the sign has changed and so now those who are falling aside they're like where'd it go i don't know where to go where'd the sign go it must not have been true the sign must not have been true because the sign's still not here but the voice is still here the voice is still here and the question is is are we listening and if we're listening are you understanding okay other reasons for listening listening to be entertained listening for your own purposes your own direction in life and in today's day and age there's so many other voices there's so much distraction around us it seems like everything that could possibly be here is today in this age is here to distract you to pull you away the voices of entertainment the voices of social media the voices of of politics the social the voices of religion the voices of church orchestration and business the churches the voices of career all these things are surrounding you plaguing you and just causing noise noise noise noise and you have to be able to put that all away put that all away because god's not coming screaming at you he's a gentleman he's coming softly he's knocking he's outside the door the war is happening all around the greatest battle that's ever been fought the dan told us all about it it's happening in the mind but he's knocking to the door of your heart but if you're not able to get away from the clamor of the war you'll never hear the knock and if you never hear the knock you'll never hear the voice because the voice is even quieter and stiller than the knock but he's speaking he's waiting if you'll hear me if you would just hear me and open the door even if you don't understand but the first time if you just hear the voice and like i hear him i think that's jesus i think he's outside the door i don't understand what he's telling me i don't understand what he's asking of me but maybe i'll just open the door and let him in you see because once he comes in to stop with you he can explain it all just like he did with the disciples he can come and begin opening the words just like he did with those disciples on the road to emmaus they were confused they were in a time of turmoil they were in a time of war they were in a time of of political strife all around them the sadducees were fighting the pharisees and the pharisees were fighting the sadducees for power you see it was a church system at that time it wasn't some pious group these were men vying for power the high priest was not actually elected at that time by the people or through the levitical priesthood but was appointed by the roman government so if you wanted to be at the top you had to be willing to do things you had to be willing to get your hands dirty and everybody knew it the people knew it the people could see it there was a few mixed in there you had a few nicodemuses here and there who still believed the truth who was still looking for the messiah but most of them they were just there for power they were just there for what they could get out of it control power money the same things that brother ram said plague us today he said the three things that there that most affect a minister he said were money popularity in women nothing has changed we're still in that same position we find ourselves back there how much different should it be we know that in the first coming of christ what the conditions were so how would it be any different in the second coming we should be looking for the same situations we should see churches fighting churches we should see countries fighting countries we should see things falling apart and crumbling when we see all these things we can be sure one thing god speaking to his people are we listening are we listening i want to close this up and i just want to read your quote you see this was a prophet of god who came all the way to that place of the wave sheath before the people he came to that place of adoption where god said this is my beloved son but it wasn't because he was special it was simply because god was saying look at bride here's the first fruits of the bride here's the first fruits all of you can attain the same status all of you can attain this same point in fact that's what you're called to do you're called to be able to walk as adam in the garden and you know what was so significant about adam walking in the garden was in the cool of the evening god would come down and walk with him and speak to him directly lip to ear or adam wasn't just hearing he was listening and understanding what god was telling him and explaining to him what god was communing to him directly it was personal so personal but that's because adam could recognize when god came down he could recognize when that he would stop and go lord is that you is it you i'm hearing just like elijah they're in the cave lots of noise lots of things happening i'm sure in the garden of eden there was plenty of noise the birds sang the lions roared they were all in harmony and happy but how much more do people sing and rejoice than when they're happy the animals were happy they were rejoicing the wind blew through the trees all the time and yet adam was in tune to where he could tell the difference between that wind blowing through the tree and god's presence coming down and here we have an example of another son of god who came to that same place and could so recognize god's voice when he was moving so sensitive each one of you can be that too you can be so sensitive to the moving of god in your lives to fully know when he's speaking to you and when he's moving now let's see what happened we've seen through scripture when god spoke there's many more go go go into the scripture i challenge you and see look when god spoke to his sons and his daughters look through each instance when god came and spoke and see how he did it when why and what the outcome was it's important this is not just a book of fairy tales and stories this is specific it's telling us how god has done things from the beginning and how he'll do them throughout eternity because he's a unchanging god so here we can see this was scripture and many of us could maybe discount it maybe the brain has kicked in and you went well you know those are all true things i believe it but the most recent happening was 2 000 years ago maybe it doesn't happen anymore i have an example much more recent okay let's look at it i know it's a little bit late but i'm going to read the whole thing i think it's good i think it's important it's in the message he that is in you 1963. and for those of you who write it down it's starting with paragraph 92 says brother tom is here brother tom simpson coming down from canada heard the forecast he was advised not to go through that part of the country because this forecast said it'll be a blizzard where are you brother tom i think that's right yeah right here he the blizzard was coming everybody had done set in for it everyone had set in oh you've been in minnesota long enough you know what a storm looks like you know when you prepare and get ready you get prepared to stay in one spot and hang tight this is not just a light snowstorm this is a blizzard this is meant to kill you if you stay out in it well i put my gun back under my shirt like this the brown without hunting under my shirt like this my red shirt started walking down the mountain as i started i got about half a mile from the saddle and oh my the big drops of snow like that the wind twisting up on the mountain i couldn't see the bottom no more i could see about 20 feet in front of me or 30 maybe and i knowed to come right down this little what we call a little hog back little ridge then come off to the creek then i know to follow the creek and where to go to if it got real bad he's got his landmarks he knows where he's going he knows if i stay on this path i'll get back to the cabin i'll get back to safety okay and so then i started down and got about halfway down there and something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back you see many times like i was saying we think the tests and trials we go through or we don't see them as a blessing we see the snowstorm we see the the storms building we see what appears to be like if i don't stay on course if i don't stay on my current course i'm i'm a dead i'm dead there's no surviving this but god wants to come to you in that moment and say stop stop no go this other way and if you are too much still in that position where you're you're trying to run off of your own ability your own thoughts and your own past experience your reaction be like nah that can't be god god would never send me into danger he wouldn't do that and you're right god will never send you into danger because where he goes with you you're in total safety and if something does happen it's because he's allowed it for his purpose and for his glory just like the man born blind everyone was convinced is this the sin of his parents or his own sin no no no it was for god's glory it was for god's glory the whole time the storm it's for god's glory it's not god punishing you it's not god trying to judge you in some way it's for his glory the storm is for his glory but are you listening are you listening the storm's all around you visibility you can't see where you're going you can't see a way out of this situation that you're in whatever it might be apply it to any situation this is a physical situation with a literal storm but we all go through storms on a daily basis we all face a storm in our life every day it doesn't have to be like catastrophic like i'm losing my home tomorrow we each go through a storm in our life every day something that you face that you need god to step on the scene and you need to be able to be sensitive in the midst of that storm in your situation where you hear god speak and say stop you know why because scripture says be still and know that i am lord. doesn't say run all over try and fix it yourself it says hold on whoa now he's not going to want you to stay still next thing he's going to do is he's going to tell you to do something he's going to give you instructions but if you're not listening and you disregard the stop you won't hear the instructions that follow okay just as plain as you hear me stop and go back well i thought what was i thinking about maybe it's just my mind here's the prophet he's he's heard the voice of god many times yet in the midst of the storm in this situation he's thinking well maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me and i just couldn't make another step forward see but in that moment he said you know what until i know i'm not moving i'm staying right here he said david did fix me a sandwich that morning and i think he tried to get even with me for fixing his daddy one one time of onion and honey that's all we had so he fixed me a baloney and oh i don't know what all was in it was wrapped in there and i had it in my shirt it got wet through my shirt i thought i'll just stop and eat this and maybe it'll be all right then maybe it's just my nerves maybe it's just the brain fine tricks on me so i pulled out the sandwich and about 10 o'clock i started eating the sandwich and as i ate the sandwich i thought now i'll be all right i'll be okay and i started to move on he kept going in his own direction back heading back towards safety but something said go back where you come from more insistent go back through that storm a half a mile or more back up the mountain into the dark that dark timber where you can hardly see as far as that organ i don't know how old again far the organ was but i believe he was in the tabernacle and the tabernacle was maybe maybe i don't know i've not been there but i've heard it's maybe only twice the size of this building here so you can only be maybe 10 or 15 minutes on a platform 10 or 15 feet or more from an organ on a platform of that size so visibility has dropped in half of what it was originally but i'm getting to be an old man and i've been a christian now for 33 years and i know no matter what how ridiculous it seems mind the lord do what the lord says you see he mentions here his experience with the lord and experiences of when he did not listen he had many but there's two main ones that we can think of right off the bat when the lord first commissioned him to go amongst the pentecostal people and his wife's mother told him how dare you drag my daughter out amongst that trash and due to the influence of his mother-in-law he didn't follow god's leading god's voice speaking to him directly and due to that his wife passed away and his baby girl later on there's another instance he was in south africa having meetings and god had specifically told him where to go when to go how to go and he would bless it but the ministerial association the church a woman once again came to him and said no due to church politics and those who have influence within the church politics we have to go to these locations because we promised them that we would and brother balon had to make a decision go with church or go with god and he chose to go with the church now many people when they first saw they said well god was still in it because god told him the angel lord told him he said i'll bless it but you'll pay for it he said every one of those ministers just about died but a man caught an amoeba that almost killed him if it wasn't for that god still had a work for him to do and here he gets to a place he says i'm where he where he's heard the voice speak to him again and he's going back up there he says but i'm getting to be an old man and i've been a christian now for 33 years and i know no matter how ridiculous it seems mind the lord do what the lord says don't worry about what other people are doing don't worry about someone else's counsel if you can confirm this is where god's leading me it doesn't matter what the obstacle looks like press on just like the man they asked him he said you know they asked me they said he couldn't read the bible and they asked him do you believe every word that's in that bible they said i do i said well what if that bible told you to go run and jump through that wall he said well then i'd run jump through that wall he said but there's no hole there he said when i got to the wall and jumped there'd be a hole for me to go through you see that's the kind of faith god's looking for you to have in his word and it all starts with listening because if you're if you do not believe the word from the best it'll never manifest into an action you can hear all you want you can sit in this church you can take the the tapes and the messages and take and download all 1200 plus sermons you can listen to every single one of them you can memorize the scripture line by line but until you're actually listening and understanding what god is trying to tell you through that scripture through that word it won't change you one bit it will have no effect okay and i turned and went back to the saddle feeling my way back old asleep getting harder and harder getting darker and darker and i sit down there and just put my coat up like this his conditions hadn't changed or my shirt over the scope again i sat down i thought what am i doing here why would i come back up here he doesn't know he's gone all the way back up and now he's just sitting there he says i don't what am i doing here why did i come back up here if nothing changes the only option is death the only option is death see god didn't give him a whole long spiel ahead of time he didn't give him a vision be like okay so you're going to be in colorado you're going to be hunting there's going to be a storm coming in i want you to be aware of this because when it comes in i'm going to give you the ability to speak the word and speak that storm out of existence god has i was at a point with this prophet i'd appoint with his son where he did not want that to be the case because in the beginning of his ministry it had been there was points where the the visions were coming so much and so often brother branham refused to move unless he saw a vision if he didn't see a vision he didn't go nowhere and the angel lord came to him and said you need to stop that he said i'll give you a vision from time to time but you already have thus saith the lord it's right here thus saith the lord for the believer says the prayer of the of faith will heal the sick you don't need a vision for the healing of the sick that's just something nice for you that's just for a sign stop following that now get up and walk by faith step out the door on the word believing that it's true you see so he wasn't going to give him a vision where he didn't require faith because this was a test of his faith just like abraham when he took isaac up on the mountain god spoke to him and he had to understand what god was saying he had a revelation that what god was asking him to do was take isaac up there and sacrifice him because if he would have listened with his own ideas his own understanding and be like wow isaac gave he gave him to me and he's my only heir and he's promised me that through him my generations after generation will people of as the sound of the sea so he must not mean he wants me to kill him and sacrifice him he must mean this is some type of maybe type or this is just like uh he's just trying to see what i do he doesn't really want me to do this exactly because everything else he's told me doesn't line up with this how possibly can he be my heir if i kill him but no god spoke abraham said yes lord because he was at the same place where brother branham said he was he said i'm an old man and everyone said i'm an old man and i've been a christian for quite a while now i've seen what not listening does it gets me in egypt trying to pass off my wife as my sister and it didn't work out well so he'd come to the place where he said lord if you say it i don't understand it but i'll do it when i get there i still don't understand it here brother adam was he got to that he'd walk to the place where he thought he was meant to be he sat down he said what am i doing here why would i come back up here i'm sure abraham when he got to the top of the mountain and he gets to the point where i says where's the sacrifice and he says it's you buddy i don't know why god wants me to do this i don't know why i'm here but he said to do it and i'm here and i just waited a few minutes here he is he's waiting on the lord and i started to get up again and just as plain as i'd ever want to hear a voice said i am the creator of heavens and earth and i make the winds and the rain i took off my hat you see it always has the same reaction with the sons of god when his presence comes by we can't help but bow our head in humility elijah there on the mount when he heard this the thunder we saw there the thunder the earthquake he didn't phase elijah but then he heard that still small voice and he covered his face and he said lord i'm not worthy of your presence here the prophet of god in our age you know he was following what he believed to be god's voice and he gets there and he's waiting and all of a sudden god's presence just steps down on the scene and he says i am the creator of heaven's earth i make the wind and the rain and he recognizes that presence and his hat comes off he's still standing in the storm you know that it's still storming nothing has changed with the storm yet you still have feet of snow accumulating on the ground you still can't see more than 10 feet out nothing has changed in the circumstances except for god's presence is on the scene and it didn't matter how much snow was landing on his head he took his hat off in humility and i said great jehovah is that you is that you he said i was the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea i was the one who made the waves to go down i created heavens and earth was not i not the one that told you to speak for those squirrels he he's identifying himself to the believer every time he comes by he'll he'll reveal himself to you if you're paying attention if you're listening it doesn't matter where you're at right now we're here we're in a church building you know but it's just a building it's just a building the presence of god is here is because you're here you're here you're here he's not here for the building he's here for his children he's looking to speak to you he's looking to move in your life his presence is here now that's not just something we say it's a reality but it's are we listening are we paying attention i created heavens and earth was not i not the one that told you to speak for those to those for those squirrels and they come into existence i am god now when a voice speaks to you watch the scripture if it's not scriptural you leave it alone you see the prophet didn't just leave it he realized okay this may cause some fanaticism this may cause some people to run around and just claim god spoke to me and this is what we're supposed to do because there's plenty of those there's plenty of false prophets eighth messengers false messiahs as they were in jesus time he said many false christs shall come he said don't believe it they'll say he's off in the wilderness they'll say he's here he said don't believe in one of them well i say unto you many false doctrines have come don't believe one of them stay with the word because the prophet always took us back to the word he always brought us back to christ and here he is even in the midst of this he's relaying this he says when a voice speaks to you watch the scripture if it's not scriptural you leave it alone i don't care how plain it is you stay away from it so now we know how to judge accordingly you want to know of god speaking to you go back to thus saith the lord and see does it line up can i go through scripture and see how god is dealing with my life because he's done it before in the lives of his sons and his daughters has he spoke to someone else that way before is he has he directed someone else like that before if so you can stand on it and move forward if not rebuke it i said yes lord he said speak to those winds and that storm and it will go away now this bible lays before me which my life is in that i raised up and i said i do not doubt your voice lord you see he had to believe a hundred percent if there had been a slightest amount of doubt it wouldn't have worked even the slightest just any doubt because although the faith the side of a mustard seed will move a mountain a speck of dust will hold that mountain in place of doubt you have to believe it 100 there's no turning back there's no alternative in the name of jesus christ go to your places i say that the sun must come out immediately and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and i leave with my brethren it was just gushing just went like that and it started going then it went and stopped i stood real still my brethren up there wondering what was happening in the sleep rain stopped there came a wind whirling down through the mountains lifted up the clouds and one went this way east north west and south and within a few minutes the sun was shining nice and warm that's the truth god knows that's the truth i just stood there just looking around with my hat off looking you say i got all numb i got numb all over i thought the very god of creation it's all in his hands what's he telling me and i picked up my gun and wiped off the scope started walk back go down the hill see he thought well okay this was it this is all god was it happened he begins walking away and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness walk with me and i said yes lord with all my heart it'd be one of the greatest things i could do was walk with you so i put my gun over my shoulder and i started walking down through that never an axe laid in it virgin timber walking through there as i did walked along down along these game trails i felt like i believe i'll just go up to the place where yesterday was our anniversary i will stand there just a few minutes just as a salute to meeta where it's a little bunch of quaking ass up on a little knob i said well believe i'll walk up there just as a salute to our anniversary then i'll go back down on this other side in these dark timbers and walk around and go around over by towards the coral peaks and come back down that way just walking and rejoicing i was saying father i know you're walking with me and what a privilege there's no buddy great earth that i could be walking with the very god and that warm sunshine amen musicians if you would come you see sayings this aren't this is not just a story these are not just stories through scripture of god speaking to his people this is not just stories of god coming down and meeting this is not just stories of power and might and thunder and lightning and all these things it's not just a story it's god wanting to speak to his people it's god wine commune he's wanting to come down and just begin whispering in your ear that love story's so sweet he's wanting to speak to your heart he's wanting you to open the door he's wanting to come in and fellowship with you it's all he's ever wanted from the beginning of time from the time that adam was here upon the earth all he wanted was fellowship fellowship with his sons and his daughters fellowships with his attributes you say attributes yeah you you each one of you you are an attribute of god you are a piece of god that could only just displayed [Music] in the character he made you there was no way other for him to express that part of himself outside of you [Music] so don't think for a moment that you're insignificant it's not true this body of flesh will drop away yeah there's nothing to it it's just a house it's just a house of corruption [Music] but there's something calling from the eternal realm calling you back to that [Music] to that picture of who you were from before the beginning who you were as a spoken word of god expressed you are his word expressed that's why you need to be able to hear it and understand because through the understanding that you'll recognize yourself because you'll recognize i'm not just hearing a word i'm not just hearing a sound i'm not just hearing a voice but i'm hearing myself revealed as i truly am and you begin to see the picture become clearer and clearer but if we're not paying attention we're like the eagle that comes to that moping period comes to the moping period its talons are soft its beak is grown over and because it can't see the potential beyond that it just lands on the ground and dies there he'll die an eagle but he'll never reach his fullest potential but if you hear that still small voice calling you up the mountain calling you to that rock of revelation of who you are and what god's potential is for your life you'll go up there will be a painful process a be a stripping away of your old self it won't be pleasant but you'll come out of it more than conquerors recognizing god is moving in your life let's just pray heavenly father lord we just thank you for coming by here this evening father lord oh your presence is so sweet father lord we ask for revelation father revelation of who we are father lord we know you're the god you're the creator of the universe you're the mighty one your elohim the lord to be able to see ourselves in you that's what we truly desire father it's easy to see omnipotence in god it's easy to see there in the act of the cross god's love god's grace god's mercy god's forgiveness but lord you didn't meant for us to see it in the scripture you didn't mean for us just to see it in the cross but you're looking for us to become a living manifestation of those attributes father that we would be the ones expressing that grace that forgiveness your love that would become a lived life father lord that we would become the word not just understand it not just see it revealed but actually become the living word father lord your very word lived out amongst the people that as we'd walk through these streets father there would be such an atmosphere that those in need of healing those in need of grace those in need of forgiveness oh father they could receive it not anything of ourselves father but that which you are expressing through us lords we just dedicate ourselves back to you once again dedicate these people i would ask you to bless them for being here hearing listening father lord i ask you to give each one including myself understanding father of your word a greater revelation every day father lord we would be more sensitive to the moving of your presence father lord that no matter the storm we're in we'd be able to just reach up and know that you're there recognize the presence of the almighty and just walk by faith as you would guide us all these things in your precious most wonderful name the name of the lord jesus christ he knows my name sing it now he formed my heart before [Music] he knows my name he knows is i have a fall yes he knows my name [Music] oh he [Music] he knows my name me [Music] he sees this praise the lord praise the lord amen we want to appreciate the lord for there tonight you know uh brother branham actually said something i was going to read something from the church ages but we fire past over the service time tonight so uh you know he taught about the listening ability you know that that god brings us to and it's beautiful in some of the things that brother jordan shared with us tonight if you look at the scripture and your moses experience with the burning bush you hear the scripture talking about god speaks and god says take out your shoes and it was only moses that here there it was only moses to the natural mind it looks crazy for the man talking to a fire it looks crazy david heard god's voice in the wind [Music] he says lord until you speak i'm not going to go and when the wind came in a mob the muppet trees he heard god speaking praise the lord you know when and and and like the scripture identified gulf wars walking in the garden of eden it's it you know uh uh we must be grateful you know like brother branham said in the church age books you know god raised men through the ages even the translation of the bible to be able to bring our mind to the place to understand some of the things that that we now understand you know for the man to really hear the voice of god you know he i mean he has to be he has to be captured into god's presence he has to be close up into his presence so we just thank the lord for that tonight let's just buy our heads together we had a few prayer requests that we want to remember let's just uh pray for them together while the musicians softly prayed i mean plain
