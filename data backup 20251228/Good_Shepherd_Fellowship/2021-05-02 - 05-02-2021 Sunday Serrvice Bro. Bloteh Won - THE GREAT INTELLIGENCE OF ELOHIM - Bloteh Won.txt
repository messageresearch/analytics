back there and the next one is isaiah praise the lord so the prophets are in church well praise the lord amen glory be to god but we greet you all and we we uh we says you are welcome to fellowship for us be at home and uh uh and if i'm missing anyone again i'm sorry for that but uh praise the lord praise the lord it's so good to be in the house of the lord so so so good amen amen and i will start up just you know but steve came back then and i told him as university we always had internet in this church it's now that the church is paying for it our church our church is not a village church it's not now that we are catching up with technology praise the lord i believe sometime back even through the church we got a hot spot but lloyd worked on that from a t but then we were constantly being charged more so then we decided to go into something else and then we we got another uh hotspot well we at the time the church was not fully on board to cover the expenses of of that of us having internet so we had to do it personally how to put it on my account so then when the church got her internet i took their hospital home so uh it's still serving me praise the lord and uh yeah so i mean we we we had to go to uh hosting a uh paying for the internet as a church because one of our website and to live streaming we needed more speed than than the hotspot crew offer us so that's the reason why we had to go to death praise the lord but we we are so glad that it came in time and once again we want to say the thanks to to each and every one of you that have chosen this place as a church to make it home and and have also uh dedicate yourself to support what we do from the corner of this street amen thank you for all your support your presence and uh and your financial support and ties and offering and all of that well i wish deborah steve will have talked to me about the suggestion of having the meeting to decide the pastor's salary you know that is never done is now strictural so i don't think we're going to have that meeting so but i'll talk to the officers about it i wish you have talked to me about it i i don't think it's stricture it's not it's not done so because if you choose to pay me five million dollar the day i start to preach wrong and everybody leave the church then we will have to sell the property for you to keep healing me so that is not structural as as much as i'm concerned so let's talk about it with the officers but for now uh i don't expect that we'll have a meeting like that or we should have a meeting like that i think it's the trustee's responsibility to come and sit with the pastor if there is a concern it should be a conversation between the trustee the treasurer and the pastor so god bless you for your silence praise the lord knowing that we were going to uh have this business meeting uh i thought that i would speak on something and uh that i entitled the great intelligence of elohim the great intelligence of elohim to show that we are here by design you are sitting in this building this morning by design there is an intelligence that is behind your presence here it is now all of your choosing amen which of course you could also choose to live but there is a great intelligence that is behind everything that happened in the universe praise the lord a church does just does not run by few men sitting together and uh you know and making and making uh uh uh yes you know suggestion or or guess or whatever it is i knew i had i had an announcement here i've already started going uh there is a planned youth meeting for the 2010 uh uh there's a plain youth meeting for the 2010 and brother jordan will bring us some uh more details on that so there's a plane meeting for the 2010 and the flyers for washington is out uh so uh brother uh stephen collins and brother team the romney will be doing uh some special meeting there up in wappington north dakota so if you are planning to go or you want to go uh to know how to get there i will i will ask that you you talk to brother jordan and before the the middle of this month we would like to be able to have an idea of those that would love to go so we can we can let uh the the brothers know so maybe until the 20 until the 16th or the 20th we would definitely like to have an idea of those that will love to go praise the lord amen and well the thing about it there you go i mean you could choose to make your own plans and and you know and go to the meeting you know when uh i mean every one of us in some way beside the kids we are responsible people but sometimes the reason why these things are done is because when you go out you are representing us as a body and it will be good for us to know that you are out there representing us that is just all it's not to control you or detect to you how you should go about but it will be good for us to know that you are out there representing us as a church praise the lord amen and uh also uh there there are a few things that uh i also had on my mind over the years i really thought that i would have addressed some of these things if we were fortunate to have our our 25th meeting church anniversary meeting that we were planning to but uh we we had an ad and we still dealing with uh uh you know the entire uh word problem and kovac and all of that so for now now we just we just keep those things as the way they are but uh the church of the living god stay moves on praise the lord you know uh kovak is not dictating to us we are dictating to to covey amen it's not dictating to us at all we are dictating to covey praise the lord and so we know that through this church we have uh two deacons there's uh brother steve john bibi and uh brother uh ben uh lingard there's our two vacants that this church the beacons are not appointed the deacons calling to the local church are normally voted in and and in the way that brother branham set it up the terms of the deacons comes at the end of the year but you know it all will determine from the the way that they can bowl works with the local pastor if we see a need for us to add on to the deacon bowl if there is a reason why brother seven on the deacon ball must must be taken of the deacombe then those things are addressed so uh we have two trustees there's uh uh uh brother max and uh uh brother steve cassidy and uh steve cassidy i'm gonna match our trustees and brother steve cassidy is also the treasurer of the church and which of course is the office that he he had been holding and he loved yelling praise the lord amen i think he's caught for that office with his level of details that he have and uh and we greatly appreciate that and then uh over the years our brother uh scath has led this church uh as uh as our song leader until brother lord came on board a couple of years ago and then uh many years ago not just couple and then a couple of years he he decided to move out of state and so we we we really never had an an appointed song leader so brother lawrence and brother hillary has been helping the office or the role as some leaders now i call into the scripture uh the the song leaders and the musicians they are all part of the ministry they are all under the ministry they are all ministering spirits praise the lord they are all ministering spirits and that's the reason why a person is not just used in a local church as a musician because of your music skill no not because of your music skill i mean you can play the guitar at your back but if you can submit yourself to the word of god we don't want that skill praise lord because they are all part of the ministry so it's not because a man can play or the woman can play a certain instrument that's why they play the the i mean it must be to the pastor's knowledge because it's all part of the ministry if you read the church all the brother branham talks about it in a way and the way he says it is that he says the the song leader comes up and leaves one or two songs you know to get the people ready and then the pastor comes up you know i mean over the years we have we have we have uh you know have this telling me it's time for some service and sometimes people think it's written in bold letters but if you study the church order you realize that it's it's not written in bold letters you know if uh if the pastor want to leave songs yeah he has a right to lay sons the song leader just helping the pastor and but then also uh you see this tool around our setting in the message where a pastor is is more of an administrator than a pastor praise the lord he's more than he's more an administrator than the pastor because he does everything you know he does everything he's into everything and you know and all of that stricture is not supposed to be like that we know from the scriptures that there must be men that are giving to the word in prayers praise the lord the deacons are spiritual advices to the pastor when it comes to spiritual things and things that concerns the people you know and also concerns but brandon says they are the policemen of the church we know that as well so uh uh uh some few years back uh uh brother jordan and his wife approached me in action but one is yes are there things that we can take off your plate are there things that we can help you to do and because i'm so selfish i'm so selfish i love to do everything it was a bit difficult for me to decide what to let them do and what not to let them do but i think slowly they started taking certain initiative and it has been a great help so uh i spoke to both of them and asked them if they could if they could help himself as as administrators brother jordan which of course his wife works along with him and uh to be able to just help me with just planning some things and and you know and some other things so uh praise the lord so they appointed them as as administrators to be able to help because even without the appointee brother jordan has taken on that initiative praise the lord and because we have now fully come to the place where we have a song leader that we can we can put in charge of uh not only leading songs but of the the the music you know uh and the musicians so i also spoke with brother ariel being a musician that he was served as a music director uh just to be able to work with the song leaders work with a musician and take on some responsibilities when it comes to to those things and until we can fully come to the place where we have a song leader that you know because it's it's a ministry that just is now only uh subject to coming up in leading songs you know you have all of these musicians you know that you have to work with and sometimes you have to make some difficult you have to make some strong calls and praise the lord and so for our appointees those uh the few that we we just appointed to be able to help us with some of the few things that we have to do around you the church is not an organization but yet the church is an organized body praise the lord the church is an organized body and when you don't have [Music] things organized is a sign that there is no intelligence to that thing that's some of that we will talk about this morning and pray that the lord will be able to help us praise the lord churches has been run in a way where you know people think they can come into a local church and uh you know it's the house of god you know and and with that they think that it has the right to you know do whatever they want i will promise you they are not in this place we will hope that it don't happen here praise the lord we will hope that it don't happen here church also is a family in families we make mistakes we make wrong choices you know when and uh and yet we sit as family and we deal with those things but when a person want to think want to take you know a way of life that does not match the value that we stand for as a church we will also let you know that we can discipline you according to the scripture if you make mistakes we can bear with you but when you want to take your mistake as a way of life we have a scriptural order to discipline you praise the lord so as we are growing you know the two places in the book of acts this the the bible talks about the growth of the church and one of the places was the bible says and they grew in the word of god you know so the growth of a church is not just the members it's not just the numbers but how much the people are growing in the word of god how much they are becoming uh you know a reflection of what they believe or what they stand for and i think i'm more interested in growing in the word of god and growing in and numbers uh we will talk as we as we go along i just thought there that we will drop few of these things but recently there are a few things that has been happening you know around the world around the the the the body of believers around the world and sometimes to draw concern for you know for those things to be addressed and [Music] so we as a local church we can know which direction that we are going praise the lord in the local church uh the pastor is the head of the local church according to the scripture is not an editor because of age is an other chronologically in the word of god praise the lord you know he's an editor because of his office is the highest office in the local church so that that makes him an error and that's the reason why paul says we must not put a man that is a novice we must put a man that is sound in the word of god and if i'm not sound you must get me from there and uh so that that makes him an editor and then in the local church also we have you know supporting ministries which are the the brothers that preach here we have brother uh dan brother jordan brother brother joseph have just come along to be with us and uh sometimes in the local church there are ministries that uh that are birthed in the midst of the local church a person we could have used as an example was brother lloyd you know his ministry started right from here and uh [Music] and then sometimes there are there are ministries that comes you know from from uh by the way of relocation or traveling and coming be part of the local church and uh in that way the the the the pastor you know uh works with the brothers and uh you know and and also support them but like i told brother lloyd you know i mean he's he's a dear friend and a son to me and i told him all the time i you know we would talk about it and i told him i said i said when you get married then i'll feed him a heart we can bring your ministry before the church because it's not only the gift as a preaching you also have a responsibility to make an example of your home so uh then we can ordain you as a local minister that we have witnessed over the years and uh uh you know and all of that if uh uh many of you will remember at the time that this this church voted us in as a pastor i had to be ordained now that was now my ordination into the ministry i was ordained as a local pastor into this church yes praise the lord as minister i've been ordained as a minister to preach the gospel you know so i mean all of those things now the reason why i'm saying it is because uh uh i call into the the scripture uh the the the office of uh the beacons uh and next to the office of a pastor those are the scriptural offices that men are voted in now the reason why for the trustees we we bring them before the church and we ask the church if there's a reason why you know uh uh i mean if if the uh uh there's a reason why this brother shooting itself is is also in the sense of uh accountability but uh uh the the next office to the pastor that the men pray for then into their offices the deacon office and then the next will also be maybe uh their associate pastor or assistant pastor when a church has come to the place where there is a ministry among them they think that uh you know uh this ministry just like elijah and elijah you know uh we found that uh you know this brother uh herself this church and we bring him before the church uh you know to ordain him as an assistant pastor and then in that way the reason why that is done is uh uh is is uh is a direct signal to the church that if anything should happen to the pastor whether he felt sick or he died there is a man that takes the office because this man has been presented he's he's ordained he's already in the office as an assistant pastor now what happened when the church does not have an assistant pastor and the pastor died praise the lord what happened oh i mean i'm not asking for an eldef praise the lord but uh that the pastor can met he's no longer conceived in the role of a pastor what happened now we realized that what has been happening over the years and in many churches we we see that there is there is a struggle that comes between the deacons and the ministers in the church praise the lord amen the deacons says i mean we are we are in charge the ministers say ah but i'm a minister and you are a deacon praise the lord but you have to understand the way the local church work a minister has the authority by the word of god because he has a gift but in the local church the local church has appointed a deacon that has been chosen and ordained so the office of a deacon his position is higher than just a minister in a local church but when it comes to the word praise the lord amen so you see there there there are there are two roles you you have to understand how those roles play out are we together so what will happen is that that they can must be able to sit down with those local ministers and uh they should be able to talk and and and i mean some of the brothers and you know because noun is a concern to the church but what i will advise as as a pastor for our church until god is able to raise up a man that we can have and know that this this man can be able to run the church we we we have a service life you know we have observed his ministry and we know that he's right into the vision for the success of this church and uh uh uh what what will happen is that uh in situations like that you know uh uh is it is always safe the safest thing to do in those kind of a situation is that the deacons and the ministers of the local church must be able to decide and bring in an editor we must bring in an editor take for example we must bring in an air that is very you know uh uh we know that is supportive to this church where we have we we can say well okay uh uh maybe uh uh one of the nearest air that we can use maybe don hoffman all i will say is like brother prater he's been a good friend to this church so that local editor will come in and serve as an overseer praise the lord so now there is not an internal conflict of struggle between the ministers and the deacons this other person said well i started preaching before you other person say i'm older than you the other person said i'll bring the message before you and and all of that no it does not work like that so now that that that that that uh that editor was serve as an overseer and and and he will work with the church and be because he's an editor and he's he's a person that is out of the body there is there is no area for personal interest what he's looking for he's looking among the ministers to be able to find a man that has a true burden praise the lord whether six months or a year if that man is found then he comes before the church and says church i think you have a man among you for this period of time that i've been working with you i think this brother can be able to lead you amen praise the lord because pretty soon those internal conflict breaks the people because everybody in this congregation every ministry that preached here minister to you in a certain way praise the lord amen i i even know that uh i'm not my daughter's favorite preacher amen she says she says daddy why don't you never tell a story about yourself praise the lord now so so you see what happened is that that's that's word now if if the local church don't wisely deal with that you have people breaking into groups the people that love brother dan ministry gather the people that love brother joseph ministry gather the people that love jordan ministry gather the day he's preaching they are on fire because that's the main one and when you do that you are killing the church you are killing the church because you are completely connor praise the lord and i've not started preaching yet less than to our feet genesis chapter one verse 1 and 2. most of the time i just love to project my the quotes and add my personal note but uh there's a portion of my personal note in this that i will i would love to project just to be able to to to get things out there i wish i could have done it in the in the powerpoint manner and then it would not be a kind of a difficult thing for uh the technicians but i'm sure they can be able to handle it i've given them worse than this so genesis chapter 1. let's read verse 1 and 2. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was with how form and vowel and darkness was upon the face of the deep in the spirit of god move upon the face of the water praise the lord amen let's also read first corinthians chapter 14. first go into in chapter 14. praise the lord praise the lord first going to in chapter 14 uh i think i'm at the wrong place second green team uh let me be sure you oh man no no it's first quarantine not second corinthian okay okay i've got into mine got into yeah the second quarantine first covering team not second corinthians sorry sorry i was looking at the wrong place first corinthians chapter 14 let's just take verse 33 for god is not the altar of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints praise the lord and let's take the last verse let all things be done decently and in order let us pray heavenly father lord jesus lord uh we uh i've just calmed lord before you and uh we just pour in our house lord and talking about things that concern us lord as as a as a local church father we just want to pray you know god godfather what you are doing in our midst you know what you are doing with each and every one of us that father you have drawn to this local assembly by one way or the other father and we just want to commit ourselves in your hands we want to pray and say lord help us father and oh god we know that we are trusting that you will be able to position and replace us in help us love father get in in in in a little little simple way that we can put our shoulder to the wheels the things of god we can be able to do that will bring glory to you father we just ask that you bless the word now and uh bless what is on our heart to share with your children in jesus name we pray amen amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat we want to talk on the great intelligence of elohim praise the lord amen the great intelligence of elohim and uh as as i was as i was studying and looking into different things uh there is there is uh there is a documentary that two great scientists did and uh they did it a couple of years back it's called the privileged planet it's called a privileged planet and uh very very interesting i mean as they talk about earth if you can just put yourself in the place of earth as you listening to the documentary you will realize that that we are privileged to be here praise the lord we are privileged to be believers it's it's a privilege you know uh uh and and a lot of the things that that has that has opened to us is a privilege now so uh uh the the reason this uh subject caught my mind was some of the things that i have just spoke about you know uh spoke about it in this way but there are things that will help us as a local church to to come in order with the word praise the lord there are things that will help us to come in order with the word and and and one of the reason did is that there is this there is this uh idea that is you know that is is uh uh is in the minds of the people out there most especially you know the people that believe in all the different theories about creation than uh than the then god than the biblical theory or the biblical you know uh belief of creation and uh the people kind of a belief that you know everything of this word just happened randomly you know so there is there is a strong belief that that is in is is you know is in science it's behind the big bang theory and and all of that and and what and what they try to promote is you know things happen by chance praise the lord that things happen by change and for anything to happen by change and and it makes sense praise the lord amen or the way i want to say is that anything that makes sense shows that there is an intelligence behind it praise the lord anything that makes sense there is an intelligence behind it praise the lord so this is uh this is is called the a stream of of information i call it a stream of information in time but the you know the term a as the stream of information that when you when you even look at information you'll realize that the extreme opposite of information is what science called entropy which is information and no information praise the lord the extreme opposite of information is no information praise the lord so all of this other they have things been in order they have order and they also have this order praise the lord just follow me a little bit and they have noise which is the stream of signal and in my notes as i was as i was uh uh putting this together i i dropped a little thing that i say is uh the technicians are working on signal to noise ratio all they are doing in the back there as as they move those things they are trying to reduce the noise so to reduce the noise they got to get the right signal that this mark is not interfering with this other mark if they should put all the marks off this [Applause] it's just going to be a noise and you put your hands to your ears praise the lord amen well we sit down we follow the service and sometimes we get irritated when we get a little noise but you don't know the work that is being done back then it's an engineering term the signal to noise ratio is reducing the noise to get the right signal are we together you see what i'm coming to because it's it's right in the scripture it's right around our life that's what the holy spirit is doing there is there is a singer that is called the stay small voice that is coming to you but there are a lot of noise around you and what the holy spirit is trying to do is to put your life in tone so you can hear the voice of god and don't be distracted by the noise that is around you because we have a generation that believe facebook and google more than the bible so the opposite of noise the extreme opposite of noise is to get the right signal and then also this in music the opposite of music is cacophone cacophony which is just just uh uh like pause it uh sounding symbols just you know just just this all the noise and music as i was looking at the stream i saw this music is reading and reading is the parting of sound silence and emphasis the pattern of sound silence and emphasis praise the lord and then as you go down you realize that you have chaos and you have cosmos there they are also to a stream amen you have chaos and you have cosmos and you will see a little bit from that word cosmos that's where the word cosmetic was taken from cosmetic so actually what cosmetic you know implies here is bringing order out of chaos praise the lord amen amen that's what you know mark factor is all about brother brandon talks about it in marriage and divorce for the matter of fact it was what brother branham was talking about when he said saturn is her designer he was now talking about the intelligence behind the creation of the woman but he was talking about mark factor he was talking about how satan has designed a woman by cosmetic from her natural beauty that's what he was talking about are we together so mark factor is saying that we can bring an order to your chaos when you put all the let me now go there let me now go there praise the lord and then you also have randomness and you have design praise the lord when david said in the psalm i'm fearfully and wonderfully made he was talking about a design praise the lord and if you have a design you have an intelligence behind that design praise the lord somebody designed this shirt that i'm wearing there is an intelligence are we together amen so the so the creation of the word and and and you you see this this thought this teaching this idea of randomness and things happening by chance that's what has made you know uh uh our word the way it is that is it it's a software teaching praise the lord is a software teaching that is even in a lot of circular churches praise the lord they are they are hoping for change and luck but yet is termed like faith they are using the word faith but faith must have a solid ground to rest on which is the word of god [Music] they are not resting on the word of god but they say we believe god god can do it what they are doing is that they are looking for change hoping that it will happen somehow praise the lord are we together amen now so you will realize that it takes energy and design to make anything orderly it takes energy and design to make anything orderly praise the lord but the thing about it again keep that thought in your mind the thing about it when you look at it when you look at it closely you will also realize that this is a path that constantly move from the right order to this other a constantly move from the right to the left from other to chaos praise the lord let me let me give you an example amen simple you face your bed nicely you lay on it it does not remain nicely yes you wake up the next morning you have to fix it again praise the lord you clean up your garage or your storage or whatever it is with time it will go back to being this author are we together there is there is there is a concept that i want you to grab as i'm saying this look at genesis chapter 1. the scripture says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth genesis chapter 2 a move to chaos with time what god created moved to chaos praise the lord amen so you can see the concept that taught here is there it is only those things that are internal amen only the things that are in tanner do not go into chaos that's right praise the lord are we together are you are you grabbing the concept amen but i i've i think so but i don't feel it praise the lord i don't feel i'm trying to get a hold of your spirit maybe i did too much talking on you know deacons and pastors and all of that it make you you you stay thinking about those things but just forget about it let's get to the word yet amen praise the lord let's get to the word and and then you will get to see it and understand why i had to say those things that i just said one of the things that are intended praise the lord only the things that are intended when we when we said genesis chapter 1 i spoke about a year one wednesday night in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the beginning of anything is the foundation of it amen and the foundation of the word is in the mind of god praise the lord so in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth it was a perfect creation in god's mind praise the lord it was a perfect creation i mean he saw it he planned it last week we talked about looking at the big picture are we together amen now right between genesis chapter 1 and genesis chapter 2 something happen praise the lord amen something happened right between genesis chapter 1 and genesis chapter 2 as i the prophet or in the book of isaiah talks about uh uh uh lucifer being cast down when he grew in his heart and wanted to ascend himself above the truth of god it happened somewhere between genesis chapter one and genesis chapter two rules who have not come to the earth except there was one that was cursed are we together now we are talking about this formation you know this formation it is also like someone said we're talking about information if ashu says something to brother juan i said brother come let me tell you something and i tell him and he tell this brother and brother scared sister now man before it gets to brother lawrence we're going to completely lose the information we will completely lose it everybody going to say their own way and then when it gets heard it's never the same thing that was said so there is this question rolling into this other praise the lord there is this constant rolling into this order things keeps happening [Music] praise the lord amen you try to work on your prayer life and you stop praying and before you realize something going wrong on the other side again you got to get back and start working on it and and and and then something gets wrong before you take care of that then you no longer praying again then you have to go back and start working there is just this constant rolling into this other and trying to get back to other and it goes back to this other you see that's the reason why when the scripture says uh uh uh you know uh uh he that uh jesus said that in sin john have passed from death onto life amen and that we have received internal life praise the lord it's not a tag that we put on our chest i believe the lord jesus i have internal life amen internation is a const is a constant order praise the lord and if thou order has been breath in you praise the lord if thou order has been birthed in you that's why now it takes energy and design to keep anything in order that's what it takes now the believer coming and and and and and i mean like paul was saying he he he he's making his call in the election show he's striving to do right why because a sense of order has been breath in you but if you just take a church confession i believe jesus christ my lord and savior i've been you know i'm born again and has eternal life and then there is a constant dragging you down to to to smoke and drink there is not there is no fighting spirit in you if you don't have a fighting spirit then you need a breath you need a breath by the word of god because the breath of the world gives us a fighting spirit you keep fighting to keep some sense of order all your thoughts are scattered all over the place but you keep fighting to keep sanity praise the lord are we together oof glory be to god amen [Music] praise the lord the great intelligence of elohim see these trees that were just dry they all put in for their leaves you want to tell me they just happened randomly it just by chance they can put for their leaves there is an intelligence praise the lord among the millions of things that you could have done for you to wake up this morning and get into your closet and choose a clothes to work and come to the house of god not even knowing what the pastor is going to talk about there is some intelligence there is an intelligence praise the lord are we together solomon said something in the book of proverbs chapter 16. let me let me read that and then i can i can now try to run here with you praise the lord oh man lord be to god hallelujah proverbs 16. proverbs chapter 16 verse 33 solomon says something here he said the lord is cast into the lab but the whole disposition thereof is of the lord praise the lord the lord is cast into the lab that's where you deal with you deal with the argument of change but the whole disposition thereof is of the lord the way is going to turn out has already been determined has already been determined are we together let me read a little bit here so you will grab uh he says now now unity one god one church now in the beginning genesis which is the sea chapter of the bible we find that we find there that when god met a man he made him in a way that he knew that he was to be and he could never be anna any greater design than what he is and when he and when he began to make life he made it from the lowest life which is more or less uh appalling world the frog and on to the highest life is man which is in the image of god and then in this life man begin to achieve things when and but when he began he began to leave god out of the picture he began to have a selfish motive and when he did that he begin to think of something for himself and we find that it isn't long until he had corrupt the very planet that god had put him on praise the lord man wants a name of the first man that went to the moon but you never made the moon if you believe there is a moon that you can go on someone put away are we together it isn't long that man has corrupted that the planet that god put him on he he had got in such a condition till even his creator grief he grieved him at heart that he did ever amen praise the lord to move from such an order of being created in the image of god a man has reduced himself praise the lord now even things that you will not find in the animal kingdom praise the lord you find man and involved into it he has moved himself from being the highest form of life to the lowest form of life praise the lord that he even grieved god at his heart and in genesis the bible says and god grieved out his heart and said what i mean man glory be to god are we together amen now you think about it god made man a man god so worse better than what they have now but it was so worse that he grieved god at his heart he said his spirit will no longer strive with man praise the lord and because of that god brought a judgment on the entire earth praise the lord now if god did not have a purpose for creation it would have been easy for him to just wrap the whole thing up trash it away stay as an internal god stay as he as as he have always been but because he had a purpose praise the lord he george the earth he condemned the wicked save noah in his household and yet the bible tells us genesis chapter 12 and god found favor with a man called abraham that showed that he had a purpose that even the wickedness of man could not stop his purpose the wickedness of man could not change his mind praise the lord amen oh that's why david said the lord has set his love upon me when god has places love upon you do whatever you want to do you will just build enough regret for yourself you can imagine how god fed when he's seen the very creature that he have made in his image and he have given dominion and how that he made him to do something for him and yet he turned all of his strength and his power over to selfish desire and achievement selfish desire and achievement praise the lord we want to make a name praise the lord for our you see it is the man that makes the toyota vehicle that caused a toyota the honda that caused it to honda man want to make a name for himself when he never created himself god was the one that make man that's why he could tell david i'll give you a name i faction you i will give you a name we know what it is it's more than the just a natural name called david praise the lord amen are we together glory be to god so we we we're trying to look at this great design brother branham over here in uh true sign that's been overlooked he says i was speaking to a doctor at the hospital he was talking about how great science has worked and the different matters of the body and and and the medicine he says and see why it will kill a certain gems and save you know the gem of life i said that's wonderful you know i listened to him for a while but i said doctor that's good i appreciate that that's fine i certainly am thankful to god for that but look you are spending all your life on trying to find something on a creation but why not sometimes think who created it [Music] why not think who created it praise the lord amen all our problems and things that i mean we worried about you know is is i mean what what we will become or we want to become or what we want to achieve and what we want to do that's that's what we think about but if you just said the thing about the one that have created me what is his thought about me as he sits on his throne what is he thinking about me what is he thinking about me what he has in his mind that he had to wake me up this morning praise the lord i challenge you when you get thinking about the creator the circumstances of life around you what means nothing to you praise the lord see that's how joshua and caleb overcame the giants that's how they overcame the wrong testimony because they were not looking at the giants in the land they were looking at the promise they were looking at a god that have said i have given you the land so because they were looking at the promise the situation becomes smaller in the eyes when you think about a great god there is no situation will overwhelm you not even a health condition not even the point of death death will never become fearful to you [Music] praise the lord that's why those old testament scenes all are the martials through the ages when they were fair to lions and and women burned to the stake all the hard on their mind the next meaning i'll be in the presence of my maker so even the flame does not fear because your mind is so occupied the next million i will be before his throne and say lord yeah praise the lord we sing the song oh i want to see him you really don't want to see him you really do want to see him praise the lord then stop complaining because your trial is just drawing you close to see him oh i want to see him look upon his face praise the lord amen how am i why not think about the the one that created it who made it who's the designer of it god is the designer praise the lord amen god is dear designer praise the lord glory be to god i think all all these uh faction designers clothes designers you know they were all smarter in the beginning now they get they're losing their mind anyway praise the lord because when they design the clothes they put the name of the designer in a hidden place praise the lord amen who is the designer god is the designer how much greater is the creator than the creation praise the lord amen are we together so you see the thing the thing did is that the thing i'm trying to drive to you brother bam said in conference here so there's nothing out of time everything is taking just exactly that calling to the great god's great master time see this is only this owner displayed his attribute to select his children who really love him and believe him now when i read this last night i paused i got it it kind of forced me in a way and uh i thought i said well okay i'll drop this in my note if i get to it okay but you see brother branham here he's also talking about how you know he says that over and over uh i mean uh you know some other coach here he says he says he says nothing is out of cater praise the lord amen with god nothing is out of cater now that is the proof that god is out of our time space praise the lord he's out of our time space that's the reason why children you cannot put time on god because god is out of our time space praise the lord he has determined everything he drops down into time and he goes out of time that's why he knows the aim from the beginning he's out of our time space are we together praise the lord all of these things will bring us back to our message on on on speed but let's let's let's go a little bit here he says there is nothing out of time god is never late he's never late there is nothing out of time everything is taken just exactly according to his great master time amen his great timepiece and this is only displaying this owner display his attribute to select his children listen to that god will create a trial he will allow things to happen to to you in your life and it almost looks like you can never see light at the end of the tunnel i never know when i'm going to get out of this but you see in his great design he designed it like that because that is a way that he can relate to his attributes you are so tired but yeah there is some internal substance in you keep making you to trust god it makes you to wait maybe the next day maybe the next week maybe you it just keeps driving you but just like abraham and sarah the loose strain in your physical body but the bible said he struggled not at the promise of god that was his fate it was an intense substance that was dragging that 100 years old body to still believe god to be the father of many nations that's the way that god select his attributes praise the lord that's why uh uh peter taught in this episode that if we cannot stand trials and trusting it means that we are not his own we are bastard children and you see god do not discipline the devil's children god discipline his children praise the lord because character don't go to hell [Music] have you ever thought when brother branham says uh if god sent me to hell i would still love him that's a strong statement because character don't go to hell god don't throw a character away his great masterpiece timepiece this is the only display his attributes to select his children who really love him and believe him that's the way praise the lord he prolonged a little bit honor honor the redemption story of boras and now me and roof there was an all-past yeah buff said we were going with you ruth said no my children go back election election that's how god elect his children go go back no we will go with you we love you go back they talk about it and they talk about it and talking as the time went on if i start to reason yeah i think i can stay here my parents are here in my family a year she starts to step back a little bit that's the reason why the scripture says he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved he that endureth yes endurance is an attribute of election there is nothing out of order everything running perfect that's my new bomba sticker i just drop it just so i can be able to print it and put on my car glory be to god are we together many times we think many times we get nervous christ identify the same and we begin to think well it ought to be this way and we have got to make it this way and make it that way we don't have nothing to do in it just play out our path that he leads us to play remember there is nothing out of cater the great unimportant god knows he knows the great man of god praise the lord amen he's not learning we have to know that god is not learning i had to remind someone that yesterday that god is not learning brother he's now learning it's not happening by surprise amen glory be to god that's the reason why we have to we have to trust the lord i mean in everything that we do because god is now learning there's nothing out of cater with god praise the lord amen the great unimportant god knows just exactly before the foundation of the word that we will sit here tonight or this morning he's infinite he has told so he can be infinite without knowing all things that's a god we have to do with the great intelligence of elohim i was also looking at something on the dna code the code of design in our dna praise the lord amen that's one of the calls that that that constantly blow the minds of scientists i mean it blows the mind of scientists because because of the order the other that is seen in the dna code amen praise the lord to just believe that the sun comes up in the morning it goes down it comes up in in in the next morning just to see that form of order then you say it's randomness praise the lord amen but yeah we will have faith in an invention of a vehicle where nobody would drive and we all look into uh a vehicle that can move us and we just sit back there and and put in you know the the the address and it will take us we are looking forward to that praise the lord because we can say it it's tesla that made it it's a u.s brand it's yeah and and all of that and then we look at the great design that is around us the great design that is around us that is even in our life i never added things of the dna code to this because my mind was going in another direction but we'll talk about it a little bit i'll bring i'll just bring a little portion to you to see the the beauty that is in it yes how almighty god design us praise the lord for us to be here and be the people that we are there's a great intelligence that is behind our life it's a great intelligence that is behind our life think about this go with all of his knowledge and everything that he knows nor in the end in the beginning praise the lord this this is the thing this is the thing that keeps stumbling the word amen with all of his knowledge and yet god will sit on his throne and allow you to make choices and he will not get himself involved oh man he will allow you to make choices oh he has the power to step right in there and say no don't go there my son but he will allow you to make choices i've i've prayed the lord had led me the lord spoke to me the lord revealed to me i prayed oh lord i'm convinced i'm convinced and sometimes when they're in those gear you can't stop them their mind is made up their mind is made up they have their scriptures lineup they have their quotation lineup glory be to god amen praise god amen almighty god amen but he will subject himself to his own lord he will subject himself to his own lord and he can break his lord why because he have given you free moral agency so he cannot break that lord he would just sit and look at you and look at you as you go alone praise the lord and in his great design the things that he have ordained to be able to work on your spirit man will start happening in his great design praise the lord he used to sir oh jesus i really prayed i trusted you he said yeah you trusted me why are this happening to me it was part of the plan [Music] what what an intelligence what an intelligence just trust a man with a little understanding he's so anxious his body is shaking to tell everybody what he had discovered he's looking for the opportunity to talk and as soon as you give it to him he ready to display you know you see and they said and you just go on it's just a little idea he have ha on the subject and he goes demonstrating and talk this girl with all wisdom he subject himself to his own lord yes amen but nothing is out of cater with him nothing is out of cater everything is right on time glory be to god even though he has everything on time he had everything rightly planned but yet he do not sleep he do not slumber [Laughter] glory be to god he do not sleep he doing that slumber her eyes move toe and further throughout all the earth to make sure the things that he have ordained are coming to pass amen amen praise the lord praise the lord like brother graham says before we got here god made choices for us he made choices which family will be born in which year we will be born which month we will be born it was all god's choices whether we would be male and female they were all god's choices praise the lord amen before they discover that they were not male they're supposed to be female god made a choice he make choices for us praise the lord he never allowed us to have homes make us to have hair on our head it was his choice glory be to god and when he made those choices when we first discovered the choices that god made we loved him until we started learning otherwise praise the lord we always love our parents i mean whether whether they could provide for us or they could improve our we never ask them for their bank account but we love them when we started coming to consciousness everything that god the choices that he made we love it until otherwise maybe until we went to school and the teacher started teaching us something different how do until we saw the neighbors and we think that they are living better than us or maybe we watch a movie and then we start having consideration on the choices that he made something has happened then we start asking questions then we start challenging him praise the lord that's what brother branham said then we took the mata from god's hand and think i can make a better choice for myself out of selfish motive we wreck our own life yes praise the lord by not constantly appreciating the choices that he made but not constantly appreciating whether i understand it or not what i love it or not but thank you jesus thank you jesus by now constantly appreciating the choices that he made we took mata into our own hands are we together let me read one more quote here and then we came close where brandon said be on the curtain beyond the cam he says and jesus march every prophecy every design jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the nil he marched everything and let me say this with godly fear and respect but love and sincerity ignoring where i'm standing the message of the hour as much everything the bible spoke of for this hour the message of the hour has marched everything that god spoke of for this hour that we are living in that goes to show there's a great intelligence the fair place to take a kentucky man a great intelligence fair place to take a man of a humble a shameful birth father that was a drunk a murderer but god in his great intelligence praise the lord amen god has given us a word if the great intelligence of god has march everything in our age and send us a message to address those things let me tell you things will only be addressed in our lives and in our home when we fall in love with the word of god when we fall in love with the message of the hour you can love brother branham get his cap get his belt put his picture from the cabin he was born to his storm all around your house if you are not submitting yourself none of that will change you it will never change your nature because he said it would be those revealed mystery truth that will literally change our body those divine mystery truths praise the lord that's that's the reason why as long as i remain your brother i point you to the message of the hour [Music] i point you to the voice of malachi 4. that's my emphasis i mean you can judge me whichever way you want praise the lord i saw the heartbreaking video the other day i was so tuned in my spirit i cried i just said oh god i want to what would that prophet of god date a couple went down to the branham tabernacle to get married and choose that brother branham would do their wedding and the deacon comes and says well you know what and and talk to the people a little bit now we turn the marriage ceremony over to brother branham they had to put a tape on and the thing about it there the couple don't speak english so you can just see the disorder and somebody is trying to interpret the uh uh what brother brand okay impossible what is that what is that he would turn around in his grave he would love from the curtains and turn his face and you think you're giving honor to brother branham when you do that you think you love brother branham when you do that i want brother branham to do my wedding praise the lord i mean a lot of things i could go into it that's that's just enough this morning amen that just enough this morning but all i'm trying to tell you there's a great intelligence praise the lord even as we stayed here as a local church i believe there is an intelligence behind this body praise the lord amen when it was time for i mean the brothers here could have choose brother scat brothers steve and the rest of them they could have just choose close this place down sell the building you know and everybody can go and find a different place but in god's great mind he saw you and myself sitting in this building praise the lord in his great intelligence he saw you here he saw the church being birthed he saw the new generation he saw the people that will be on fire for god praise the lord that's the reason why we advise you if you don't agree with the things we do pray for us because it's not by just human reasoning we do the things that we do we are relying on his great intelligence so the best that we know how maybe that best is not sufficient for you praise the lord with your help and prayer we might get there but you see that's that's that's what time provides for us that's what time provides for us there is another on this side there is there is another extreme of this other on this side and as long as we stay in time that's the fight that we have to fight to keep things together keep the spirit of love keep the spirit of unity keep the word among the people and as hard as you preach the people will keep straightening from the word and then you can sit down there and say so yeah you know this and and it's just a canary brain poor reasoning there are a lot of things that is happening far beyond your spears that you can understand that's what the new birth brings to us it brings a fighting spirit the new birth bring a fighting spirit you don't get discouraged you don't throw in the towel because things are getting worse you get out on your knees you pray the more things get worse the more you press aim the more you serve god the more you love god a new birth breaks fighting spirit musicians you can come um [Music] let's buy our hands together [Music] trouble foundations [Music] in the presence all of the kings yes in
