praise you too your grace and your mercy has brought in trth the Lord bless you thank you music thank you brother digs for jumping in there amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you richly go to be in the house of the Lord you may have your seat for the while I sang that song that quot that verse just now because early this morning I was uh uh looking through my notes good to have you brother uh Andrew and wife hope you people had a wonderful travel praise the Lord amen and uh uh we greeted brother DS on Wednesday he's there with brother uh willing ning in in uh yes he's back back day yes no no no I'm calling your pastor yeah yeah he's there with brother Willi nland there in Liberia so uh it's good to have him with us and and also brother Afra back there Freddy you are not stranger here though so praise the Lord you know some people like the stranger feeling so they stay away and then then when they come then we greet them praise the lord well you not stranger amen like like I was saying I was studying this morning uh uh what we want to talk about and then I break into this grace and mercy than and uh uh uh I break into the grace and mercy thing and then it kind of for really captur me this morning really spoke to me in a personal way and uh uh and I think uh you know it looks uh it's it's sometimes it become very common to us that we don't really realize uh you know what grace and mercy means to Us Praise the Lord so before we go into our subject this morning I just share with you my uh what was part of my morning meditation now so uh uh uh in the message the oncoming storm uh this this this was a quote that I remember many years ago there's a brother that was preaching for us and he said this I've read it saw it and never really uh I never got a hold of it like the way he said it but then it it kind of throw much light on the subject the thing surprises me is the grace of God I said I have exhausted his Mercy many times but I never can exhaust his grace and I'm so glad of that praise the Lord and the first thing that comes to my mind is because God's Mercy is renewed every every morning amen so definitely we all exhaust his mercy so he got to bring a brand new one every day praise the Lord uh uh the scripture said in the in the book of lamentation this I recall lamentation CH 3: 21 this I recall to my mind therefore have our hope it is of the Lord's Mercy that we are not consumed because his compassion fth not they are new every morning and new every morning great is his faithfulness praise the Lord amen so when you really look at Mercy and Grace they are they looks like identical twins but yet they have they have uh they have some differences Mercy is God not punishing us for our saints that we deserve praise the Lord amen we deserve to be punished but he's not punishing us amen like David said in the psalm he has not dealt with me according to my transgression praise the Lord so that's God's mercy and his grace is God's blessing us desper we don't deserve it amen is uh an unmerited favor so he's blessing us we don't deserve his Blessing but he's blessing us praise the Lord and what we deserve he's not giving it to us what we deserve for our wrong he's not giving it to us God's not giving us what our wrong deserve that is his Mercy but he gave us what we don't deserve and that's his grace Mercy is deliverance from judgment Grace is extending kindness to their unworthy every day we live is an act of God's mercy if he give if he give us all we deserve we would not live another day and Grace is anything in everything we receive by his Mercy anything in everything we receive by his Mercy praise the Lord then I also look into the thought of Sovereign Grace God's Sovereign Grace is to all mankind regardless of their spiritual standing praise the Lord so God is Sovereign in his sovereignty he give Grace to every one of us to give Grace to every living creature but that's different from his Saving Grace his Sovereign Grace is different from his saving grace even though in his Saving Grace there's an act of sovereignty but his Saving Grace is a special unmerited divine assistance for regeneration and sanctification the the grace that is giv us to be able to pick up ourself and say I'm going to church a Saving Grace praise the Lord because not not many can do it amen even though everyone have his Sovereign Grace life is given to them but not many make that choice of coming to the house of the Lord to appreciate him for the grace that that is given to them praise the Lord in Hebrew 4:16 Hebrews 4:16 Paul said and we want to quote then we can go into what we want to share with you this morning let us therefore come bed onto the throne of grace praise the Lord let's come boldly onto the throne of grace because we will meet God's favor there amen praise the Lord when we come boldly to the throne of grace we're surely going to meet the grace of God we're not going to meet judgment there we will meet God's favor let's let's therefore come Bolding onto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need praise the Lord so you see how grace and mercy Works hand in hand praise the Lord is by the grace of God that we are not condemned and that's Mercy because God is not dealing with us according to all we deserve praise the Lord so Mercy is God not giving you all you deserve for your wrong and his grace is desper you are wrong he still love you let's stand to our feet this morning turn to the word of God praise the Lord his grace and mercy has brought us through amen let's go to St John St John chapter 4 no that would not be St John chapter 4 that should be wrong that should be Matthew chapter 4 I said in my notes in John chapter 4 that's not in John chapter 4 s John chapter 4 should be the woman at the well Matthew chapter 4 Matthew chapter 4 is Jesus Temptation in the wilderness praise the Lord Matthew chapter 4 we read from verse one then was Jesus led up led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 night he was afterward and hungry and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread and he answered and said can we read that together it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God Amen St John chapter 6 that's where our our inspiration is coming from this morning men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God you go in the book of Deuteronomy you realize that Moses said that uh you read chapter 8 but we want to read uh St John chapter 6 we read this on Sunday evening uh um during the communion but we want to take it into our subject now this morning it's in John chapter 6 let's read from verse 31 Our Father did eat Manor in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then said then Jesus said unto them verily verily I said unto you Moses give you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the word then said they unto him Lord for forever more give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst praise the Lord let's pray together father in the name of Jesus Christ we have just read your written word we want to thank you and God ask this morning Lord that you will just bring a special blessing father father Lord God for us this morning each and every one of us Lord we want to pray that Lord God you would just you will set us aside Lord God and speak through us this morning let Faith be created in the building Lord God where the word can have the preeminence Lord Jesus oh Father God May every interfering Spirit Lord TS on our mind we want to bring it Lord subject to the Holy Ghost this morning and we pray that father God you would just bless us in your presence now in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat thank you thank you that's that's just uh our little weight of uh honoring the word when we read it it's our salute to the word now now uh this morning title what I want to speak on the tree of life in plain view uh couple of weeks ago we were we were down in New Jersey uh speaking for brother Kenneth and his group there and I preaching this year uh take the book and eat it so that's what I was speaking on and then after the service uh he said uh you know closing the service he says wow you know uh uh the brother brought a treat of life in plain view so I said well that's a good title I will change my title now the treade of life in plain view so that's that's what I title what I want to speak on but it's a continuation from take the book in edat it Genesis chapter 2 if we would just we just quickly do a review here Genesis chapter 2 that was that was where uh our subject started from in verse 8 Genesis 2 verse 8 and9 we Genesis 2: 8 and9 and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life was in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge good and evil now you remember that's when we were trying to uh show how the tree of knowledge over time overshadow the Tree of Life praise the Lord because what you talk about over and over it has a way of overshadowing your mind praise the Lord amen so the tree of life was in the midst in the middle of the garden and uh and and and in the midst of all the other tree now and and when we look at that word Miss also uh we we try to uh bring our thoughts to the place to understand that uh the word Miss means the middle but also something that is in the middle uh could also mean something that we all gravitate around praise the Lord amen uh uh uh if we if we if we want to take uh an example we can use uh uh a leader a CEO he's in the middle of the company because everything gravity even though he's not the one on the field but you know everything has to pass through him praise the Lord so uh uh the the the Mist the middle of uh of the Garden of Eden or the position of the treat of Life uh is uh it could be a geological position but what I want to bring out of it is in the place there it was the tree of life so it sustained everything that live in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord everything in the Garden of Eden survived on the tree of life so the tree of life being in the midst amen Jesus is in our mid he's in the middle of our life he's the center of our joy like we sing he's the center of our joy is it means that everything that bring joyness and gladness and everything about our life rotates around him are we together that's where we want to go with this talk this morning now so we look at there together the treat of life in the midst of the guing and the treat of knowledge and good and evil was also there praise the Lord and then we look at verse 16 and 17 uh um in the same chapter 26- 17 the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree listen to this now this is the first commandment that was ever given to Men of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat but of the treat of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou sh shall not eat for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die praise the Lord I Hope You Hear the Commandment clearly amen then we go to Genesis chapter 3 verse uh uh uh we go uh uh chapter 3 verse one let's let's take verse one now the serpent was more subti than any beast of the field which the Lord has made and he said unto the woman yeah have God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the the the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden now that's where that's where we were trying to get the focus that's word everything is misplaced here because the tree that was in the midst of the garden was the tree of life amen the tree that God told them not to eat us was the tree of knowledge good and evil it was not what was identify as being in the midst praise the Lord but yeah yeah Eve is saying we can eat of every tree but the tree that is in the midst he said we should not eat so the the the the the thought year is there the uh uh over and over the the the the devil has been able to to to to move the tree of knowledge in the middle praise the Lord amen it's it's almost like the way the devil does it with you know there are a lot of things that is going on in our life and and we wake up in the morning and you I mean we have all but if there is a major problem if there is a take for example what he like to use an illness if there is a sickness in a family it becomes the major talk we talk about the prescription we talk about the doct of visit we talk about oh I I also read this I heard the news about and that's what we talk what what he doing is that he brings that little problem and he overshadow every other thing in the house that's the only thing we talk about it does not means that you know uh uh we all going to die tomorrow it does not means that I mean nothing good else is happening but Satan has a word of bringing the ugly thing and he Amplified and he spread it out and and now that's the only thing we talk about that's the only thing that is taking our energy and we realize that that's what he did here because the word of God is clear is written right there he says every fruit that is Pleasant thou might eat it talks about a treat of life in the mid in the middle verse 16 and 17 and he then he gives them the Commandment don't eat of the tree of knowledge good and evil now here in in chapter three we realize there the when when he confront the woman and and the way that he throw the question on the woman he he knows how our mind runs praise the Lord he knows how our mind runs and if he want to set upset you he knows exactly what to do praise the Lord he knows exactly what to do to give you a miserable day well that's that's that's the person he is okay that's the person he is I mean he's he's not having no good plan for nobody praise the Lord amen you ever look in his bag saw him carrying any good thing even the ones that look good it's just a tribe to make you miserable praise the Lord so we so we came traveling down that road now where we want to go uh uh today is there uh uh he got them to eat he he overshadowed the treat of life and now cut uh Eve in this thought process that uh uh we may eat of every treat in the garden but of the fruit of the of the tree which is in in the midst of the garden God have said ye shall not eat it neither shall you touch it least you die he he have already got in E praise the Lord amen if you take the word of God from your life the devil has got you praise the Lord that I mean that's that just what it is no matter how how smart how educated you are take the word of God for your life that's what Jesus said men shall live not by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God that's what we want to talk about this morning so he has already got there them to the place and and and I mean there was he has he he has taken her defense you know he have taken her protection away so yeah she's vulnerable because now she can see the treat of life and this treat of knowledge good of evil God said the day you eat of it that day you will die so that was the treat of death now so uh uh and and the four came and the B will tell us let's go to in chapter 3 and uh uh the last two verse in chapter 3 verse 23 the Bible says therefore the Lord God sent him sent man Adam forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubin praise the Lord and a flaming SWR which turned every way to keep the weight of the treat of life now that the tree of life was overshadowed God now put cherubins to be able to guide the Tree of Life praise the Lord amen the Bible says they were placed there to keep the way of the treat of life to be able to guide to become a protector now because now the the the devil now has uh has uh has overshadowed the treat of life he has he has uh uh uh put this tree of knowledge on the minds of Adam and his wife and and not too too long they will see King killing Abel death would now starts to enter in the family death would now starts to enter into the hemay and things will just go on from there to where we are but with the treat of Life the treat of life is our Focus amen the treat of life because what it is in the center it must be in the center of our home the Tree of Life must be in the center of our family it must be in the center of this church amen praise the lord we must keep the treat of life in the Center meaning that everything we do must revolve around the tree of life if we want to live are we together so our focus is the treat of life and yeah we see the treat of life now is now protected with cherubins protected with angels that have flaming swore praise the Lord at one time it was there it was it was h h h accessible to us Adam could run to the tree of life you see that's the reason why he was not experiencing hunger sickness nothing because he was feeding from the treat of Life the treat of life was was uh I mean he was he was running everything through the treat of Life are we together praise the Lord now the treat of life is protected they are cherubin with flaming sword turning every way to keep the weight of the treat of life that man would not bring his sinful hands he will not just jump from the bed of sin and jump to the Tree of Life praise the Lord amen God is now requiring him to come through the bleeding skin because God provided a bleeding skin for Adam and his and and his wife God is now requiring him to come through some kind of atonement he cannot just jump from the bed of sin right into the church and that's the thing that is happening in our our our our generation Merced has been abused the grace of God is made a disgrace where we think the grace of God is just enough for us to run right from the bed of sin into the presence of God we are tramping over the blood that atone for us are we together so we see here because God will not allow him to do that so he put a cherub in there now with flaming sword to protect the treat of life we never needed to send a prayer request for for illnesses in our body but we have to now send prayer request we have to pray father please touch our brother father please heal our sister why because there's a there's a cherubin there with flaming sword are we are we together amen so so we we we like I said the treat of life is our Focus because we we realize that Jesus here is talking about the bread of life he is the bread of life then that bread must come from the treat of life so the treat of life is our focus and that's where we want to look to now now so this treat of life you will realize how over the the ages as You Follow the the the progression of the word of God and you follow the things that God is doing you will realize that uh uh this tree of life was a spiritual treat and it it starts to take a you know it starts to take a spiritual form as the ages went back I will explain that as as we go ahead praise the Lord amen now to be able to bring this to be able to bring this you will realize there the Bible speaks about the the the treat of life being protected by cherubin we will not hear about cherubin again until Moses we go on top of the mountain and uh uh uh and God was Will instruct him to build a tabernacle praise the Lord amen and then when Moses will come down to build the Tabernacle he will build the the Ark of the Covenant and uh uh come on Emmanuel go in office right under the light you will see a small now uh God will instruct Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant and on top of the Ark of the Covenant God would tell Moses to build the very same God that told Moses not to build no graving image he was not to build an image of anything but here is God will instruct Moses to build an image of two cherubin and they should be made of gold and they must be set right on top of the Ark of the Covenant praise the Lord now when you really look at this thank you I have a small one here when you really look at this if the Lord help us it would be very beautiful this this is the Arc of the Covenant is the is the whole is the whole thinking that that uh uh you know someone made just in type of what Moses was instructed to me and uh uh the act of the Covenant was made of two parts in a general sense it's called the act of the Covenant but the cover is called The Mercy Seat now so The Mercy Seat is right here this is The Mercy Seat this middle right here in here that's the mercy seat so in the way that is made is that the Angels the angels as as the Flop their wings like this these two Wings touch so it makes an entrance there so this place is The Mercy Seat so we have the Ark of the Covenant praise the lord we have the AR of the Covenant and then we we have The Mercy Seat sometimes and many times we take all to be the same praise the Lord but they all have their road if we have uh if the Lord bless our talk this morning we look into it so now upon this act of the Covenant that's when God would tell Moses to build two angels because remember now he's building the Tabernacle according to what God show him on the mountain that's the reason why he had the 40 days there so Moses would come down and instruct the children of Israel to build everything build the Ark of the Covenant and build two cherup and set it on the Ark of the Covenant now that's when cherubin will return so it gives us an idea that cherubin that were protecting the tree of life has now moved to protect because in the Ark of the Covenant was where the Ten Commandments were kept are we together amen so the the the treat of life was to give life to them just like how the Commandments of God is to give life to us are we together praise the Lord amen so so what what are we what are we saying what where are we going the tree of life has progress it's no longer a natural ual tree for the father it was a spiritual tree are we together and now we seeing that God is instructing his Prophet the same thing he did in Eden he's instructing his Prophet to do the same take two cherubin building on the lead of the of the of the Arc of the Covenant and it it should cover which mean you will have to pass the the cherubin to get to the Commandments just like you have to pass the cherubin to get to the Tree of Life are we together amen so it's it's beautiful it's beautiful as the Lord will will help us to see as the Lord will help us to see it because when you look in the you look in the scripture oh God help me this morning amen you know as I as I was as I was looking at this and studying yesterday that I just it it just it was just so beautiful to me that God put Mercy above his word this is The Mercy Seat Mercy is above the Lord he Mercy endure forever we don't know what we have we really don't know God's mercy we abuse it we really don't know what we have he put Mercy above his Lord like brother Braham says he says God he will put barale before the sinner to stop him but the nature of seeing a man what makes him to jump over it go under it run around it are we together he put Merced above the Lord It's A Beautiful Thing Paul quoted Moses in Romans 9:15 he says I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy praise the Lord amen I will have mercy you just think about it this the this this this very thought this was God talking to Moses traveling with those stubborn people in the wilderness with all the trouble they were giving him praise the Lord one time God says I will WEP then Moses says no Lord don't do it praise the Lord he came back and said God I think you should do it now God said no you say I shouldn't do it praise the Lord that's that just how much trouble we give the Lord amen Paul quoted Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy the I can the mercy seed are two separate things in scripture I want for us to look at that a little bit because it will bring it bring a it bring a whole lot of light to our subject as we go into it the AR and the mercy seed are two separate things the holiest of hly was was defined by the presence of The Mercy Seat praise the Lord amen the holiest of Hol was defined by the presence of The Mercy Seat let's look at Numbers Chapter 7 let's do a quick uh uh let's do a quick scripture run here and see if uh we can be able to get through it Numbers Chapter 7 Numbers chapter 7: 89 and Moses and when Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard a voice of one Speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the AR of the testimony when he heard the voice it was not coming from in the ark the voice was coming from where it was coming from The Mercy Seat praise the Lord it was coming from The Mercy Seat he heard a voice speaking unto him from all the mercy seat that was upon the ey of the testimony from between the two cherubin and he speak unto him amen are we together let's look at 1 Chronicles chapter 28 1 Chronicles chapter 28 praise the Lord 1 Chronicle 28 11 1 Chronicle 201811 then David gave to Solomon his son the pting of the porch and of the house thereof and of the treasury thereof and of the upper chamber thereof and of the Ender P thereof and of the place of The Mercy Seat praise the Lord uh can I remember why I pull this here okay that's one of them if it comes to my mind I will I will I will fall back to that uh uh Leviticus chapter 16 Leviticus 16 verse1 15 Leviticus 16 verse1 15 if I remember why I put that there I will come back to it then shall he kill the goat of of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with the blood as he did with the blood of the bulock amen and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat praise the Lord but you have to remember now The Mercy Seat is sitting on the Ark of the Covenant but God is being precise he's being precise and there is a reason are we together praise the Lord sprinkle The Blood On The Mercy Seat and before the mercy seat let me leave it there and uh we will we will let's let's also look at U having another another uh verse here Ezekiel chapter 43 Ezekiel 43 then we will look at something in uh in in uh Jeremiah but Ezekiel 43 the prophet Ezekiel Ezekiel 43: 6 okay I know where I know why I put this here I know what I put this here okay let's let's just look at Jeremiah this will take take me take us through another long route but let's look at Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 16 Ezekiel will take us he's a prophet after the Aire he will take us back to the asire so let's just look at Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 3 Jeremiah chapter 3: 16 okay they have it up there and it shall come to pass when ye be multiply and increase in the land in those days thus sayth the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done anymore let's read the next verse at that time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord now now you can look at this prophecy in two different ways but Jeremiah is talking about a period of time where the ACT will not be mentioned anymore amen but there will not be a time where The Mercy Seat will not be mentioned are we together are you see in the picture his mentioning of a time where the ACT will not be mentioned praise the Lord but there will not be a time where we will not meas The Mercy Seat are we together so that's that was what I wanted to grab your mind on now so when you when when you look at all of that you realize that uh it is the mercy of God that is keeping us here praise the Lord amen is the mercy of God God in his mercy so you see the uh uh you know when you when you when you really look at that and you you think about the the TR of of of uh of of Mercy message in the in the Revelation series you know talking about The Mercy Seat changing position and now The Mercy Seat one time was in a man the Lord Jesus you know he was the one that blind bimus cried and Son of David have mercy on me and now The Mercy Seat you know through the the atonement is now in the house of the believer and you realize uh you know what what uh you know uh uh a responsibility you know what a responsib ibility you know that that we have I won't go in that direction this morning but it is just to be able to grab our mind because like I said the cherubin is our Focus the treat of life is our Focus praise the Lord okay so the treat of life that was protected by cherubin now under Moses dispensation is now protected by cherubin but it's now on the uh uh two tablet of Stones amen and he was the one that that that that said that in uh Deuteronomy chapter 8 men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so the word of God is all is is always protected amen the cherubin are there to protect the word and that's the reason why God raised up men in the ages to be able to protect his word amen to carry on his word now so if you look also you will see there this is what I want to get to if you look also you will see that in Isaiah Ezekiel and Revelation the the the cherubin took on identity amen the Cherub being they took on identity they were identified as a lion as a ox as a man and as an eagle the chuban took on the face of this creature let's look at Ezekiel chapter 1 verse 10 let's look at Ezekiel chapter 1 verse 10 yeah Ezekiel 1 ver that's what I said Ezekiel chapter 1 verse 10 praise the Lord am I making you sleepy okay now he talks about the chuban year when you read you you will see him talking about the CH but let's let's look at verse 10 as for the likeness of their faces therefore have the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they for her the face of an ox on the left side and they and and uh and and uh no therefore also had the face of an eagle now it talks about the left side the right side so the first phase was the front side and the back side praise the Lord when you read this it's easy to think that each one of them have four faces no I think we we kind of uh demonstrated the idea the last time with with four of the brothers now so if it is the face of a man they all take that identity so when they move they are now moving in separate Direction they all move together praise the Lord amen they all move together if it's the face of the man they all take the face of the man all the strength of the Beast get behind there and defend the church or defend the act of the Covenant if they are going this way and they take the face of an ego every one of them is identified with that Faith so they don't it's not that one have full face no they don't go in separate ways they move in One Direction and when they are moving whatever identity is there if it is the lion they will all be honor that anointing of the lion I we together is the picture out praise the Lord if it's not clear to you you tell us we will develop it more we will develop it we can show more light on it now the reason why I'm bringing this is there you look in Ezekiel chapter 10:14 you will see more identification of that Revelation 4:7 gave us more identification of that now these are the very same cherubin that was in the of Eden praise the Lord these are the very same cherubin that God told Moses to put on the Ark of the Covenant but here it was in an image form praise the Lord amen but which mean the presence of the of the of the cherubin was symbolic by this gold image but the presence was there are we together and here and here Ezekiel is seeing the same thing uh asaiah saw the same thing after Urias died when he went into the temple he saw the chuban they were moving so fast and he says their train filled the temple while their wings were so locked together that they were moving in such a speed that he he he took it as a train just like the train bucket is join one to one to another and is moving their speed that was how Isaiah saw it when he said their train filled the temple it was the same cherubin with their wings all locked together are we together Ezekiel Saw the same thing John saw the same thing over in the Book of Revelation praise the Lord now so the cherubin as much as they are there to guide us back to the Tree of Life the the their position is the a person that is guiding you is also influencing you amen their position is a position of influence they are there to influence us are we together amen so you will realize there is a lot of responsibility upon the ministry because the ministry is playing their role in a little sense our position is to guide you to the treat of Life praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why uh uh can you imagine that God will give a man a burden and and and uh you know it was it will I mean uh uh uh he wake up and everything he does is he he he just he just have the people on his mind praise the lord it's a blessing to have somebody that will pray for you amen somebody that can be able to be there to listen if you want to talk praise the Lord but that's the way it is praise the Lord I don't want to lose my trend of thought here now so remember now the the the the the Adam and Eve were supposed to eat of the treat of life amen it was in the middle of the guiding now the the the cherubin are there to guide him back to do that same thing and now these cherubin now are taking on identity under which they are going to in influence the people back into the presence of God hallelujah now of all of these all of all of these uh cherubin if you look at them the the man the ox The Lion and the eagle if you look at their natural eating habits if you look at their natural eating uh H how can I call it the way they were brought up you will realize realized that all of the three beasts fill their youngs with milk beside the eagle are we together now remember now the reason why I'm saying that I want you to keep our thought they are supposed to guide us they are supposed to influence us so our we been influenced back to to the treat of life if we are following the influence of this living creature we will realize that from the beginning when they get our attraction when the birth comes the first thing that we are fed on is milk are we together praise the Lord the first thing we are fair on is milk so you will see uh uh man as himon when we give birth our babies Fe on milk the oics feel their youngs on milk the lion feel also they are they are young on milk only the eagle that feel fees is Young on the fresh kale the ego feel is Young on a fresh kale so you will see that these things they influence us in our own spiritual work is also an influence on the age praise the Lord the first three age was on uh uh the Lion's anointing so you could see how the disciples they were trying to feed these people about the message of the Resurrection you know and and and Paul was trying to carry the gospel they were bringing but then even in that you will realize at a place where Paul keep telling these people you need to grow up we can't keep feeding you on milk praise the Lord amen we can't keep feeding you on milk we will see it in the scripture here I mean he cried to the Church of Corinthian the same thing he said it to the Hebrews the same think even Peter said it to his to his congregation are we together now remember now we talking about feeding on the Tree of Life feeding on the Tree of Life men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God we're trying to get to a place yet are we together amen praise the Lord you love the Lord amen let's look at 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse three praise the Lord you see I like to I like to look look for these things because sometimes I'm writing something completely different praise the Lord 1 Corinthians chapter 2 praise the Lord hallelujah we want to get to a place here and uh I'm sure sorry and I knew that I messed that up chapter 3 verse two chapter 3 verse two so it's chapter 3:2 that's in chapter 3 that's where Paul is you know rebuking the the the Corinthian Church and saying uh you know one person baptized one person plan you know one is saying I'm for Apollo one is saying I'm for this and and all of that you know so he's here verse one he says uh and our Brethren could not speak unto you as a spiritual as uh uh as unto spiritual but as unto kind even as onto BS in Christ praise the Lord are we together amen I have fed you with milk and not with meat for Heather told you were not able to bed it neither yet now I ye able look at this verse also that Jesus said here to his disciples in John chapter 16:12 St John chapter 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear it that's that's the same thing that Paul is telling these people it looks like we just going in cycle you see and and that's how cut and evil movement I made praise the lord we just come together and recite the things you know to to to pledge our Allegiance praise the Lord you got to say it fast we need to say it fast as soon it's done as soon as you can catch up with that you part of the group that's how C is built praise the Lord but we are serving a living God and he want to be among living people and with living people there is growth praise the Lord there is growth are we together so Jesus said says you know there that there there there there a lot I could say it unto you but you cannot bear it verse 13 He says uh uh how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you is it not the work that the cherubin was doing he will guide you so we see another progression of the cherubin he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself self but whatsoever he shall hear that he shall speak and he will show you things to come he will show you things to come praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 5 I know I'm doing a lot of Bible reading this morning but it's good amen the Bible is the word of God when you read Hebrews chapter 5 you see Paul right from the beginning year he begin to speak about uh uh this priesthood and then uh uh let's get right here over in verse 9 we can we can be able to make some argument yet and establish ourself for being made perfect he became the the author of internal salvation unto all them that obeyed him called of God and high priest after the order of mesc of whom we have many things to say that same statement again many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye a door of hearing for when for the time time you ought to be teachers ye have need that won teach you again which be the first principle teaching is always the first principle that the first thing we do to our children teaching is the first principle of the Oracle of God and I become such as have need of milk and now strong drink praise the Lord amen now see what he says now this is where we will take up from and uh and see if we can preach a little bit but strong strong May belong to them that are of a full age so you see all of those creature even though they feel their young milk but as they grow up they don't get them milk amen the mother the the the Lioness goes out to hunt and then she expect the babies to come and eat she's not going to feed him milk anymore are we together praise the Lord and uh so Paul is going to say something here but strong Meek belong to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to dis concern both good and evil praise the Lord so Paul in one sense he's he's defining what is spiritual maturity when you can be able to put the word into exercise praise the Lord when you are able to exercise yourself in the truth are we together praise the Lord when you are able to take what is been given to you what you've been taught and apply it and build upon it praise the Lord If the child would not take the spoon from the B right to their mouth we know that I mean they're just going to make a mess so we have to feed them are we together praise the Lord you find people you know we we we I mean around the faith you know I mean uh with all the the the you know uh things that are happening out there on the media and and all of that I mean we we must know what we are called to amen praise the lord we must know what we are called to if we if if we have been acknowledging the grace of God God in our life if we have been acknowledging how God have been merciful to us we must know what we are called to we have a generation you know just like uh Isaiah said in you know Isaiah chapter 4 seven women will take hold of one man that was just an example you know uh uh and says well we will eat our own bread we will wear our own apparent all we want is just to be called by your name now we realize that's how the religious system is we can be called you know uh Church of Jesus Christ of deliverance we can be called you know Church on the on on fire for Jesus Christ we can be called church but we have in our own doctrine that is contrary to God's word we have our own appear that is contrary to God's word the people can dress anyhow do anything our Banner can be so big delivering burning fire bush of Jesus Christ we are just taking his name but providing our own apparel we want to dress in the house live in the how and still be called Christians when will we grow up praise the Lord and let's little thing happen then we start whining up that's a sign of a baby that's the only way the baby can call for for attention it's a god-given gift God give it to a baby if if she wants something she cry you have to figure how what's wrong with her did I do something to you no what happened no praise the Lord but you see when we talk about a bride we don't believe in honor age marriage amen no when we talk about a bride it's a stage in our walk with God it's a stage of maturity it's a state where we are making choices and making decision based on God's word praise the Lord so we see here uh uh uh I mean just just like Paul says here you know but strong me belong to them that are of full age amen that word for age means mure praise the Lord I mean if we will still be foring on uh uh uh some of the common things the things that nature s supposed to tell us there are some things that nature naturally it should tell us praise the Lord that if we say our body is the temple of God there are things that we must not put in it and there are things that also I mean uh we must not expose ourself uh you know to the public praise the Lord but you see just like Paul is is identifying just like I said the last time I mean you can call the little one and says you are a baby she say no I'm not a baby praise the Lord in her mind her mind is telling her I know how to wear my slippers praise the Lord whether she's putting it on left or right but she know that this is her slippers so she can be able to argue with you that she's not a baby she know how to find her slippers praise the Lord you see but but and and and that is the same thing with our walk with God praise the lord it's a spiritual growth and it is seen in the way we handle things in the way we present ourself that's where spiritual growth is seen and that's how God's grace is also appreciated Peter speaks of the same thing there in uh uh uh 1 Peter chapter 2 uh verse 1 to3 he you know caution the Believers in the same thing let's read that wherefore laying aside all malice praise the Lord amen all malice is is uh you know Jesus when Jesus speaks about faith he he says uh you know uh uh uh unless we can we can we can uh enter to the kingdom of God like little children because they have this ability to forgive you know children little children they have that ability to forgive but they also have the ability to keep malice they will soon remind you what you did to them are we together they will soon remind you what you did to them but then you will see the beautiful nature about it is that the way they are free with you they are not holding against you but they just want to tell you that you were me wherefore laying aside all malice no hypocrit envy and all evil speaking Paul is identifying all of those things I mean to spiritual Believers just are the things that we we must be past gone if there are issue let's sit down and talk about it praise the Lord as a new baby uh desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby and if we grow then we must also grow from milk amen I heard somebody say something and I love it milk the person said milk is a food that was digested is that truth oh yeah it's truth we get W get a c milk because it have digested the green grass praise the Lord as much as it sound funny as true amen glory be to God and that's the reason why like I said before you cannot just live off of the verse of the day whether it's a Bible verse whether it's a message quot it is somebody meditation you can't live of it if that is just the only thing that is sustaining your Christian Life at least baby can get milk in the morning milk in the afternoon praise the Lord so find the verse for the day in the morning find the verse for the day in the afternoon and uh in the evening and the night since since you since I mean uh you uh uh you are being sustained on milk praise the Lord amen but I mean as a as a as a as a as as a full grown uh you know uh uh uh uh where where's the young man I think it's there I call him out there jna junor yes last week after service he came to me in the office I told himself to write that thing of and he didn't write it and give it to me uh to to show me what he what he been studying on you know he been steuding on the gifts of the Spirit you know and then he's writing and and and so so he's explaining all of that so I said okay you write it down decent and give it to me on Sunday praise the Lord you know because I I actually had I had my thoughts I was going to go in this direction on Sunday and and because you see it's it's a sense of where you are getting in the word you are getting in the word praise the Lord you are beginning to look at these things it's not just a it's not just a you know uh a chapter you realize that the word is connected are we together and you see this this this age that we are in this information age I mean it's it's almost like everything every everything I mean uh there's somebody that have put some kind of information you could get the right one you could get the wrong one I mean God has blessed our age so much that you take some of these Bible apps on your phone they can even give you the Greek word they can give you they can break down I mean just for you are not becoming a theologian but you see it's putting it's putting you to the place where you know what the word of God is becoming your meditation and if you even if we even want to go farther that with that you will realize that uh uh uh the the the the the clean animals both in the Act and the ones that uh that's that Noah I mean that Moses uh uh classified as being clean animal if you really study them they having most of them having uh uh two two unique uh uh uh identities praise the Lord most of the clean animals are the animals that chew their cup amen the ability to chew it swallow it bring it back up again and chew it praise the Lord in the eyes of a person it looks like oh my God they bringing it out and chewing it again all that's that's nasty but uh uh God's applying there to us as a sheep of his pasture we must be able to chew on the word look at it again James said we must not be forgetful heers are we together you see that and and that is the reason why the it's hard for the people to break into the Super Supernatural because they want to they want to handle Divine gifts when they don't have the moral character for it when we have not been able to grow in moral character we have now started speaking evil of one another and blackmailing one another and then we want we want Supernatural manifestation praise the lord the devil can give you an impersonation amen amen he can give you an impersonation run down the out and and and shout and speak in tongues and then few days we hear you insulting and and uh and and you know and all of that you see that's that is that is the thing with the church praise the Lord amen think about this when Jesus gathered those disciples they started seeing him healing the sck and you know and and all of the things he was doing he brought them to a place where he commissioned them and sent them out to at a time praise the Lord send out two by two and the Bible says there in the Book of Luke he told them I've given you power praise the Lord just realize now see this this was just in the infancy of the church okay I've given you power scorpions are subject unto you these guys went out I mean now uh just one day Crusade they have or one day the Revival they had I mean they came back shouting all in the community praise the Lord the other Gody says see you see let let me tell you when you finish talking your own let me tell you my own praise the Lord they were so excited I mean I pray for somebody that was sick they God heal praise the Lord amen and then when they got they come they came to Jesus he said uh he told them and he said I saw Satan falling like a lightning you know what that means it means every time the believer comes into position on the word praise the Lord you see you read the book of Jude the Bible says not even Michel the aangel never brought no realing accusation against the devil all he needed to do was just to take his position and says the Lord rebuked thee praise the Lord the most thing that the devil is afraid of is a Son of God or a daughter of God that is standing on God's word praise the lord the devil knows they you create an earthquake for him because right from the beginning when he was cast down he has been in a descending order when when Isaiah saw him says oh how are thou Fallen oh Lucifer when Jesus saw him he says I saw Satan falling like a lightning he's in the descending order praise the Lord is when we leave the word that's when he take position on our shoulders but when you stand on the word you create an earthquake for the devil praise the Lord he said I saw Satan falling like a lightning he's already falling just imagine the church in its infancy they are breaking into the supernatural they just started tasting of the heavenly things how much more when we line our lives up praise the Lord amen where the the the the the gifts of God is birth in the people and young people are are rising up as Sons and Daughters of God praise the lord we are not looking for things for uh to build our case and excuses and all of that are we together so you see we're talking about this treat of life let's read it a little bit the truth and false Vine a very beautiful type today when the church is hungry God want his children filled with the bread of life now with some t uh uh T but with the bread of life who and what is the bread of life Jesus said I'm the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven said your father eat Manor in the wilderness that John six they eat man in W Manor in the wilderness and they are everyone dead I'm the bread of life that comes from comes from God out of Heaven If any man eat this bread he shall never die or in other words I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden and if they eat of the the tree of death they die if they eat of the Tree of Life they going to live praise the lord we continue to read there the Holy Spirit gathered the tree of life until the atonement was made pray of Praise the Lord when the atonement was made which is the death of Christ the tree of life became a person because right from Eden the tree of life was representing Jesus but it was under a shadow form until he came and paid the price to redeem the Earth back praise the Lord so when he paid the price on the cross of Calvary and said Satan is finished and came back to the church in the form of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now we have the tree of life we have the Tree of Life in plain view praise the Lord he says I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord that time they had to go to the Tree of Life this time our tree of life follow follow us he said these signs shall follow them them that believe so our tree of life is following us are we together the Holy Spirit gu the treat of life until the atonement was m and now the holy spirit is running the people to the tree of life amen that's why the preaching of the Gospel is all about let's wrong let's get back to where we supposed to be if we fall let's wake up let's get back praise the Lord amen Adam and Eve was trying to get to the tree of life now they are children are trying to stay away from the treat of Life the holy spirit is the holy spirit was guiding and is bringing them to it and they and they refus to hear the holy spirit voice because the same adversary the devil that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away from the Tree of Life praise the lord we just want a shua gospel amen but we have a living God that is so anxious to make himself new to you I'm telling you young people you can experience God in a way that you can be an influence for your generation and your PE praise the Lord see so as as we watch these things and seeing here that these uh living creatures these cherubin we see that uh you know uh uh uh it was guided right till the atonement now the Tree of Life Is With Us he's the bread of life he's the Living Water amen that's Jesus Christ so the treat of life is now in plain view praise the Lord amen he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of my mouth and do you know that how the eagle feels the eaglet is mouth to mouth praise the Lord the mama ego cut those little meat and and and and drunk chunk it in the eag mouth are we together and that's what the Holy Ghost does to the believer when we are just we are right in the word and and God just make this word so real it just become so real to you it just capture you praise the Lord I mean you can we can read the word and it's too far from us why because we are thinking about David in his trouble we are thinking about you know uh oh wow David and all of that you see and and that's one of the thing this this uh Gone week I was I was there in the psalm a little bit and I was just reading of some of this Psalm and and there was something that struck me I I I I thought I was going to I can't remember the S now but I could go back and just show you you see David talking about uh uh uh my enemies now you have to remember just like Psalm chap 22 when David said my God my God why have Thou forsaken me praise the Lord you have to remember that under inspiration he spoke in the first person amen he spoke in the first person so many of the time I was thinking about it this week I says oh my God because you see people take that trench of David's s and and and you know David is talking about his enemies and and the Wicked and all of that but if you really study the sign you will see that many times David is also speaking in the first person he's talking in the place of God so he's talking about those that hate the law of God when he said those that hate me and those that will not do my Commandments he's not talking about his soldiers praise the Lord he's not talking about his soldiers because sometimes I I mean if if you were even there then David was under inspiration and and and and he's and he's and he's crying and saying my God my God why have Thou forsaken me you will see this guy is ungrateful God has been so good to him how can he be praying in there and saying God why are you forsaking me praise the Lord but you see David was far he was far he was honor an inspiration he was honor an anointing he was prophesying that would be the very word you see but now our our our church days our church word we forget about our lord Jesus on the cross and say father counted not to their curse forgive them no we don't want that one we want this David David destroy his enemy Lord kill my enemies my enemies where are the enemies you realize you check it or you you yourself you are your own enemy we ourself become our own enemy why were you worried about that when God promised to be your Fortress he says as the mountain is surround the Jerusalem so the Lord is around his people if we are abiding under the shadow of the almighty and staying in line with God's word why will you be worrying about enemies praise the Lord looking for something where it's not there when this is the age this is the dispensation where the mercy seed has dropped down I wanted to talk about the mercy seed this morning I I just been trying to push it away a little bit but it's a beautiful it's a just just a beautiful thing out of God's word just a beautiful thing out of God's word because until this Mercy Seat has been made rear in our hearts we can save this generation because the generation is so evil the generation is so ning I mean evil is just springing out from everywhere but who's going to be Jesus today praise the lord we we we we just we are we are just we are just so filled with judgmental Spirit we judge we criticize we condemn praise the lord we are carrying an act with no mercy seat when you are just legalistic and you just get the law you just get the law the law the law your AR of the Covenant does not have cover praise the Lord but there on Calvary we saw Mercy when it spit in his face the disfigure his his his face by pulling off the beard on his face we saw mercy and it's that same Mercy that want to drop in your heart it's that same Mercy that want to drop in our heart and change our life praise the Lord is that same Mercy I want to drop in our hearts and change our life glory be to God you see if if if we are honor the guidance and honor the influence of uh of uh of the cherubin if we are under the influence you know they will influence us to Mercy praise the Lord Isaiah was there in the temple the Bible says there when he when he when he when he saw that uh uh uh uh uh yuzer his friend died and and and and you know he F so condemned before God and start crying to God what is man I'm a man undone and you know the Bible says it was one that took a fire one of those angels left that place came down and P a cat of fire upon the prophet that was God's mercy that was God's mercy to Isaiah it was also God's mercy to the people of Israel because he would come out of that Vision with a different Ministry praise the Lord he will go so hard and talk about a virgin shall conceive unto us a child is born he will go so hard and talk about the Millennium praise the Lord he will go so high and let us know what happened how Satan was cast out in the beginning praise the Lord when you experience God's mercy it brings you closer to him amen God can be able to lift you in the realm of seeing things and understanding things getting to know his nature because that's what his nature is it's a god that is full of Mercy praise the Lord I mean that's that's where the church is that is that is where our problem is we are placed in in in an age where hell has break loose and we having all of these things happening around us praise the Lord amen we see the kind of a society that we are living in we having uh you know uh uh uh LGBT and and all of that that's that's Our Generation that's the age that we are in the Bible says as it was in the days of sodon and gomorra praise the Lord but let me ask you a question when Abraham went down there to redeem lot did he went down there asking the people is it that the very same people from Sodom he went out to fight for praise the Lord no he could say all those places it's abominable place I mean all of those people they even wanted to sleep with the angel I don't have no time for them you see if Mercy has not been has not come to our heart we will not even know how to relate to the people out there and those very people going to be your buses those very people will be people you will you will fly a plane with you will not even know how to have a conversation with them why because now you sitting down somebody you are in hell all in your mou oh my God let this PL just reach oh my God the person is not the problem you that the problem you are in a spiritual prison that's not Christianity that's why Jesus was called one Berber because he talked to the drunkers on the street that's the age we are in that's the society we have how are we going to live so well I stay in my house and I will order everything online they are the very same people that is packaging it to send it to you you you know how much you have experience God's mercy when your heart is tender towards men when your heart becomes tender towards men praise the lord we find and see many of those people that are caught up trapped in those livest God's Mercy is visiting them and they are giving their heart back to God we will look at that and be thankful but go out of the room see another one and start criticizing them I mean if we can criticize one another as much as decent we try to dress praise the Lord when we can be so judgmental to ourself how are we going to help anybody praise the Lord the Holy Ghost supposed to bring us internal security but you having the people so insecure they are so insecure they come to the house of God they are so insecure when the Holy Ghost supposed to give us internal security it's supposed to raise our level of trust and confidence in God's word but we become so insecure as soon a person misquote the Bible oh my God that's why I I knew it you knew what praise the Lord people is a spirit it's a spirit that is robbing us of our Liberty it locks people and carry them as far as into isolation because they can't trust anybody they can't trust anybody so they just lock up in isolation and they abusing them themselves and destroying thems all because all the sea and sense around us is just judgment just judgment that all the see are we together Jesus says I'm the treat of life and the Bread of Heaven praise the Lord are we together no I wanted to read something to you I know I've passed my time here just read this to you and we close musicians you can come up please as the eager n when God born a child into his family that man has a makeup something that can stand the supernatural that person has a makeup in them something that can stand the supernatural that that can differentiate between real and unreal and one who knows what ego food is Eagle foood comes from the mouth of the feeder now some men may toic but from the mouth of the feeder which is Jehovah Eagle amen men shall live by every word that comes from God mouth he's our feeder amen who FS with his own word and the ego will never bring her baby anything that will hurt them oh I just love that God will never make a promise that he won't stand behind and the ego just love to get a hold of that word he love it because it comes from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle he love it amen men should live only by bread alone men shall live only by bread alone let's reg glorify Jesus this will be the last one for this morning this afternoon now King I don't believe that King willfully walked out there and got the fruits of the field walk work of his hands and brought it over I absolutely wanted to do that he he just absolutely wanted to do that it wanted to do it to be a smart alec I believe King come with all his heart thinking he was doing the right thing and I believe that's that's the way we are many of the time like the Bible says all of our ways are right in our eyes praise the Lord I believe King come with a full heart thinking he was doing right why was he trying to find favor with God he was trying to find life again he was trying to get back to the Garden of Eden again where the cherubin was I imagine they they went to the east side where the cherubin was guing the tree of life and they were trying to get back and the man with the destination of his soul hanging in the balance he end up there to play Church his gory up there to worship if we realize that we are hanging in the balance we realize that life can slip from us in the moment that's what the prophet of God saying we will not play Church praise the Lord you see when we when we just think that we have too much time on our hand what we are not appreciating is the mercy of God we are not appre appreciating that God has been so so merciful to us that he has not consumed us he has not deal with us according to our transgression but his grace has given us another opportunity rewrote my life God's mercy re root my life I you have fallen my soul cast down God's mercy reot my life oh let's just sing it together now yes Mercy REO my [Music] [Applause] life oh mercy rro my [Music] life and I you have fall my soul cast down oh above Mercy reu my life oh yes God Mercy rro my [Music] life oh it was Mercy [Music] rro my life oh ah you are falling my soul cast down oh mercy REO my life oh thank you Jesus [Music] Mercy reu my it was your mercy rro my [Music] life you have fallen my soul [Music] Mercy you know the other day we spoke we spoke about shame how to deal with shame and it's a it's a subject that not even stry office on just asking the Lord to just help me look into the subject and but one thing I learned you can't help anybody by first shaming them and many of the time what the devil would do is there he will shame a person in your mind and because he makes the person to to look so shameful all because he just want to handle you but take it think about it some of the kids that are friends to our kids don't know any better how are we preparing our kids to deal with it with those things if we are not preparing them they can even tell from how we are dealing with our owner issues the conversation we have home sometime the prayer needs that we bring up do you ever take up a prayer need oh I saw a lady at the Walmart oh God I don't know her name but my heart just reached out for her can you pass by someone sit down in your car slam the door and just say oh God just help her help that young man Lord or do we just go what is this again oh my God what next will we see if we have experienced God's tender mercy and to know that it is by by his Mercy that is by his Mercy that we are not consumed that there is nothing of ourself we can count ourself worth it of the grace of God that have come to us you ever think of yourself that you so better that you can't give another m to the handshake I think we need to find our place to the altar find our place to the foot of the cross and say God have mercy upon me how can we get over to the treat of Life how can we really feed on the word of God how we we feeding on the word of God without Mercy without going by the way of of the cherubin without getting to The Mercy Seat how we getting to the Commandments of God that's the reason why we hear the word of God and all that sound to our mind they just condemning me they just condemning me no we are bringing you to The Mercy Seat if the preacher tell you it's wrong for you to dress immorally is for you to come to The Mercy Seat if we can meet at The Mercy Seat the word of God will make more it I mean it it will appeal it will make
