there so I think we just have some service tonight amen I might help him to get his job done quickly and better praise the Lord you see all of these things that he puts on the wall they are not just there for decoration is to control the sound the room is so small so we having sound bouncing here and there so he came up with there to be able to absorb the sound and so we can we can all go deaf before we leave from here amen praise the Lord so we want to thank our brother and we want to thank their their Tech Team praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat that will be it musicians thank you maybe we might put brother Jordan to work at the end of the service amen praise the Lord so uh uh we want to we want to announce and uh just uh this is this is coming towards the end of the school year so we have in we're having uh a few of the things that uh uh coming to a successful end of the year for the Aesthetics and so uh some of them will be doing their graduation I know um um sister promise will be graduating this weekend and she's having some of her folks coming down from Georgia so uh the Deacons will want us to know that we might be having visitors this weekend and also Memorial weekend and I wish of course we will announce but for this coming weekend we might have some some visitors that are coming to town to support our sister and so if they choose to come to church we might get a little bit crowded and so we want us to be able to accommodate the visitors so for for whatever reason if the deacons are asking you are asking us to make room let's let's be flexible praise the Lord amen and I I'm sure that's what you would do if if you have uh if we have guests to the house you know you try to give the guests the best seat for them to be able to sit and and enjoy the fellowship so uh uh and then Memorial weekend coming also uh uh uh Memorial weekend coming also will be the same we're having uh um but a lot of Nicos coming down from North Carolina but I learned that he might be coming with some of the folks from the church so we might have we we're trying to to be accurate on the number but it still does not intimidate us amen because we have a big God praise the Lord if our building cannot contain everybody God can contend and praise the Lord so there's there's our comfort tonight praise the Lord so we we just we just want to let's let's stand on our feeding and then we want to go into what we want to talk about tonight praise the Lord I want to I want to speak on red true red is white but when you see a red true red is white he says science has proven that red true red is white so that's what I want to talk about tonight I'm using that as a title but I want to I want to I want to show uh by the grace of God and the help of the Holy Spirit be able to to see something uh out of Prophecy from the word praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen and uh Jordan I don't see the offenses stick here and uh that remote think we were using on on Sunday but uh let's go to Isaiah chapter one Isaiah chapter one that's uh we want to read that uh very famous and familiar scripture Isaiah chapter 1. thank you sister Faith foreign he works with her back I mean she works with him back there so praise the Lord Isaiah chapter one let's read verse 18. let's read from verse 18. from Verse 18 to verse 20. from Verse 18 to verse 28 Isaiah chapter 1 if okay I think the technician will catch up with us it's good for us to be ahead of them come down and let us reason together say the Lord though your Saints be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be rare like crimson they shall be as War if Yale if you be willing and obedient he be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if ye refuse and rebel now so you have to you have to counter uh refuse and rebel with uh willing and obedient praise the Lord if you are willing and obedient you will eat the fruit of the land but if ye shall refuse and rebel for the mouth of the Lord have spoken in amen let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we have just read your sacred word many times so God father this this is a very very familiar scripture it it speaks about the cleansing we have in your blood it speaks about the reconciliation brother Branham uses to preach the message or conference with God and Father Lord you calling us to come and reason with you calming and understand Lord come father and have a conversation you want us to come and have a conversation and oh god father your Prophet taught us obeying on speaking terms and oh God so we pray tonight Lord that you will just speak to our hearts and may we commune with you also when we find ourselves in the word and say Lord thank you thank you for speaking to me father and help me Lord God and when the word is addressing our need may we not just be done foundable may we receive your word because you said in your word if we are willing and obedient we will eat the good of the land let it be tonight let that be our portion tonight father may we never be found in a place of refusing and rebelling no Godfather that's not a spirit that comes from you bless us tonight in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the Lord bless you tonight you may have your seat praise the Lord now Numbers Chapter 19 let's take Numbers Chapter 19. let's go right there Numbers Chapter 19. praise the Lord I'm I'm sure if I if I can get very familiar with this PowerPoint think it might it might make me to be faster Numbers Chapter 19 are we together praise the Lord the Lord speak unto Moses and unto Aaron's saying this is the ordinance of the Lord which the Lord have commanded saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke which means the neck was never time it was never bound to any man or Never Bound to any reason there was never a yoke around the neck of this red heifer and yes I gave her now that's what I want us to to pick up tonight the red heifer is a female animal praise the Lord the rare heifer is very important in in the worship of Israel is very important they need it for every time they go to the to the to to the the Tabernacle uh uh the the sprinkling of the water that the the priests use to to to sanctify the people it comes from the arches of the red heifer praise the Lord amen now what this will teach us in the light of brother Branham or the message of the hour is that how much God kept his bride in Redemption that the red heifer is not a male animal but it's a female animal praise the Lord amen so the red Huffer is a female animal and and and and yes I give her unto Eleazar the priests that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall sled her before he face and the Eliza the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times now so you know you go through the the message the seven Church ages verbraham types that uh sprinkling of the blood seven times before the Tabernacle how it represented the seven Church ages how God would keep the seven Church ages under the blood you see that's the reason why from every Church age God got a bride it is not only this last Church age even though Luther did not have the fullness of the word but yet he was able to give God a brine praise the Lord amen Paul speaks dead I have exposed you to Christ like a chess virgin why because God honored a shadow of the Tabernacle sprinkle the blood seven times representing that he was going to get a people in every Church age that will be accepted because that's what the blood represents amen the blood represents your acceptance to worship praise the Lord that's the reason why King uh sacrifice was not accepted because uh I mean uh uh without blood you know there's no remission of sin amen and and and and even God for him to for him to bring his children back into his presence Adam and Eve he have to Slit alarm and and get the bloody line and that's when he called Adam Adam come unto me you see so it is the blood that that speaks our acceptance amen and that's the reason why there is no savage brother bottom change is complete without the word because what the word is the blood right praise the Lord the word is the block so every time the word is preached to you is the sprinkling of the blood are we together now so uh uh verse 5 and and one shall burn the halfer in his sight her skin her flesh and her blood her downside shall he burn praise the Lord and the praise shall take a see the world and and hustle and uh uh scarlet and and cast it into the midst of the burning of the Harvard then the praise shall wash his clothes and he shall bath his flesh in water and after all he shall come into the camp and the priests shall be unclean until the evening praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh okay let me just finish the reading there in his shop and he's uh and he that burned her shall wash his clothes in water and bath his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the evening and the man that is clean Shall Gather up the arches of the Hartford and laid them up without the camp now you see because this animal was a special species they don't always hide it it was not there all the time so when they have when he had an offer there was not that didn't have no spot no blame and that halfway was proving to be the half of a sacrifice when the burning like that they keep the Arches they could keep it for many years because they they don't know when they will have another half for the game so the the red Harper was not just a common animal that you could find any day so that is the reason why uh they have they have been instructed here that they must gather up the arches of the heifer they must lay it and and lay them up with Father cam in a clean Place praise the Lord and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin so the red heifer was a type it represented crisis represented our lord Jesus and like I said it was it was a special species of animal and sometimes uh the red half of may not show up for 10 years or more so uh so the the the the priests have to use those arches sparingly he had to you have to use it you have to manage it because if they go without the red huffle and they don't have arches they will never have service praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the Jews are in in in the situation that they are in now because they can go to the Willing wall and pray but they cannot make sacrifices they cannot make sacrifices they are they are lack of making sacrifice you see that's the reason why all of all are are all through the years the the the the the the Jews the the rabbis they have been looking for the red Hartford they've been looking for one that will meet the qualification here of uh of of uh Numbers Chapter 19. why because their services is not complete without a sacrifice so all the Jews can do now and they suggest go to the Willing Ward and pray they cry to God and they are crying to God and saying Lord uh bring us back the dead of worship bring us back they cannot have this kind of for service we are having they can be taught the word they can read the word they can lend the word but they cannot have service they cannot have Fellowship because you cannot have fellowship with god without the blood yes sir God is not going to come to that service right praise the Lord you see that's the reason why I feel I feel so sorry for a bunch of these Gentiles that don't know their place and they want to become a masonic uh uh Christian they want to take up a a a a a Jewish position you can take a Jewish position because you think that's where the blessing is but you are not in fellowship with God amen amen because according to God's calendar until the Gen the days of the Gentiles are fulfilled then you're going to release back to Ezra via red hatford and now they can have seven now they can get into the congregation of the Lord are we together now so that's the rare halfer there better man would take this year in tinky's man filter he said no face in Exodus chapter 19 actually Numbers Chapter 19 that was what we just read that's what he was referring to you don't find it in Exodus chapter 19 but normal chapter 19 I want you to read it when you go home when you have more time no face when Israel had committed sin first they took a red Huffer which had never had a yoke on her neck that means she never was yoked up with anything and she had to be red the color red is an atonement color did you know science knows that if you take red and look through red to Red is white praise the Lord so that's why we talk about our tough from tonight red to Red is white if you look true rare to Red it's white look true red and red it's white he looked through the red blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and our rest sin become as wide as snow amen praise the Lord amen church amen praise the Lord let's respond to the word Hallelujah when you don't respond to me I'm thinking that okay I'm reading something and maybe I'm you know how how I do you know I'm reading somewhere different and everybody says where is he going uh what is he reading we don't see what he's reading praise the Lord now so and uh uh he looked through the red blood of the Lord Jesus and our rare sin become as wadas no red true red and the half was killed in the evening time by the whole Congregation of Ezra and there was and there was both seven Stripes of her blood upon the door where the whole congregation had to enter a type of the seven Church ages by the blood amen praise the Lord you see that's the reason why you cannot be critical of the messenger of the church ages they already had a representation before the Tabernacle praise the Lord amen and then her blood was taken her body was taking sorry and burned it was burned with the whole the skin with the intestine in her dong everything was burned together and it had to be picked up by a clean man and how tall be put in a clean place outside the congregation therefore if Israel could only see the type this word of God must not be handled with dirty hands of unbelief praise the Lord amen this word of God must not be handled uh with Daddy hands of unbelief it got to be a clean man and if he's clean he had to come through God's filter and God's filter is his word praise the Lord amen because uh uh the the the the the heifer like like we said was representing the word amen so we see here a God is calling us to a conference he's calling us to a time of Fellowship come let us reason together praise the Lord and and you see he will not call us if he had not made provision already he have already made provision praise the Lord amen and whatever we need it's not when you ask you already had it before you asked he already made Provisions so he want us to come and just jump in Fellowship you see that's the reason why having the revelation of debt you don't become so so so so so bad about uh uh you know uh uh bumping the door or the benches but you you just get in the place and and learn to worship and thank God because whatever we need he has already provided amen he's having that provision praise the Lord if we can just learn what the church needs to know if we can just learn to Have a Heart of Thanksgiving praise the lord we are always sin has put us in a reverse State we always want to receive before we say thank you praise the Lord amen by the original state is to say thank you praise the Lord so if God can give us a Heart of Thanksgiving you wake up in the morning and just give God thanks spend time on your knee just thanking God and just praising God you know what you're doing you are believing in his ability to provide for you Hallelujah amen now so uh talking about God's provision talking about God's provision there is there is uh there is a judge in the Book of Judges that you you we you have to understand the time of Judges there was no king in Israel and the Bible says every man did what was right in their eyes amen praise the Lord if you never read the Book of Judges you you sure believe that's the time that we are living in amen in Social law this time praise the Lord but you see the scripture make us to to realize the other God will will raise up a George for the people whenever they have gone into adultery God will always make provision for them are we together he will always make provision for them praise the Lord now so uh uh knowing that this is what I want for us to see I want I want you to see I want us to be able to see even though the time of the judges was a time where there was no prophet but yet God was in control praise the Lord amen God was in control and the provision that God has made the provision that he's that he made was also in control so there were a lot of things that were taking place on a prophecy are we together we see how God and and one of the things that is also we we talked about this before one of the thing that is also beautiful in the Book of Judges is that this is the time where God was using Ordinary People praise the Lord God was using ordinary people that made themselves available he was using ordinary people that made himself available praise the Lord he was just picking people up see how he picked up Gideon praise the Lord an angel appeared to give them the almighty man of Heller kitten was looking over his shoulder who is he talking to but he was the one now so if you look here uh uh over in Judges chapter 10 just like the way the the the uh over there in uh the the verse that speaks about Shem guy it was just only one verse praise the Lord and brother Brown uh uh referred to to Shem God uh uh describing the time of the judges for us so so you will see there there are there are few of them over in the Book of Judges where you was you you we will realize that God you know he he just he moved in uh in in a special way and and and it's it's all in Prophecy so I want for us to look at this uh uh this judge that will rise on the scene after the time of abimelech there arose to defend that's the word I want for us to look at that word defend means to save it means to to uh to deliver praise the Lord so there are a rose to defend Israel Torah the son of peel the son of Dodo a man of Hezekiah and he dwelled in Mount Ephraim and he judge Ezra 23 years praise the Lord he judge Israel 23 years as I read that today my mind was going all over the place but I taught us as well today is Wednesday so uh you you do well blotted if you just stay right in your line of thought amen don't go all over the place just stay right here here's Josh Ezra for 23 years and died and was buried in uh now so you will see here that uh what I want for us what the underlining word here is that there arose to defend Israel praise the Lord that is the underlining word because whatever arose to defend Israel it has to come from God praise the Lord whatever thou will rise to your defense [Music] are we together there arose to defend Israel Tola now if you look at this individual his name is very interesting the name Tola it means it is it's like a like a warm like a my girl especially and uh now we we will get into explaining the mall I was able to to go and look uh uh what actually I was trying to see if I if I would find a video uh just just to be able to show you but but we kind of make some research to be able to look at this and and we will we will we will get that get get that to you now so the the name Tola was was this Josh name praise the Lord but also when you look into his name you realize that there is a whole lot that is going on here we see Crimson though your same be as Crimson it will be water snow we see Scarlet you know we see warm and we see color and what what actually it is we'll get into the history like I said there is there is there is a lot of connection here when you when you look at it but like I said remember there are rules air a Defender a data Rose a Defender want to defend Israel that's that is the major thing I want us to keep in our mind you know data roles uh to defend Israel that's that's what we want to keep in our mind but we're looking at this guy told that we're looking at his name and let's go let's go a little bit here now now so Tola means Scarlet in as much as also it means warm okay warm like like what you take off of the Earth and when you look into the scripture the from uh from the uh you see when you when we go back here you see from from that age 32 16 that is that is the translation that goes back to the uh you know when you're looking through the the Hebrew the concordance you know so that's that's what they are trying to be able to bring out of this together for us to understand be able to get a picture of this so about 38 times the same word is translated as Crimson the same word that is used as Scarlet you know that's the same word that was used when uh when Rahab gave those men this kind of land you know when they told her to put their Scarlet uh uh to her door it was the same word that was used when uh uh Zora brought his hands out and the Scarlet thread was started around his hand that was the same word it comes from the same background that were taller but as we will look at the word here there are uh I mean scholar telling eight times used as Crimson Scarlet dime was made from a particular one now so uh uh the die was just like what they were used to die a cloth right to change the color so that died was was taken from a particular animal praise the Lord so you will realize that this the God's Redemption story is written all over the universe he he wrote it he wrote it in in everything that he made praise the Lord because you have to realize that uh uh creation was just speaking about Redemption Redemption was God's main plan because there's no way that he would dwell with his attributes without Redemption right so in in everything that he created the heavens declare the glory of the Lord that's Redemption the Sun comes out like a man comes out of his chamber praise the Lord now so yeah this this colored diet was was from this particular animal and they get they're having all of their scientific name here you know uh these insects Peace attained by uh uh and then uh the the the the sock the sub from which they prepared a war skill to protect their soft body the diet is in the scale and uh the active ingredients is uh you see the name right there and that is the one of whatever the name is I want to get to my place here it said yellow red in water and it becomes their topical Violet red in Asic solution praise the Lord are you can you cut the light off here if if is that much better okay when reproducing the female clam in the tree usually in in a horn arcs and were a bad ax and the lava hash and feel on the body of the worm it gives its life for its mission the Crimson spot is left on the branch in three days praise the Lord Amen in three days and if you take that that three days now you take the same three days in the heart of the Earth right you take three days for the resurrection in three days when the Scarlet spot dry out it changes to White as it flakes off praise the Lord amen amen now even though is this individual name that's his name his parent gave him his name I don't think they were looking at this animal when they gave him their name but you it this is just to be able to show us how divinely God put the scriptures together amen is just to be able to show us the inspiration of the Holy Spirit yes a man yeah that is that is that that have been raised up in Israel just in a time of need praise the Lord now for Hashem God the Bible say he took on us God and he went out bed and he killed as many Philistines that he could kill yeah and the Bible talk about evil the left-handed man he took a dig out and then he was able to use that to deliver Israel the Bible speaks about jail she allowed this man coming to a house she did not arise him she gave him milk and food put him to bed and just put a nail in his temper and and nail him to death and thou brought a great Deliverance praise the Lord why because Deborah has already prophesied that by the hand of a woman right we would get the victory praise the Lord after Gideon his son abimele went and slew his 70 Brothers and he went over to the Canaanites and told them he says and you know I'm your brother it's better that you have one man ruling over you then you have all of these seventy sons of of Gideon gerabelle praise the Lord he went and killed his brother he he influenced the people he's in power but one of Gideon's son was alive the younger one he prophesied he says abimele is going to be like a Bramble and he's going to waste fire on you and you're going to return fire back on him praise the Lord amen but you see with all of that uh when the Bible speaks about that uh the Bible speaks about a certain woman that took a milestone was running away she took a mailstone and just rolled that Millstone down I like the way someone said they give him a split headache praise the Lord he got a split-headed because it's just it just entered his life it just it just broke his head and he died so you see God here using Ordinary People right right yes that's right amen well no no particular a skill set and Military skill set uh I mean I mean they know how to cook they know how to eat but I mean there was just no particular skill set that they needed to be a deliverer praise the Lord yeah the strength chart is going to tell us about this uh uh uh individual and and and and and here the Bible only tells us that there arose to defend Israel Torah that's all the scripture said that's all how did he defend it so you see almighty God will keep the mystery of his defense in his name amen how did he defend it yeah praise the Lord The Mystery of the work that he would do I mean that is all that is said about him that rose up to defend Israel Torah that's all that is said about him and for 23 years so for 23 years he kept peace in the land for 23 years he judge Israel how did he do it yeah praise the Lord you see how weather whatever he uses and and how he did it it does not matter right praise the Lord so God it does not matter what matter to God here it is the other he's now going to see how Moses gave them a provision praise the Lord amen how write down from the scripture that God taught them that uh I mean uh uh uh uh without blood there is no uh uh remission of sin and there is no worship there is not even a sacrifice that will be accepted praise the Lord amen yeah the Bible is not telling us that he brought a red heart for this it's not telling us anything it's just telling us that there arose to defend Israel Tola praise the Lord then it Rose and what I'm seeing in my mind is that God is is is helping us to see an inside a talking yeah there is something something that is that that that will be able to to defend Israel judge them for 23 years praise the Lord now so just like I said it is not it is not uh uh a specified yet what did he use what did he using Hammond he used a Gun there's nothing yet is telling us right but what is telling us here there arose to defend Israel and God is their Defender are we together we are the one that we are we just we just becoming a little bit nosy praise the Lord because sometimes you are reading and you are studying there are things that catch your attention and you just say well let me look into it a little bit and then you start to to look in and things start springing up out of the Bible or out of the word so that's one of these that's one of the situation here this guy his name is warm it means scarletta and and Crimson is used in different parts of the book now we come here to realize that uh you know that this is an insect and this this animal of this uh creature who say the other uh and and out of this creature will come uh uh uh you know a certain diet and they have to wait for it the particular season and it goes through all of these uh uh uh transformation it goes through all of these stages in his life and the ones the aesthetic you know animals to be able to bring us this report they are telling us that uh you know during this period of time this animal have to stay three days you know after it brings out this colored color and then after three days when he leaves from there you see the skull it turns to White praise the Lord now what would make this more interesting now in Psalm chapter 22. let's go to Psalm chapter 22. I get verse 6 up but let's go back and read from verse 1. that's what it's going to make this whole thing interesting it's it's going to grab us into the grip of Prophecy praise the Lord because here is David here on the the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he's speaking out the very word the owl our Defender will use on cavalry hinder the one that will defend the very words that he will use my God my God why have that forsaken me why I dial so far from helping me and from the words of my rolling oh my God I cried in the daytime but that year has met and in the ninth season and I'm not selling but Thou Are Holy oh thou that inhabited the Praises of Ezra Our Father trusted in the they're trusted and thou bet deliver them praise the Lord and I'm telling you if we trust in him he will Deliver Us praise the Lord Hallelujah you see David yeah going through whatever he was going through like you are going through whatever you are going through David is bringing himself to the place and saying oh my God I cried in the bed I'm calling upon your name in the night but I'm reminding myself that our fathers did the same cry they trusted in you and you delivered them so you see David is not it's not casting God down to say you are not doing anything for me but David is challenging himself praise the Lord and the challenge that he's bringing on himself is that I need to trust God more because there were people that were before me that I had need and the trusted God and God delivered it no matter what I'm going through if the Lord can just help me to trust him amen praise the Lord amen thou word trusts it means to be cast it has a very deep sense of humbling yourself it has a big sense of being humble praise the Lord it means to cast it does not mean to take this and put it on the ground no it means to let go it does not mean take it and put it down easy [Music] no no no no no no it means to let go you have to cast it and you're not turning it up to catch it you need to let it go down [Music] praise the Lord oh it has a very it has a very deep meaning it has a very deep meaning just like I was saying on Sunday laughs we can enjoy the Creation The Works of God's hands but for God to be able to bring us a creation he have to Humble himself he has to condescend you have to leave the state of being Elohim or leave the state of being the self-existing god you have to count the same we can praise God and thank God for Redemption I'm saved and praise the Lord I'm saving uh since anybody ask you to tell I'm redeemed for Redemption to come to us he had to do the same The Secret of God is not in how much you can memorize is in how much humble when we are humbling ourselves to God's word and to the word of God then now you are trusting God right you are not trusting God by reasoning in your mind Our Father trusted thee that's what David said yeah they trusted and thou deliver praise the Lord thou deliver them praise the Lord are we together verse 5 they cry unto thee just like I'm crying on today praise the Lord and you deliver so in this psalm trust is one of the most online subject that's what David is dealing with in Psalm 22 yeah is Trust they cried on today and will deliver they trusted thee praise the Lord so you see when that when Jesus was saying my God my God why have Thou forsaken me yeah it was more than him just being sorry for that he's died no right the whole phrase an embodied Trust are we together you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord they cry on today then we deliver the trust that indeed and we are now confounded and the verse says he says but I am a womb so if you take it back to the Hebrew he's saying I'm taller right I'm a woman and no man I'm a warm I'm this little creature I'm not a man um I'm this little creature I'm not a man when it comes to this art I'm not in the cabinet shop I'm not giving the blind the aside I'm not feeling ten thousand I'm a warm that is stuck on this street and pretty soon when I leave this colors will turn to White I'm a worm that is stuck on and after three days I mean amen I'm a woman known man every approach of man and despise of people only want worms when they want to catch fish it's time to look for worms when they want to catch fish but if once you show up here you see everybody will be jumping up just always despise despise yeah [Music] obey that see me in life just come they shoot other leaves they shake their heads saying he trusted on the Lord that He Who deliver s Fender of Israel a believer of Israel praise the Lord you are seeing the picture you see in the connection by God who put the name of Tola into His Holy Scripture his 23 years of judging Israel and did not give us one account of what he did praise the Lord because there will also arise our Torah yes the Lord Jesus Christ he was our taller that's the reason why honor Prophet said a prophet Isaiah can say it though your sin be as Khalid praise the Lord if you are identified in me praise the Lord it will be white as snow though it might be read as crimson I will make it white just like a water you know this will just bring us to the place Sons and Daughters of God oh all over the years and over the ages people the church try to carry out this life of Christ you know as as a as a life to to impress other people right you go back to the Book of Judges and give you a picture some of these people were living humble humble life humble life but there is one Element that we must always realize they that trust the Lord they that put their trust in God they belong to God only asked their Defender oh and God can see down in your heart down in your soul no matter why your mind is going through no matter what your body is going through you're not trying to put on some kind of a show for people to know that you have faith you're going in the rapture but it's something that is now in your heart I know my redeemer liveth [Music] it's real to you yes it's not a show on life it's something that is real deep down in your heart praise the Lord the Jews in their backslady state they don't have a temple they don't have a red huffle but every practicing Jews let me say it that way the one that is practicing Judaism they believe that they are children of Abraham so a Jews can go for a deal he's going to do business he's ready to trick you and he's still believing that the god of Abraham right is going to see him through that deal he's going to trick you but he's believing as a sea of Abraham he will come out of that deal right with more benefit than you that's right praise the Lord yeah oh he said he say his his uh uh his Jewish prayer he called on Abraham Isaac and Jacob how much more about Sons and Daughters of God right now we know that we're not supposed to trick any man we know that we're supposed to to apply our heart earnestly and Lord to the best of man ability I know I'm applying my heart earnestly so I trust in you for the result praise the Lord that's what I wanted to bring to you tonight we have a Torah amen we have a Torah we have a Defender we have one that have rise to defend to deliver us praise the Lord they hang him on the on on on a trade on the cross and he bled out blood let's take the mail was to put him in the grave for three [Laughter] right they should have just left him hanging there because that's what it take it take three days for this warm to go through its process where the Scarlet turns into white God writing the story of redemption in a war the same way he write the story of a Rapture in a butterfly that is a caterpillar and it goes into secret and from there it flies away he wrote your rapture in the life of a butterfly right musicians can come [Applause] praise the Lord that's why when you read the book of Job there is one thing that it holds with everything that job was going through God took him to the different animals praise the Lord the next time you see a a creature that is created by almighty God it might be holy Solomon says learn the way of an ant yeah that's why Solomon said he said learn the way of an ant in the time of the summer it Gathers it take little booms from here and run in the hole it takes another boom from your Iran in the hall because when the winter comes it stay in that hole and feed its family [Music] [Music] don't just care to fly maybe the fly might teach you
