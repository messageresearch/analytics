So tonight I I want to thank I want to take I'm taking I'm taking the thought tonight and uh uh I want to labor a little bit on on overcomers overcomer overcoming. Brother Brandon preached a message uh uh what it takes to overcome all unbelief. He said is our faith. He says uh uh that's what it takes to overcome all unbelief. Then he also preached the message how can I overcome. Now so this evening I just want to uh uh as I trust that the Lord will be able to help. We want to just uh uh uh be able to go in that direction tonight a little bit. I just want to show you something and uh uh I pray that it be is a blessing to you. Amen. Amen. I pray that is a blessing to you. Now, uh, uh, man, if you can pull my image up, please bring my pointer. Amen. Bring my pointer. It's 8:15. I have 45 minutes to preach. If I can become a successful preacher, successful preacher preach in 45 minutes. Amen. never been successful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon committed brother Neville and uh and he said he or he brother Brandon was never a successful preacher because he couldn't preach in 45 minutes. When you listen to some of brother Neville messages, he was able to just stay around the circumference of 45 50 and all there. Can you put my image up? Are we able to in the second? If you go down, it's not part of it. It just gives you a link. What have I done? What in the world have I done? Praise the Lord. Let me let me just see here. U this is that we have used before uh Emmanuel. So uh it should be in our Oh, I see what happened here. I see what happened here. Let me try this again. Let me try again. See if when I look in my I look in my Okay, we will still we can still refer to that. Uh I see exactly what's what's going on. So yeah, uh when we uh when you if you remember, we were talking uh uh one time and I was showing you those images that I said I will come back to. And uh the one that had the it had Okay, man. I've just sent that again. So, I hope it went uh Okay. Yeah, I think you should have it now. You'll soon remember the the one with the paramed and then it had the the the the red the the beast on one side and then the living creatures on the other side. That's what I'm trying to refer to tonight. Praise the Lord. Now, so uh uh when you when you look at that image, uh we uh we were trying to uh you bring it up. Just just pay attention to me. Let's let's just read uh let's let's just read an introduction here. Okay, I think you got it. Let's just read an introduction here and see what brother Brandham said in a message. How can I overcome? He said this. He said, now I choose this because that I think that is a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said we must never let the spirit of revival die. So which mean in a sense that we have to overcome. Now you have to remember the subject he's teaching us here is how we can overcome. It does not matter what you have to overcome. It's how you overcome it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The devil can come in in in every way. I mean, he he's just changing his max, but he will always come the same way he have ever come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will always come the same way he have ever come. So no matter how he come, if you know uh how to overcome, you will overcome him. Every word, any time, under any condition, any disguise, you will overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you know how to overcome. &gt;&gt; Now uh uh uh uh in uh uh Matthew chapter 4, Brother Brandon will let us know that Jesus overcame the devil by saying, "It is written." Amen. He overcame the devil by pointing to the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He overcame the devil by pointing to the word and say it is written. And Satan comes back also and say it is also written. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will give his angels charge over you. So I mean he's challenging the Lord with uh but let's look into the church ages and see how how that we overcame. How how are we overcoming? Because what I'm going to show you is not something that uh uh we we we we are learning to do. It's something that we are already doing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's something that we are already doing because uh the way we overcame over the in the church ages uh is play out in symbols. In the church ages is play out in symbol. But we are living the reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to show you tonight. Let's uh throw my image up, please. Amen. So yeah, this is this is what I wanted to show you. I told you that we will come back to this. There there's a whole lot that is around here that I want for us to to to deal with a little bit. Amen. Last Wednesday we read from the book of Ephesians uh uh uh Paul says the weapons of our warfare are not cannon. He says we are not fighting against flesh and blood but we are fighting against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places. So this dark image here is is is an evil power is is a is a is a is a is a representation of the of of from the bottomless pit. It's a representation of uh a a a a dark smoke uh uh uh you know that is coming out of the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; Now you you'll see that over and over in uh in the prayer line. Brother Brandham will always identify demon power as a dark shadow. He says, "I see a dark shadow hanging over you." Amen. I have one of those picture in my in my office. I printed it for the reason. I will use it when when it's time now. So, so this is a a dark shadow representing the evil power representing demon powers that is streaming out of hell uh to attack the church. Now, you have to remember this. Now, this is a representation of the church because when the image that Daniel saw was hit in the legs, when it fell, the Bible says a great mountain &gt;&gt; grew up to that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that great mountain was the church. The image was representing the political powers. It was representing Bab Babylon, the head of gold and and and and the M. And so all the political powers that was going to be ruling the ages uh uh the Gentile kingdom was represented in that image that Daniel saw. But when the stone hit the image in his foot, the Bible says a a mountain grew. Yeah. Now, so if you go to Christ in is revealing his own word, that's what brother Brandham says God started building his church from the from the feet up because in the feet age, which was the first church age, that was where great missionary work is done. He said when it came to the Pentecostal age, it was the tongue age. So God gave them the gift of tongue. He says when you get to the tongue that is the mouth. Next to the tongue is the intelligence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the intelligence. So we are in the age of the intelligence. Praise the Lord. We will get to all of that. But this is where we want to dwarf. I'm just I'm just trying to bring you into the picture of what I want to talk about tonight. So this this image represent the church. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh uh all of this will represent each age of the church. We will we will get there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh but tonight we we we we want to look at what uh brother Brandon telling us here is that the reason why he said he taught this subject about overcoming is so we can know how to keep the spirit of revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to keep the spirit of revival. He says that it will never the spirit of revival will not die. We have got to keep in revival constantly. We have to keep in revival constantly. Revive every day. Paul say I I had to die daily that Christ should live. And we must never let that revival die in us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the church revival. &gt;&gt; The revival must never die in us. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can have a lot going on around us, but the revival, the revival of the word must never die in us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must never let the spirit of revival die. He says here, we find here that God has always had overcomers. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has always have overcomers. He had overcomers in every age. So in the seven church ages, we will read he that overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that overcome. Now you have to remember now you go back there. I mean my Bible is open here. So let me be let me be very clear before I I say something there uh uh that I shouldn't say. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go right over uh to the to the first church ages. The first church age. Sorry. And uh uh uh the Bible says, "He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit said unto the church, to him that overcometh." Now uh uh I'm I'm repeating this because it is not saying to him that will overcome. It's saying to him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the overcoming is already done. Amen. That's why Jesus said, "Be of a good chill &gt;&gt; because I have overcome the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Be of a good child." Rejoice. Rejoice. So, so what we're doing is that as believers when when we recognize the word, we recognize the message of our age and we come and receive the message, what we're doing is that we are rejoicing in his overcoming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are identifying with his overcoming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you can you can think about the quote brother Brandham says, "Oh yeah, you know, God is not going to bring you through a tube and and take you on the other side." And he says, "He that overcome the word, you have something to overcome." All of that is truth. All of that is the word. But the the truth about the matter there is that is him that overcome it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't care how hard you try. If you are not having a good chill, if you are not rejoicing that he has overcometh overcome the word, you are not going to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh uh he says uh we we have had overcomers in every age. Uh there always been every time in every age that there has been on earth, God has God has always have somebody he could put his hands on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody he could put his hands on. And you know what he's doing? He's putting his hands on me and you and picking us by the column &gt;&gt; and lifting us up. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's putting us, grabbing us by the collar &gt;&gt; and putting us over all the trials, all &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I've overcome the word. &gt;&gt; He's taking us over all the cosmos of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what? If I remind you that if we will make it, it has to be all in him. Yes. &gt;&gt; You have to grow in a faith where you know that all is in him. &gt;&gt; It is him that have done it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what I'm trying to bring you here tonight. So he says here, God has always have somebody he could put his hand on as a witness in the earth. He never has been without a witness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No matter how bad the age is, &gt;&gt; no matter how polluted, how sinful, how backsliding the people are, God will always have a witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There will always be somebody God will raise up in that generation &gt;&gt; as someone that believe his word. Somebody that fully trusted in him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has never been without a witness. &gt;&gt; Though sometime just one &gt;&gt; but somebody overcome. &gt;&gt; Somebody overcome. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you feeling like an overcomer tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel like it, you have to believe it. &gt;&gt; Believe it until you start to feel like it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh he said this. I'm going to use this as my principle that I want to use to go into what I'm what I want to go into to again he says in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith. He says, "Now all redemptive blessing to us, the human race was paid for for us at Calvary." When Jesus died for us, he said it was finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "God paid for every redemptive blessing. Whatever you will enjoy in this life in your body, in your your health, in your faith, whatever you will enjoy. It will not you will not enjoy it because you have a better preacher that now makes the message simple to you. You will not enjoy it because your life status has changed. You will enjoy it because it was paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was paid for at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now he says that it was uh when when when when he when Jesus died for us, we believe that the works and the complete plan of God. &gt;&gt; Every redemptive blessing was completed at Calvary. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be your confession tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that the works and that the complete plan of redemption, every redemptive blessing was completed at Calvary. That all of God's promises was made possible. Everything that God promised when from from Genesis 1, every seed would bring forth of his kind. It was made possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent was made possible because of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Every promises. Now follow me now. You got to follow me. It says every promises all that all of God's promises was made possible to every human being that will accept it. &gt;&gt; When are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we accepting? When Jesus died to clear the human before God at Calvary, I believe that every man I believe that every man in the world was saved when Jesus died at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Every sick person in the world was healed. &gt;&gt; When Jesus died at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now it's a finished work. Now, the thing to do is, &gt;&gt; can we get the people to see it? &gt;&gt; It's already done, but can we get the people &gt;&gt; to see it? &gt;&gt; And accept it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6. Revelation chapter 6. I would get him. &gt;&gt; Put Put the image back up for me, Emmanuel. Thank you. Revelation chapter 6. We read from verse one. Let the image stay up and uh I will do the reading. And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal, and I heard as it was a noise of thunder, and one of the four beasts, which is one of these, one of these of the four beasts is supposed to be uh the living creatures, but one of these four beasts Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the four beasts saying, "Come and what?" &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the four beasts saying, "I want you to tell me what the four bees is saying." One of the four be saying, &gt;&gt; "Come and see." I want you to say it. One of the four B saying, &gt;&gt; "Come and see. come and see because that's where we are tonight. Now remember that remember brother Brandham says everything was already paid for. Everything is a finished work but if we can only get the people to do what? &gt;&gt; To see it. &gt;&gt; To see it. Amen. Now, so I'm I'm trying to show show you how we overcame how how we overcome. How we overcome. What's the principle? That's what I'm trying to show you tonight. I don't want it to go over your head. Now, let's let's read on a little bit. I'll come back. One of the four be saying, "Come and see. And I saw and behold a white horse." This is this this one now. Amen. I saw a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Now when this evil power was go was was was traveling and trying to conquer the church, it first started by arresting Peter and John and then they whip them in the public place. They said never speak in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it went down again to grab John and they killed him and it went down again. Uh so this evil power was moving. It was it was conquering little by little. We talk about the church of Thessalica coming under persecution. It was it was all under this this uh h white house that was that was that was that was you know taking up his heels and beginning to run. Now listen now. How do we overcome? The Bible says here, one of the four beasts, which is the anointing that was in that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the anointing was the move of God. The anointing was the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go back again to uh Revelation 6:1. Don't change the image, leave the image up. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can write it down and read it. The Bible says, "And and I saw when the L Now, so there is there is uh there is there is uh another uh uh uh another player. Let me let me say it like that. Another person in the whole strip here is the lamb. &gt;&gt; When the lamb opened the book, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here we have one of the four beats. Here we have the white &gt;&gt; the white house. Amen. &gt;&gt; With bow and no arrow. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we have the &gt;&gt; the beast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But before we saw the beast, before we saw the white house, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; what do we see? &gt;&gt; That's That's right. John said, "When I saw the lamb, &gt;&gt; are we together?" &gt;&gt; Amen. When I saw the lamb, who is the lamb? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; The one that say I have overcome the word &gt;&gt; be of a good chair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The first person you must see is who? &gt;&gt; The lamb. &gt;&gt; That's that is the that is the guy that is that is particular and major in the whole thing. It's not the it's not the beast. It's not the living creature. It's not the anointing. It's not the the the the white horse, the a bow and no arrow. The first person you should see when John introduced, he said, "And I saw the lamb." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb in your trials? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb with things that are happening around you? Or are you seeing the devil power? Or are you seeing the anointing which is maybe we go to church, I feel good, I feel the presence of God, but are you seeing the land? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to overcome? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to overcome &gt;&gt; whatever you are dealing with. The first thing how to overcome &gt;&gt; the first thing you must see is the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; John said, "And I saw the lamb." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did the lamb do? Open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The lamb open. So it is what the lamb open that is now going to show us what is happening. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And until the lamb open your eyes, you will never see what is happening. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You will never see what God what God is doing in your life or why God is alive. You will not see it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isaiah says, "They have eyes, but they can't see." &gt;&gt; Why? Because the lamb did not open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; How to overcome. how to keep the revival. I saw the lamb open one of the seals. Amen. And I heard as it was a noise of thunder. &gt;&gt; All of those are are beautiful. &gt;&gt; We can get in there and start to and start to What is the thunder? The thunder is a voice of God. We can get in there and start and start and start uh you know getting into all of that. But what I want to get to you tonight is this. I heard as it were a noise of a thunder one of the four beasts. Now so when the lamb open amen &gt;&gt; I'm the one preaching tonight. I represent the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the lamb open, this is the book that was sealed. This is the book of redemption. When the lamb opened, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; From out of this book, we heard a noise of thunder. We heard the voice of God. And the voice of God is the voice of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of God is the voice of the lamb. And when you heard that voice, what did the voice say? &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; The voice call to you particular. Amen. &gt;&gt; I broke this thing. Okay, fine. I got it right. The voice called to you. Come and see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you have to remember in in in in St. John chapter one, brother Brandham always talk about Nata and Phillip. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went to call his friend and what did he say? &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; That come and see is always the voice of the lamb. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I gave you water, you drink, you never come yet again." She said, "I perceive that you are a prophet." But when the Messiah come and he says, "I am he." When she went, what did she say? &gt;&gt; Come and see. Why? Because the lamb was identified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am he." Revelation 6:1 was open. &gt;&gt; The lamb was identified. And every time the lamb is identified, you hear the voice, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every time the lamb is identified, every time the book is open, that is the reason why when a person gets saved, uh I mean uh h a joy is in your heart. I mean you you have seen something, it's so easy for you to say, "Oh, come you know you can invite somebody to it becomes so easy." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have seen the lamb. &gt;&gt; At that time you don't know you don't know the doctrine of the church. You don't know that this church they can be critical. This church they can be that. You don't know all of that. &gt;&gt; When you sit down, you become so relaxed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you start sleeping in church, that when you can see all the church problem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when you are first saved, you are on fire. You just are like that. I I just love to be in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what is happening? You have hearing the voice of the lamb. Come and see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I when I uh when I saw the lamb open one of the seal, I heard and it was like the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is the lamb Maybe I I'll have to I'll have to maybe the next time I'm talking talking on this I will have to I'll have to add to the image. I'll have to put the lamb. So it's the lamb saying to the beast come and see. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lamb is exposing this. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb is exposing the power, the spirit that is waring against the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit that is waring against our life. &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome. &gt;&gt; The lamb is saying come and see. Come look over here and see. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "We overcome by knowing the devil in all of his tricks." &gt;&gt; How do you know the devil in all of his tricks? &gt;&gt; This man that brought David down, he brought Solomon, I mean Solomon, he brought Samson, the strongest man, down. How can you know the devil in all of his tricks? You got to hide behind this anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why in every age God raised up an anointing to lead his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every age there is an anointing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are sheeps. We don't lead ourself. &gt;&gt; We stay under a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We stay under an anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the anointing that now lead the church to see the working of the devil in their age. &gt;&gt; Because you see the law of restoration says when you grab the man that come to steal and Jesus said Satan comes to do what? Steal and kill and destroy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that anointing comes, the lamb says, "Come and see. Come, I will show you. Come, I will show you." He has the book open. He said, "Come. All you behind this lion anointing, come and see. Let me show you." So the lion anointing comes and the book is in the hands of him that was wanted to take the book &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then now he's pointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, that is the reason why you can there is no Christian practice you can try to overcome. &gt;&gt; For you to overcome, you got to follow what &gt;&gt; the the anointing of your age is pointing in the word. &gt;&gt; There must be anointing that saying see come and see. &gt;&gt; This is the spirit in your age. This is the thing that is bothering you in your life. &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome. It's not fasting 21 days. It's not fasting seven days in a week. All of those things are good. Fasting and praying is a good thing. It's a good thing for the person to be able to draw nigh unto God. But you don't fast and pray to be able to get straight to overcome the devil that you can't see. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The same way that uh your anointing is invisible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able also to deal with the invisible powers that is also waring against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see that is the reason why if this age and all the the the the propaganda and all the lies and all the deception can be able to destroy &gt;&gt; your interest in listening to the messenger of your age. How are you going to overcome? &gt;&gt; It's not where all the preachers on YouTube &gt;&gt; the other preacher says this. Oh, you you know you must put the Bible under your pillow before you sleep. And the way you can get good sleep and vision, you must be able you can you can listen to all of those things. &gt;&gt; Is it said the beast &gt;&gt; is said the anointing &gt;&gt; to deal with your age. &gt;&gt; The lamb is saying to the anointing, "Come and see. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that is happening in the you think about it the early church one time they had to pour pour in a basket and and and and put him down by the war of the city so he can he can run away and all the persecution and and and and and the slaughter that was taking taking place in that in that age. It was a delified innocent &gt;&gt; as a white &gt;&gt; horse. Innocent. You look at it, it's pure. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why all through the ages, many people thought the white horse was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They thought that it was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it looks innocent, &gt;&gt; right? It can quote the scripture. It quoted it to Jesus. He will give his angels charge over you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you when you see how Constantine came in and merged with the church to many of the kind of believers, what what is wrong? We we are trying to preach the gospel to these people and they are accepting the gospel. What is wrong for for a a a man like Constantine? He's going to build us a big church. They're saying that we're going from house to house and having fellowship under the tree. We would stop it now. I mean, God is bringing wealthy people in the church. You look at it. It it it looks to be good &gt;&gt; because it's it's white. It's not a black. It's not black here. It's just white. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very innocent. &gt;&gt; Yes. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because all through the ages, men has always been trying to find way to make the work of God easy. God did not give that work to you. &gt;&gt; It's not your work. &gt;&gt; Tell it. &gt;&gt; All what we can do so so there can be peace. What we can do so I mean we can feed the spirit. What we can do, you know, let's let's uh I mean all sorts of things. Let's let's bring disco light. I mean in the evening when the light you know when the lights start changing it it makes people to move their body. We we trying to find all sorts of things to be able thing that is asked of us to be born again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are not ready to commit to that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I challenge you tonight if we should pass the paper around. You know what you think that will be able to help this church? Everybody get good ideas. Everybody get good ideas. Someone said to me the other time, brother, why why are we just only having Wednesday service? &gt;&gt; At least we can have Wednesday and Friday when the Wednesday service you are not here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When the Wednesday service, you are not here. &gt;&gt; Then you want a you want a a Friday service for who to attend? You I mean you are so concerned. You are concerned. You want a church to grow. You want a church to be spiritual. Good ideas. It can just it can just fly in our mind. But all of those good ideas is a white horse. Very innocent. No, I'm I'm just me. I'm I'm just I'm just telling you. I mean, it's just it's just my piece of advice. Praise the Lord. Don't worry, we'll have a church meeting. I will listen to all your ideas. Please don't hold them back. Okay? Don't hold them back. I won't criticize them. Don't hold them back. You you just tell me how you feel, what you think. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I have a little book uh on prayer in bounds. He says man is always looking for new method to run the church. Say God is not looking for new mentor. God is looking for men. &gt;&gt; Because the method that God started with from the beginning. &gt;&gt; If he can just get a man &gt;&gt; that will stay with it, it will produce what it produced in the beginning. &gt;&gt; We don't need new method and new ideas. We just need men &gt;&gt; that will be dedicated and committed &gt;&gt; to taking what is what we have. &gt;&gt; We have not even scratched the surface. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We have not scratched the surface. We have not even get wet in what we believe. They have not soaked us yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And yet we want to pull more over our head. Praise the Lord. Let's let's come to Wednesday service and the service is going to 10 10 p.m. in the night. We say, "Oh, I mean the the Lord is blessing the servant. The the presence of God is dead and and and I mean the the people are captured in the presence of God. So, okay, let's let's just add another day." We we can't even fulfill we can fulfill to even get it to church on time. Then we get so concerned when we so burdened. I mean if we are even having two services in a week. Praise the Lord. Put ideas for other people to to throw it. I'm not trying to be critical. I'm just trying to see to to let you to see how sometimes. Come and see. That's what the the lamb told the first anointing. Let's go down a little bit. You'll see here verse three. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast saying, "Come and see." So now it was the age of the ox. Come and see. Come and see the power that is slaughtering the church. The lamb is saying, "Come and see." And the thing about it there is that the same anointing here that was innocent has now changed its marks. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was white and innocent yet it has become red and bloody. &gt;&gt; Is the same spirit. The same lying spirit is the same thing that gossip. &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit that that commit adultery. It's just the same spirit. They are not different. &gt;&gt; It's just the same spirit taking another form. It's the same spirit. It was just one spirit moving to another. It just changed its mass. Yeah. It was looking so innocent. Everybody say it's a good idea. The church is getting big. The Roman people are now believing. Do you know the true believers at that time they were still gathering in house? They were not associating with what Constantine started. This group that that Paul wrote the book of Romans 12. How can we overcome is by hearing the voice of the lamb that says come and see. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know when that voice spoke in our day, you know what he said? Good morning friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said good morning friends. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When he say good morning friends on the tapes &gt;&gt; he say come and see. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm about to show you. &gt;&gt; That's it. I'm about to show you what is happening in your day. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into into spiritual warfare? &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into spiritual warfare? The Bible says he went to the prophet Jeremiah book. &gt;&gt; He went into the message of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You will never be able to see the weight of your age. &gt;&gt; You will never be able to see uh the things that is happening in your day and around you. &gt;&gt; I'm just listening to brother Ben. Where's where's my phone? &gt;&gt; Oh, I left you in the office. I just listening to him today and you were saying some things and and it it just described the day that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just describe the day. It's 9:00. I came I won't I don't want to stand for my phone and get into that and and you listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; You get into the word &gt;&gt; and if you are really in the word there is something in your daily activity &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost will pick up &gt;&gt; something you have read &gt;&gt; something you have heard &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will pick up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he pick it up, it is that voice of the lamb come and see. &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not by religious practice. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; We overcome by hearing the voice of the lamb. The Bible say they overcame by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the words of his testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the bleeding word. That's how we overcome. That's how we deal with situations. When they come, we listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; Say, "Come and see. Wash up." It's the enemy trying to do something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, then Brother says, "When you get to that place, then you realize it's not your wife, it's not your husband, it's not your brother, it's not your sister. You realize that it's the enemy &gt;&gt; because you are listening to the voice of the lamb and then the anointing of your age &gt;&gt; will not expose the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not you are just cannor. You are fighting a losing battle because all the cannon you bailing in your mind will just frustrate you. &gt;&gt; God will not honor it. &gt;&gt; He will not anoint it because it is not his word. &gt;&gt; It will make you mad. It will make you angry. You will just you will just be nervous. You will just be frustrated. Why? Because you are feeling on your own dead thoughts. &gt;&gt; You are not feeling. You are not listening to the voice of the lamb.
