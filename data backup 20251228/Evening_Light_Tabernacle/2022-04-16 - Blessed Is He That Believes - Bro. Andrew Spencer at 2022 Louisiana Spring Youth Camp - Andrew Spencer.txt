[Music] when the lord swept through a building said i am your champion you ought to have been there when there was a young people that decided that i'm done with that devil i was there so i guess i ought to know don't you just love the lord this morning wow what a wonderful service last night brother donnie that was tremendous we certainly appreciated the word of the lord and what an honor it is to be here in this meeting i certainly appreciate brother tim and his his kindness and his his friendship throughout the years with tim has been a real friend to my dad and a real help in this trial brother tim's been a real real help to me throughout my my life in ministry and i counted a real privilege to be standing here today and i feel just honored to be standing before the purchase of god today amen if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the book of matthew book of matthew chapter 21. what an honor it is to be standing here preaching sorry brothers but with my favorite my favorite preacher brother ron spencer i got a reason i got a reason why he's my favorite and i i sure do appreciate him i got a feeling i'm not i'm not alone in locking him here amen let's just speak to the author of the word before we speak this morning how many here has a need that you'd like to take before the lord god is mindful of every single one of your needs and don't just lift your hands out of tradition just now but lift your hand because of that need that that is meaning unto you god is able to meet your need this morning whatever it may be god can meet it let's just speak to him father god we come to you today in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ what an honor it is to be able to call upon your name lord there's no other name under heaven and earth where men should be saved but by the name of jesus christ we know that there is a time that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord and while we have this opportunity father we want to bow before your name and we want to worship you in spirit and in truth and father we pray today that you would come amongst us by the power of your holy spirit father and that you would move across this congregation these young people they walked in here one way they walked in here delivered they walked in here set free they walked in here maybe with different things on their life but may they walk out of here father today lord saying and screaming and shouting the victory today i pray that your blessings flow lord and that you would help us to get out of the way just now father the greatest gift that i have is to move aside lord may you just take us and use us for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen matthew chapter 21 verse 1 and before we before we read this morning well branham said in the ephesian church age he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches how tragic that it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ matthew chapter 21 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethpage under the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an ass tied and a coat with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say odd unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the full of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass in the coat and put on them their clothes and they sat on him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the from trees and straw them in the way and the multitude that went before that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this amen john chapter 4 and verse 23 brother branham goes up there and he grabs that matthew 21 he said what was it it was prophecy that was being fulfilled and that which was prophecy was just now made history and i believe that history is being made right here in this service today john chapter 4 and verse 23 jesus saying speaking unto the woman at the well but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you today today from this text on blessed is he that believes he's been dying all week to take take that coat he literally died but blessed is he that believes this is him we realize that we are living in an hour when we look over into malachi chapter 4 that that we realize that that that we're living in an hour of an hour of a great and dreadful day and truly as you look out upon the face of laodicea and the world that we are accustomed to you can see that it's a very dreadful day for the world that we're living in and but this is not the hour of the dreadful for the bride of jesus christ but this is a great hour and we realize that that we've got more we've got more criticism and we've got more doubters and we've got more skepticism than we've ever had but this is not the hour of the unbeliever but this is the hour of those that are blessed to be able to believe and this i know that we've got every critic and every every devil in hell that is staring down the church of the living god that is that is looking at her and seeing whether that she can handle the battle or not seeing whether she can accept the challenge or not but i want you to look as you as you saw last night their israel had been sitting up there on that hill for 40 days and they were listening to that boast their unbelief kept them up there on that hill but it was the faith of a little david that brought him down off of that hill it was not his unbelief that brought him down there it was his belief in what god called him to do and you recognize that that we are in an hour that this is a restoration hour where the heart of the children's have been turned back to the faith of the fathers and only the children will listen and here we are in that day where we are listening once again to the spirit of truth in this hour and brother branham would say that every man that's ever amounted to anything in life or a heal of beings has been a man who trusted him that know that he was the son of the living god the incarnate jehovah here on earth yes sir so if you're going to amount to anything in life young people you got to believe in something and if you don't believe in jesus you are in a perfect spot to be able to find him so well i'm lost as lost can be well praise god that means that you can be saved you say well i've been through all kinds of chaos just to get to this spot you are in a perfect p a perfect place to come to perfect peace and you are blessed to be able to be in the building you're blessed to be able to come to camp you're blessed to be sitting in the atmosphere of the holy spirit you're blessed this morning the bible said blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord jesus said when he was preaching his first first sermon up there on the mountain in matthew chapter 5 verse 3 said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled let's say that together for they shall be blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say it shall say all men are of evil against you falsely for my sake but rejoice but rejoice and be exceeding glad for great as your reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets which were before you brother branham would say in redemption by power he said you're always pointing at how wicked the world is getting he said but you fail to see how powerful the church of the living god is getting at the same time yes we've got every devil yes we've got goliath standing on the hill but you fail to see how powerful there's a young people in the house of the living god this morning oh she might be little in a flock oh she might be there maybe not big in stature but she's standing on her feet she recognizes who she is she knows what she is not so she knows what she is if you know you're a child of god you know you're not a sponsor satan if you know you were born in the fire you know that you are not going for the peace you are born for victory oh she might be little oh she might be in strangers it might be low enough but there is strength in unity young people it's not strength there's not strength in numbers but there's strength in oneness when you are in the same mindset of the holy spirit you watch what god is going to do in this service when they got up there in the upper room they were all in there with one mind and one accord and they got up there and they started seeking the promise that god had given unto them we say well i don't know whether it can be done for me jesus said with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible he said in mark 9 23 he said if you can't believe all things are possible to him that belief brother man i'm in the jehovah gyra series he said to believe the word is to receive the word and let it become life he said now god's showing there that he was confirming this covenant it has to be that way the church not an organization not a denomination but the individual and god has become the same spirit that's god's purpose in the beginning adam and eve was the same spirit so you recognize it's got to be the same life it's got to be the same power that'll make you a believer that'll make you that'll make you walk in the same attributes in the same words that he did again he said now remember the spirit comes upon and the spirit that's in the church the real church the true church god's church god's people the spirit that's in them is the same spirit that is on christ with a promise so you recognize that there's a spirit born people here that is sitting in the house of the living god their spirit they have the same spirit that jesus did they had the same life that jesus had but he said they have the spirit with a promise so you recognize that you are abraham's seed this morning you have you have the faith of abraham but you have the spirit with a promise and jesus brother adam said that that promise was that the works that i do shall you do also so you have his spirit but you have a promise he said well it can't be me abraham i want to tell you in your weakness it can be done for you you say well brother andrew you don't know where i came from and you don't know where i'm going you don't understand what i've been through just take a look at abraham's life abraham left his family abraham had to get away and separate himself from his brother from his nephew from everybody else but i want to say abraham i want to say just like sarah well just like when melchizedek when he was up there at that tent how did he know that sarah was sarah was back there in that tent how did he know that their name has already been changed it must have been the one that had changed their names how does he know how to talk to you today after you had a night like you had last night it must be the same one sarah begin to laugh me have pleasure with my lord and my condition i battled this disease i battled this sin all my life i battled unbelief all my life sarah is there anything too hard for the lord remember abraham what i told you i am your shield i am your buccal i am your great and exceeding greatly reward ishmael is not your heir sarah you got a promise over you young people you got a promise over you let me speak to that promise you will receive the baptism of the holy ghost you will be set free sarah you are going to bring forth a miracle you're a part of the miracle when sarah laughed brother branham said that god god could have had a right god could have had a right to kill her right there because she laughed in his face but because she was apart [Applause] but because she was a part of abraham god could not slay sarah sarah let me speak to you stop trying to have your miracle through everybody else stop trying to have it through hagar stop trying to have it through the handmaids young people stop trying to put the new birth over on your pastor stop trying to put it off for somebody else stop trying to put it off on your neighbor or this one or that one sarah there's a miracle that's got to come through you young people there's a new birth that's got to come through you you will produce what you are called to produce god sent a promise and he had somebody that was willing there to receive what he had said [Applause] hallelujah there's a predestinated people that are in a spot to be able to receive the promise because god doesn't send his promises in vain god doesn't send his word in vain if he said he'd heal cancer [Applause] then there ain't nothing too big for erica parker there ain't nothing too big for ron spencer there ain't one devil in hell that can stand in front of the power of the church of the living god brother branham would say that if you've got a shadow of that power you can grow out and create a new world i ain't one to create a new world i'm simply wanting to live in the world that i was built to live in not the world of unbelief not the world of sickness not the world of stigmas not the world of complexes but the power of the holy ghost in the church of the living god oh blessed is he that believes this is him i'm gonna i'm gonna stack up your problems for a minute you don't know where i came from you don't know the star pass that i came from you don't understand the demographics of my family you don't know how we were broke up when i was a young person you don't know what my mother's been through you don't know what my father's been through and because they went through that it sent me down a roller coaster of emotion and this is what you got god ain't wasting his time picking out the wrong ones if god told you he called you if god told you he told you he didn't choose you because he knew that you would go down into pete he knew what rahab was he knew what she was doing he knew her career he knew what she'd been through but he knew what she would do with the word he knows what you'll do with this word you're not going to leave it down there and say it's with somebody going on it's for the days of miracles that pass the days of the pouring out are passed god knows what you're going to do with this word you're going to accept this word you're going to become this word [Applause] and i saw another mighty angel come down there's a people on earth that's been fellowshipping with elohim they've been fellowshipping just like abraham was fellowshipping with him he had communion with him he sat at his feet he fed him abraham i want you to know everything that you have need of i'm putting on the inside of you i'm giving you a power i've given you a power that'll make you produce what you couldn't do in your own flesh oh you can try all you want to in your flesh and you'll never produce this you'll never produce this message but what god has put on the inside of you is for you it's for you it's for you it's for you what god has put on the inside of you is capable of a body change i'll tell you your miracle is so powerful that kings will look on that and lust after it the kings of the world are looking on a young people that can live out this last day message and they're lusting after it you remember when abraham and gassera had went up there to to gorier now sarah if anybody asks you if anybody asks you you just tell them you're my sister don't tell him about the power don't tell him about the promise don't tell him about who we met up there and when the king of guerrero looked out upon her he did not look out upon her and say you know what i would like to have another woman in my kingdom he didn't say well i'd like to have another handmaiden in my house i'd like to have another dishwasher in my house this king had an expectation to make her his wife and god visited him in his night seasons and said if you touch her you're as good as a dead man [Applause] i'll say this that the king of this world has got an expectation that he's going to try to take the spirit of your womb and try to contaminate your womb with a serpent seed with unbelief with all kinds of things but god's got a promise over you young people touch him and your curse touch him you're good as a dead man his expectation was cut off you start talking about the expectation of the king how to preach right there had a preach right there the expectation of this king was wanting to demolish what god was building up the expectation of this king was wanting to demolish what power that you have he's tried to cram cigarettes alcohol pornography and all kinds of things in your life try to shut down the move of god try to tell you that you're not good enough trying to tell you you've been too bad trying to tell you you can't have it it's just for brother tim it's just for brother donnie it's just for brother on he's tried everything that he can to stop the move of god but his expectation was cut off his expectation was cut off but let me give you a promise proverbs 24 and 13 says that your expectation shall never be cut off what you walk in here for expecting the king of kings to come to your courts your expectation will not be cut off young man your expectation will not be cut off young girl i come here seeking the baptism of the holy ghost you're gonna get it [Applause] you're gonna get it god knows what you're to do with the word he knows what you're going to do with it we're living in an hour where everybody's trying to substitute the baptism of the holy ghost wow you know what i'll tell you what you do you just shake the preacher's hand and you got it just play the tapes and have a tape player in your home and bless god you got to toke it if that's the token then why are you being you and i being in here we ain't even playing tapes no more we're playing it on our iphones we're playing on our mp3s so if you want to get literal about it it ain't tape players that god's coming back for it ain't mp3 players that he's coming back for it ain't sd cards that he's coming back for god ain't scared of your tape player anyway he's scared when you start listening to those tapes and you take that tape and you start manifesting what was on that tape is he that believes this is him well let's substitute it let's substitute it for easy believe this brother round's a prophet hallelujah i believe it i i've got the pictures on my wall i've got the pillar of fire in my home i've got him sitting there in 1951 in houston i've got that i've got brother branham's picture in my wallet i carry it around i've got the token that's what the devil's wanting you to believe he's trying to give you a substitute for the holy ghost but jesus said marvel not that i have said unto you you must be born again there is no substitutions for it you must be born again [Applause] i know it's hard to believe but one time i was in school and i'll get you later one time i was in school and i'll tell you the best days of my my school career was when we had a substitute you knew when you had a substitute you weren't going to do no school work you weren't gonna have no homework bless god you was probably gonna watch a movie that day you weren't gonna have no schoolwork you weren't gonna have no homework basically you had the day off and when you try to take a substitute you're trying to pre-create a vacation for the believer but there is no vacations for the believers young people you already got a target on your back and a substitute will never work but if you got the real thing oh i ain't talking about some coca-cola i ain't talking about some gatorade but when you got the real tank when you got the main thing when you got the holy spirit hale don't know what to do with you brother phillip when you got the real thing you see that's what god's strategy is to do is to come and take empty vessels and fill them up brother branham said in oneness he said you were made with a place to empty out so that god could come and fill it up and god's strategy is to take empty vessels and shake the world with them and i'm looking at a bunch of earth shakers world shakers lay out of sin shakers and when the god of this bible becomes the god of your life hell better watch out depression better looked out it's your last day with me devil it's not blessed is he that disbelieves it's blessed is he that believes for you are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and i will walk in them and i will be their god and they will be my people faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god hebrews 11 6 says without faith it is impossible to please him for he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him brother would say that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as a substance and when there's when it's there there ain't nothing going to shake you from it there ain't nothing gonna shake you from me you can line up every depression devil you can line up every cancer devil you can line up every devil in hell but you'll not stop this move of god you'll not stop these young people you say well you don't know what they're going through let me just go ahead and prophesy you'll not stop these young people you better be careful brother andrew getting out there too far in pentecostalism and going out there and prophesied absolutely not they just took and tried to substitute what was meant for you and i this ain't mind over matter this ain't just speaking what you want this is the sovereignty of almighty god god knew what brother branham needed up there when he was hunting him squirrels he knew what hattie wright was going to ask for before she ever asked it he knew what you came into this camp for he knew what you'd come begging for he knew what you needed you're not gonna walk out here the same way you walked in here there's somebody in our midst that's bigger than me that's bigger than this ministry it's him blessed is he that believes this is him what that little blind girl up there in memphis what was she doing was she doing up there she wasn't looking for william branham she was looking for the gila screaming for her daddy you may not even know who you got a hold of just for a minute jacob you may not know who you gotta hold up but you just hold on just for a minute everything you have need of is behind those lapels it ain't william pratt you get ahold of the same one that that little blind girl got a hold of you'll find your daddy your daddy's been looking for you he sent you to this camp knowing that you would get something helping and praying that you did something your mama didn't just pay your way so that you could come down here and get excited and get emotional he's wanting you to get your eyes open oh blessing is he that believes this is him if you can give me to the healer i'll find my daddy brother andrew if you get me to the healer i'll find my way back home it might be a water tower in your space young soldier boy but your amnesia is getting ready to leave you when that young boy started walking up there his vision started returning i remember that camp experience i remember being in that home i remember that hillside i remember climbing up that mountain and shouting glory glory glory i remind myself of going down that valley and he was there all the way he was helping me every little bit that you went through the promises there's no weapon that's formed against you i shall prosper if god before me who can be against me i can do all things through christ soldier boy keep walking soldier boy keep walking amnesia's leaving phillip because you looked at a water tower and this was broke off of you philip god ain't done yet god ain't done yet god ain't done yet young people god ain't done with you yet the devil's trying to tell you that you're finished that you'll never win you'll never be victorious but you've got something on the inside of you that satan cannot handle when the god of the bible becomes more than a god of william branham that becomes your god hell don't know what it's messing with brother adam when god did somebody that's so tuned to the spirit i believe what you're looking for is right here if you can just turn me loose just for a minute and let me operate young girl you just let me operate just for a minute i believe everything that you're looking for is right here blessed is he that believes this is him young girl if you just let loose just for a moment i know you're trying to hold on to me i know you're trying to hold on to me but it ain't the flesh you got to let me loose just for a minute so i can work the works of god let me lay my hands on you because there's a promise in laying hands let me loose just for a moment let the holy spirit loose in this place just for a moment to operate in this atmosphere and you'll find everything you have need of she didn't need william brown to find her daddy after she met the healer the healer was leading her back to her daddy you'll find your way to every promise you'll conquer every day for you win every battle and with jesus up there and you go reading matthew chapter 11 when jesus starts talking about john the baptist and john the baptist up there in prison and he starts he starts telling his disciples you go up there go up there and find out if this is him that is to come or are we looking for another now he's already seen jesus a player on the jordan river he's already seen him up there and he's seen what he was doing he's seen he said this is the lamb of god he said my brother brandon said his eagle's eyes got filmed over and he got up there in prison and he started telling his disciples go up there and ask him brother branham i go you go and listen to the forgotten be attitude brother branham goes up there and he said he said now john when john was up there in prison he said he didn't go up there and give him a book on how to be happy in jail he didn't give him he give him he didn't give him a book how to be patient in jail he said but you go back and you show john you just stay here for a little bit let you just stay around this camp for a little bit the blind are seeing the death or hearing the lame are walking those that were diseased or set free you don't need a book you just show them the signs just stay right here just stay right here for a moment and you watch what's going to take place go show john go show go show your parents what happened in camp go show them what took place here go show them that your eyes are open go show them that you're not walking the way you once walked because you got a hold of somebody but jesus said blessed is he that's not offended in me he said tell john everything's right on schedule i'm moving right into playing of god i'm moving right in here everything's working right according to it's working i know your eagle's eyes are filmed over but you can fly back up here but bless it is he that's not offended in me and today we live in a society of men that who are ashamed of jesus they're ashamed to call on his name they're ashamed to stand for truth they're ashamed to say that they're identified with the message of the hour but this ain't the hour of the unashamed this ain't the hour of the ashamed it's the hour of the unashamed for the bible said in job chapter 2 that i will restore unto you the years that the cankerworm and the palmer worm and the caterpillar and all those that are eating off but you shall eat and plenty and my people not the goofballs up there in washington not those bunch of hippies up there in washington dc but my people shall never be ashamed paul said i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is a salvation under those that believe the seal of pentecost is the believer's credentials it's your credentials young people the ceo of the baptism of the holy ghost is your credentials your credentials to say that i am qualified to handle the task i am suitable for this situation so in other words i am here to do what only i can do ain't nobody else going to take your place ain't nobody else going to do your job but i am here to do what i do i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ i'm not ashamed of the moving of the holy ghost i'm not ashamed of these young people and their worship [Applause] brother branham said that there is a necessity of the return of the dynamics of the holy ghost it's a redistance necessity of this hour is the return of the dynamics it's bringing you back into a pentecostal experience where you come in contact with a living god that will not leave you the way that you walk in here but you are coming in contact with the person and the person is the message brother brown would say he said i'm afraid too many times we're getting the people to church instead of getting them to christ if i can get you to christ you won't need me to hold your hand you won't need me to pump you up you won't need me to stir you up you won't need me to walk with you you won't need me if you can meet him i'm pumping you up anyway i'm just preaching you to the word of god and the word of god will pump you up and it'll stir you up the word of god will move you into a condition to believe like never before well you're just stirring them up let me go ahead you're just stirring them up brother andrew you you brother donny brother ron y'all just stirring them up yes we are we're doing it the bible way though paul said stir them up by the way of remembrance so if i'm going to stir you up let me serve you up by the way of remembrance you remember that dirty rotten scoundrel that talked you into doing that dope and making that bad deal let me stir up your remembrance and say and do you remember when he was defeated at calvary let me stir you up one good time do you remember i was savior you ought to have been there so let's stir up the church of the living god and say he's still a champion he's still a mighty conqueror he's still a devil destroyer he's still a devil defeater and i'm still a serpent bruiser we're not going to leave one hook behind it's my credentials i'm qualified to do what i do shamgar was qualified to do what he was doing up there and he grabbed a hold of that when he grabbed a hold of that ox goat he was qualified to do what he was doing he said all i've been is a farmer all my life but i'm sick and tired of the devil coming in and robbing my joy and robbing my spiritual food in due season i'm qualified i'm qualified to do what i do and let me just work just for a moment i remember that my great-great-granddaddy abraham received a covenant with god and i am a circumcised israelite i recognize who i am and there ain't no depression there ain't no philistine there ain't no suicide spirit that's going to stop me going to stop my family it's going to stop me from doing what i'm going to do same door it's time you take your oxygen and start whipping the devil instead of taking a whipping from him it's a return of the dynamics when they got up there on the day of pentecost they were up there in one mind they were up there in one accord they were up there under one plan and that was to receive what god spoke that you after the holy ghost has come upon you that you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power you see he'd give them a promise what were they up there doing they were up there believing let me let me just draw back for a moment what are you doing here you're here believing you're believing that all things are possible you're believing he's as good as his word you don't just believe he can you believe he will you have not walked into this camp to leave here as the ordinary young people you've left here you've come here to be a powerhouse brother burden said in the stature of the perfect man brother rham said that god didn't send me to build denominations he sent me to build individuals to be power houses to be abiding place by the spirit of the holy ghost let me say our young people cannot be built upon knowledge our young people cannot be built upon intellectualism our young people cannot be built upon psychology our young people cannot be built upon emotion our young people cannot be built upon they cannot be built upon feelings and they cannot be built upon dead religion and neither can they be built upon legalism because when you try to move legalism in you're only simply trying to confine their worship to the true and living god so if we're going to build them up on something that's built them up on the up on the most holy faith i'm looking at a bunch of powerhouses today that are containing the same power that was up there in that upper room they were up there waiting they were up there seeking they were up there believing and god was going to send an action to their reaction you're here believing you're here speaking and you're gonna get what you asked for he said ask that your joys might be full well i'll tell you what brother andrew i'm gonna fleece god i'm gonna fleece god just like gideon if god will let me have the front row in this camp i'll really do some dancing i really get the baptism of the holy ghost you might as well go ahead and surrender yourself because you're going to lose i'm going to fleece god if god will heal my mama cancer then i'll believe him if god will heal my daddy cancer then i'll believe him no you won't they did the same thing with jesus if you really did raise lazarus from the grave why don't you come over here we got a whole graveyard full of them really if you've got the power of the spoken word why don't you just speak the seed into the young people let me tell you you know how to get that dirty line devil out of your life i love that last time god dispersed those seeds and the holy ghost knows where that seed is god knows what you've been through god knows what peter been through god knew what mary had been through but they got up there regardless of themself regardless of their circumstance regardless if their favorite preacher was preaching regardless regardless what james did regardless what john did regardless what philip did make your way into this room make your way into this room everything you have need of is in this room mary mary you may have carried him at birth you marry carried him for nine months you may have fed him all your life you may have fed him and took care of him but now you're getting ready to receive something mary you're getting ready to receive something you pushed him out of you but now he's going to push himself into you because you had the faith to believe mary is the only woman that could say i got him back twice i got him twice oh i say god give me a double portion of your spirit and they took god at his word and brother branham said it's a death structure satan when man begins to take god at his word let's send a death stroke down to hell today god i come here for one purpose and that was for you i didn't come here to be seen i didn't come here to be felt i didn't come here to get emotional i come here to get you i come here to take you at your word you're gonna walk out of here blessed bless if you believe we need a repeat of pentecost let me give you some quotes so you don't think i'm just preaching for my intellect don't worry i ain't gotten on that anyway if he can only get away get you away from the doubters that say all the days of miracles has passed if he could ever get you away from the people that says there is no more feeling of religion the heartfelt religion that your father's bled on the battlefield for there's nothing to it if he can ever get you alone one time and all your ideas shut outside he could get if he could ever get a group of people together like that there would be a repeat of pentecost he said in the message here ye him he said if we can only have obedience to those three words you'll see a repeat of pentecost in this building he said if you're without the holy ghost today this might be the very time where god will repeat pentecost again in another few minutes from now this building may be illuminated with the power of the god people going out of here with the baptism of the holy spirit i put an amen behind it he said if he said it could be possible tonight and also probable that it would be there could be an hour or this next hour on that clock there wouldn't be one center or one backslider left it here without being right with god it could be that every sick and afflicted person could be made well and go out of here glorifying god this could break into a repeat of pentecost if the atmosphere gets right he said the atmosphere to bring such results would be the holy spirit he said if he can ever get a heart every heart and one accord then he could just move masses and heal the people and save the people or whatever he has died to redeem them and every redemptive blessing belongs to the individual i want you to believe that christian this could break into the atmosphere and be a repeat of pentecost brother brown said he said it's the hardest thing to do is to get people in the atmosphere to believe he said but it's also an atmosphere like this that eagles are born in and you watch up there in that upper room they got up there and what was born it wasn't a bunch of chickens that were born it was a bunch of eagles that were born and when they jumped out of there they were scared in one scripture brother branham breaks into that upper room he walks up there and he said he walks up there he walks up the outside of those steps and goes up in their upper room and there's a lamp in that room he said they were up there he said they were not kneeling he said they were sitting and all of a sudden the holy ghost sat on them and they began to speak in other languages here peter was a jew but he come out speaking galilean and they said how do we hear every man in our own language these must be drunk and peter stood up and said these young people ain't drunk as you suppose but this is that that was prophesied by the prophet joel and what they were watching out there on the street was the effects of pentecost what you're watching in your young people is the effects of pentecost you know they weren't known as pentecostal those 120 that went up here in that upper room they were not known as we would call them pentecostal until the event of his coming you are not known as message believers until the event of his coming and this is him that has come down you're not just known as a bunch of other church goers as another group but you're known as a final voice to the final h you're known as serpent bruisers you're known as a real true church of the living god you're not a church no more i'll call you bright so you understand it ah just settle them down all right if these be quiet go up there and luke and start riding with jesus on that donkey one good time and those pharisees said why don't you quiet them young people why don't you shut down the move of god can i give you jesus one for a moment if these don't cry out the rocks will cry out i ain't never seen a rock i never seen erotica cry in my place and i ain't gonna let one cry now if god's still god and his word still the truth let's praise him praises brings the blessings of god down on the people you've been waiting for your moment this is your moment [Music] blessed is he that believes this is him hold them back hold them back oh no the bible said praise the lord praise him in the firmament of his power praise him with a loud sound and symbol praise him on a low sounding symbol let everything that hath breath praise he the lord i praise him i got a reason to praise him my mama have been sick with psycho doses the doctor said when psychologist was defeated i had a reason to praise him i got a reason to praise him brother ron cancer is defeated in the name of jesus christ young people you got a right to praise him you got a right to bust out of this upper room you got a right to shout you got a right to dance you got a right to let loose all things are possible to them they believe i'm afraid to worship i'm afraid that's what we've got today is a bunch of secret service worshipers they're afraid to be seen worshipping they're afraid to be seen praising they're afraid to be seen speaking in talks they're afraid of their new birth and what might it make make them do brother brown said i don't care he said of the holy ghost he said i want to come to god's level he said i want to go up to his level he said if he makes me speak in tongues talk in tongues grow in tongues then let me grow in trunks let me do what he wants me to do i ain't no secret service worshiper i ain't afraid to get caught they tried to shut blind bartimaeus down but he said even so david [Applause] he's already passed you he come by here on friday night he's already past you shut up shut up he's already paid you've already passed your moment you were born that way you were born with fat disease you were born with that depression you were born with that eyesight put blessing are your eyes for you have not seen blessed is he that readeth and understand the sayings of this book seal it up until the day it's time to be loose blessed is he that believes you can sit there and your blindness all you want to and i don't know why i'm going to blindness today but here we are blessed is your eyes for you see this ain't me this ain't brother donnie this ain't brother tim's emotions this ain't brother tim's desire this is the holy ghost desire what made brother tim desire to have this camp over 30 some years it wasn't his own ego oh let me just go ahead and cut him off it wasn't his ego it wasn't because he wanted to be a big name preacher he had a desire for young people to get the same power that he watched in william branham be exuberated in the church of a living god he's already passed you young boy he's already past you he's already passed you it's already past you he's already walked past your way you've done sitting away your day of grace but if you felt like i felt if you've been blind like i've been blind sometimes you will not get your blessing until you start acting like you were born to act if blind bartimaeus would have stayed better in that condition if he'd have stayed there in that spot if he were to listen to the crowd if he will listen to the naysayers some blessings you will not get until you start acting like a pentecostal hey hey thou son of david have mercy on me he's past you no he ain't past you lemuel he came right to where you are but it was your scream it was your voice if you say to this mountain be plucked up and move from yonder god's wanting your voice malachi god's wanting your voice titus god's wanting your voice nathan god's wanting your voice young girl if god ain't done nothing for you you still ought to be able to praise him you still ought to be saying thank you lord but let me have a moment with you but because you ain't never been through a battle and because you ain't never faced something you ain't never had to cry out but i've had to cry i've had to beg i've had to ask i've had to seek him i've had to ask god [Music] i can't handle this on my own i'm only asking that you believe me i'm only asking that you believe me free forever bartimaeus you're not walking back to that hole no more you're not gonna sit there no more you're free you're free the son of man's looking on you you're free and when the sun is set free it's free indeed don't you worry about it no more don't you feel with that no more what you battle through what's a victory don't let the devil try to talk you back into that defeat no more i brought you to this hour for such a time as this your name is not defeat your name is victory your name is not suicide your name is not depression your name is a child of the most high god you docked thou spirit of hell i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ god knows where he can put this power at by the way jesus said you try to put this you try to put this wine and no bottles it'll blow up he knows where he can put it at you see god has built the mechanics in such a way that it can handle the dynamics when it comes you try to put rocket power on the inside of a pinto that baby's gonna blow up my wife drives like that sometimes thinking she's got rocket power or she tries to move like she's in that other dimension already like a thought akin to richard petty from north carolina baby hold on i ain't got enough insurance to cover that rocket come back down here in this forward for a minute god didn't put rocket power on the inside of a ford because he knew he couldn't handle it god didn't put rocket power on the inside of the methodist because they knew that they couldn't get no higher than the horse and buggy god didn't put rocket power on the inside of the westlands because they knew they could only drive an automobile god didn't put rocket power on the inside of pentecost as a restoration of guests but he put rocket power in astronauts that were born to live up here and born to move in a dimension that they would live built to live in you had the capacity young people to move into the holy ghost and to move into a spot where the church of the living god was destined to move in you were built for this moment you were built with the capacity brother branham said that here's the easter message the mechanics and the dynamics are together they're together in this building they're together in this moment they're together here in the house blessing is he that believes this is a return of the dynamics come to a close brother america preach is a powerful series in 1959 on the holy ghost what is the holy ghost and what was the holy ghost given for and then he preaches questions and answers on the holy ghost i admonish you to go listen to it it'll do you some good laurel baron comes in there and question answers on the holy ghost and he goes in there and you go listen to it you verify what i'm saying and he said he said there were two things that came behind it to vindicate what i was saying there was a tongue and interpretation that broke out and he said it vindicated the message that was brought forth he said and there they were saying blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord and he said something caught me real quick and said otherwise blessed is he that believes this is him and he said there my sister dolores was sitting there and he said the devil was going around telling people to set steel sit still shut up shut up a dumb devil talks to you talk back and do it like a dummy you big dummy set steel the devil walked through there after that vindicated message and was telling people to set steel don't don't receive it set still well you know if the devil's telling you to sit still it must be something about you getting up well go ahead get out get up get up get up i am sick and tired i'm telling let the devil tell us to sit still and go back to our homes but if you felt like i felt you couldn't sit still you couldn't hold yourself you couldn't contain yourself i'm sick and tired of having every child of god sit there and listen to a lying devil this ain't the time to set still it's a time to get up get up in the power get caught up in it get caught up in the holy ghost hallelujah we will not sit still and listen to every cold formal devil no more we're the childs of the most high god get up the lord said bill bill while you was a preacher while you was a preaching bill i felt like i could just get up and jump and shout he said that was a time to get up and jump that was when those people got to shout i felt like i was a little old nothing he said that was a devil that was a devil trying to tell you that was the devil trying go to listen go to listening to oneness of unity he said brother baram said that devil's hissing he's a hissing trying to make you believe him but we will not believe the devil we will not believe his kingdom we will not believe his oppression spirit blessed is he that believes when david pulled that rock out he was already committed he was already committed let me tell you once you get the rock in your hand you're already committed the book of psalms says that when i'm overwhelmed i will run to the rock when you get the rock out of your hand you're already committed david didn't ask himself you know what that's my favorite rock you know i was out there in alabama and i was i was out there in that mud puddle and i was digging for frogs and i found this rock it's my favorite rock i'm afraid to lose it david you should have never pulled it out your script back i was listening to the great warrior david the other day and brother brahm said he he would take that he'd take that script back had that medicine in there he had a little honey in there had a little honey in there and he said with no sheep because he was a shepherd he'd take that honey and he'd pour it on that limestone rock and those sheep go to licking on that rock and they'd get the nutrients from that rock brother baron said when david put those rocks down in that script bag when he pulled it out it had honey all over it had honey all over brother branham said you are like that and you got honey all over you god's got a rock when he got you god got a rock when he got you brother god got a rock when he got you i got honey all over me just go licking this rock it's my favorite rock but i am committed i'm committed god knew when he chose me i'd be somebody and be committed to tearing every devil down telling our young people you won't live in defeat you won't go down to feed it [Applause] do i hold this for myself and keep all this joy for myself you know i was back there on the desert and i found out how to use this thing it was the same rock i could tell you it was the same rock that took out a bear it still got blood on it it was this rocket took down a line now i'm just using this for emotion i'm just using it for that just to gear it just for a moment because we know david walked down in that valley and grabbed him rocks but i ain't talking about a rock i'm talking about you it was the same rock that killed depression it was this same rock that killed that suicide spirit it was the same rock it was the same rock that said i'm sick and tired of living with a pornography demon on my life i'm sick and tired of lust i'm sick and tired of the power of hell do i keep this rock for myself or do i let loose do i let loose do i let it loose and free all the children of god paul said in romans 8 that this is the liberty of the children of god it's time young people that you let your rock loose for a moment let yourself loose blessed to see you that believes [Applause] it won't be unbelief that defeats cancer it won't be unbelief that defeats your enemy but it'll be your faith in the most high god when that mother that little mexico woman i didn't let the musicians come when that little mexican woman her little baby had died early that morning she said i got to get somebody that's higher than me she went through the water with a dead baby she went through trials with a dead baby all day long she'd been carrying this thing a dead baby another said you know what you might as well just bury it it ain't for you you can't have it it'll never come to life again but something on the inside of her it was a paradox it was unbelievable but it was true she believed here she was a catholic woman with this type of faith what about you to do today you said here under the greatest ministry that's ever been released what are you do today with your faith will you sit there and pity yourself for everything you've been through or will you sit there and get up it's been easy to go ahead and marry it'd have been easy pushed her to get into the presence it was an unbelief that got her there it was an unbelief that made her push through 300 ushers it wasn't her unbelief that caused the vision brother tim it wasn't it was a faith [Music] it's a paradox why you're even in the building why are you here why did you come here did you come for the games did you come for your friends did you come to get a girlfriend did you come get a boyfriend it ain't a bad place oh y'all let's be spiritual brother andrew let's be real spiritual right here we ought to come seeking the baptism my holy ghost well sure but if we're gonna if we're gonna push our some p our young people somewhere to find a find a mate this is a good place to start what you come here for you can have all that and i'm for it but what'd you really come here for [Music] this mother decided that enough was enough i've waded through the waters long enough i've held on to this long enough [Music] you're tired of holding on ain't you why don't you let it come to life one time once you let it come to life you felt him cooing to you all day long once you let it come to life brother brother jack moore why don't you go down and pray for her she don't know she don't know me but faith calls to profit faith it's faith that walked you in this building this more it's faith that brought you here it's faith that caused you to come to this moment it's faith that's built this atmosphere it's faith and this is the time to release your faith brother graham said i took that baby in my arms i took that baby my arms he said it was wet it was cold there was no life there he said but because i had authority of a vision he said all of a sudden that baby kick started kicking started kicking he started kicking brother baron said he kicked that wet blanket off young people you have been sitting here and there's been people this hour that's tried to cool off the move of god and tell you that you can't have the holy ghost and tell you that it's not for you why don't you kick them wet blanket preachers out of your life and let the fire of the holy ghost loose in this place loose in your life loosen your heart loosen your soul say god i believe you [Music] [Music] [Music] blessed is he that believes this is him oh why don't you let your faith loose would you let your faith lose for a moment say god i need you i need your hour i need your desire i need your energy i need the passion of the holy ghost [Music] [Music] tired of that cloud hanging over you ain't you god's here to remove it and he's here to roll away the reproach god's had his eye on you the whole time he will not forget one of his own [Music] the holy ghost is for you walk into the liberty of the church of the living god this is the message that'll produce a body change and you're in it you're in it [Music] brother biscuit said when he was out there fake campfire and it was his turn to go watch brother brandon was on the first watch and he come to the second one he said when i walked up to where brother branham had been sitting at he said there was a presence there it was like a lover's room had been stepped into this is that same presence this is the angel of the covenant little donny [Music] cancer won't win it won't destroy satan will rob what he can't take [Music] you can believe this or not but three o'clock yesterday morning you walked into my room [Music] and there was a girl who walked up said daddy i'm healed and satan woke up and satan walked up in that room with me that was just you brother andrew that was just a dream that was just that was just an emotion that was just a trance and i thought if satan would battle me that hard [Music] why would i sit still in this emotion we said brother andrew how do you have that i have that by isaiah 50 he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes erica parker is healed by his stripes ron spencer is healed by his stripes temple it's made whole by his stripes esther esther blessed is he that believes this is him [Applause] reach out and touch the lord [Music] is [Music] reach out and touch the whole [Music] he's passing by this way for
