========================================

[Music] You're not there. I'll never drift from your love and care. There's not a thing about me that you don't know. [Music] The wings of the morning will take me to you. The blackness of night, your love will shine through. You're already there. No matter where I may go, even before I came to be, your loving eyes were looking at me. You're even closer than the very breath that I take. Mother and father, more than a friend to me, beginning and ending and living a life to be a song I find myself singing when I awake. Oh, I will praise you. I praise you for bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my eyes to heavenly things. For being a song I can't help but sing. Praise you. [Music] Look at me, Lord. I'm open to you. Do anything that you want to do. If you know me better, then I know myself. I'll not be afraid of what you can see. Cuz you know the inside of me. I won't even try to hide what you know so well. Now Lord, be patient with my mistakes. I want to be yours. Whatever it takes, I've learned that life without you is no life at all. Failures and talents, schemes I bring to you. Aspirations and dreams I sing to you. I'll just be here ready whenever you go. So I will praise you. [Music] I praise you. I praise you for bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my sides to heavenly things. For being the song I can't help but sing. Praise you. Oh, I will praise you, Lord. I praise you now. I praise you for bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my sights to heavenly things. For being a song I can't help but sing. Praise you. [Music] [Applause]
