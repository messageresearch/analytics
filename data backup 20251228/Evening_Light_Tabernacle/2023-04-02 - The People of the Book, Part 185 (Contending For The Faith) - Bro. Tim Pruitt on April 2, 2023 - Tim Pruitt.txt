amen amen praise the Lord How Great Is Our God aren't you glad to be serving him in a day an hour like this you can say I know in whom I have believed and I am persuaded he's able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day what a wonderful Lord that we serve today and we love our lord Jesus with all our hearts amen certainly thankful to God for being with us watching over us keeping us his end of Grace has been Upon Our Lives and each step we take we know he'll guide us we know he'll be right there with us the other day on March the 31st one of ours brother Ross Oglesby stepped over into the other dimension there were those that were waiting on him as he went home to be with the Lord and they come down to the river no doubt to to greet him and to welcome him he hadn't got through shaking hands he out in the hugging necks rejoicing as he looks around at the Wonders others come around to show him the Wonders of the beauties that are there strolling all over heaven with him showing him to different sites we never know when our last moment will come but I'm thankful for this a man that I am known for probably 40 50 years struggled a long life's way and has stumbles can never really get a grip that Jesus loved him he can believe in God he could believe that that the message that God had sent was true and was Realty to him but he just couldn't get it to accept it for himself back in about 1998 somewhere along that time that little birthday celebration versus would be his daughter-in-law my daughter Lydia he would sit down on the couch there and we'd visit for a while and I'd say to him for the Ross you know there is hope for you you haven't crossed the line God's a god rich in Mercy and he'll able to turn your life around and this this is not just for someone else it's for you and it was there that he looked at me kind of in a shock surprise and said really is that right I said yes it's true it's for you too and that day God began to do a work in his life and turned him around and over the events of time just um just some years later I was preaching a sermon called when he came to himself and there to the altar came a big huge man Ross Oglesby and melted altar and gave this life to the Lord that day he came to himself in the last few days and months that he's had where he knew he was going to not be able to stay here in a long time his time was up on Earth God did great things bringing reconciliation and Restoration in his family miraculous taking place God preparing and making the way for reservations on the other side and for a great day where we'll all be restored and and restoration will be complete or we'll all be in new bodies today we don't we don't sorrow as those who have no hope we have hope in the Lord and um you know he would be able to look at his at his son Aaron before he left and say son if you quit if Alan quits if Amanda quits that the whole family quits serving God I'm going to go on with God you know that that's the thing it becomes very personal to you it's not about what others think about Jesus is what do you do with this Jesus called Christ and there brother Ross took him and put him in his heart he was on no longer on his hands pilate had him on his hands and couldn't wash the blood of Jesus off but Ross had Jesus on his hands and he accepted him into his heart and we want to thank God for his life and his testimony and what he's meant to us and to this church his friendship his love to his family is his love to his children his wife and all that God is all his friends he loves you very deeply and we love him and he's not dead he just crossed the veil of tears and sorrow into the land of joys so we want to just ask the Lord's blessings upon the family they're going to be perhaps having a a memorial service at a later date brother Aaron Oglesby right now as I am speaking is probably winding up his service there and and um Johnson City Tennessee at brother Donnie Reagan's he just preached two wonderful meetings there for the young people and God moved tremendous brother Ron Spencer listened to it and he said man it may not made me want to get saved myself that's the way it is you know you hear the word of God he just moves down on the inside of you says I want more of you Lord and today is brother Aaron would Minister his dad made him promise you go on don't you stay here you go and minister to those young people and so there as I told him he's over there with that cloud of witnesses looking on as we continue the battle here upon the Earth so let's talk to the Lord today and ask God's blessings now upon their family footprints on the sands of time Lord we look and see the path even you said that some take a long time even a predestinated seed sometimes take a long time for the recognize their son but at some point you get it true to them you were called you were chosen you were ordained for this moment in time and place Lord we want to thank you for brother Ross his testimony his love for you we want to thank you for the Oglesby family and extended Camp family Lord I pray that you would bless each one in their own way sister Linda the children brother Allen brother Aaron sister Amanda all of their [Music] daughter-in-laws and son-in-law grandchildren bless them in a special way today Lord a little teardrop of Sorrow comes down into our hearts and sometimes rolls down our cheeks when we think about those who go on before us one day the last one will go only to be called back in just moments of time in the great Resurrection ahead we believe it's that close We Believe Lord that we're right here on the cusp of the the very coming of the Lord where we will be gathered to meet you in the air but first we'll gather with those who went on what a day of rejoicing that will be I pray Lord that you would bless us today as we just chinch the armor up a little tighter and another steps in line maybe it'd be one of his grandchildren there's a step up there and say here I want to take my place in the ranks I want to move forward as a Son of God and and step where my grandfather stood believing in the Lord with all his heart and carrying this sort of the word forward pray you'll bless the family blessed by the Aaron as he ministers today and restore strength to his body Satan attacks us in every kind of way but you're the Lord God that healeth all diseases and our hope and our trust is in you today I pray that you'll bless the word as we read it together today bless those that are assembled with us in Jesus name amen amen God bless you let's sing a little part of that song um what a day that will be we're looking for that day there is come mean a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky and No More Tears to down the eye and all his peace forever more on that happy golden Joy oh what a day a glorious day that will be [Music] today that will be who in my Jesus I shall see when I look up all his face the one who saved be by his grace for any takes me by the hand and leads me through the Promised Land who are the day a glorious day that will be we'll sing it again now what a day oh what a day that will be in my Jesus I shall see [Music] upon his face [Music] morning takes me by the hand at least [Music] a glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there there will be no sorry I have no more no more sickness no pain no more parties over there and forever [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me by the hand and leads me through the Promised Land a day a glorious day that will be praise the Lord amen we look forward to that glorious day don't we amen thank you Brothers amen God bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning to praise him to worship him to give him glory and honor that is due his great name amen remember Easter services are coming up and so Wednesday we will be going down to Dry Creek Louisiana not supposed to be dry this weekend I hear there are natural showers and I know there's Showers of Blessings coming so come and look for the rain amen the former in the latter ring being poured out together amen so we look to the Lord for Spiritual rain but pray that the natural rain can hold off for the camp it'll be really nice for that pray that way I'm sure winds tonight you were blessed by Brother Carmen Mills who ministered varus on Wednesday night he comes from New Brunswick Canada um he I I've known them through the years you know I as as I know sometimes you can't go with me everywhere that I go and and see everywhere that I am but um you know I've ministered for them since the the early 90s through some of their conventions Through The Years up there in New Brunswick brother Ivan Carr is now 93 years old he continues to minister twice a week he's my mentor it's assigned to us to never give up and if that ain't good enough God gave us Ron Spencer to kick ourselves in the rear every weekend after you hear him preach well you can't sit around and feel sorry for yourself anymore so I was just with him and brother Kelly Hildebrandt up there in Charlottesville area that's where I flew in and and um was with brother Ron and them we had a great time together sometimes a fellowship and thank you for letting me be gone in a way but like I said brother Carmen came and he ministered on when God remembers what a wonderful message and it certainly stirred our hearts this morning as I you know you just can't make all this stuff up you know that that that comes and we just saw the hand of God so much Discerning the thoughts and intents of hard and certainly um minister to us and um so you know back uh when I come home today and I turned on my computer and uh came up with my my sermon notes that I have there and I just was open up the one that I had prepared for today and was just looking at it and and just pushed the button and as I did it it just made it where I could see more than just that one but another one that was there and it opened up to one that had been on my desktop for now since December on December the 18th 2022 the people of the book part 175 I preached the sermon God remembers and so you know um again it's just a confirmation that God remembers amen and it's not that God forgets but it's the time when God is going to bring his promises to pass and I don't know if you remember or not but I just printed out just a couple of notes from there this morning there that in the Old Testament you know it always when God remembers is a call for Action it includes an action is when God starts he remembers start something starts happening and so you know he remembered Noah made the water recede you remember Rachel and opened her womb and years later her day Hebrews cried for rescue God remembered his Covenant with their their ancestors and rescued them and and uh so we're living in a time of fulfillment and it's never a time that God forgets his promises or his people because he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the creator of the universe and he doesn't suffer from memory lapses and just in case you forgot what I preached that's what I preached amen but we're not going to preach that this morning we're going to go to Genesis 18 and verse 10 and we're going to read that and let you be seated and then we'll read a scripture from the next to the last book of the Bible Jude Genesis 18 verse 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him you can be seated and here is where faith is restored to Sarah that brings about the Winds of Change that would restore her body and her place give her her place in the Covenant now turn with me to Jude chapter 1 which there's only one chapter but verse 3. and we'll read from there a couple of verses and it's from here I'm going to take my text this morning beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write into you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before a bold ordained of this condemnation ungodly men turn in the grace of our God into lasciviously lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ so today I'm going to speak to you on contending for the faith now you know again a Content means to struggle far it means to fight far to war to battle for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints and the the way that it's awarded here that once delivered uh it seems to indicate that they were already losing that Faith but they were to fight for it and and of course you know it's a day in hour where that we must fight to possess every promise of God and it is a battle and every denomination in its own way is a part of this battle they're all claiming to contend for the faith in Judah it's the only place that we read where that in the Bible we're taught to contend he said I now earnestly contend for the faith that was once to deliver to the Saints well we know the Baptists think they're contending for their for the faith and and they did they fought and they died they were terribly persecuted for insisting on adult baptism instead of infant baptism many were burned at the stake and put to the sword because they were re they re-baptized those that had been baptized as babies and this time instead of sprinkling they baptized them um by immersion and so they stood for their faith and as I said just for that amount of Truth they they contended for it and I you know you can look and you can see that they built a fort there we call that a denomination and they built a fort there on that deal and became named the fort became named Baptist well because that they believed in um baptism by immersion and and as adults and not babies because the Catholic church had always taught it differently that you're born into the Catholic church this is how you're born into the church you don't have a new birth just being born into the church makes you that and then you are you are born into it by the by the um sprinkling of the Holy Water by the priest and of course you know we we have the the Pentecostals which is one of the last day moves that they also believe that they're contending for the faith and they did they fought for an experience of the Holy Ghost and believed with in speaking in tongues and gifts of the Spirit these people fought for this and it was not without a cost but they they were shot at women you know there's there's actually testimonies of women who and and men as they rejoice in the spirit and and they were shot at Through the Windows and and the bullets would hit their dresses and fall to the floor and their churches were burned and many of them were beat actually sometimes tired and feathered oh yeah that happened here in this 19th century in the 1900s as they were beat for their stand for the truths of the Gospel they contended for that faith there was a lot of sacrifices made by men and women alike and of course before them the nazarenes which was a part of the um Holiness Movement by John Wesley they believed that they are contending for the faith but like the Pentecostals the Pentecostals have built themselves a fort and they call that Pentecost and and that they they're stationed there upon that truth of restoration of gifts of the Spirit and speaking in tongues and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as they call it and then and then of course the nazarenes did the same they built them afford on Holiness of course you know their walls are falling down and a lot of worldliness has come in and they're not nothing like they were but they were part of the Methodist move insisting on Holiness as John Wesley priesthood and they too were persecuted and kicked out of their churches and and they and and even John Wesley was kicked out of his church and and uh preached on the street corners and he would many times sing and and until a group of people a crowd would gather around and then we would begin to preach and what he preached actually of Holiness and a holy life and you know something more than than the than just um church annity and but you know something that would change you and the priest and the laity many times were offended by his sermons and they and they would hire Thugs and rabble rousers to disturb him and many of them priests felt that Wesley was preaching without being authorized to do so by the church in Medlin with the people in their town so he would be run out of town many times as he contended for the faith and during those 19 years of sermons John was pelted with rotten tomatoes and manure and stones but he refused to give up and for those 19 years this was this weekly even his daily experience he was dragged before magistrates he was beaten with fists he was pummeled with rocks and and homes where he stayed with set of Fire but you know it's so he contended for the faith and and the people that followed him build camps they built a denominations thoughts there fortifying that position of um the methodists and the nazarenes and the pilgrim Holiness and so on you know and but sadly though there may be some that still stand like the Baptists stand for immersion and though the Pentecost will still stand for the gifts and others defend certain portions of Truth yet they have progressed no further in standing for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints but if we want to see what it means to to choose to stand for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we need to go back and look at Jesus amen that what Jesus was yesterday we know he would be the same today or the scripture is wrong if we can see what he was here in his body of Flagship on the earth in his Corporal body we should be able to see what he would be in his body the church today if he's the same yesterday today and forever so you see we can look back and see what he was and then you can see then what he would be in his body the church we of course would see his body then fulfilling mark 16. and the Great Commission we would see ourselves fulfilling John 14 12 The Works that I do say you do also and Mark 11 22 if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea it shall be even as you said so what kind of Faith are we contending for I want to say today we are a people that are contending for the greatest faith that has ever been where that the early church was upon the cusp of it as doctrines was revealed and and miracles would happen in their Ministry yet Paul would say you know but but those who are asleep you know don't sorrow as those who have no hope but I tell you this the Lord will come and he he shall descend from heaven with his shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so what kind of Faith are we contending for we are we are contending for body changing faith if I could say it third pool faith and that came by the opening of the word remember that the third poll or the third phase of brother Brandon's Ministry was based on Mark 11 22. and that in that word that was revealed and restored is a dynamic power to make mountains move to cause impossibilities to become possibilities remember this this is what you are contending for for your impossibilities to become possibilities amen this Faith was demonstrated uh in in the days of Jesus by Roman Centurion and this is a faith into Gentile bride must come to the Jews never came to this kind of Faith as as Jesus would say of the Romans interior I haven't seen this Faith this kind of faith in all of Israel but I found it in a gentile amen and that Roman Centurion said Lord I'm not even worthy for you to come under my roof and you don't even have to come to my house just speak the word and my servant will live I'm on a centurion that was a man of authority over about a hundred of Rome's best soldiers and he can stand there and say I'm a man of authority I say to this man go and he goes there I say you go and fight here and you go fight and you go there and they do it they have to obey me and he knew that he was Jesus was the son of God and that every sickness and every demon was underneath him and all he had to do was speak the word not even pray he would just speak the word that's all and it would be done because every demon would have to bow to him and Obey him do you believe that this morning every demon will obey God it has to everything obeys God and it'll obey you if you have faith Jesus never limited to himself he said if you say to this mountain whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you will have them you don't realize sometimes the power that lays within your words Joshua would stop the son is that true amen you've been a lot of a lot of us say all things are possible with God but you know there's nothing impossible with him but all things are possible to you also nothing's impossible to them that believe all things are possible if God made it right and brought it right down just if you just know who God was and then know who you are is the son of God and brother Brandon would say this he said I I'm afraid the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid the Holy Ghost born man doesn't realize the authority God has permitted the church I give to you the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you were loose on Earth will be loosed loosed on Earth I'll loose it in heaven I give you power over certain serpents and every kind of disease and nothing shall harm you exercise your faith Let it Loose let God have his way God will grant it to you don't we realize when Jesus said this speak to this mountain whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them that in doing that and giving us that word he actually gave you a blank check with authority to fill it out he never limited it to anything did he he gave you a blank check whatever you need come on we don't have to wait for youth camp but if you're waiting for it go ahead and write it out amen go ahead and tell God your expectations go ahead and write out your claim amen because God is here to answer every desire ever need and you will not go away empty amount every one of you that has received the Holy Ghost you have been placed in the family of God as a son of God and with their full authority to use his name think about that the full authority to use his name Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in other words this will be the identification of those that are sending me in my name they shall cast out devils and whatsoever you ask in my name that will do John 14 3 and he repeats the same in verse 14. if you ask anything in my name I will do it you have the authority he says to use my name whatsoever you ask the father in my name he will give it to you amen that is a black Shack for every one of you today and I'll tell you what if I were you I would write it out some of you need to actually just open the fly leaf of your Bible and write out a promise write out a check say I write out a check I want my husband saved I want my wife saved I want my children saved I want healing from my body I want Deliverance in the church amen I want Harmony in my family whatever it is you right after check [Applause] Jesus told you to do so the scripture speaks of the adoptions of sons who when they are adopted they're given positions of authority the usual meaning of the the word adoption means to adopt a child is born to someone else but the Roman adoption was when us when a man's own son became a fuller age and was placed with power and authority over the father's domain and this happens to us when we receive the Holy Ghost but I want you to know that it's also an adoption hour for the church individually you have been adopted but the church also is going to be adopted and this uh this adoption aged for the church to come into their full inheritance with power and Dominion this fulfills the scripture of Romans 8 19 where the whole world groans anticipating the manifestations of the sons of God where God called men and women will be known as Sons at place and positioned with power and authority brother Branham told us and hear you him he said that's where God is trying to get his church now just say to this mountain be moved and it will move Authority sons of God the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God waiting to a spot where sickness will be arise and it'll be that way the blind will receive their sight the deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it didn't say these Saints have followed them that believe they'll pray for the sick he said he said they shall cast out devil not I will they will so I want you to understand what he said it said you will do this not me you're going to do this not Jesus you've got to do this amen you these signs shall follow them to believe if you say to this mountain not I say but if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption amen we're we are made for Dominion realize this you have been made for Dominion you were created by God and by your new birth you certainly have been made for Dominion you see sin is not to rule over you it's sickness is not to rule over you trouble is not to rule over you you are to rule over your trouble you are to walk on your Waters amen remember this God Made You for Dominion he did not make you to be a slave to sin a slave to sickness of slaves of trouble God made you to be our Dominion in the beginning in Genesis 2 God gave them dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and through sin then what happened man lost his Dominion he lost his godship he lost his sonship and Satan took over but where are we at now we're at the end we're not back over here to the beginning of this story we are here in the manifestations of the sons of God as prophesied in Romans 8 where you and we're waiting for that manifestation where sons of God come back and take it over again you look at the world you're living in today sin house it evil house act but it won't always be that way hey man we're coming back Revelation 19 says after we go away we're coming back we'll write with him on the white horses following the word of God and we'll come back and take the world over defeat the Antichrist throw him in prison for a hundred for a thousand years and we'll have a millennial Reign where the devil won't have power over anything and if the Rapture takes place today we're only three and a half years away from the millennium [Applause] that's how close you are the millennium's not way out under millenniums right here we're just going to go away for a short time but we're coming back I'm telling the devil we're not leaving out of here defeated I'm telling the devil even though we're escaping the things that are coming on the earth let me tell you that escape is not escaping from the devil it's escaping from the wrath of God that is going to be poured out through the seven vials on the earth in the tribulation we are to being taken away so God can judge the Earth and burn it with fire and bring us back to I walk on the ashes of the wicked I'm quoting Bible it is your Malachi for scripture that says the people in this end time will do that Hallelujah those that have received Malachi 4th and Elijah Prophet that is promised and the hearts have been turned back to the faith of the father they will come back when though after the world burns like an oven and walk on the Isis oh Hallelujah Hallelujah don't you know you'll walk on the ashes of every Tavern of every brothel of over every evil thing amen God has already given you power to walk over it amen amen he's already given you the power to be an overcomer but now we are people who he said will come back when the power of God will walk out and take every Power that Satan has away from him ever power wow every Power somebody look at the others say every Power amen he said waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets at the top now what he's talking about the gospel starting down low and coming up like a pyramid coming narrow narrow until it's capped off with Christ coming back not a pyramid itself and not a pyramid Doctrine just using it for an example you know like a pyramid coming up and it comes up to an Apex and it'll come up to the Apex right here at the top before the Capstone comes there will be a people who have the same Ministry that Christ had before he left because it has to be a match Feast to the coming Christ it'll be God In Bright form working in his people living in his people and they will false Sons will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and take every Power Satan's got away from him now we're contending against the spirit never think this is a flesh and blood Affair oh brother Tim you know sounds like you're against the Baptist we're not against Baptists well it sounds like you're against these Pentecostal we're not against the Pentacles sound like sometimes you're against some of these messy churches we're not against anybody flesh and blood is not in the equation we are battling against the spirit are you with me we're not battling against men but against the spirit spiritual wickedness as as evil as a wickedness out on the streets of America's spiritual wickedness oh yet they're fundamentalists having basic principle of truth but denying the power of the Gospel listen you know there were as brother Branham said there it was back in the beginning there was a middle age and it was the same group of fundamental Believers that put Jesus on the cross and killed him because he had signs and wonders and they didn't believe it and that same Spirit lives among the churches today a religious spirit not a bunch of infidels fundamental replace it right there and they're exactly right but they have a form of godliness fundamentally right but denying the power thereof the power of what the power of healing the power of shouting the powers speaking in tongues the power of interpreting the power of the church moving just like it did at the beginning and brother and sister we are contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen we're we're contending not against man it's a spirit that we are contending against a spiritual war oh but he allowed people to be fundamentally right but deny the power the power he said of what the power of healing power shouting the power of speaking in tongues the power of interpreting the power of the church moving just like it did at the beginning you know again we turn churches into into treatment centers what we will treat the disease of sin you know well you know you'll take these nine steps and we'll dry you out and we'll fix your drug habit and you know we'll do this and you do that and we'll you know try to conform you and teach you now how how to overcome in this way and use psychology and methods you know to change the mind you know to associate that with hurt and with pain look what you've done but look what it does to your family look what it does to you look what it does to your children but none of that will hold you in the hour of Temptation but there is a power there is a blood Hallelujah that once it comes and touches a heart and changes the life you don't no more have to worry about them anymore amen because it's a power that seals them to the day of redemption where the devil is sealed out and you're sealed in with God we're contending for that faith now people say a lot of times that's against my faith well there's only one faith one Lord One Faith one baptism you might have a faith but we want the faith and we want to earnestly condemn for it that means to argue for it to stand up for it to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints what were they called Saints because when they were Sanctified the Holy Spirit cleansed them they were called Saints now Jude would be the Foster brother of Jesus and he would say just before the you know it'd be one of the last things that are said before the book of the unveiling and Jude is saying you know let us let us earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Sea don't ever let that fate drop and the faith of the of the Saints was not in creeds it was not in denomination it was not in church buildings it was not in associations amen it was in the presence of the Living God oh yeah association's good we meet together with good people that's wonderful but that's not where our faith lies when we're out of the presence of good people are you with me the presence of the Living God still goes with us somebody told me one time brother Tim I could live this gospel if you just go with me everywhere that I go if you go with me to work if you'd go with me to to school you go with me wherever I go I can live it I said you don't need me you need the Holy Ghost hey man I can't go with you everywhere but he can he'll go with you shopping [Applause] he'll help you pick out your clothes amen he healed you're with you everywhere that you are come on he will be there right with you when you're looking at a movie and he's telling you Ah that's wrong don't feed on that kind of stuff you see the Holy Ghost one of its works is convincing you of sin and it can't deny his word well I you know I don't think brother Tim it makes any difference about a woman's hair whether it's cut or whether it's long I don't I don't think it's any difference about a man whether his hair is cut or whether it's long well the Bible does and when you get the Holy Ghost you forget your own thoughts because you receive a new thinking so no longer do you say I think because I is out the picture you see when he comes in and your your life begins it's s-i-n and I I is the most important thing in your life what I want and what I want to do and how I want to live and what I think but when God comes in your life he crosses that out and puts a zero there and oh there and makes you a son Hallelujah and as a son you no longer care about what I think you care about what father thinks amen what God's word said and you exalt his word over your own thinking now the Christian world today are not earnestly content we're told not just to contend but earnestly well my faith don't teach miracles they teach us past you know because we don't need it today we have the word no you don't have the word you have the letter of the word with no life so then you're not contending for the faith that was once delivered for this to the Saints so you know of course we don't believe in fanaticism but there's a real genuine gift to the Holy Ghost amen we earnestly content for that we believe in it Saints speak in tongues some say well you know my faith don't believe in Divine Healing a lot of message people are that away today that's just a minor we don't even need it today you just ain't been sick enough amen I don't believe in Divine Healing well we don't believe in a bunch of fanaticism either amen but we do believe there's a God who heals the sick amen that he's the same yesterday today and forever and we have been told to condemn for the faith not a faith Baptists have the faith Presbyterian happy faith the Pentecostals have a faith but we want to contend for the faith that was once delivered and without signs following vindicating the truth you don't have the faith you might have a knowledge of the Revelation but you don't have the faith to make it work now and I wanted to say we have the faith the truths of the word has been restored we have today by divine inspiration the faith that was once delivered to the Saints but I want you to know though as as we declare the word has been revealed but when the word is revealed it expresses itself so what has happened is that we have swapped the faith for the intellectual conception because those conceptions of men and that turns it into a powerless gospel now brother badham told us sin when Christ is a mystery of God revealed he said when the word is revealed it expresses itself that was God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his laws by death and Christ God died in the flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God well that will not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of men you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals that and if a man says he is born again and tries to take these promises of Christ in this last day to some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that manner that person has been in a delusion by Satan and if that man says he believes that and it don't manifest itself through him Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe into all the world to every age casting out Devils speaking with tongues all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not that they may be or they ought to but they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't so you can see brother Branham was very clear in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that the word has to be expressed to be the word so when we you know that word is really the true word when signs follow it so in the church that believes the word there must be miracles there must be healing there must be Deliverance there must be gifts of the Spirit all of them every promise of God amen there must be Ministry anointed Ministry that not only must be anointed Ministry but there must be an anointed Church the church Anointed with the same Spirit that's upon the ministry the power isn't all to be in the Pulpit the powers to be in the pew amen believers what the signs follow them that believe remember the faith that was once delivered to the Saints God had to bring a prophet in this day to bring us back and restore us back Malachi 4 said that he would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so therefore the original faith of the fathers of Pentecostal fathers is what has been promised it's the same Doctrine word by word Power by power Spirit the same dangerous exactly like it was beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of Christ and that's what your Prophet taught amen my Prophet too now let me just say this and this is where we want to Center God wants to create a faith for a rapturing church so he says if we could just realize the Holy Ghost is upon us creating in us a faith trying to present himself in so many ways and gifts to creative faith for a rapturing church it should put us in action but wonder if we're doing it the way he wanted it to be with reverence and humility the pillar of fire in this last day ought to put the whole church into action it being Vindicated signs of his coming he spoke of it as being raptured in Grace and he said I'm not trying to condemn you he said and what you have but I'm trying to give you more Rapture and Grace and that's the way it is even when we're talking about these camps these forts that have fortified around baptism or gifts or or Holiness or whatever and they built their little walls we're not trying to condemn them we're trying to say there's more amen there's a Grace that is being given for a Rapture amen that we'll have in this hour to come we'll have a Rapture power not only to heal the body but change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that Christ will be so real in their bodies till he can change it by his death of what he purchased Christ's surreal in you that he can change your body now it ought to be a cry from our hearts to see God fulfill his word it ought to cause a longing down on the inside of you know come to me Jesus don't leave me alone keep knocking on my door amen keep dealing with my heart don't let me go Lord whatever you do in order to be a cry in our hearts for God to fulfill his word brother Branson to church has got so backslid he said they eat food like a buzzer does carrying of an age past the Holy Spirit has no more right away in the truth some more no more prayer prayer meetings no more agonizing with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever you say wow brother Tim yeah we we're contending for the faith I'm asking you are you agonizing for it agonizing when we're living in this hour when we're seeing the evil in the land and The Trebles in her head brother sister don't you realize there there needs to be somebody agonizing the Bible said I'm going to put a seal on those a mark on those who sigh and cry but the Abominations that's done in the city amen is more than just making you sick it's more than just giving you something to talk about about how evil the world is getting amen but it's a people that begin to agonize with God fulfill your word of God whatever you do don't let us keep on going down into Sodom do let us keep going toward the burning Lord let your church get a people out of here it's a late hour and I don't want to be left behind whatever you have to do shake me down turn me upside down shake me but whatever don't turn me loose keep a hold of me God and I'm like Jacob of the heel Grabber I'm getting a hold of that promise and I'm not letting go until I'm blessed that's the way you ought to look for Rapture and faith Lord I want that faith surely we're on the very cusp of the rapture the very hour of the change and brother Branham said this we've lived the time out and the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for eruption faith that will pull can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we're living in I want you to understand he had an expectation an expectation we are we're looking for Rapture and faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change his body when we see God can raise the dead off the floor out in the yard and bring him back to life again present him here before when we see a God who can take a cancer that's in a man to Shadow raise them up to a strong healthy man that ought to give Rapture and Faith to the people amen that ought to give Rapture and Faith when we can see God working Among Us amen so God isn't working Among Us how in the world are you going to ever have raptured faith you said brother Tim but I I got Rapture and Faith no you got Doctrine you have a theology but we need a supernatural streaks to change these metal bodies and we should be going from glory to glory as we look into the book the Bible said we look into the Bible the book as a mirror and we're not what's in the mirror but we are changed from glory to glory till we fit what's in the mirror look at the Bible it speaks of you this is what God wants you to be and you're looking there until you allow God to change you you need to look in the message the word of God it's the wise hour change until you become what God Said hear this and here's Sarah now she's an old woman she's 90. she don't look nothing like the promise god holds the promise before her like this and says right here you're a mother if you're in the Covenant you are in the promise and she says I don't look like that and how can be that how can this happen and he says is there anything too hard for the Lord you look at your own self and you see him failures I don't fit this I might like this I'm not that's spotless bride I'm not that people I ought to be I'm black in here I'm lacking there you're looking there but keep gazing Don't Take Your Eyes Off of it keep looking at it possess your Gaze on this word you have changed the glory to glory until you match his blurry you're the people of the book look in the book you can't do that intellectually you've got to get in the spirit should be the Cry of our hearts brother Branham even even after the seals were open still told us and preached to us in 64. he said they never found a better way he went through that whole thing we ain't never found a better way for a baby to get what it wants them to cry for it you can give him a bell and say junior you're three days old you know but here's this ring to smell when you want something you see the baby the baby cries for what it wants the Bell ain't gonna work come on now we're doing every kind of thing and that denominations have done it you know to it doing it and we're learning and we're taking from them brother random said don't try to have a church like them don't try to have a pastor like them amen and so they come up with this sophisticated way of just believe the message and say God sent a prophet I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and you're saved amen well that's just like Junior trying to ring the bell that ain't gonna work the only way it'll work is for you to cry for it amen that was God's provided away and brother Brandon said God recommends this for his children for his believing children not intellectual speeches not some great theology to teach he wants you to cry for your needs if you're ready to limber yourself up a little and cry God will give it to you he likes to hear his children cry amen cry for your needs to God you know there's something about a baby crying that moves a mother's heart our parents heart amen and you take a newborn baby start crying that mother she's breastfeeding brother the milk will start flowing a mountain you know I I would I was there up in the other day in in Pennsylvania and outside the restaurant they had a bunch of goats in a field and I used to raise goats but nevertheless these these little kids come up to his mama two on each side and they come up there to to nurse and they punch that Mama until that Mama's feet come up off the floor off the ground and you know you know punch and punch and punch what was it it was a response to make that mother let down the milk you want God to let it down for you amen you start punching you start praying you start calling on God you start saying Lord I need you I've got to have you and what causes parental instinct to come out in outside of the Blessed God we're going to give a freak how long does a baby cry till he gets satisfied amen some of you young people say how long will I have to cry till you get satisfied oh brother Tim well I got a feeling hey are you satisfied well no we'll get another one get another one get another one I tell you I'll be honest with you I got so many of them I could never ever point to say which one was it I just knew it happened because every one of them was great every one of them was a change every one of them was a Feeling and I say just keep punching at it come on you say well I've had the Holy Ghost for 10 years punch again amen give me another refilling Not My Heart Lord don't leave me where I am I gotta have more strength for this hour [Applause] I hear preachers say a lot of young people to say I don't know whether I have the Holy Ghost I don't know that I got it well do you believe the message yeah you believe that whatever word is true yeah can you say Amen to it yeah well you got it and they know they're not living overcoming lives so they're wondering well how can I help the Holy Ghost and I got sin in my life like this I can't overcome I can't be victorious I you know I'm not going to tell you because you can verbally say Amen to every word of God you know listen say an amen to the word you say well that's evidence that's evidence well yes you see when your life says amen you don't disagree with any of it you believe it all you see brother Brandon's dealing with a whole group of people that are speaking in tongues and shouting and running the aisles and claiming the Holy Ghost and bobbing their hair and painting their face and wearing men's clothes and and then he's and he's saying you know the evidence of the Holy Ghost isn't jumping and shouting and running you know when you can't even believe the word a man with long hair don't have the Holy Ghost he needs it amen you say well I I I've accepted Christ well you need to get the Holy Ghost amen a woman with short hair needs the Holy Ghost come on that's what they need amen a woman that a bit that would be a cross-dresser and dress like a man needs the Holy Ghost a man who will cross-dress and dress like a woman needs the Holy Ghost a man or a woman that's in pornography they need the Holy Ghost that's what they need a real baptism of the Holy Ghost and then it'll cause your life to say Amen to the word now you'll surrender to every word of God Christians are real genuine articles of God they fight for their position amen so we have to fight for you say well I'll get the Holy Ghost I'll never fight again now that's when your battle begins Jesus was filled with the spirit and immediately was led by the spirit to be tempted of the devil you get the Holy Ghost you're going to face the Temptations of the devil with overcoming power how will you overcome thus saith the Lord it is written it is written it is written and the Holy Ghost in you will bring your life subject now it's that body changing Rapture power that we need in this hour where Christ becomes so real in our bodies till he can change it no notice now we want to just look at this because we want to come to a perfect Faith we're contending for the faith the perfect Faith the crowning Jewel of God's Pride will be a people that believe him and so he's appeared to us in this day in the same form that he was on the day of Pentecost in a pillar of fire the same way he was in the Old Testament when he appeared to Moses in a burning bush and he's appeared there with the same word it's the same Christ because he is now here in the form of the Holy Ghost not the third person of God the person of God coming in the form of his holy spirit to come and dwell in his people the word Christ means anointed one in the book of Acts it speaks of Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God Anointed with the Holy Ghost who went about he done great works God manifests and proved that he was in this man Jesus and now since Pentecost and the baptism of his Spirit it came because when Jesus went away he said I will send you another comforter I cannot stay here as the man I've got to come back and he said I won't leave you comfortless but I will come to you and he comes now in the form of the Holy Spirit and by his infilling we become Anointed with that same Spirit anointed Messiahs of the last days that we shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we show that he's not dead but he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people and he's moving among his people with a love affair and he's pouring out into her himself and to becoming one for the wedding supper at the same signs and Promises by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestations and there's nothing left for us to do but believe it Hallelujah you don't have to go to Calgary for it and die on a cross amen all you got to do is believe it and receive it for yourself and as God promised Sarah restoration necessary to bring forth Isaac so as God sent his spirit and he's now using dust human flesh to bring us a message to speak his word through now God has done this in this last day as he did in Genesis and now he's revealing the very Mysteries that God as he says to Abraham shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do and he begins to give him what he will do down at Sodom what he will do for Abraham's seed what he will do as far as given the inheritance he gives us all to Abraham as he stands there God using flesh to appear to Abraham and Sarah and now bringing them a message of the end time that will prophesy and speak of what God will do in the end time that God again will use human flesh and God must bring a message to us now this flesh would not be deity it would be a man it would be a prophet and God would use a prophet to bring a message and that message would be one of restoration and and there it would reveal to us the mystery and that's why we speak of Brothers Ministry the third phase of the prophet's Ministry is the opening of the word have you received it I have in anointed once at the end time he said not when he starts on the message but when he begins to declare his message when the first poll heal and second Paul prophesied third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way a prophet can be Vindicated is by the word remember the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths that's been sealed in the word so he tells us in perfect Faith this is coming to that third pull this is just now starting to bloom it's just started among listen listen it was still the third pull was still in his infancy it was just now starting to bloom he said I just did this for a purpose I I did this for purpose I'm working out something has taken this charge of faith and going right there and bring it out and how to come in to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you never noticed it before not of Faith but the perfect Faith built up in here and what took perfect god with a perfect heart would keep a perfect Promise by a perfect word which is separate than a two-edged sword and Discerning the thoughts of the heart and we're now coming to Perfection because the people have to come to this in order for the Rapture and that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith I'm looking for it and it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God now I want to give something to you he said then in his ministry it was only just starting to bloom wow to bring forth fruits it's got to bloom amen but you don't go pick the blossoms it goes from Blossom to seed amen and he said I'm looking for a perfect raptured faith now so he said why I've done this why I've had this prayer line well I've discern the thoughts and intents of heart why I've done this is to raise Faith up to a bracket that you've never noticed that way before not a faith but a perfect faith now I want you to think right now right now what has God been doing even in our prayer lines amen even in the ministry of the word what's it been doing Discerning the hearts is that right am I dealing with situations what if to raise things up into a bracket not for you to stay there but for you to receive a perfect Rapture in faith you see where we're at is not the goal to have a miracle now and then or healing now and then that's not the goal even even to have some devil cast out now and then that's not the goal but what our goal is is to come into that perfect raptured Faith but this is giving faith for that it's causing Faith to rise you look back Even in our own church why even the rise of Faith you're talked about around the world you're talked about as a church of Faith where miracles happen people bring their demons here to get them cast out people even bring them to our youth camp to get them cast out and it works it happens amen why because it raises Faith they see God heals God delivers amen God God sets free you know God God heals cancer God heals brain bleeds God our God heals crippled children God heals blinded eyes I'm not talking about out yet or I'm talking about right here God heals kidneys takes a boy that would have been a little little red not not able to grow at all and make a strong healthy boy out of it by Recreation created in him a new a new kidney I'm talking about God working but it's only being done to what to raise your faith up to a bracket not for you to stop there but for you to contend for that perfect faith for that Rapture in faith don't be satisfied with what God has done look at what God is doing but at the same time let's go on further listen brother Madam said in the message indictment made her come forth the Revival of the just that means righteous should be able to say you are by the blood May there come forth the Revival of the righteous and a great power come among the church just before it's going how many believes we're there just before it's going it's not hard to pray for that he says because you promise it and we're looking Lord for that third pull that we know that will do great things in our midst so notice what he said May there come a Revival of the just among the righteous he said brother Tim the world ain't going to see a Revival no they won't but you will you have not received yet everything God has for you content and he said it's not hard to pray to God for that because he promised it and we're looking for that third pull to do great things so you say but brother Tim third pole is open to the word it's theology it's a it's a word word word no it'll do great things I want you to get it just because you've received the truth of the doctrine and the message doesn't mean you have got it all yet that's the mechanics when the apostles first obeyed his first commission remember this remember I've been preaching on fulfilling the Great Commission denominations can't do that because they can't take all the word so because it will not receive all the faith they'll stay right there with their little bit of Faith the Baptist Camp right there with their faith of immersion Pentecostals with their faith and gifts the nazarenes with well they're losing their Holiness but nevertheless Sarah claim it they're contending for that they're fortified they stopped there they've camped around that they've claimed that part but they hadn't gone all what's now his last commission is to preach the gospel to all the world and then shall the End come and so he there there again with his first commission was in Luke 10 18 where Satan fell like a bolt of lightning what caused the fall of Satan where it was when he gave them Power To Tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing by any means could harm them is that right amen and when they drop and they began to act upon that commission Satan fell like lightning his last commission does the same by casting out Satan As We Lay hands on the sick now some will say we don't need laying on the hands we got the word now you just believe it sitting in your seat well pardon me but Brother Brad him over and over and over practice laying on of hands having the congregate to lay hands on each other as he prayed he did this all the way to the end of his ministry amen you see you see his first commission was to heal the sick and he the second commission was the last commission was to heal the sick lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but you see Satan wants to bind the hands of the church with a false theology to try to make it wrong to lay hands on the sick because when Satan is cast out he falls like lightning from heaven so when we pray for the sick and they're healed it brings Satan's fall come on Church I hope he gets more than a bobo amen I'd like to see his nose broke his head broke amen he could learn he could land on his tails for all I care and get his tail broke but he must be broke I'm telling you the devil that is tormenting you must be broken listen to what I'm saying now brother Bradham told us in 1963 in June he said he said I want you to believe now for healing we know the holy spirit's here and I believe in lay it on our hands or somebody jumped on me kind of rough about that this morning and said there's no such a thing as laying hands on one another it shouldn't be done can you imagine some preachers in the message now under this same evil spirit we're not we're not getting against men we're about spirits evil spirit that anointed men like Alexander Campbell with his so-called Church of Christ teachings I don't call them Church of Christ I call the man of Christ but anyway it's so-called Church of Christ teaching resisting the Holy Ghost and now that same devil jumping on us for prayer lines where we lay hands on the sick and the devil oppressed I'm just going to say it this you can't stop it we're going to matter that Youth Camp we have it almost every service here come on Church you ain't gonna stop it we're contending for it [Applause] we're fighting for it hey man listen here he said he said that they said there's no such thing as laying hands on one another it shouldn't be done I said you just haven't read the Bible brother and that's what I want to say to some of these guys you haven't met or even read the message let alone the Bible that's all the last the last commission that fell from the lips of Jesus was lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the last words he said when left the Earth his first commission he gave the disciples was healed the sick cleanse the leper raise the Dead cast out Devils that's the first group he sent out Matthew 10 and the last group he set out these signs shall follow them that believed they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things that they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that was the last words he said and was received up in the glory certainly that was a great commission what it does I don't know it's just carrying out what he said do hey man I don't know how it works either there's no power in my hands no power in any preacher's hands I don't know how it works but I just know it works amen I just know because he said do it we do it and that's still the commission now how can anyone now I'm contending I'm arguing how can anyone be against altar costs I'm praying for the sick you think that's against Church order you obviously hadn't listen to church order which by the way is not a law but it's a guideline of how to conduct an orderly church service so brother Branham gives some points and guides on how to you know you know how to conduct an orderly church service and then and so he taught us to conduct a church service you know have your songs have the preaching and then he said give an all to God I'm talking about 1963 church order give an altar call by giving an invitation to accept Christ and and afterwards after that offered prayer for the sick he says in church order you know there as he you make the altar call nobody comes you know in a few minutes you say well if nobody comes and say well would there be somebody that would like to be Anointed with oil tonight for sickness we pray for the sick here woohoo amen I mean this is church order this is how brother Branham taught us to conduct a church service and make an altar call and he said bring him up you don't pray with them those except Christ you know those that need to linger he said you can even take them into a room and pray with him some more and then make their invitation and say would it be someone here that would like to be Anointed with oil tonight for sickness we pray for the sick here but Satan with all this ecclesiastical pressure trying to stop us from fulfilling the Great Commission to preach preaching's under attack Don't Preach just push play and Jesus said preach Paul said preach brother Brandon said preach is that right amen but you see ecclesiastical pressure to try to keep us from fulfilling the Great Commission to preach to cast out Devils to heal the sick to speak with new tongues amen if Satan with ecclesiastical religious through the clergy pressure look at the revelation of the trumpets you know Israel received opposition and persecution from governments of the world in a physical manner which resulted in them being uprooted from the lands that they lived in Germany Holland all through Europe Poland wherever and and being forced back to a physical Homeland in the land of Israel the Jews in Israel today are there because of a squeeze amen a war broke out and exterminated six million of them and they said we got to have a Homeland for the Jews and it forced them out of their lands and their homes and ancestral lands they've been in there for some of them for fifteen hundred two thousand nearly two thousand years in Germany and Europe and different places and they were forced out to go back to their Homeland is somebody with me but now it doesn't come against the bride in a physical manner he told us it comes against the bride in an ecclesiastical manner in other words a religious spirit trying to use quotes to put a squeeze or pressure on the bride you know what it will do it'll just force you out of those dead places amen and get you to a place where there's life let me go to Homeland where the Bible is preached where the mighty healing happens where Miracles take place where the Holy Ghost can be given so it comes against the bride in ecclesiastical ecclesiastical manner a religious spirit trying to use quotes or scriptures putting a squeeze or pressure on the bride and it will only serve to force the bride from man's Traditions back to the homeland of the Bible and what it is it may seem harsh and man it seemed harsh brother random said to uproot all them Jews but he said it was a tender hand of Jehovah leading them to the Tree of Life you see they had to get there in order to receive the Messiah amen and he said the same thing that is happening here he said ecclesiastical pressure is pushing there against the bride pushing her out of the systems of man back to the homeland of the Bible and he said many are uprooted and have to leave family and friends and this and that the other but he said what is it it is the Tinder hand of Jehovah lead you to the Tree of Life bringing him back to the Homeland where the word of God is preaching power [Applause] like brother Bradham said in the Third Exodus the people were in Egypt in the days of Joseph remember they were there and our days of Moses they've been there for 400 years why was he in Egypt there was a reason they got in bondage how come they became slaves the people of God became slaves why would they be in that land and out of their land God had promised Abraham I'll give you this loud this is it why wouldn't be the people be in the place that God provided and he says that's the question of today also God gave us a Pentecost he gave us a book of Acts he gave us the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us he gave us a land and why are we out of it why is the church out of it why isn't the great Christian church today living again like the book of Acts bringing forth the same thing there's some reason for it Anna you know what the reason was since was because of the dirty jealousy toward a brother why did they hate him because he was a brother no not exactly they hated him because God dealt with him more than he did the rest of them and they didn't want his gifts they didn't want his dreams they rejected his Supernatural of our intellectual conception and that's why today so many are out of the land of milk and honey where Miracles flow freely and the sick are healed and tormented Spirits can't stay and brother Bradham goes on to say they thought they would never need him they thought they would never need this Supernatural this Holy Spirit he types Joseph to the Holy Spirit we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpreters or tongues they've adopted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit therefore there is a people that's elected that has their names on the Lamb's Book of Life they can't go for that they are spiritual minded and therefore they can't go for that they can't stand it Hallelujah I believe that's the bride of Christ today a man that are elected their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life they can't stand that amen so they have to get out of there get to Homeland somewhere get back to the Bible get back to the message well man where the faith is contended for for the bride of Christ it is an ecclesiastical spirit that is uniting against the work of God opposing the Holy Spirit opposing altar calls denying the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost replacing it with a cold intellectual form of belief I hear it all the time oh brother champ brother Tim one of the restored Mysteries one of the restored Mysteries is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without Sensations without emotions or without feelings that's a lie and it isn't message Doctrine it's actually Baptist Doctrine it's a part of a quote like said the one Satan used to try and trip up Jesus upon the Mount of Temptation and when Satan uses a quote you better watch out it's not the word it's a twisted with an implied meaning something different from the Bible and brother Brandon said I'm not much for dead things by the way this is after the seals so I'm not much for dead things so anything without emotion is dead the scientific research will prove that anything without emotion so if your experience hasn't got a little emotion in it you better bury it and get something that has got some emotion in it amen the restored mystery lays in the second part of the quote which declares the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did and what were the works that Jesus said that we would do speaking with tongues heal the sin cast out devils amen but you see when you deny laying on our hands and deny speaking with tongues and deny the power of the spirit and deny the power of the of of casting out Devils then that's where you see that ecclesiastical Spirit begin to put a pressure on the bride now John 14 12 said the works that I do shall you do also and you hear it all the time from these false prophets just receive the message and believe it you got the Holy Ghost that's evidence oh sure you will say man you will agree with all the word but if the signs don't follow it's just an intellectual conception and because what they're preaching has no power then they have to replace the power with psychology to treat the symptoms of sin rather than the old-fashioned sin killer devil destroyed holy ghost power to cast Satan out and as ecclesiastical pressure against the bride of Christ and it comes from preachers that are comfortable with the anointing on the ministry but don't want it on the laity because they can't control it remember that now though it's not time for the actual forcing of the mark and I'm going to lay some things here just in the next few minutes though it's not time for the mark of the beast the actual Mark him it happens after the bride is gone but there is a spirit of unity of ecumunism to unify try to unify the bride and message people with the teachings of denomination this is what happened when psychology is brought in it's unified bringing in their methods to try to conform and reform rather than the power of transformation so I want you to understand you know when the bride is gone there will be the actual forcing of the mark of the beast but right now there is a spirit of Unity on at communism that is affecting the minds of the people remember the Bible tells you that they will all give their mind to the Beast and it's a cord of of so-called tolerance that is binding the people together and acceptance of evil and forcing you to call it good and it's a move to make unbelief acceptable and that bind together against the Holy Ghost against the gifts of the Spirit against Power God's power to seal for an easy believism will just believe the message yours you're sealed now brother Branham called it a boycott it's what we call today a council culture so you cancel anyone or anything that dares oppose you remember it's not physical yet it's spiritual like brother Brandon said about in Satan's Eden about men and women wearing shorts he said they belong to a society whether they know it or not they're perverted and don't know it they're spiritually belong to it and don't know it that's what he said and you can spiritually belong to something and don't even realize you belong to it it's a binding remember there is a binding going on God's going to take a weed into the gardener but the tares will be burned are bound together amen and now I want you to notice it's a uniting and people spiritually belong to it and don't realize it now I'm trying to show you we're trying to uncover so that you can see what you're contending for because Satan wants you to convince it's a move of God it is not a move of God it is never a move of God when we have to have our men have classes week after week after week to teach them against sexual uh habits that is not a move of God that is a move of EC communism to make you like the rest of them because that's the power denomination the power of the Gospel changes the nature amen we don't need we don't need weeks and weeks and weeks of that we need a getting in the presence of God and getting delivered from the power of sin and the changing of the nature but Satan comes along and he wants to bind together because this is what he's doing in this age he's binding tears all together and he uses we're all the same you know message churches become famous denominations there's no healing there either there's no Miracles there either there's no experience in the Holy Ghost there either what have they done they've been brought into a court and they're being united with this instead of this the word follow my thoughts now listen to brother Branham spoken word's Original Seed I predict the two Pentecost the two denominational groups Pentecostal and Evangelical groups will work together in a denomination I predict they're going to work together watch they will unite themselves together and become a member of them all of them are the Federation of the Council of churches or the Council of churches they already belong to it all of them and they will come through them a forcing or a boycott that will stop everything but what belongs to that Union of churches the Bible said there would be a boycott even to such a way it would cause people to not be to buy or sell unless it received the mark this the mark of the beast which is romanism the image of the Beast which is protestantism the Beast had Power Authority to give image the image life to speak and it did that's the confederation of churches when they Confederate themselves together now there's many young people here I don't know Jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year I don't know when he's coming but remember if I don't live to see that day of his coming which I hope I will and somehow believe I will now I if I don't see it don't let this word ever depart from your ears and your heart remember I speak in the name of the Lord I believe with all my heart that that's a way to wind up there will be like a union a boycott and all places as this will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you've got a permission or license from this Federation of churches to hold his service it shows it does that now even in the denomination it shows where it's at yes sir you have to have it and that's where it'll wind up that's my prediction as a servant of Christ to the understanding I have of the word and the inspiration that's where it'll come from all signs are pointing to the end hmm and yet you don't see yet much action amongst the council at church you don't see yet but remember it doesn't become physical until the bride leaves so now it's ecclesiastical and ecclesiastical is using scriptures and quotes to try to force the Holy Spirit out now brother Bradham said in the spoken words Original Seed he said I believe someday the real real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of God now what in the world then do we have that's coming from Jeffersonville of forcing to try to stop the preaching of the word of God what is it what is it what do you see the Bible prophesied something that he said in Romans Revelation 13 16 you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its Mark but then when the lamb will take his pride and judge The Horde for it so we're right here in the time where they don't want you to preach no more do you realize the last gift we've already done away with speaking in tongues and prophecy and and we've already done away with discernment of spirits and miracles and Gifts of healing it's already been done away with in the church and now the last gift which is inspired preaching here Satan comes for the last gift and what's he want to do squeeze the life out of the preachers that they dare not stand in the pulpit and preach when Jesus told us to preach when the last commission is to breach come on and somebody's got to fulfill it say brother Tim what are you doing I'm contending for the faith I'm contending for what Paul said preach the word be Infinite season out of season you know rebuke with all on suffering and Doctrine but he said in that time the Lord God the lamb will take his bride and judge the horror now right now you don't see it happening by the government but the mechanics wake up just a moment look at your neighbor and just say this word mechanics mechanics really damn what in the world are you talking about the mechanics for it to happen is in place what you see is the spirit rising up and ecclesiastical spirit that tries to force us to stop preaching denying us denying the commandment and commission of Jesus to go into all the world and preach the gospel why is it is Satan's attempt to stop mark 16. keep in mind the mark of the beast and the fortune of the Mark is not yet physical and it won't be enforced until the bride leaves but however there's a spirit already at work and it's bringing a union or a boycott or a council culture of the truth now what's the spirit also at work in the churches to to enforce a cancer culture a boycott I mean it's even working in our nation if you're a baker and you don't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding you'll be canceled your your business will be ruined amen it's a it's a you're 19 against the word amen Michael and Beth had a little uh campus business of of putting photos on the canvas and I had to stop it you know why because they're beginning to get requests to do gay weddings and if you don't do it you're sued and you're canceled now you know so you see it what is it it is a spirit in our nation uniting against the word and making the word of God seem to be evil and wrong and evil righteous and it brings a canceled culture against now I'm I'm taking right now look at what's happening you you think well brother Tim you know they it's just something going on there tearing down our statues and you know monuments and this and that and our history what is happening there you know there is a there is a work in our nation to destroy patriotism they don't want you patriotic for America burn your flags America's evil Americans have the evil past you know we are not to be Patriots you know why because they're canceling out patriotism for a one world government and everybody is starting to give their minds to this you know if you don't go along with it you're canceled you know there's church shooting that just happened the other day this sickle transgender um I don't know whether it was a god pretending to be a girl or girl pretending to be a boy I never figured it out it was a girl pretending to be a boy and now they're calling it a martyr a martyr after killing three teachers and or two teachers and a custodian and three children it's insanity now that's a martyr you know you know because that individual had been hurt and nobody would accept it if you don't go along with it you're canceled so if you preach Divine Healing you'll be canceled If You Preach or believe in the Holy Ghost and that it must be an experience and not just an acquired knowledge of the message you will be canceled If You Preach it's gifts it's Miracles you will be canceled even crucified so brother Branham told us there that that they are coming together now watch he said you will not be even allowed to preach or allowed to have prayer for the sick and we're seeing the same thing begin to happen against the bride of Christ Don't Preach don't pray for the sick and that crucifies the Vindicated Word of Promise it stops it you're not allowed to have it no more no more healing Services no more prayer for the city no sir you can't do it and that's what brother Bradham told us he said it was rising up right there and you see the same spirit that is anointing those of the world begin to anoint those who claim to be in the truth now I'm trying to bring something brother Branham said they've already got the machine has been set up and ready to move the mechanics is already there they've already got the mechanical system of an organization that's going to bring up on the earth a piece they say like a U.N and he said hey then he goes on and he said that you know he goes on and he talks about how the big machine is set up and now we are seeing it over and over and over and over again do you see the protests that were just made here the other day where people were actually Protestants and and standing for pro-life and here they get assaulted by an evil group you know what and and there's no defense for them but they would defend the other side that's a hate crime but to stand for up for righteousness no the police just stand by and let it happen you see that right now it is a spirit but but it's going to be it will one day get its Dynamics when the bride is raptured and right now you can already see the mechanics is there now then you're seeing the Dynamics begin to move is somebody with me now amen you can see it beginning to move laws are being changed prosecutors being put into place that are bought with money already that that will not even prosecute criminals all these things that are going on in our nation I was listening to a report yesterday in 10 years there has been a 4 000 percent increase of transgenders and a mutilation of America's children where that boys are mutilated there and neutered and and and and and their organs removed and girls are are sterilized and their breasts removed at 13 years old without parental without parental consent and this kind of thing is happening in our nation you know why because right now we see the Dynamics is starting to move in the mechanics and they're all one mind oh you know tolerance you know nobody should stand up against it or or whatever else and brother Branham tells us he said you'll find out there be affiliation the Pentecostals the groups will come together and they'll set the doors on them guys that won't listen to it and you want to be allowed to open your mouth right but that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a ray Hallelujah and he said somebody's got to stand up for this he said like Patrick Henry said Give me liberty or give me death somebody has to stand up for it and he said if the Holy Ghost is a saint Holy Ghost and fell at Pentecost it still does the same things it did there the same power The Same Spirit it'll work the same way we don't need a council of churches we need the Bible back in action [Applause] you can see what's happening in Gomorrah our our sister Country Canada we're Sodom their gemara our next door neighbor raisin with pressure against religion a young man the other day arrested for saying what the Bible says at a Christian School at a Catholic School some of his classmates young girls came up to him and said listen listen now we we are we're we're afraid because men are using our bathrooms and we're afraid they're calling us up females by the way they sent one of these so-called females to a female prison and wound up with about 10 or 12 pregnancies so you know here here again this young man in school he just stood up and said what the Bible said the Bible said you know against that that men and women are different and and he stood up for his female classmates who were complaining that biological males were used in their bathroom and he's been thrown out of the high school and arrested them and you look what's happening in the schools of America transgender curriculum forced on our kids drag queen chose forced on our kids and corrupt judges striking it down when laws are passed to stop them brother Bradham looked for a squeeze I'm going to tell you you're in it yet we know it was revealed in the trumpets we won't go through the persecution dearly Church did and don't get confused with what happens to the foolish virgins who are hunted down by the Dragon but let me tell you they are setting up and bringing the order setting the stage for the mark of the beast and she is rising in power as we head toward it a one world government with Satan at its head look it's what's happening in just in the last few years since covet seemed like ever Calamity they use it whether it was 9-1-1 to use it to take away freedoms then it comes along the covet and they learn another way how far they can push the American people and the rights it can take away from them you know that remember were there two people in jail because they dare to have church luckily we had a we had a man who was a president that said freedom of religion is in our country and nobody's being shut down to go to church and so you know but but look at our money our money your money is Vanishing in the thin air our freedoms are Vanishing they're finding ways to circumvent the Constitution here's our constitution and they're finding ways to circumvent it amen you want to hear you know you talk about freedom of of speech it's leaving they've already censored it you know you don't have freedom of of speech just try to get on Facebook and tell the truth the media companies will will absolutely censor you and cancel you some of you were canceled during covid just for just for saying I don't have to wear a mask that's the truth amen freedom of religion is going the right to bear arms is leaving amen our elections is rigged our borders are not secure we're being invaded 6 million or so in a year you know our our borders as I said is not secure there's illegal drugs like fentanyl flood in our country and killing a hundred thousand per year America no longer has a righteous majority you are a minority and you are you are about to go extinct and back to the matter is you will one day there will not be any bride left on the earth she's going in a rapture amen you are now a minority you are no longer a righteous majority America doesn't have it the the lots are down there with their righteous soul is vexed but they are a minorities too all the while sodomites are beating down every door wanting more than their rights as a set of four thousand increase percent increase of transgenders mutilating our kids America is shown in Revelation 13 Rising like a lamb but later speaks as a dragon amen we're hearing Satan speak everywhere come on church amen all the rights of the Lamb with all our freedoms are being stripped from us and we're hearing more and more the voice of the dragon and Insanity Insanity increases as a mind of Satan comes in don't Revelation 12 tell you he will be cast down people who are ascending Amen brother Branham tells us Kevin can I preach just a little longer Amen brother Adam tells us he said but when the when the squeeze comes down he said what's the third pull them [Applause] what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power [Applause] what lays in the word people want to talk about the opening of the word well you know the what the Bible has been opened what lays in the word the power of Creation The Power of Salvation this is in the third poll the power of creation the power salvation the power of Resurrection the power control and atmosphere the power of healing that's what lays in the word president random said right now just as this time has happened so you can identify its presence among you but it won't be used in a great way to this Council begins to tighten up do you feel it tightening but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily or be manifested in the fullness of its power the move is on for the bride and for the bride leaves it must manifest faith in its full Dynamics and brother Benham tells us and I'm closing on this as I bring it right down in there to this this morning Satan is there with the mechanics and he said he's only waiting for the Dynamics and I'm telling you what we see here in the evil that is going on is only temporary compared to what will be expressed in the tribulation if you are left behind or you will be hunted down and you will be exterminated and killed amen you will do you hear what the Bible said we will in Revelation 11 it says you will amen said that that could be sir that that there would would open the dragon would would come and open his mouth against Israel a war like a flood and then he said an earthquake would take place you know what that is that's Armageddon that's when God comes and Christ sets his foot upon the Mount of olive and it Cleaves him too and there's a great battle are you with me it's a battle of Armageddon that takes place but he said when he can't get to Israel he turns him and puts his Venom against the remnant of the woman's seed there is coming a great persecution there is coming a Great Tribulation you do not want to be left behind here can you see the Dynamics begin to work in Satan's mechanics that ought to tell you something let me drive this home right now let me tell you right now if you see the Dynamics begin to work in Satan's mechanics then you'll either be able to recognize the Dynamics is beginning to work if God's mechanics and the Dynamics of this church will be a revealing of the Holy Ghost that they have left in a small measure while the headstrong was coming down to the body but then the full power of the Holy Ghost will receive of the Dead in Christ that's been dead from The Seven Ages Hallelujah Hallelujah the Dynamics the Holy Ghost is coming the Holy Ghost he goes here the Holy Ghost he got pouring out and what you have seen temporary is only going to be manifested in the fullness of its power Satan can't cancel us Satan can't stop us we have been told content earnestly could give for the faith once delivered to the Saints God has remembered his promise he's pouring out a spirit ask him to pour it out on you say Lord I need another refreshing of the Holy Ghost hey man I need a raptured faith I need my faith elevated to a higher position you're letting things happen among us we see the sick healed we see Devils cast out we see the captives of three but Lord pour into me your spirit I said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I'll pour it out look at his own failing words of promise God coming back alone the other night
