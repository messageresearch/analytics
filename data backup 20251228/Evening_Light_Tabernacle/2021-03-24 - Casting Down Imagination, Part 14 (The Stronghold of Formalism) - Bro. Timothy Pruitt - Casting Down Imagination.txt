your glory and for your honor in jesus name amen amen let's turn to second corinthians 10 and verse 4 also genesis 4 and verse 3. amen how many can say i'm glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen it's a wonderful privilege to be able to come together and amen just speaking to different ones yesterday and even today that's over uh in europe and also in the philippines that are back under strict lockdowns and just just crying out for prayer and asking god to intervene so amen i believe god can make a way for those amen amen so it is a privilege to be together something i don't take very lightly and take take for granted but always enjoy the presence of god in the presence of his people second corinthians 10 and verse 4 said for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and to bring bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ amen also genesis 4 and verse 3 he said in the process of time it came to pass they came brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect and to abel and to his offerings but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain while thou wroth and why is that countless fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field they came rose up against abel his brother and slew him amen we'll let you be seated this evening just like to speak to you on once again casting down imaginations but also the stronghold of formalism stronghold of formalism you know in hearing and recognizing and acting on the word of god the prophet would say this he said whenever there is a revival it always produces twins when there was a birth from isaac and rebecca it produced twins when the world was created as we read in the bible here of twins adam or abel and cain it produces two when is when ishmael and isaac was born it produced two when he saw and jacob was born it produced two but one of them of the natural one of them of the earth and or shall we say of death and the other one supernatural one looked at the natural the intellect the other one walked by the spirit and i believe that's a very wonderful uh thing if in your life for the spirit of god has come inside of you and and you're not no longer walking by sight but you're walking by faith and believing in the things of god that all things are possible to them that believe you know and looking at a boys and and these two as we read here uh one was walking by what he saw amen as cain would bring an offer and he would bring of his first fruits he would bring of what he would produce what he could do and the best that he could do now they both came to church they both worshiped they both came to give an offering unto god it wasn't that cain was trying to do something evil he was trying to bring something before god but he was not coming by spiritual revelation he was coming by intellectual knowledge amen and that is what is very very a tricky thing in this hour amen god is not coming for an intellectual church he's coming for a spiritual church he's coming from a for a church that has been born of his spirit amen that's walking by the faith of almighty god amen is not offering of what they can do or how good they are how great they are but it's all about what he has done and this is where abel would be able to look beyond what was before him in his sight and he would realize it wasn't that it wasn't fruits it took them out of the garden it was it was blood that took them out of the garden it was the sin amen of a fornication that took them out and it would if it was blood that took them out it would have to be a greater blood that would come to take them back in and so this is what abel by spiritual revelation would begin to look and he would say i got to have a lamb and it looked like maybe not the greatest uh type of altar it was a very messy altar it was very ugly altar here cain had built him something up that looked very pretty and no doubt decorated as best as he could and his fruits all in the right place and every his vegetables arranged just right but god wasn't working looking for something that was dead god was looking for something that was alive and god is also the same today he's looking more he's looking for a church that's walking in the supernatural realm that the supernatural god can come down and to meet him he can touch hearts he can touch lives and he's not looking for our works he's not looking for what we've done or how we've how what we've accomplished he's not concerned about all of that but he's looking for life amen he's looking for the blood of the lamb amen and so we see that one walked by intellectuals but the other walk by the spirit and we find that in every revival amen it produces twins every bible has twins they have a bunch in there that's carnal believers and there's a bunch in there the spiritual believers every revival produces an esau and a jacob amen he saw as we would look at him for a moment amen he walked by the intellect well he walked by his feelings what he walked by himself amen as he would come out of the out of the wilderness out on the hunt or whatever he was doing and he was out there and he come in very hungry and and he was willing to trade the birthright for a bowl of soup amen here on the other hand amen jacob would do whatever it took to get the birth right and this is where god would find favor in jacob because jacob wanted more than what he could produce or more than what he could do he wanted what god required and he could do whatever it took to take to get what god required amen so you know he said see what happens is he said first they go along first thing you know the carnal ones begin to think well these guys are getting off the deep end i better separate myself from them and they go back to the intellectual part they want a pastor that'll speak to them pleasant things they don't want a spirit-filled pastor that'll obey the holy spirit from the platform and just preach the word like it is as john said lay the axe to the root of the tree and let the chips fall where it will most of the churches of the day will vote that out of their pulpit that's right but it comes as separation always does it did it in the methodist age it did it in the baptist age it did it in the pentecostal age and it does it every age he said therefore the great church is making itself ready we find out that esau and jacob before either child was born god said he loved one and hated the other they were twins same mother same father twins every revival produces twins there's twins born in a natural man and a spiritual man it was back in the garden of eden cain and abel the same thing started from there and look at the church jesus all the way down he said through the scriptures have been twins all the way down to jesus he said jesus the pastor judas the treasure brothers out of the same tribe out of the same group out of the same church one the pastor won the treasure one a devil one god amen that's the way it goes jesus said in the last days the two spirits would be so close it would deceive the very elected if it was possible amen so twins believer make believer reasoning faith carnal spiritual in our scripture reading we see two approaches to god an approach of wisdom or man's wisdom or intellectual abilities or knowledge a carnal approach i mean a formal approach or the approach of faith a spiritual approach approach with a revelation amen it wasn't their own revelation it was a revelation of christ brother and would say abel was able to look down 2 000 years to the coming of the lamb and realize god is requiring a lamb god is requiring blood god is requiring life he wants more than our just our old dead confessions and our our dead religion god wants something with life inside of it amen he's not coming to i mean what man just speaking naturally what man is going to go marry a dead woman it's not going to happen they want somebody with life in us somebody that amen reciprocate somebody that gives back to them so i mean that is the same with god he's not coming for a dead church he's not coming for dead religions or dead creeds or dead dogmas he is coming for a living breathing amen working supernatural church with supernatural signs with supernatural wonders amen the living god living among them and working through them amen but many people want to put god in a box and he only operates a certain way and he only does certain things and you know and we don't get the holy ghost like they used to and so we get it by believing and all kinds of things they put god in a box but god will go right around your formalism right around your box and move in ways that blows your mind moves in ways it goes beyond what you can think or ask amen i believe in a god who can come beyond our greatest expectations amen and we have seen him moving even among us but he said notice he said when the natural and the spiritual meet there's always a clash it's never failed it always clashes why because in there is a jealousy amen we find that their jealousy it causes it does this jealousy begins to cause carnal imperson impersonations or even carnal comparisons well our church ain't like their church or this ain't like that or you know it's carnal comparisons or this preacher don't preach as good as that preacher or that at carnal comparison he said we find it today as it was then when god does something for an individual everyone wants to try to copy just like god did it for that person and it causes the competition it makes a carnality he said and then if we cannot on the other side get the spiritual results then they'll take it by political power they'll substitute something to upset the people's minds what to do what to draw disciples unto themselves amen that's exactly what took place at the very beginning as cain and abel both boys here on earth when abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and god vindicated it who vindicated it god vindicated it wasn't able vindicating anything god vindicated it amen amen and god vindicated it coming down and received a sacrifice but it caused jealousy with cain because he was jealous of his brother and he slew him it started at the beginning with that natural and spiritual city cain and abel worshiped the same god they built the same kind of altars they both worked as the same god not different gods the same god at the same church same altar but cain by carnal reasoning brought the fruit of the land and laid them upon the altar thinking surely this was the answer for god's atonement he must have brought in what people think today apples or oranges amen what might have took even adam out of the garden in the beginning that's where he was coming by his own intellectual abilities amen but abel had the right sacrifice he knew that it was blood that did it so he brought a lamb and when god received this now abel by faith offered a better sacrifice amen there was no bible written there wasn't nothing given but by revelation he brought it before god and god received it and god is once again not looking for our intellectual abilities or our abilities to speak well our abilities to orientate our abilities to put things together he's looking for spiritual revelation amen that then when you have that in your heart it's more than in this spiritual like revelation is more than a jump or a shout out but when you receive it it might make you jump and shout out and we're talking about the fire of god that comes down upon the altar how many has ever burned been burned by a fire and not had an emotion do it i mean you just go and you kind of burn yourself on a teapot or or one of your sisters getting a pan out of the out of the oven you didn't quite put the mitten on right and you grabbed a hot pan i'm sure like wow that was incredible that was no no there's going to be some emotion to it and how much more greater is the fire of god when it comes inside of a heart that burns out sin and unbelief and all these kind of sins and past mistakes and past problems amen there's some kind of emotion to it when you realize i once was lost but now i'm saved i once was on my way to hell but god and rhythm rich in mercy turn me around [Applause] hallelujah amen you know somebody brother george shared this with me today it was very i thought it was very wonderful somebody asked a man said why does god send a people to hell he said god don't send anybody to hell he said we were on our way to hell every one of us was on our way to hell because we were born in sin and shaped an iniquity but it's by god's grace he put a lifeboat in our way and we have the ability to step off our road and get on that lifeboat amen i realize what i've been saved from what god has done for me in my life and i realize it ain't looking at me and my works and my faults but he provided me a lamb listen it makes me want to shout it makes me want to cry it makes me want to laugh it makes it puts all kind of emotions in me when i realize what god done for me that he came by my way with a lifeboat i wonder how many people you know they say well you know it ain't all of an emotion i wonder about somebody's out on the ocean put that same person out on the ocean somewhere on a little raft and they're just you know floating around for days and they had nothing to drink for days and hallucinating every kind of thing all of a sudden they look out there and here comes a ship [Music] and they're gonna just sit back in their formalism and sit back and like ah well if you know if that's really of god he'd just come right over here and pick me up well i mean you heard the story of a man wanting to be saved you know it was in a flood you heard that story just got reminded of that this week amen wanting to be saved and crying god save me god save me god save me all of a sudden here comes a boat and said come on get in the boat and he said no god's going to save me wouldn't it well god wasn't working in his box in other words and then the helicopter comes along and you know he's crying now god save me he's getting water's getting hired god save me here comes the helicopter drops the lifeline and he and he won't get on the lifeline and and the water comes up and he drowns he goes sees god god said what do you mean i didn't say you tried to save yourself in a boat i sent a helicopter and you refused it all amen got to send things by our way and if you don't get off of where you're going and get on that lifeboat but thank god i took the step how many else here tonight took that step we were all born in sins and shaped in iniquity on our way to hell but a lifeboat come by my way amen the blood of jesus come by my way and it picked me up where he found me but thank god it didn't leave me there it brought me out of there and it set my feet on the king's highway [Applause] no that person in that little thing out there been floating for months and days i just read about somebody survived some like 60 something days out in the ocean i couldn't imagine but i guarantee you when they saw that ship hey [Applause] hey i need saving hey hallelujah and we want to look down on somebody because they get a little emotional they're seeing their lifeboat come by and seeing the holy ghost can be their holy ghost they're saying god can be their god hallelujah just like i told brother linda up there in oklahoma i said now that god that was your daddy's god your uncle's god that god is now your card whoa hallelujah when i realized it ain't just my daddy's god no more it ain't just the church's god or anybody else's god it's my god and did you know it's the same god that helped abraham isaac and jacob it's the same god that walked the children of israel through the red sea through the desert into the prophet that's my god hey that's my god something happens but you see it takes a spiritual revelation of course the devil will be around on your feelings i understand that right but he'll come and he'll come to you after an emotional service and say well that was all emotional but you realized something changed something took place i don't have those same desires no more temptation may be there but the desire ain't there there is a difference between temptation and desires amen it was a revelation he you know he'd come to peter and he'd say you say well who does men say that i am he said well some say your lies some say you're one of the prophets he said well who do you say i am he said i i say you are the christ the son of the living god he said notice a statement that jesus replied blessed art thou simon son of jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my heavenly father has revealed this to you and upon this rock and brother brown said not a church not a religion not peter he said it's upon the revelation of who jesus is upon this rock i'll build my church amen no man he said and he said no man could even come to me except my father draw nigh and he said you have been drawed simon and he said no man can cut he said flesh and blood's not revealed this but i've drawed you into this my father which is in heaven has drawed you to this moment and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it hallelujah don't you understand what you got inside of you you got something that hell can't do nothing about [Applause] amen it didn't say it wouldn't be against you it said it wouldn't prevail against you amen many of you come back from camp or services and all hell seems to break that's just normal amen welcome to being filled with the holy ghost every gun in hell has been pointed at you but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen when you realize it was more than just an emotion it was more than just a moment it was god that came on the inside of me and changed my life forever [Applause] and it's no longer my fruits and what i can do and what i can produce it's what he's already done but it brings a clash we find that clash in abraham and lot we find that same clash and moses and nathan and cora moses being an ordained prophet with the word of the lord vindicated that he was chosen to be their leader of the hour and that abraham had done all that he promised all these promised things and here moses did exactly what god said it would be take place in carnal and korah being carnal wanting to raise up against him he want to make a group of men on his own of his own he said god doesn't deal with people like that shows you right there in scripture he said what takes place oh moses you're making too much out of yourself you know the whole congregation is holy you say you're a holy man the whole congregations are holy we're all holy we're all god's children god moses said lord what did i do and god says separate yourself and he swallowed him up in the earth see there was a clash when the carnal and the spiritual meet there's always a clash when judas and jesus met there was a clash son of god one son of satan the other just like cain and abel a clash one of them a treasure the other a pastor and we come to this day to the same thing the carnal denominational denomination to the spiritual bride of christ the spiritual bride of christ is so much different from the carnal organization until there's no comparison in them at all hallelujah but we see here let me go down here we find that that that that sorry i lost my spot for a minute we find here and if we talk about in second timothy talk about the last days the church would have a form of godliness have the form of being a church but deny the power what power the same power that fell on the day of pentecost and we're not moving from that power amen that power's been restored in this day like never before all down to the church ages it went into utter darkness but in this day that same power that same holy ghost that same god is now living among his people doing the same things with same signs same wonders same miracles saying we are writing another book of acts but i know there's a carnal church out there that says it ain't so it says you only have to believe it to be you only have to believe the word accept the word for your day you know and then you're saved i mean you're nothing but a good baptist but there is a spirit of god that can come on the inside of you you say well brother timothy i mean you got the mechanics but listen we also need the dynamics we get it we got the word we got the word we got the word but you've also got to have the spirit amen that makes the word live that operates the word in the body that changes the hearts and changes life the spirit of god that can fall in a room and change the whole atmosphere to everyone in the building can be healed people can be saved god can come in such a phenomenal way you say really yes god can still do that because he's still god it doesn't matter how much the carnal impersonation say it ain't so you know you get a you get a little emotional about things you know and you get the spirit of god moving they won't say well you're just pentecost i say thank you you're exactly right amen i am pentecost the original amen not the denomination the original amen what was the malachi 4 sent for to turn the faith the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen we have been turned back to the faith of peter back to the faith of paul amen back to the faith of the bible back to the faith of hebrews 11 back to the faith of all things are possible i don't care how much the carnal people says it ain't so we have been turned back to the faith to believe in miracles to believe in signs and wonders to believe that our prodigals are coming home to believe that our children can be saved to believe that there's still mercy for those that desire mercy to believe that they're still amen the spiritual guard to create a spiritual atmosphere that a spiritual birth can take place listen we're not interested in formal dead dogmas and mords we're not interested in ice cold places called hell prison camps death counts that's not what we're in that's not where we're going you know after those ones that wants to call us pentecostal because we get a little emotional or shout a little bit or or jump a little bit or maybe because we've seen our lifeboat moving through the building pardon me didn't mean to hurt your feelings but what in the world are you a methodist a good baptist catholic what are you if motion makes me a pentecost what does no emotion make you amen he said but see they have a form of godliness but deny the power how many people have you talked to i just talked to one out in the parking lot has a form of godliness has a form of worship has a has a want to go to church as i want to even minister has a want to do things but they deny that god can change a life they deny that the holy ghost can come in a heart and so change their nature to whether they don't want to smoke drink corrals do know that again but no they don't want that they want church and that a form of godliness oh they worship creeds but they deny the power from such turn away hallelujah for this is the sword to slip in from house to house and lead silly women and led away with divers lust amen never able to learn or never able to come to the knowledge of the truth he said see we got the church formal carnal believers and we got the church spiritual born again with signs and wonders by spiritual revelation just the same as it was in the garden of eden the spirit of cain is here the spirit of christ is here you have to make your choice what was cain worship dead worship that's right it was dead there wasn't no life he picked that fruit and as soon as you pick a fruit from a vine it's dead the life is in it's withering away it might look beautiful for just a few days but you leave it on your countertops long enough it'll be a stinking rotten mess you might you might can preserve it for a little longer in the refrigerator maybe a little longer in the freezer but if you allow it it'll rotten to the core because it was picked from the vine and it has no life and that's what cain worship is it don't have life in it there are people sitting like dead knots on the log there ain't no response to the word there's no joy in the house of god hey man they like i act like they're in a prison camp somewhere i don't want to act like that i want to act like i enjoy being in the presence of almighty god i want to act like i enjoy drinking from the fountains a pentecostal blessing i want to pleasure i want to give god all the glory when he's lived cain worship he wasn't brother brown said he wasn't infidel he wasn't a communist he was a believer he went to god built an altar done a very religious thing done every religious thing that apple abel done but he didn't have spiritual revelation of the will of god he said there you are he didn't have the spiritual revelation that's what's the matter with the church today he built an altar he worshipped he brought sacrifice he knelt down he prays he worshiped god he done everything religious that abel done and god flatly refused him because he didn't have a spiritual revelation of what god required then and from that same line went all the way down to the ark he said all the way down through israel all the way down through jesus all the way down to the dark ages until we see it again carnal fundamental church stiff and starchy he knows all the doctrines knows all the theologies they can explain it all boy just like that but without spiritual revelation that is the doctrine of cain and it's amazing who was it was cain and jealousy because he seen god accepting what they were doing and he began to strike out at what god was doing listen it wasn't even god he listened cain was he killed abel but he was striking out at god and this is why we got to be very careful who we strike out against you know it was what was one of the pharisees in the new in acts he said talking about that i believe it was about the disciples and things that were taking place and he had a very wise thing he said listen if it be of god let's don't say nothing about it but if it isn't of god it will come to naught balaam done the same thing as they come through the wilderness he said here comes a bunch of what they call holy rollers a little bit too emotional for balaam but what they had listen to what these holy rollers had these holy rollers they had a spiritual revelation god was with them they had a pillar of fire just reading it from the quotes they had a smitten rock they had a brass serpent serpent they had the pillar of fire and he said when i think that same god lives with us it's still the spiritual revelation of the world word he said that spiritual church still has the pillar of fire among them it still has signs and wonders it still has the same christ which it vindicates all the way from the dying lamb to the garden of eden unto the second coming of the lamb absolutely the same yesterday today and forever and that light of cain religious polish scholarly write down the same just the same every day the same criticizers persecutor this is a quote persecutors as k was of able so are they today and have been and always will be carnal unbelievers but look at cain and abel both of them sincere but cain by his wisdom after his mother church eve like his mother he took reasoning how can i build this the way that god would be pleased he didn't want to get bloody like abel did he didn't want to he didn't want to get drunk like they did on the day of pentecost he didn't want that he wanted something that he could you know have a good godly confession and and you know fulfill his religious duties and and leave out and go on about his business he didn't like the way able done his he thought man ain't no way that's such a nasty looking thing look look at that and nobody looked and he criticized look at all that nonsense they got going on and even like tabernacles they're just shouting and crying and running up and down the aisles and waving these white flags they've lost their mind didn't realize this was what god was requiring was this lamb and abel was dragging this lamb up and it's bleeding and his crying and and his uh and he's just looking and he's pulling come on and it was his fan it was something that was dear to him that he laid on the altar he tied his feet in his leg and he laid it there and he grabbed an old rock and he pulled his head back and he began to hack at his throat listen it wasn't a fun thing i can promise you i've had to kill some animals in my life and i don't ever like it when one of them begins to holler and begins to scream that's not a fun experience to me i don't enjoy that kind of thing amen i couldn't imagine this hey is this the lamb [Applause] that's how they make that's what kind of sound i've heard it and blood's trying to start squirting out and then kane's like oh my goodness they're they're he's crazy he's lost his mind well that's a that's a mess they got going on there look at all that nonsense and blood starts squirting everywhere and and god's looking at oh i'm so pleased this is what i was wanting this is what i desired this is what i'm longing for this is what i want and cain's over there criticizing and doing his that and he's making fun and all kinds of stuff happening come on now blood squirting everywhere it's getting all over abel's eyes and all down his clothes and listen when he left church it looked like he'd been to church god had changed him god had met him there god had done something for him amen that's what it ought to be when you come to church you mean you become part of your sacrifice that the blood of jesus should come upon you and it can wash you and it makes you white as snow it changes your nature it changes everything about you and when you leave church it looks like you've been to church oh beautiful sacrifice you couldn't get past the cane flowers he had it fruit he had it surely god surely in his race surely god would accept this but see he says see it ain't all he said you know the man was sincere because it meant life or death to him but his brother branham again he said them people who don't think they're they don't think they're hypocrites they're sincere then could they be sincere and be wrong he said sure he said a man could take arsenic sincerely thinking he's taking castor oil or something else he's sincere but it's sincerity and truth it's it's water and blood and spirit it's it's spirit and truth it's dynamics and mechanics it's mechanics and dynamics it's a balance listen i i agree if if all we get is jumping and shouting and carrying on and that's all we get it ain't going to do us no good but when i see lives have been changed i see young people they don't even look like the same young people no more and god's done something for them i realized it was more than just a drunk moment it was more than just a jump or a shout but there's a real change on the that's what we desire cain was bringing what he'd done cain was offering what he had grown what he'd worked for his own ability his own thinking to lay it on the altar to die not to lay it on the altar to die but to put it before god and say look what i've done look at my wisdom how i've learned to do this look at me god cain was coming in his own wisdom not god's wisdom there's a huge huge difference between the wisdom of man and godly wisdom amen cain was boasting in what he had done what he had provided that he had provided a way of salvation but abel was coming not by his own wisdom abel was coming boasting on what god had done and what god had provided amen but cain by his own wisdom would say surely god will accept me i've got an altar i've been to church i have i've worshiped i i'm just i'm sincere i've got a beautiful something here and surely god will receive it that's the same thing the devil told his mama the same lie same wisdom but in hebrews 11 it said by faith abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain amen a more excellent sacrifice how by faith not by intellectual wisdom not by his own understanding or his own reasons but by faith in what god required amen we're going down and he would go brother brown would go listen to that it's a wonderful message wisdom versus faith he talks about the revelation versus the botany life and the dead versus life and wisdom versus faith and wyatt had to take blood to bring him out of the garden again or or to appease god for the sin because it was blood that took them out it was blood that was going to take us back in he said how is a man through his own wisdom going to understand it when the whole bible the whole church of god is built upon divine revelation by faith amen upon this rock i'll build my church but see cain religion is dead religion able religion revelation is life i want to take a few things here for those that are formal let's help them maybe with their formalities when the church was inaugurated on the day of pentecost it's a very beautiful type of the first man of fallen they was up there in the upper room and one accord and suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind it filled all the house where there was setting clothing tongues appeared upon them like fire and they were all filled with the holy ghost and out into the street they went screaming and shouting and going on and all the religious formal world standing there saying well these guys are drunk he said they were full of new wine i never heard such noise in my life he said let me tell you something my dear catholic friend here let me tell you this today the blessed virgin mary was with them and if god wouldn't have respect no more for the mother of jesus christ that she couldn't get to heaven till she went there and received the same baptism of the holy ghost and act the same like a drunk woman how much more have you got to have it before you can get in there [Music] oh hallelujah she staggered like she was drunk hallelujah staggered like a drunk person he said have you ever heard a drunk saying oh everything's just fine now be not drunk upon strong drink this is what they're saying but be drunk on the spirit that's what we need today that's what we need today that's what we need today is an old-fashioned drunken baptism of the holy ghost that burns out sin an old-time backwood sky blue sin killing religion hallelujah what the world needs today it's an old-fashioned saint paul's revival the bible holy ghost back in the church again that's what's the matter with the church today the reason is so formal and indifference amen the formal church looked at him and said well what do we have to do to receive this peter would tell them they're they're not drunk as you suppose this is only the third hour of the day but this is that that the prophet joel spoke about this is a fulfilling of scriptures that's taking place he said what have we got to do he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he said see what has happened he said they went in and they got some of that original manner and he said and it's coming this day he said we have the same right to go in and get some of that same original manner that fell on the day of pentecost it ain't a hold over religion it's a whole jew religion amen it ain't a make-believe religion it's a religion that'll change your life change your thinking change your thoughts change everything about you change how you think about god and about church and about the uh the movement of the spirit it'll change everything if you get a good dose of this kind of holy ghost just up at those meetings in oklahoma we had an outbreak of the holy ghost girls drunk in the spirit laid out on the floor one of them happened to be my daughter katie i'd actually preached that night and went when i thought the service was just going to kind of end on a high note is shouting and praising god in worship so i went on back to my room to get get a shower real quick and come back and i came back and there was a prayer line out the door and around the building nearly and i'm like wow what's going on this is nearly an hour later my daughter's still over there in the floor and her and sister jamai and a couple others was there and i walked up to the uh to the door i went around toward the side i could get the decide i could easily access her because i wanted to go see what was all happening walked to the door and there's his brother standing there and i said brother what's happening here we got a drinking party going on he said he said i don't know this is quite amazing i said well let me go in there and i walked in there and i sat down by katie began to talk to her and pray for her she was drunk she didn't know where she was she didn't hardly know who she was finally got a hold of her and staggered her up to a pew behind us and sat down and put my arm around her and just crying and praying i thought boy if i don't get out of here it's going to get on me too and i'm going to be back out there on the floor with all the rest of them you just feel the power of god moving i said what's happened to you katie she said i don't know but i sure like it and i don't want it to ever end and she said a lot more drunker than i just said it so her mom came up and i prayed with her and later over there i began to walk out the building made it out the room and brother lemuel pruitt run out behind me and he said uncle timothy he said i got to get baptized i got to get baptized i got to get baptized i said what what do you got to get baptized for and i'm trying to remember is he ever been baptized you know it's trying to thought kind of things i'm trying to figure it out and he's just such deprived desperation that gripped him got to get baptized and i said well what do you want to be baptized for he said because i want that holy ghost i want god to change my life i gotta have it i'm not leaving here without it i said well you don't have to be baptized to get it you can get it and be baptized i laid hands on that boy and he went instantly drunk instantly drunk and laid him down in the chair somebody brought we prayed with him for a while and he began to scream out at that moment oh god you're my god you've come and touched me now i see it's real i see you've touched me and changed my heart you're my god hallelujah god still gives that kind of experience [Applause] there's still tongues in the church i know the carnal people want to cut it out but that's it's still right here in the word makes them feel uncomfortable but it's still here what's happened is their mana got old got termites in it bugs in it broken cisterns their waters run out all over the place why because they let their experience dry up there become nothing but stagnated pools but he said every person has a right to go back and get them a handful of that same original manner that fell on the day of pentecost it'll have the same works it'll have the same manifestations it'll have the same power it'll have the same evidence this is the prophet of god say everything that they got on pentecost we can have today not something like it the same thing oh hallelujah he said those fellows back under that old omar they didn't have to get something that looked like it they got the original he said i'm glad today that we can get the original baptism of the holy ghost powers signs wonders say miracles why is it it's the same resurrected lord jesus christ it's the same god moving among us he said it's not what it's another place this is not what i am or who i am it's the perfection of jesus christ and god that died in my place to make me what i am he said it isn't whether i can stand it's whether he stood oh i love that brother that would make a baptist shout out wow so apparently brother branham even believed in baptist shouting amen there's something about it that's real he said i believe and shout him i believe in that old-fashioned religion that's what's the matter today they say your religion is too much emotion he said i can prove to you scientifically anything that hasn't got emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got a little emotion in it you better just bury it for it's dead yes sir if a baby's born and it doesn't cry or do something the baby's dead we got too many dead born babies in church some of our message churches wouldn't like the prophet of god preaching for we got too many dead born babies born in our church that's what's the matter with the church it doesn't understand it hasn't never come to life you know what they do with a little baby when it's born if doctor picks him up and gives him a little posterior protoplasma stimulation he wakes him up right quick and he goes to squallin he said if there's anything the pentecostal church needs tonight it's a good old-fashioned gospel spanking to wake them up to wake them up the little thing get some of the starch out of them get some of the starch out of them he said you brother branham you're holding a meeting down there and then people are screaming and carrying on said yes sir he said don't you think that's fanaticism no sir so it reminds me one time he had a great night a farmer had this great nice farm beautiful farm nice tractors beautiful barns but he was just too lazy to farm let his place grow up in weeds wouldn't put up no hay wouldn't put up the feed too lazy yeah at all he had the beautiful tractor he had a beautiful barn but he had all the weeds no food and all he could do was look over at the other farmer other fellow lived over by him didn't have much of a place barnes maybe not too good but he was a real industrious smart worker he got out and he planted alfalfa and clover he said reminds us some of us has got big churches but that hasn't got nothing in it sometimes you get a little mission sometimes you got a lot more than you find in some of these big morgues around here he said you talk about hollering and caring brother on brother brother you don't even know the first principle of it that's what he's talking back to that guy he said in the barn of the farmer with the weeds in his loft to feed there was this little calf born and over on the other side and the old shaggy barn was this little calf bar born they both were fed through the winter and springtime come out and the farmer that had plenty of food to feed his calf he turned him out in the crowd when he did that calf was all fat and sassy you know when that spring wind blowed a little bit and boy he felt good and he went to kicking up his heels and the way he went and that man with that big fine ritzy polished up barn throughout his little calf out poor little fella so weak and couldn't hardly move he said he staggered out over that fine concrete floor peeped out through the little crack in that website oh that was me through the crack in that fence and watch that little calf feeling good kicking up in his heels it's a such fanaticism he said what's the matter he was hungry and he couldn't do that mercy instead of those preachers looking at us and saying fanaticism they ought to give their people something to eat so they got something to jump about and shout about and give god glory about won't you open up your bible and feed them something of the holy ghost give them something that'll give them spiritual strength and do season give them something that'll fight the devil that'll give them strength to stand toe-to-toe with that devil and say no devil you're not coming past here i rebuke you in the name of jesus he said you may have to worship in a cow barn but as long as you got spiritual vitamins as long as you got something to eat that's what makes you kick up the heels and act the way you do the holy spirit coming and confirming his word god promised it he gave it to us he said to abraham he was going to give him the promise abraham believed god and god told him if you notice went on to 100 years maybe got worse his strength was going on but that didn't keep him he just come over to god said look abraham your strength is gone just come on over to me i got something for you el shaddai the breasted one amen the way amen two sides to him healing and salvation and he brought it he said i'll satisfy you and i'll bring you back to strength again that you can fulfill my word i'll give you something to shout about i'll give you something that'll bring forth life then you won't have to criticize you have something with life in it another place about 50 years ago on this through the streets in california a bunch of people worshiping god so the method that methodism had gotten so formal and different that they didn't want none of what was called what they call fanaticism what they call fanaticism no shouting no amen no nothing in the church they thought that education and reformation would reform the people to a place that they didn't need that stuff no more this is where we get people are trying to reform people into being a christian more no more than an alcohol anonymous trying to just give them a little something that you know i understand you you had a little problem but if you'll do this 10-step program then you'll be okay know what you need is the holy ghost so let me tell you my friends education is good as it may be reformation as good as it may be will never never take the place of the baptism of the holy spirit it's god's eternal plan to seal his church away oh my another one talking about that calf again he said see what was wrong i going down he said he was starved on denominational weeds what we need is some holy ghost vitamins in the church that'll renew the youth it'll renew the youth of the church take it back to pentecost again take it back to pentecost again and bring you over with an experience fattened up he said that's what's the matter we're putting too much on our buildings and claiming jesus is coming we're doing this and doing that he said we got all kind of our intellectual knowledges what we ought to do is be on the job out getting somebody in there saving souls feeding them god's vitamins through the power of god that's exactly right amen just like the little calf come out of the stove just as fat and round kicking his heels out the other one's so poor poor he could hardly move and if the wind would blow it blow him over sideways he's seen that old fat calf of having such a good time such such fanaticism he said but when a man is filled with the holy ghost there's something in him that's full of god's spiritual vitamins it makes him praise god it makes him shout it makes him act different he's no longer earthbound he's heaven bound he's left them earth brown bicycles and automobiles and he's went up into the heavenlies oh hallelujah oh now we'll bring this one down ready in case you didn't like none of them here's a good one he said if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got to mother something it's a nature so a church is going to try to produce something but we're not to try to we're not to produce something that's not of god we're to produce god's seed the sun amen with the promise of the sun as abraham and sarah would but it's got and so this mother knows it's in her her nature is to produce something so instead of doing what god called her to do she's going to go manufacture something get her a dog love on it a cat live on it never seen such in my life anyway i'm going and to bear a child but to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service of god that's entirely out of her line she should oh but she'll be disgraced if she did by our sin-loving society of this 1965 type of woman a true picture of the modern church today he says neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngins around her she don't want over there any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had well you said brother timothy where are the messages we ain't part of the nomination well then what's your problem what you worried about hey man why such a child would be would immediately put her out of her nomination they had one like that in one of the churches while they'd throw her out real quick why are you letting such stuff like this go along oh so you see she's pregnant with something because she's going to bring forth members all the time but you don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belongs to they would throw her out but my she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth hello somebody you say well what year was that well that was 1965. but in case you want to know every quote i've read was in the year he was a prophet amen hallelujah that's the only kind the word will bring forth born of the spirit of god it has to have the spirit of god in it not intellectual church joined creed going bob there painted faces there's no such a thing as that in it at all you don't find that in the word of god you find old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god that all together out there adam's out of reach for that church but not for the church of the living god but he said i will restore [Music] he's brought a church up with the life of christ did it amen we're back to seed form again so just like there was in seed form at the beginning we're back in seed form again so you don't plant a corn and get a pea you plant a corn seed you get a corn seed so how in the world we're going to plant a church and get a different church it's going to be the same church with the same powers and the same wonders and the same holy ghost and the same miracles and the same signs hallelujah we saw this past weekend i mean miracle take place after miracle after miracle god moving in his children god touching hearts we saw a blood disease that was healed amen we saw a eczema that was healed some trouble that was healed all kind of other testimonies that are coming out of it god moving in a miraculous why because we're back to seed again with the same holy ghost as back in the church again and that same holy ghost has the same power over every sickness it has the same power over every sin it has the power over every devil in hell amen we saw how many pornography devils have to bow at the name of jesus and be driven out of lives amen they might have thought they had to live with it but when god became their god they really i don't have to live with that thing no more i'm free from that and we saw the same holy ghost give the same liberty that it did on the day of pentecost we're seeing the same holy ghost amen raise the dead among us it's the same power and it'll produce the same effects no matter what the spirit of formalism wants to say let's bow our hands he said and you accept you receive the same spiritual revelation you'll always call these people holy rollers fanatics always making fun mercy two spirits two twins where do you find yourself tonight we're looking at a church that's doing the greater works cancers are being healed every spirit of hell's being driven out young people overcoming baptized with the holy ghost that's what we're seeing lives change forever that's what we're seeing and people want to say that's fanaticism i'll take it i'll receive it i'll receive what he promised if you don't go i'll go probably seemed pretty crazy for rebecca to believe all the things that was in store for her but she had to come to his decision i would go god's moving in the miraculous realms they brother timothy i don't know i don't know about all that well i know right in the middle of a woman sitting on the side of a bed thinking about her problems and had that brain bleed all of a sudden her mind began to change she began to realize that god had been so good to her done some wonderful things and she started lifting up her hands and praising god and shouting and thanking him for sparing her life and the lord must have been pleased with it because right out of the middle of that floor step stood up this little 18 month old baby never walked or crawled and began to run all over the house doctor says he was going to have to have maybe surgery is this that another because of undeveloped underdeveloped hip but god came in that moment and healed him not only did he do that he restored my mama's eyesight back to her [Music] right in the middle of praising him and thanking him there's nothing wrong when praising him [Music] what why do they want to take that from us i got every right to praise him [Music] he'd done some wonderful things for me he ain't done nothing for you maybe you can just sit on your hands or whatever you want to do i don't see i don't see how that's possible he's giving you the opportunity to hear the truth that's enough to praise him about he passed the lifeboat by your way he said jump in you don't have to go that way that's enough to praise him about hallelujah thank you jesus we don't have to be ashamed of what god's done for us and what god's doing in our midst i'm not ashamed i can't tell you how many tears and rejoicing i've went back and watched last wednesday of god moving in a mighty way that's nothing to be ashamed about that's something to be thankful about that the spirit of god would feel pleased to drop in our midst and let us wave the white flag of victory [Music] and not only that we saw the black flags of satan fall at our feet [Music] something to praise him about [Music] hallelujah well i mean just say lord break all the shackles of formalism off of me lord i don't want to offer you something that's dead i want to offer you something with life in it lord [Music] maybe you've been out there been cold formal there's a fire here for
