this this evening to a kidney lord we speak life father to the body's lungs lord is trying to breathe we we speak the life of jesus lord we speak jesus over each and every heart we love you now and we appreciate you we thank you for the ability lord to depend upon the promises of god in jesus name amen and amen turn our bibles to second corinthians 10 and verse 3 and also isaiah 55 and verse 8 amen it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ also isaiah 55 and verse 8 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen let you be seated this evening i speak to you again on casting down imaginations you know i would i would just dare to say that there's probably not a person in this building that would want every thought that you had this week posted up here today or even maybe the last hour put up here today because we have things that comes through our minds and and you know brother branham would speak about it as a bird that would fly over your head you you could fly over your head but you can you can't keep it from doing that but you can keep it from building the nest and so you know brother brandon was actually asked a question about thoughts and about thinking he said brother adam please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to thank them he said if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking amen so all those things you've been battling with that wasn't your thoughts that was the devil's thoughts if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's god's thinking if it's wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's good thoughts of the word or of god it's god's thinking and i believe that's what we want today is god's thinking and so i believe to have god's thinking you have to think what god thinks and what god thinks is his word amen that is his written express thoughts of god written on paper for us to pull strength from in the hour or the battles that we're going through but we see here you know i was actually looking at some things and thinking man's filter today because brother branham is an interesting way that he received that sermon as he was walking in the very woods there where the squirrels were created he was walking there and he he said he saw a cigarette pack laying there and something told him to go back and look at it again and he went back and looked at it and it was a slogan on there that he would preach a amazing message from and pull from it many times throughout a couple of time more times throughout the last few years of his life on thinking man's filter and the slogan was a thinking man's filter and a smoking man's tastes and he would begin to talk about how that in that sermon as i would look at it today he began to talk about how men take other things and they begin to all right you know how they would put a filter he said you know up on a cigarette and then he said what was it he said there's nothing but a gimmick to make people smoke more cigarettes and he said well it was a you know put there as a gimmick because you're still taking in the the the tar you're still taking in the nicotine it's only there to sell more he said it was actually the the man's mind and their greed for more money to put that upon there and a trick of the devil amen to talk people in the smokings more cigarettes more cigarettes more cancer more diseases more this and that and the other he said but you know what man he said well he said there's other things that's even worse he talks about sin and he goes into all kinds of things and he said but there's only one thing that you can bring your thoughts to a real thinking man or a real man will bring their thoughts through the word of god and through the word of god then you can breathe in the thoughts of god and what god thinks of you and how he how he what he thinks of you and what he is determined you know he's in the scripture he said god said i know the thoughts that i think of you amen they're of good and not of evil amen there to have an expected end god has thoughts of you and they're not evil thoughts and i'm thankful tonight that god's thoughts don't change like man's thoughts change you know my man's thoughts you can think one thing one day in the next few hours think another thing and we get you know and go waffle back and forth but when god thinks something or when he first thought it it stays that way when he first thought of you in his mind no matter what's went on here on earth no matter how the devil has come against you and tormented you and brought you in different avenues and different things of your life that still did not change god's thinking you said well i got into drinking i got into this that and still did not change god's thinking amen what i got i got this sickness that still does not change god's thinking god's thoughts of you are always the same and i'm thankful to serve that kind of god i i don't know where we would be if god's thoughts changed of us if one day we thought was he thought we saved or the next day where he wasn't but if god ever had you in his mind and he did before the foundation of the world and he had a picture of you in his mind in his mind that picture's never changed even though sin has come and sickness has come and old ages come that picture he had of you and his mind has never changed but many times we begin to change because of of our own thinking our own thoughts and we begin to filter in other man's creeds or other man's ideas or even the devil's thinking comes into our mind and we begin to filter our own what we do or how we act through those filters but there's only one filter a christian needs tonight and that is the word of god if you can take the word of god and believe breathe in the thoughts of god then by his stripes you're healed amen by his stripes you're delivered if you could pull that in tonight it'll be it'll it'll produce something in your life amen and we know uh you know brother brown will talk about positive thinking and he would talk about positive thinking just positive thinking don't work but if you would take that and turn it upon and put that thinking towards the word of god that's what works and he talks about the right mental attitude he said if you could just take that right mental attitude towards any divine promise you watch it materialize no matter how impossible it looks if god said it he makes it possible hallelujah he said if you take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise god is made it'll come to pass if you'll just simply say it's god's word how many can say that tonight it's god's word amen it's not for me to try to figure it out that's god's business how he brings it to the past he spoke it and that's all that's necessary something will take place hallelujah he says the word of god written in the bible is his word to us and every promise has the same power of creation behind it that's what god's word had at the beginning every promise still has that same power of creation behind it and he said if we believe it to be the word of god he said it depends on where the seed falls he said it's if it falls into a ground a ground that has moisture or a nourishment around the promise of god it'll bring forth every promise the bible has amen i want that kind of mind tonight i want my mind to be able to come in under under the influence of the holy ghost that when the word of god falls there it will create the atmosphere it will create the moisture it will create the nourishment to bring it to pass amen and that's what we have to have he said why the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass if you just look at it and take care of the word just right because the infinite god spoke it it's god's word and it will come to pass hallelujah but it takes somebody with some with something about them to say yes lord i believe it's your word i believe your words for me and i'm going to breathe in your word tonight i'm going to breathe in the word of god i'm going to quit breathing in my doubts and and my fears and my anxieties and my worries i'm going to drink in from the word of god and let that word be born in my heart amen and that's what it takes he said if he says you know here's another question as we go into this he said the case may be the devil is placing your thoughts in your mind about a certain thing and this is a question he said if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of he said you take the very opposite of it amen if the devil makes you think he said if you know you're a christian but he tries to make you think you're not a christian take the very opposite and say i am a christian as long as your experience matches god's word say i am a christian and anything else the same way so if he tries to make you think there's no hope for you you tell him my hope is in jesus christ if he tries to make you think that there's this word is not for you you tell him the word is for me he said it and i believe it hallelujah he said see and anything he said see god grant your overcoming whoever you are may your thoughts go right back to the other side and say i'm a christian i'm a believer satan you have no hold on me hallelujah i wonder how many can say that tonight amen i'm a christian i'm a believer and satan you have no hold on me hallelujah he said frankly i'm standing right here saying the same thing he said because i'm fainting right here in the pulpit four or five times i've almost pitched over that's the truth why because of thoughts the devil trying to put thoughts in a prophet's mind mercy but the first thing you have to do is you have to surrender yourself entirely to christ surrender your mind to his word lord i won't act on my own feelings no more well that'll solve a lot of problems right there amen i won't act upon my own thoughts i will only act upon your word amen i will act upon your word it's not you're not to go down and say well i you know i lost my healing if you do it'll be worse than you ever was don't ever say that you stand right there upon the word of god and make that committal lord god of heaven i'll stand by my what your word so help me till the last drop of blood is left in my body or i breathe my last breath oh hallelujah the devil won't know what to do with a person that'll stand there no matter what he puts against them listen i've seen people face insurmountable odds and i thought how in the world are they standing there they wasn't standing there by their own power they couldn't have no more power left they had no more human strength left they had no more human ability left but they were standing upon a word and it wasn't just a word of a mortal man it was the word of almighty god that said let there be and that's where the bride is standing tonight we're not standing upon a word of a kentuckian preacher we're not standing on the word of some theologian we're not standing on the word of this church we're standing upon the unadulterated word of almighty god and he said i will have a bride without spot without wrinkle and that's where we're standing he said it hope you're this kind of group here tonight he said here sits a group tonight waiting under great anticipation i believe we ought to come to every service in anticipation amen every day not just a church we ought to be anticipating every day for god to do something amen he said i hear sets a group of people right now setting waiting under great anticipation but satan if he can interrupt your mind that's all he has to do wow and it don't have to be necessarily a bad thought come on now he can get you thinking about tomorrow or thinking about yesterday or thinking about today any and they're not thinking sinful thoughts some may be but not everybody amen i hope not thinking sinful thoughts just everyday thinking what is he doing he's trying to interrupt your thinking interrupt your focus interrupt amen what god is doing i've seen it happen you know brother brown would call it out he said what happened he said that woman's missed it he said why because the devil came and interrupted her or he'd say some other word but the devil would come and move and it would interrupt what was going on and she would miss what god was doing or he would miss what god was doing listen we ought to be well every time especially when we come to the house of god well to lay aside everything i mean just lay aside tomorrow let tomorrow take care of itself well i got this plan and i got to go do this and i still got to do this and i and we got a whole list of to do and all these things and before we know it the service has come and gone and god moved and we missed it why did satan interrupted our thinking he interrupted our thoughts he found a little spot there to grab your attention and meanwhile the angel was passing right by come on somebody amen it's time we focus in if there ever got to be a people that's focused into what god's doing it ought to be this people in this day because we're coming right down to the very end we're coming right down the last mile the last hill the last valley the last trial the last sickness the last demons of hell the last moments upon this earth we ought to be focused here and saying god i don't want to miss a moment with you i don't want to miss it when you're raising the dead among you you're healing the sick and you're delivering you're setting free i don't want to miss a moment what has to happen you got to give god's word first place amen i wish i had spoke to me today or in the last couple of days i've seen it somebody shared it with me talking about how a holy ghost feel person brother brown said can sit hour after hour and drink in that word why because you're focused on something you know i i i know every one of you has watched the film or something maybe whatever whatever kind of film hope it's been a godly film but you know you get to that punch line and somebody wants to come talk to you and you realize if i don't catch this i'm gonna miss what's going on or you know it's something and and and all of a sudden something can happen you're like wait a minute what happened how did that how did that happen i missed it there's going to be a lot of people that's going to come to a moment and say you know what i missed it because the devil interrupted their thinking and it wasn't all on sinful things think about those excuses that came to go i don't know why we're going here but we're going think about those excuses that were given to go to the to the marriage supper wasn't necessarily sinful things it was an ox or it was a land or it was this or that the other it was everyday life [Applause] come on somebody all the devil has to do in a service is interrupt your thinking and then the preacher can preach 30 minutes and you've been off somewhere else for 30 minutes and you missed it and you might have missed your visitation this is why and i okay i'm the system pastor here so i can say this this is why it's important that when it comes down to the end of the service that you really start tuning in i think the time to get up to go to the bathroom that ain't the time to go wash your hands or think about this or think about that tune in because the holy spirit has fallen among the people and you don't want to miss your visitation brother so-and-so may still get his but you might miss yours and it may never come back come on somebody it's time that we realize satan is trying to interrupt our thinking trying to interrupt our thoughts it ain't so much about this and that and the other sinful things but everyday life give god's word first place that's what was a statement in the greatest battle ever fought give god's word first place a man cannot sin until first he cast aside god's word he can't sin until he cast away and that's disbelief until first he gets rid of the word of god the presence of god he cannot sin eve could not see it until she laid aside god's word and are we not seeing that in the day we're living in today but aaron just sent me the thing today the pope come out and said talks about how the homosexuals are now accepted they're all god's children they're smoking through a different filter they're smoking through the filter of hell no other word no wonder the bible would call her the mother and her harlot daughters and she'll burn with unquenchable fire amen why because they have taken the word of god and they laid it aside and took man's thinking amen we don't want man thinking we want god thinking i don't want man seeking him in my own life everyday life i want god's sake i don't want my thinking one little iota of god's word disbelief caused all the trouble that we're having now how's it going to get back by still disbelieving god's word no it's you'll have it's gonna have to shut off all those same shut off memories shut off conscience shut off reasons and ain't that what the devil loves to do he loves to bring back memories especially bad memories and faults and failures and try to bring all that back up but you wouldn't have done this if you was a christian or you wouldn't have done this if you was there you went yeah cast down reasonings cast it all it's accept the word upon this basis god said so and if god said so and you accept it it puts a channel between you and god that god can operate in that god can move in that god can become and do something for you in he said you can't come through reasoning you can't come through all these other things you say well if i could just feel it it ain't about feeling it it ain't about i could smell it or if i could taste it ain't nothing about that well it looks like it ought to know you know the doctor said this look like they ought to know what they're talking about amen but they're what are the who says the doctor's right he said what is it all of those thoughts is just the devil standing there the devil trying to poke something into you trying to get you to disbelieve god's word oh but god's word said above all things can you say that above all things i would that you prosper in health hallelujah above all things he said my i want you to prosper in health he said but what happens satan tries to get by that by poking in a little doubt or leave something into your conscience or something into your memory or something into other some other avenue and he tries to find an outlet or a weakness he can get you in he begins to use all those little different channels if he can get your mind to accept it oh but what he can batter against you but it can't get to you unless you accept it what the doctor said can battle against you what your mind is saying can battle against you but until you accept it it can't get to you hallelujah when satan walked up to eve you know the fruit is pleasant what happened she stopped for just a moment and she began to reason it all out and she stopped he said don't stop for nothing listen we're too far along the journey this ain't the time to stop he said don't stop for nothing you got the message who's got the message tonight jesus lives god's a healer he's a deliverer he's a savior he's the same yesterday today and forever don't stop for nothing hallelujah i've heard the message and i'm going to believe it no matter what [Music] but she stopped for a moment and when she did that's when satan walked into the mind well that sounds reasonable yeah he did say that but i understand what you're saying what about what had happened to abraham if he would have stopped yeah right he'd have never received the promised son or you could manufacture something but that wasn't what god was talking about he'd have never received the promised son and people have manufactured things and manufactured but there's going to be a people that receive a promised son hallelujah amen what if he had stopped for reason and when he said sarah was going to have a baby here here she is now 65 of him 75 and he gets to be a hunter and she gets to be at 90 90 years old no hope left and you say well i hope you i get this right i hope i'll be well i hope i'll get the holy ghost i hope i'm a christian i hope i do you don't want that against hope he believed in the word of god faith is beyond hope [Music] faith comes from back inside faith comes from in here amen but through this mind this battle is going on he said when you get the battle setting array the devil is sitting right here on every heart he said right here in this meeting every heart he's trying to sit there and he's trying to bring down he's trying to bring fear he's trying to bring unbelief he's trying to tell you it'll be another service he's trying to say it'll be another time he's trying to tell you we can't have another service like we've had before he's trying to tell you all kinds of things he's trying to he said well what do you have to do when he comes cast him out that's all cast him out amen that's right cast him out we have been trained oh hallelujah i believe there's a people here today that's been trained to cast out devils amen and i i understand those demonics that forces that expose themselves and show themselves by speaking out of somebody but i'm talking about even the devil that wants to come and try to turn your mind or interrupt your mind cast him out say no satan i got god's word it's first place and i'm listening for the sound i'm listening for it and i know at any moment the angels of god are going to begin to move and things are going to be to take place and i'm waiting for that sound amen is what he told david he said you wait for the sound of a going you wait for the rustling and the mulberry trees and you wait on there and you don't move until it happens cast down your reasoning david cast down at the heart of the army's bigger and greater because when i move i move oh hallelujah when god moves god moves and when he begins to move it's time to step into the water [Applause] got to thinking about that after wednesday night unless wednesday night some came up within about 30 minutes of the preaching apparently didn't bother god might have been out of somebody's order somewhere but it wasn't out of god's order amen but i got to think of the member of the air and i believe was talking about it afterwards you know when that angel came down into the pool and began to trouble the water i don't see anywhere that there was a guaranteed time he was going to be there anybody read it 30 minutes 30 seconds hour three hours one day no he said when he troubles you get in when god's moving you get in be sensitive to the spirit of god we ought to be a people that's sensitive when god's moving amen we realize he said we ought to be a trained he said you said what's the matter with us preachers he said i wonder what kind of training we have had he says there in daniel 12 there'll be a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before and we're living in that time hello somebody that was 1962. pretty good dave you asked me looking back i mean you know people living in the 50s and 60s i mean could do unbelievable things brother ross here tonight i don't see him but he talks about as a kid just a kid going and jumping the train and going down to baton rouge for the day i don't think there's been a thought like that in the building today now we live in a time if we heard from our kids in 30 minutes we think they'd have been in a car wreck they're in icu and they're almost dead thoughts the battle this is the greatest battle ever fought well let me tell you this battle hasn't gotten better it's got worse mercy a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before and we're living in a time of trouble amen with when culture and education is smothering out the word of god and has got into reasonings and so forth the battle is on now who will stand there's a question who will stand the battle is ready to go in she's an array look what a great opposition we got yonder i wonder if he was seeing to where we're at today or even the 1977 what a great opposition we got yonder but who will be like david it said let's you stand and let that uncircumcised philistine defy the armies of the living god i'll go fight him he cast down all of his reasonings he cast out think about all the doubts and the reason david how he had him but he cast them down and he stood upon the word of god this word says i am a son of abraham and this word has given me an inheritance and this is my land that john's standing on how dare that goliath the father the armies of the living god i'll go fight him hallelujah is there some people here that's tired of the devil standing on your god-given grounds standing upon the promises of god and saying you can't have it you can't have it next service next service next service i defy you devil in the name of jesus christ this is my hour this is my time and i'm coming for it hallelujah i'm coming forward in the name of jesus christ you're going to get your hands off of my property hallelujah who will be a david we got plenty of sauce got plenty of david's brothers hiding in their tents worried about what to do about this oh i could say a lot of things right there i'm so glad god's given us the ability to stay home and have church in the tent meanwhile goliath is marching back and forth stealing their families robbing their joy taking what god has rightfully given god's children and they're allowing it to happen but there's some david's on the earth it said not today goliath i'm only going to listen to you one time and

shoot at it and graze this wing and graze his back and grave maybe shot off one one leg but he still had the message and just in the nick of time here he he he makes it up high enough till he's out of reach and he flies over into the camp and he makes it in the message got through on the wings of a dove amen the message got in amen i remember of another great dove he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity and the chastisement of my peace was upon him and the message got through he's a healer and though all hail has sell me i'm not gonna be moved amen jesus
