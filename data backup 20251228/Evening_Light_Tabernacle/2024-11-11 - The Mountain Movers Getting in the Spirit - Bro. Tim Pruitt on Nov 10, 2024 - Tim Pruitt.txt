something pleasant oh I'm so thankful for him this morning aren't you amen God bless you you'll turn with me to Revelation chap 1 and9 and I want to read from the scripture today Revelation chapter 1 and we will read from verse 9 I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was on the aisle that is called patmas for the word of the Lord and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in a book and send to the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and to Smyrna and the pergamus and thyra and to Sardis and into Philadelphia and he didn't leave out the end time he said into leoda and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle and I'd like you to turn with me to 1 Corinthians 14:1 15 one verse there what is it then I pray with the spirit I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also God bless you can be seated I want to speak today on getting in the spirit I here he says in in this chapter of Revelation that we have just read it pictures him in a very Barren deserted place on the aisle of patmas he put out there with a bunch of criminals for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ not for doing something evil or bad but you know by just serving God he's here in a very difficult place in life and you know it is it's been really busy all around and people are wondering about the coming of the Lord and and they're saying John you know you're getting old and you know you you know he told you you'd live to see his coming and yet you know um you're still here and and um you're getting older it's got to be any day John and of course John would write in in his gospel and he said but they misunderstood the Lord he didn't say that I would T till he come but what is it today if he terries till I come you see a lot of times when prophecies come even though you heard them they're still a misunderstood because even in your own mind things get interpreted and you know slanted by what you heard that's what I heard him say and this what I took him to mean and they had taken him to mean that the Lord was coming at any moment and and surely John surely John you know we're looking at you you're getting older and you're running out of time and when are you when is the Lord coming I mean I mean you know what did he say to you what well you know he he didn't tell us about his coming he said that day and that hour I can't tell you that only the father knows because here I am is a in in man form and here there's only some things that I can see as a in in this form because I I come to overcome as a man and and and I didn't come to live this life as a God but I came to live it as a man to overcome as you overcome and go through things like you go through and and so I can't tell you everything but because of this saying God takes him up onto the aisle of patmas and you know sometimes the government will do some many funny things you know they the devil will actually work and do something for his plans and yet it's God's plans all the time because nothing gets out of cater with a Christian everything is in place everything is where he supposed to be God has it all orchestrated and all things are working out together for your good because God's got a purpose and a plan in life he's not an author of frustration but he's an author of peace and so when we're looking at this he says um he's he's out on the aisle of patmas and the government has uh has arrested him and put false charges against him and put him over here on the aisle of Patmos for for the testimony of Jesus Christ and and holding him in a Barren place with a bunch of criminal and he gets a little bit of rest out there and while he's resting from all of the questions that are going on from the Believers God comes to him and reveals to him his coming that's right and and so here in this moment the Bible said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now it wasn't just a Sabbath that he was on it wasn't a Sunday that it was on but he was actually carried into the spirit into the eternals into the day of the Lord he got in the spirit this is something is very important for us as Believers to realize you know really it's not about this life it's even not about the way we sing or our our voices or whatever it's really about getting in the spirit brother Brandon would talk about this and he said I would call those words the whole of Christian Life In other words this is so important to us this should be our goal our aim our desire to get in the spirit you know again if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit and John was not talking about his own Spirit of course I would not have brought to his visions and had to be the spirit of God and it has to be the spirit of God with us too or yet all our effort even all our worship is in vain because he would say to them in that day in vain do you worship me because you're teaching for Doctor the Commandments of men you're never getting into the spirit of the thing you're never really seeing what I'm saying you're not really comprehending it's not getting a hold of you you're not moving into the Realms of the Eternal you're too carnal in your beliefs this would happen over and over again with so many but you see if there's anything's going to be good is like Paul said if I sing I'll sing in the spirit if I pray let me pray in the spirit amen you know because it is there where that if it's going to be revealed it has to be revealed by the spirit and and it then confirmed by the word it made manifest by the results that it bears and so you know John needed to receive these these um tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus and as surely as he did we need to be in the spirit to understand to wrap our minds around what God is doing in our generation and to see it in the importance of what it is meant to be you know this week I dreamed and I dreamed I was in a church service just like like this and there were people in attendance I knew them I knew who they were they were just sitting there and but yet you know they were in attendance but it was as they were spiritually dead there was I had no response to worship there was no response to the preaching they were just there and I spoke to them and I said it does no good just to come to church and yet never get in the spirit now I you know I just want to say to you today even what good is it to just attend church without getting in the spirit you see it is a form of godliness it is something that every believer should do every believer should go to church it ought to be his custom it ought to be what we do but it's got to be more than just coming amen but we must we must not Den deny the power come on church amen but but but again we must have the anointing come down and it becomes and when it comes you see it's the power of God but just attending church just go into the motion of singing just going through the motion of prayers with never get in the spirit is just a form of godliness that denies the power and we are counseled in the scripture turn away from that yes sir amen this is very important you see even in preaching it's not preaching unless the Speaker gets in the spirit amen it's it's just an intellectual talk it's a lecture it's a speech but unless it's anointed amen it that's all it is amen preaching it must be is only preaching when it gets anointed when the Holy Spirit Come comes down takes the man over and speaks things that oh my in the spirit he never even knew he would ever even say but the Holy Spirit takes him over you see the Bible said in 1 Peter 4:11 If any man speak let him speak as an oracle of God in other words whoever speaks is as let him speak as utterances of God let it be God uttering through him let it be the voice of God speaking amen again are you called the preach then preach as though it was God himself we speaking through you there there again this is what it must be it must be a man yielded to the spirit of God not just getting up with because he is gifted he has a he is an aror and able to get up before a crowd and you know he has a personality that is attractive no that's not it is it is that you preach and you allow God to speak through you anybody can give a speech amen but it takes the anointing of God to preach now some men have claimed they can preach without the anointing I've never seen one preach I've seen them give a talk amen but it ain't worth anything unless the spirit comes I would you to understand folks you know it's not worth anything unless the spirit comes get it down in your heart this morning to realize even our worship is in vain unless the spirit comes I was in the spirit here again you know brother Brandon would tell us again about a a minister and he said let me just share it he said I first thing I would say according to rules of the church in the New Testament at the first place people entered the Church of God in a spirit of worship that walked in hymns were sang and maybe the preacher would speak for he for he was the prophet of the church amen a new testament Prophet is a preacher we know that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy said Revelation right that's in the last chapter and a lot of people don't know that a man a man who is preaching is actually prophesying if he's under the anointing when the anointing comes it's God using his voice voice it's God speaking a message that he is predestined for that moment and when God speaks you must hear you must listen you must embrace it now so again you said well I don't know about this um preacher of being a new testament Prophet well that's what the prophet taught us and and you said well but we only have one Prophet yeah one major prophet One Church age messenger one seventh angel one Elijah there's not going to be another come on nobody else to raise up but they're still prophets amen when he assited on high he sent gifts back to men Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors amen these are gifts that God gives and when they get anointed by the spirit of God they are God's voice to you and so it's the testimony of Jesus Christ you know the preacher be brother Brandon said now the preacher begin to preach and while he preach the blessings maybe in the end the big sermon Begin to Fall um the the people would say amen and go to blessing God now he's given the order of the New Testament Church the preacher would preach he would get under the anointing and then the blessings would fall and and then they go to blessing God and as soon as he stop preaching there would there would be a message maybe go forth maybe speaking in with unknown tongues First Corinthians 14:13-14 then if there be no interpreter in the church this person is supposed to hold this their their peace because they're speaking in tongues correctly but they do it before God so if they speak in tongues and nobody inter interprets well don't give any more tongues there's not an interpreter in the house amen you see there but if they're speaking in tongues and there's an interpreter an interpreter is supposed to give the message all the all churches are coming to that so I'm just telling you what he said you know people say well say what he said well that's what he said but as we want to say again is in 1 John 2:20 but you have an unction from the Holy One an unction that's an anointing you have an anointing from the Holy One you have been set apart you have been specially gifted you have been prepared by the Holy Spirit and all of you know the truth because the because he teaches us illuminates our mind he guards us from error we don't have to worry about being deceived the elect is not going to be deceived come on amen yeah there's a deception going on in the world today but not for you because the elect will not be deceived oh can they be misguided can they make wrong steps can they can they hold the things wrong sometimes thinking they're right yes but got to get them back on track don't worry he knows how to do it so you know as brother bradam tells us and let me quote him here he said you Brethren you have never preached a sermon in your life now let me just say brother Aaron me Timothy brother Joe God bless him he's out ministering today but you've never preached a sermon in your life the Holy Spirit preached a sermon through you I'm quoting that's right see we don't preach the Holy Spirit does the speaking oh we might write out something and read it but that isn't preaching preaching is when inspiration comes and it is preached by inspiration and the the holy spirit gives the unction amen I love it when he says it there you have an un you have an anointing you are anointed people hallelujah what what a word that this is to us today not just receiving intellectual speakers be Spees because any man can get up and give a speech but it takes a call and an anointing from God to preach so well why do you preach well cuz Jesus told me to because Paul told me to because the seventh angel told me to and because God told me to amen so we are instructed in the word that there would be those who would preach men who would be Oracles of God men who would who would speak the words of God now let me just realize it is an intellectual it isn't how smart we are you see we we have not drawn you even to this place you're not even drawn to this message because we had the most intellectual man you know we had this great wizard brain wizard you know here that that's smarter than all the rest and so we were attracted to the message because of how intelligent brother brandham was now he was intelligent there's no dummy but that wasn't what got us it wasn't even the the proof of in his intelligence would have been so many degrees on the wall you know from colleges and whatever proven that he' passed certain tests and made made certain qualifications but that isn't What attracted us What attracted us was the spirit we saw the Holy Ghost we saw the word demonstrated we saw the power of God that's our attraction amen now you see again today churches are full of churches that are are there trying to get them in the church by intellectual speeches but but we don't need intellectual speeches what we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with power with demonstration manifestation of the spirit that is our greatest attraction our greatest attraction isn't because we got men that can oh man he they can wow you with with great Revelations and Mysteries and understanding you know I I'll just say to to begin it's one of my coin phrases you'll hear me say it from time to time I hate mystery preachers because when they get through it's still a mystery amen Don't Preach me a mystery the Mysteries have been revealed preach me the Revelation amen and the Revelation is it becomes simple it can be received by you know it's sure it was a mystery it was held out of our understanding God did that for a purpose for the end time but not for any longer that's right come on church I'll hold the mystery back back in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin the S the mystery of God will be finished amen it a a time to preach Mysteries we're preaching understanding we can preach the Revelation oh I hear them you know somebody asked me a question the other day and the other you know it was it was over in Europe and the little person was trying to speak to me in French and I didn't get much of their French so somebody was trying to interpret it and I I was trying to explain something to her and she was an elderly person you know and I was trying to to get it to and the person wasn't speaking very good french well maybe good french but not understanding good English finally he just desperately Shrugged and said it's a revelation in it right and I said no it isn't a revelation it's been revealed it's no longer a mystery it's no longer some hidden secret it is something revealed it's unveiled it's plain now now God chose in you know illiterate and ignorant men who could not speak well men who couldn't even read their name and the Bible said it in the in the book of Acts when it described the disciples said these are ignorant and unlearned men but we'll tell you something about them they've been with Jesus yes amen we can tell this about them they didn't get their recommendation from us they didn't get their credentials from us but where they got it from here's why we know look he just raised up this man this crippled man we know these men have been with Jesus that ought to be the testimony of every every preacher every person we have been with Jesus even even the slogan of brother Brandon's a sermon they would preach over again it say we would see Jesus this ought to be the goal of every time we come to church amen not to see a man not to seeing pretty songs not just to have a little time of of entertainment Church isn't about entertainment s we will see Jesus if you think of it God chose an illiterate Kentucky preacher to be his voice to this last age and you might ask why why would God choose a seventh great Kian so he wouldn't lean on his own understanding but to be taught of the Lord this is important some somebody who would get it from the Spirit come on that's the way this message came it came without men's intellectual abilities as I said not that the prophet wasn't intellectual or that you know it was an intelligent I meant far from it but rather he didn't lean on his intelligence but was moved by the Spirit come on church amen now you see but today we we come and we we move forward we advance in years and the message and and I I just want to say the vision of of the Bride where where he saw the vision of the church and then the vision of the Bride you know remember and he said that they they were he had the preview and he saw them and the the condition as it started out a beautiful select elected group of women Marching In Tune and Harmony and they were in the spirit of Onward Christian Soldiers going forward advancing I like that amen and then then he would see the degression as it moved over into Europe and the gospel moves into America and how worse and worse and worse and worse it became and he could even see them going down as they come to the end rather than going up and he said I then he said I thought my my my mind is that the best I could do is that the best all the gospel preaching could do is to get is to do the do it like this you know preach with all our hearts and this is the results a bunch of rejected people out of the spirit dancing into the tune the rhythm of the world to the tune of rock and roll going on down and into these things moving into this that's the the best I could do and he said about that time he said I saw and heard the music change and I saw that group of women coming again he said here they come again at the end time he said look the bride will come again and then he said I saw some of them in the back and I that's where I want to say we're at we're in the back amen we're way way down the line we've been many many years in this come on we where there's many of us that just got in the in the parade as it was but he said I saw them get out of Step because they were looking they were looking and watching what they were these others were doing listen we cannot look and see what the others are doing we cannot gaze upon them or pattern from them or take from the denominational system come on church amen we must be a people who instead of get out of the spirit get in the [Applause] spirit but it wasn't all gone it wasn't all hopeless it wasn't all lost he said as they got out of Step I heard my voice scream out get back in line see it wasn't they weren't bride many times many times men will get out of Step they'll get out of Harmony sometimes they misunderstand but they'll get back in line they're the elect right they just got to get in the spirit somebody help me now amen now brother brandham brother brandham told us you know if education was to take take the place then Christ would establish schools when it when he was here on the earth and and that's what I'm trying to say listen psychology will never which is behavioral change we can never replace the spirit amen come on even theology knowing the word cannot replace the Holy Ghost that's right W if I speak in tongues you know like men and angels and and and if I have all the gifts yeah if I know all the Mysteries and have not this holy spirit of God it don't matter you can clutch your sealed book and miss the Rapture God ain't rapturing books he's rapturing people who are changed people who have been caught up in the spirit yes amen listen you see if Psychology was what was needed then Christ would have ordained psychologist but God didn't ordain psychologist said brother Jim why would you preach like this because those in the back we're having problems with even ministers in the back who are back there now you know introducing psychology and and having having seminars to to to change the behavior people listen that ain't what you need you need to get in the spirit somebody needs to get anointed with the Holy Ghost and preach the word with power and that power deliver amen now brother bradam warned of becoming imperfect strength and by Perfect weakness he taught he talk when we realize our weakness that our intellect cannot accomplish the job that's when we will seek the Lord and receive strength for the job now he told us that demons were streaming loose everywhere they're coming he said out of tombstones out of morgs churches that you know the spiritual thermometer is 90° below zero you know he said he said that demons are streaming loose saying and they're crying the days of Miracles are house and we don't need the Holy Ghost you say well they would never say that no they won't come right out and say that but what they say is it was that was for another time that was only for that healing movement that was only for that era we we've got the word now well pardon me if you got the word that look like to me you would have everything if you got a open book you would have every promise of God you would have healing miracles signs wonders come on the baptism of the Holy Ghost the shout of the king in the midst the holy ghost moving among the people there would be I it will be poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh Sons and Daughters would prophesy old men would see dream dreams young men re see visions so they would never say days of Miracles are passed and we don't need the Holy Ghost so they would never say it that way but they're saying the same thing we don't need the holy we don't need the Holy Ghost who would say we don't need the Holy Ghost a ain't a Baptist Methodist preser and Catholic any of them would say we don't need the Holy Ghost there's not not any but what will they say we don't need to be filled with the spirit like acts two we don't need an experience you see that was only for them back you see days of Miracles are passed and you know why you know why this has happened cuz we got men in the Pulpit that have never experienced God Amen they're not anointed by the spirit they don't know the anointing amen they don't they you see again brother Bram said they there these are coming there from from these from these um tombs tombstones crying days of Miracles has passed and we don't need the Holy Ghost and who can tame that devil you remember I've been preaching about Revelation chapter n and the influx of demonic spirits and it coming against the bride in an ecclesiastical manner right not physical but in ecclesiastical Manner and he says who can tame that devil we can't do it by ecclesiastical forces but there was a voice one time that did amen that Tamed them Devils put them in the right mind put clothes on them and that same voice give us a promise The Works that I do shall you do also you'll never do it under an ecclesiastical gasoline in a carbon struck car you'll never do it in organization you you do it when you empty up and become weak and pour all yourself out and let the Holy Ghost come in and flood over every part of you and saturate every lid of your body amen I I pray there'll be bodies this morning saturated with the Holy Ghost people who get in the spirit now as brother Bram said if we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the Holy Spirit and if the churches to be run and governed up on the intellects the educational program you say brother Jim ain't no educational program listen you know we we have we have taken this until we educate people into the message it's educational programs where we teach them how to behave here and we teach them how to dress and we teach them certain doctrines and and and it becomes an educational program listen friends you know honestly you'll not have to preach another sermon on Holiness if you get people filled with the Holy Ghost it'll be the holy God on the inside living out his holy life I won't even be needed I mean you won't have to say one thing about short dresses and and bobbed hair and cutting hair and trimming it off and painting your face you won't have to say none of that if you get the Holy Ghost those who chafe against it and push against it are people without the Holy Ghost I'll tell you right now you hear them saying you know this don't matter here and this don't matter here it's because you have never got in the spirit you might have come to church you might have been born on a message Pew but you have never been filled with the Holy Ghost where your nature is changed so you you'll give voice to the world instead of voice to the word you see again if if it's to be run by the Holy Spirit then we don't need the intellectuals amen it's either one of the other am it's a day where the church has actually rejected the Holy Spirit just like the brothers of Joseph didn't want that dreamer you remember he was a spirit field man you know they you know they didn't want that Holy that Holy Spirit they resented the supernatural happening in their midst rather than embracing it and saying oh we don't know how this is going to happen but praise God he's raised up by our young brother here and he he's going to exalt him such a place and and and and and position God's got a a plan and a hope and a future for us but instead of doing that they resist ented the word of the Lord they resented the anointing that was upon the upon Joseph they resented the Supernatural and they thought we'll never need this guy so what we'll do is we'll kill him and then one you know got his mind on money and he said no tell you what we better out be better off with some money than to kill him so sell him so they sold him well not knowing not knowing they were prophesying of what Israel would do thousands of years later they would sell the Supernatural come on Amen and and that's exactly what would happen they would reject Christ and they would they would selling for 30 pieces of silver and and for money and the same thing would happen with with Joseph's brothers they didn't want this dreamer they didn't want the spirit amen so you see like I said they think with their own intellectual mind I mean here I am I'm I'm the firstborn here and and I'm I'm the one here I'm I'm better to able to set the church in order better than what the Holy Spirit could do but they don't need it any longer we don't need it quoting the prophet we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need the Holy Spirit to speak with tongues we're all intelligent people now now Church listen I I I don't want I don't want a bunch of just people you know just a bunch of tongue speaking and confusion and and nonsense I don't see impersonation and people trying to manufacture something please don't do it amen don't do it you'll spare yourself and me a whole lot of trouble that's right but I tell you what I am going to do I'm going to say it's in the Bible I am going to say it's for the church I am to say that the Holy Spirit does those things amen and we should we welcome it come on so they say well now listen I'm talking about mainstream message men stand up and preach whether or not preaching speaking can't say that under inspiration under inspiration you can't say these things so well we do you know you want gifts you want speaking in tongues you know it's CU you're you're just Pentecostal babies grow up no the that was a mature church that's right come on read the book of Acts amen realize what they were they were a mature church this is what the seed did the seed had signs and wonders the seed had manifestation the seed had the power of God the seed God in the spirit that was the seed Church well of course they wasn't like that in Lutheran of course they wasn't like that in Westland course the shf impersonated the Grain and it wasn't the grain but we're back to the grain again somebody wake up it's not a sign of immaturity it's a sign of maturity [Applause] but the devil wants to take that and turn it around because men don't get in the spirit now he said he said you see the stone that was rejected is the Chief Cornerstone that the building set on and he said Jesus was that he was rejected and this last day they're going to reject the Chief Cornerstone and if you remember the Cornerstone for your life the Capstone for your life is God himself love that comes through the baptism of the Holy Ghost statue of perfect man brother Bram did not put the Holy Ghost down here at the bottom he put it up here at the top we're right here at the top where the Capstone and the Holy Ghost must be there this is the adopted church people who know how to operate in the spirit people who get in the spirit now again he says he said the reason that it was they thought they would never need it we don't need speaker in tongues we don't need interpreters in tongues we don't need Old Testament prophets to set us in order by the Holy Spirit we understand it they've adopted man-made Creed to take their place therefore there is a people that is elected I believe I'm speaking to those this morning that has their names on the Lamb's Book of Life and they can't go for that they are spiritual minded and therefore they cannot go for that they cannot stand it no matter if their fathers and mothers has was lived in whatever organizational church when the when a church makes does maybe it wouldn't speak that out right out oh no but they won't speak it right out but their actions prove it here's the word and the Holy Spirit proves it among those when he can get them gathered together that he still heals the sick and raises the dead and speaks with tongues and casts out Devils hallelujah amen a church in the spirit so you see if the holy spirit is going to lead the church then it won't be According to some ritual of man it'll be by the Bible amen and you see the church today needs a baptism let me just tell you evening light Tabernacle needs to get in the spirit amen you know we don't need just to polish it up no we got a nice building we got nice pews we got carpet on the floor we have a beautiful place we have a wonderful campus amen but what we we don't have any needs like that what we need is another B baptism of the spirit amen we need to get in the spirit men and women get in the spirit of God know their calling know their place now you know this is as I said this is why we needed a prophet and not a theologian that's why today we need Spirit field and spirit led men and women you see brother Bram had some very strong things say about it he said you hunt forart and see it isn't always the intellectuals that are demon-possessed think about that and he said worldly wisdom is against Christ always and he made it clear Jesus didn't tell us to go build seminaries he never did it but having Bible schools he said preach the word preach the gospel and he said these signs shall follow them that believe in other words he said go demonstrate the power of God to All Nations amen this is why the message cannot be passed on intellectually this is why preachers must be anointed by the Holy Ghost this is why the book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people people who can who can have a prophetic in sight who can do like John get in the spirit and it will require an ability to hear from God if any have an ear well check you have two of them so that ain't what he's talking about he said if anybody's got the ability here tell me how that ability comes it comes by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost gives you an ear listen it even gives you a mind because unless you're born again you cannot understand the Kingdom of Heaven that's right you cannot understand the Holy Ghost so again it gives you a mind an understanding it's an understanding the world can't give that's right you see it it doesn't come intellectually but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear so he says how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to he and know and I thought you know as I comp thought about how this message came listen folks it began with the supernatural it came with an angel stepping out of Dimensions unseen and walking a light coming and and um and and an angel coming out of that light it didn't come in a seminary that's right it didn't come by even brother Bram going in there and going and studying he said now I tell you I want to figure this out and figure out and I'm going to have a message in the last days it didn't come that way it came from a supernatural encounter amen that's exactly the way you are as a Christian you cannot be a Christian without a supernatural encounter you can be a Christian by name but not by by deed by birth unless you have a supernatural encounter and this message started with the supernatural do you know it's going to end the same way come on church out into that room came a light out of that light stepped an angel am then when he gave his message he stepped back into the light and went out of the room it's going to happen the same way come on church amen the light will come I'm talking about the pillar of fire out of it will step theophanies come on Amen and they will be changed glorified those those that stepped out will be glorified even our theophany oh hallelujah it's going to step out of that light and when it does it'll come and Unite with us and we will step back in that light and off we'll go yeah no wonder we'll travel like a thought brother Bram said the same thing and and Christ revealed his own word he said missing people they have them every day and missing here missing there he said one day you're going to come up and Miss he said Mystic lights they are seeing Mystic lights here and there he said one day a Mystic light is going to come down and pick you up and take you off hallelujah what happened in the Days of Elijah a Mystic light came down and and a Char of fire steep come out out of that fire and here he stepped in it and he went up in the Whirlwind sir that's a Rapture then that's a Rapture now and it will not be happening by intellect it'll be happening by the supernatural somebody who got in the spirit oh brother if I'm ever in the spirit I want to be in the spirit on that day yes now but then we have the mysteries of the Seven Seals you said brother Tim what's so important about it well you you precious soul don't understand the word had been close to us it was laid under confusion of mans and ideas and this one has this idea listen if you tried to search out truth there's 40,000 of them I'm talking about Christian denominations for you to have to search out and sort out you couldn't do it in a lifetime God made it easy and simple for you amen you don't have to argue over well what school did you come from where where's your preacher from was he from this one or was he from that one where did he get his credential I like the has this credential I like it don't matter all of them are man-made God gave his credentials amen he Vindicated it with a pillar of fire he showed signs and wonders to show us this is my voice so it'll go out west he'll meet with seven angels guess what they didn't come from from a school they come from the Supernatural and they came like a speed of light he said into into this Dimension caught me up in it one place he said they throw a sword in my hand gave me a message send me back to the East and told me that the the the the the Seven Seals that that that day the Seven Seals would be revealed and he said I I went in that room and he said I I was going back my own old thoughts and I was relying I don't know anything better than to do I called this meeting I don't know what these seals are but here's something I studied out years ago and I came to these conclusions and I preached this and he said I was about to make a horrible mistake but about that time he came in the room I got in the spirit and when I got in the spirit he revealed to me I heard the voice of Thunder I heard the voice that had been silenced I heard the voice of God revealed to me the mystery and now we no longer look and see a symbol in the Bible we know who it is we know it was the Antichrist we know his advancement come on the book has been open why because somebody got in the spirit thank you Lord that's right Amen brother Bram would come to the fifth seal and he said them revelations in the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in the room oh my seven spirits of God from one Holy Spirit revealing seven manifestation bringing seven voices revealing giving seven interpretation to Seven Seals Hallelujah where did that come from how can we have confidence in it because God backed it up amen because God was his own interpreter because we heard from the spirit amen amen now speaking of that as we as we see and we know now we're no longer in the time of Silence the Silence has been broken the end time has been revealed it is all started in process we're no longer waiting for a prophet to come and tell us what it is he's come right but now are you in the spirit of it come on is it just a message and it didn't get you in the spirit or did a message get you in the spirit what is happening now look I'm just going to say as you notice my title put it up here for a moment you saw my title of getting in the spirit I'm speaking of mountain movers the mountain movers getting in the spirit why in the world would you combine these two thoughts together because you're going to have to be in the spirit to move a mountain that's right it's going to have to be God speaking through you because man's word cannot move a mountain only God can move a mountain right so after me deity move in the mountain you know good and well you can stand up there and hollered all day long all you want to and it ain't going to move but I tell you what if you'd ever get in the spirit once and the spirit speak through you come on you think that was brother Bram when he spoke squirrels into existence when he resurrected the little fish when he when he when he spoke to hady right children but when he spoke to tumor out of his wife when when he did that spoke to the storm do you think that was brother him no God said speak it it was somebody in tune with God it was somebody who could hear the voice of God you say brother Tim that was a prophet but you're a prophetical class of people you're a people who ought to be in tune with the voice of god let's just take it down to Moses for a moment Moses could not fulfill the prophecy written of him he could not feel fulfill the prophecy written of him even though it was in the word of God God said your people so Jour in a Strange Land for 400 years and after that with a mighty hand I'll bring them out the word had said now we have the prophecy but we need the spirit on the prophecy come on Amen we got the man but we need the spirit on the man the man with the prophecy without the spirit ain't going to do any good the prophecy without the spirit ain't going to come to life come on Amen so what does God do you know I mean Moses tried to move this mountain that's right he went out and killed an Egyptian I'll lead them out I'll show them how to do it kill your oppressors kill them this Egyptian that was that was Overlord and being being uh mean to to one of one of the Israelites and he killed him buried him I'll show you how to do it we'll move this mountain one by one start a rebellion here we'll rise up we'll we'll overthrow this Kingdom time to throw this out didn't work did it he ran off defeated but God you said in your word yeah I did but you didn't get in the spirit Moses you tried to do this in your own self you never met the pillar of fire Moses you are trying this you're trying to make prophecy come to pass you're trying to fulfill scripture without the power to do it right you got to get in the spirit Moses that's right well Moses gets out and he soaks for about 40 years out there and his brother bradam said it took 40 years to to get out of Moses all the stuff that's right that had been taught to him until he finally you know it was through it was over with and he's out on the backside the desert amen and here now the prophecy meets the prophet but this time with a pillar of fire now brother Brenham said killing an Egyptian one dead Egyptian he said that's about all that we have done with the gospel he said is killed one dead Egyptian maybe make a man live true to his wife you know maybe he quit stealing or doing something listen church I I I'm happy for every person that gets reformed makes better neighbors nicer people amen amen but but really that ain't what it's all about it's not about a Reformation it's a transformation it's where God comes down and eradicates sin from the life amen now Moses couldn't feel that fulfill that prophecy even though it was the word of God even though his mother others had told him he was sin of God you're a special child look you were saved as a as a kid that's a that's a lot of problems we we get baptized when we're young people and we're saved and we're going to heaven and you never met the pillar of fire well I've been baptized and I go to message church and I'm in no you're not you got the prophecy and maybe you're the predestined but the predestine and the prophecy has to come together in the pillar of fire you got to meet God Amen so you see Moses could not fulfill the prophecy written from him of him even though he tried even though it was the word even though he had others tell him you know listen you're the one you're predestinated what do we tell you over here you're predestinated you are called you are chosen you're elected you're going to be there but if you don't meet the pillar of fire you'll never be there and that's what's being left out that Encounter of getting in the spirit and we can tell you all day long you're called to be a part of the Bride that you're here to Tire down Satan's kingdom and it's true but you can't do it no more than Moses good amen you see the pillar of fire had what Moses lacked that's right he had the word without the spirit yeah well it's the word brother it's the word yes it's the word but if you don't have the spirit as brother bam said it's gasoline but it might as well be water cuz you don't have a spark so delivering the Israelites from Egypt bondage and taken in the promised land that was Moses Mountain that was huge mountain getting them people that had been rooted in there for 400 years can you how many how many have got Irish background let me see your hands Irish well real high as I can see oh yeah well I've got a good number all right so we have Irish background how long you've been here well at least maybe 1002 200 years let's go back to Ireland what I don't even know that place I don't even know I don't know it's it's I'm not in love with it valleys and it and it's whatever and you know I me go back to I'm not going there that was the Jews that were down in Egypt this is home you know just get us a better Pharaoh you know give get us a better president we can just stay here a little longer you know you know you know what leave here leave here and go to a Promised Land you see this was Moses Mountain first of all getting the people willing to go secondly getting them to believing they could amen and the only way that they could believe they could was when God showed signs and wonders and brought plagues on Satan's kingdom somebody don't close the book I'm preaching amen here it is that you see they were right there and the and the only thing that would do it to move this mountain Moses need to do one thing meet the Pillar of Fire and when he met the pillar of fire what he couldn't do with an army he did it with a stick you see it don't take a lot once that you get in the spirit because only by the spirit can you move this mountain you see when you get in the spirit and you step in the Holy Ghost and he shine his light upon the word then the impossible becomes little things that's right to get the bride in the Rapture that's our Mountain amen amen and to do it it's going to take getting in the spirit amen you already have the word you're already told you're called elected chosen predestinated placed somebody help me amen you already been all of that you know you you got a uh all of this but we got to get in the spirit you see and when you get in the spirit The Impossible becomes little see to get the bride in the Rapture it takes getting in the spirit now and of course you know things happen in our day to generate Faith stimulate faith that Gifts of healing that was added to the church and when and brother Bram said to that when but now when I'm gone healing isn't gone healing ought to be more than it was before we come that's what I want to say even to the message Community today friend when brother bradam left healing didn't leave amen no we had a gift to stimulate Faith but we have no excuse not to believe we we know the impossible possible has been done amen so healing ought to be more than before brother Bram came that's right and brother bradam said this remember this when I'm gone and if you'll check he's been gone nearly 60 years when I'm gone Jesus will still be here and when I'm not in your church Christ will be there just to name amen oh I wonder if some of those who are just depending on one day when brother Brandon comes back I wonder if they can get a hold of that would that when I'm gone Jesus will still be here there ought to be more healings after I leave than what it was before I come that ought to be our testimony today amen oh but you see the devil has sent down his troops in the latter days but you see the men ministers hadn't got the people in the spirit of the last days they hadn't got them into the spirit of the open book where that they realize then all the promises of God are true and real and for us that believe that's amen that's why I'm telling you we need to get in the spirit more than ever anointed you see in in every church service you know Paul said I'll sing in the spirit I I I I'll we I we got got to get in in the spirit of worship you know we had admonitions today by the by the worship leader there who was worshiping and trying to get you in the spirit amen you know brother Brandon put a warning out to those you know in the balcony and he said you in the balcony sell them will I see the Holy Ghost move there he said because because people will sit up there aloof he said if I were you I find another place well I tell you what if you're in the habit of sitting in the messine and not getting in the spirit I'm not talking about jumping up and shouting I'm talking about getting in the spirit and not get in the spirit I find me another place to sit i' get on the front row amen I'd get locked in I wouldn't miss nothing amen I want to be in the spirit that's what we come for get in the spirit [Applause] amen I I remember when the Revival hit Donnie Reagan's church back years ago um back in what was that the 80s now and the Revival hit and the young people were on fire for God they sat and filled up the front rows of the church you know why they wanted to be close to the anointing amen oh that there would be a people I'm not trying to get you to jam-pack the front I'm trying to say I want a people get in the spirit when we sing We Sing in the spirit we worship in the spirit we get out of the Dos we get out of the Flesh and we get in the [Music] [Applause] spirit Amen brother bradam told us he said music plays a big part of that and he tells of a prophet One Day by the name of elij they got all out of out of sorts because there was a man a king come up there wanting wanting a word from God wanting help from God and he had been a rebellious Pagan and he said you you're you're going to come now now now you're searching me out now you're coming to find out he's all sted up and they're needing a word from God and he said I tell you what if it wasn't for Jehoshaphat this righteous man I wouldn't even give you audience that's why but he's talking to the King right but he's giving him a a dress down he's all stirred up and angry about everything and they need a word from God and he said wasn't for Jehoshaphat I wouldn't give you an audience but nevertheless bring me a menstral if you get to sing in the old songs of Zion yes sir amen oh which by the way brother Brandon said one of them many one one of them in when telling the story and he told told it many times he said one of them was the there's going to be a meeting in the air well that was a Pentecostal contemporary song for that time it was a modern song for the time and he was singing it you know he said he got to singing one of them old songs you see because all our worship is old it came before the foundation of the world it's not a new fangled religion it's an old religion it come before the world began when job was there said where was you when the sons of God shoted for Joy amen when the morning Stars sang together I don't know I tell you what I'm right here in time right now as a Morning Star Shing while the sun is missing from the earth I'm beaking him back to the earth a light say he's coming the sun is rising amen Jesus is coming coming back and I am singing a worship sir amen you see brother Brandon said If Music brought the power of God down then it'll bring it down now but you know you're going to have to get out of that out of sorts thing amen brother Tim butt said I was going to have to preach something a little extra this morning because you'd be all out of sorts because Alabama beat LSU maybe that's your problem so I'm preaching a little extra I'm telling you get in the spirit not for LSU though amen I'm not on that team on I'm on Heaven's team amen I want to hear the angels sing I want oh Hallelujah you don't believe that can happen brother BR said I was in a meeting and he said while the altar call was going on I heard singing from another realm that was they were worshiping in heaven while we were worshiping here on the earth oh God that it would be an evening light Tabernacle that heaven would come down and voices from Heaven would be heard yes yes sir it's not impossible it just takes the right attitude the right atmosphere so he said I'll tell you what you do he said bring me a menstral and he got to sing and all these songs got caught up in the spirit and he said this is what to make a preacher preach said brother Tim I'd like to hear you preach good well this will make a preacher preach I'd really like to see you under anointing this will make a preacher get under the anointing when the anointed people get ready to hear the anointed word and the two come together the word to an anointed heart hallelujah amen and a message is preached and then worship takes place people go to praising God Amen yes Lord it's the truth God it's for me it's for my children it's for those that are fall it's for all of us and when we get in the spirit things happen then the preacher prophesies Spirit of Prophecy comes was a good prophecy dig this Valley full of ditches the more you dig the more you're going to get a water you're starving out there you cattle are dying the the deeper you dig the more water you're going to get go to digging amen and brother Brandon said if they got out there with the shovel and they hit a 10 pan 10 can he said they they just threw it out and kept on digging amen that's what you ought to do is dig down come on Church get in the spirit get rid of that old doldrum get out of that old old malice get that in be out get that jealousy out get all of that get it all gone get all that all that grumpiness out of you they ain't singing the songs I like or what get it all out get in the spirit and then go to digging ditches dig out dig out unbelief dig out [Applause] Darkness till the holy spirit moves in the waters of life flow down and your enemies will fall into that and drown dead but the people are in the Spar of the last day yeah there's hydrogen bombs or atomic bombs or whatever bombs they are I I I watched the documentary a minister sent me the other day on all the bombs in the world and how many times they can do it and don't think it won't happen heard the charismatics you know grabbed a hold of brother Brandon's visions and was saying you know now this could be the woman or maybe God will give us a reprieve maybe God well you know is it too late to repent and we'll repent and God will give us somebody else you know and and and won't happen maybe maybe let me tell you it's going to happen get ready to leave this world Amen you know the world is laughing and scoffing and making fun living like the devil every every day it's it's the spirit of the last days amen We As Americans we just elected as a new president we can just go to sleep a little longer we dodged a bullet did we nothing's going to happen after all we'll be the good old USA again we're going to make America great again you know you know prophecy has a very unique way of coming to pass we we already had a woman rise up we already saw her in purple we already saw her rise up of a vice president or president as brother bam said we also already saw another Catholic President we already seen we've already seen it running this country to the ground and shambles don't get your hopes up that in 4 years this man can turn things around I know people think it's the last Trump I don't where they're calling us but I'm not dancing their tune listen listen let let me tell you prophecy has a unique way of coming to pass it will come to pass and you will not even know it Eddie bisco's green shirt don't even know he has a green shirt told her to get rid of the green shirt you know don't pack that I don't want it throw it away and she repaired it and put in the in the in the in his luggage didn't know he was the man till he steps into the vision wasn't even then probably when he put it on he say hey I've got the green shirt no it would be pointed out to him here it is here it is now that Grizzly is going to be right we got the Caribou it'll be right there how's it going to be there I don't know I can see his far doesn't matter he's Jehova Gyra he can he can produce one right there amen and the next moment well my goodness it's somebody's milk cow you see has a lot to do it I mean the Forerunner we know was John the Baptist he was to come and trees would clap their hands and and and high places be made low and Low Places be made High you know rough places made made smooth and when he came and they were in the vision most of them never realized that's right never even knew who he was they didn't realize a vision was being fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy was being fulfilled in a wild man down there with a with a beard and and and an old old camel skin garment and and eaten honeycomb and honeycomb and and grasshoppers or locusts didn't know this man this simple man was the Fulfillment of it and it happened and the whole world the whole Jewish World missed it and he introduced the Messiah and the whole gener generation of Israelites crucified him that's right right yes and yet hundreds of prophecies were taken place while he hung on the cross and there they was spitting on the prophecy he was supposed to be virgin born and when he come a he's illegitimate his mother had an affair they covered it up anything good come out of Nazareth how could he be he can't be a Nazarene he's got to come out of Bethlehem every way they looked you know they he can't be the Messiah he doesn't measure up you know it it it ain't him it ain't it ain't him they were in denial amen well this couldn't be a woman I'm not saying the woman I'm not saying it was I'm just saying the damage may already be done that's right so what are you going to do and instead of relaxing becoming lukewarm I'm going to get in the spirit that's what I'm going to do what are you going to do brother Tim uhuh I ain't folding my hands up and saying ah I ain't nothing happening yet we can go back to sleep false alarm I am what I'm going to do is say I'm going to be anointed I am anointed for this power for this reason I have come I'm here in this generation am I'm going to get in the spirit so I can see things because when I get in the spirit then I can see he's present he's Among Us it's the son of man he's among the church ages he's still here he hadn't left us right you see to get the bride ready he'll take getting in the spirit it takes the word but it takes the spirit to bring the word Jesus knew them that of his disciples they had walked with him now for three and a half years of ministry and he knew they needed power for service this why he told him that now don't you go don't you go anywhere else you go to Jerusalem don't you go preach listen oh well we're going to go tell them you rose from the dead we saw you sin we we we we going we got a message no you can't preach you cannot preach oh but he's risen but you can't preach what we can't preach no not until you're endued with power from on high otherwise it's just going to be it's just going to be nonsense it's not going to have life in it it'll never produce anything but get there in the upper room until the spirit comes and when the spirit comes then you will really be Witnesses because you will be talking about my resurrection you'll be talking about your resurrection that you were dead and sins and trespasses but now you are alive many people are preaching about the resurrection but they never had a resurrection you see to be qualified as a witness you have to have an experience you can't be a witness using somebody else's testimony you had to experience that I was there well so and so told me so and so said you're not a witness that does not qualify as a witness when you when you are when you when you are a witness it happened to you you saw it you experienced it amen it was part of your life amen they had they had to to witness that not only he had he died and buried but that he had come again you see this qualification was to be the coming of the promised Holy Spirit to fill the church with unction and the word unction is anointing it's a power the Bible said and you shall receive power that word power comes from the Greek word where we get our word Dynamite it's an explosion when we step in the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it then the impossible becomes little things forms of godliness denying the power you go to church but never getting the spirit no power no spirit and God hates a powerless religion power is not emotion NE is neither is the Holy Ghost emotion but it comes with it it was not the emotion there other people ran people there on the day of Pentecost other people ran shouted but they were run running away strange things happening someone was running away to tell the priest tell this and tell that one they didn't have the experience but you see he could not send the church out till it first got in the spirit amen did tell you see you see brother bradam was was told by doctor one time uh and the doctor said hey these guys he said they're running to the altar he said you know what's the matter with them they're just worked up you worked them up brother Brandon you know they're act they're acting like that crying and running the altar it's just emotion brother Brandon said Doctor you ought to know enough it takes something to excite the nerves before that a person could be emotional it's something present and it's true that when the Holy Ghost come down it stirs the crowd to motion they're sitting there Anointed with the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit sweeps across them it stirs emotion it's got to amen when you realize when your eyes come open when you get in the spirit and you realize Jesus is coming by you're going to wave your palms come on now you're going to say hosana to the son of David if you don't the rocks will cry out amen cuz when the spirit of God is there there's liberty amen well brother Tim but that that's not the way it happens here because it's forms of godliness which denies the power there's no you know it's like drinking cocacola you let it sit out and lose all the Fizz I pour it down the sink that's right I don't want it if it don't have the zip amen I'm going to say the same thing I don't care what preaching I don't want it if it don't have the zip if the spirit ain't moving in it if it ain't quickening in the Heart come on I don't want it it's failed something another that was left over from some other time I don't need it I don't want it it ain't no good have all you want of it but what I want I want something with life with power in it you know if there's anything the devil would like to do he'd like to he would like to accompl is prevent the new birth if he can cram down the church spiritual birth control Theology and keep her from bringing forth live births he will do it if he can just keep the church from reproducing with live births there'll be no Sons and Daughters of God born and no one to operate in the realm of the Holy Ghost and no one to cast him out so he want have anything to fear and you know our prophet of God warned us over and again about stillborn babies he even brought it right down to birth pains when he was preaching there in his one of his Easter sermons one of the last sermons that God would impart to us in this age by the seventh angel and he would bring it out still born babies and he said if a baby is born and it doesn't have life if it doesn't Squall out and unknown tongues to itself or something he said it's it's born dead and he said this is what we have produced is a lot of still born babies we got to have life amen when you have people who are church members who still smoke do drugs alcohol fornicate adultery divorcing they come from a hen but not from the mate that's right hello the hen can set him brother bradam you used the illustration over and over my H can do a good job sitting on the eggs sitting on the egg she's trying she's trying but if she hadn't been with the mate none of them's going to hatch that's the same thing these Concepts friends were taught all the way through the message that's brother Bron talked about himself he said going out he said as a Rancher he said I learned you know hey a cat would be born and and yet he had to be marked we had to know who he was so what we would do is get a fire real hot stick a Brandon iron in it tie him down and stick a hot iron to him I've seen it done I've been a part of it even on our farm where we did things like that and you take it there and he said man he said that calf was Squall and yell and kick and you let him loose he'd jump up and raise his tail and race AC cross and had throw a big fit but he knew who he was from then on and he said that's the way it is with the church you get the Holy Ghost and you get branded by the Holy Ghost and sealed unto the day of redemption you'll cry and you'll scream and you'll yell and you'll jump and and you'll holler but you'll know who you are amen you'll know you don't belong to the devil anymore Hallelujah that you're a Son of God because you've been born of the spirit but that's the reason we've got so many cold formal churches today that don't even believe the sign shall follow them to believe because why they've never been with the mate oh yeah yeah oh yeah we're going to have a prayer line listen I I watched a prayer line here here here just I've got it I've got it watched a prayer line here the other day sometime ago was sent to me of a of a brother one of the principal leaders in this country so we're going to have have a prayer line now you know you know this is not the season for miracles and you know that was for another day whatever but we're going to have a prayer line you know because whatever and but we don't get the Holy Ghost today you know there Gentiles like they did in the book of Acts because you see with there in the upper room that was Jews and the Jews got the Holy Ghost and they spake with tongues and and they they uh had the moving of the spirit upon but with the Gentiles while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost came on them that believ so you know that's the way it is today we we just get it when we receive the word if you believe the message you got the Holy Ghost you see so you don't need that because that was for the Jews and we are Gentile why don't you read your Bible amen so they come down and they baptized them Peter and John did come on in the name of Jesus Christ after having believed on the Lord amen and what they said these have received the Holy Ghost just like we did at the beginning because we heard them speak in tongues and prophesy you know people don't even know their Bible anymore you see again because again you see this is what has caused so many stillborn babies you see a real birth is a meth this is another concept I'm I'm preaching you message Concepts over and over and over again that brother brandom emphasized you say he said he even in birth pains he said oh people give into my message just as he talked about stillborn baby my message you see a real message produces life but he said yeah people don't want to take it because of their style their pride I see it creeping to us Pentecostal people little pride we don't want to do it I don't want to get down to that alter and boohoo but let me tell you he said I birth is a mess I don't care where it's at if it's in a house of barn pink decorated hospital room a birth is a mess and a new birth is a mess and you can't come up starchy and say I've received Christ as my personal savior nonsense get down there at the altar and stay there till you're born again it's a mess and it but it brings life I don't care what scale or level I have to come to amen he goes on to say he said stay until you get in the spirit that's what's wrong with a lot of our prayers we're going through the motion but we never get in the spirit watch now he brings it around like this a chick in the shell it's there in the Shell he said you can't help it out this is what's happened that's what killed a lot of children in the message you believe the message you got the Holy Ghost but you know I I I still am living what just grow a little just grow a little you'll be all right you'll be all right you've got the Holy Ghost can you believe this can you believe this we went back to baptist Doctrine just believe God sent a prophet just say you believe the message you got it you got it you're all right say brother Tim you're unsettling me I hope I do I hope I root you up enough to get you down to a place where you get in the spirit you know Church you don't understand as I deal with Ministry and and have a mainstream minister to pull me aside and said listen I need you to talk in counsel with somebody in my church I said oh you need me I'm not here to Pastor I'm here to be an evangelist but if I can help some way you're asking me I'll help you what what is it well this man him and his wife's having real trouble they're about to have a divorce I said oh that's terrible I said what's going on well he committed adultery I said yeah that's awful that's something really hard to overcome it's a line you cross well you know uh he also has had other lust problems I said yeah what oh well he had some homosexual encounters too I said man he don't need me to talk to him he needs to get down the Altar and repent he needs the Holy Ghost I said I I'm through talking I ain't nothing that ain't no reason I can do that can help him man all the talking to that I give him and advice I give him ain't going to do a thing for him I can counsel with him and talk to him use psychology on him and give him behavioral lessons and say now you do this when this happen it ain't going to happen it ain't going to help I said he needs to be born again he needs the Holy Ghost he said oh no no brother Tim you don't understand he has the Holy Ghost he's been a member here for years and years and he has the Holy Ghost I said what he has the Holy Ghost yeah he believes the message I said what you believe he believes the message and he has the Holy Ghost and he's got sin in his life I said he don't have the Holy Ghost I said it's impossible you can't do that and have the spirit of God he's never been in the spirit well find out when I did find out who he was you know you go to preaching he would be one of the loudest amers in the church you know a lot of people think if I say Amen to the word brother that shows I've got the spirit that ain't the spirit that's acknowledging the word is true that's right that's just agreeing with it but if you really agree with it you'll live it come on Amen it's like I talked to a young man the other day and I met him out at at a place and and and and he got about 10 ft from me I was he had a dog that was in his arms and was barking and going on and was trying to nip me and I didn't want to get too close to him so kept my distance from him and he was talking to me and and and he said uh brother Tim he said I I love the Lord I said well I I'm sure glad he said yeah he said I I believe in him I said that's wonderful I can smell cigarettes on him that far away I knew as we talked he'd been the hardies and drinking and drugs but I love Jesus but but I I I believe in God I believe the Bible brother listen you don't believe until you're changed you're just saying you believe you're agreeing in the concepts but real belief comes when the Holy Ghost comes so you know again this man you know saying to me oh brother Tim but but I tell you what this man does have the Holy Ghost I said he can't have the Holy Ghost not didn't live like that he said well I said the Holy Ghost is an experience it changes your life he said well what about those who don't have the Holy Ghost and don't know it I said what we have the Holy Ghost today and don't know it the Bible said that that day you shall know that I'm the father and the father me and the and I am you right come on you will know it's it's an experience it happens to you I said sure I I would understand somebody said that you know they' been taught the tongues was the Holy Ghost and and speaking in tongues was the evidence and they had never never spoken tongues and they were confused on that point I could understand they could have the Holy Ghost and had and have it and had not spoken tongues because they was looking for that as an Evidence they thought that was it I don't have it cuz I didn't speak in tongues I said it was mistaught but sin listen church I've been around the block a long time how many ever heard of Ernie villain NOA oh yeah you did lots of hands went up God's called him home first time I met him I met him and some of his friends Arie marcion Ron nordone and I'd heard Arie marconia in a testimony meeting get up in Tu son and he say he was he was sharing about how he received the message I believe all the message he said I've got the Holy Ghost he said now I got a little habit of speak of smoking but you know I uh I've got the Holy Ghost I believe the message and I I thought well my how's this happen in these days so I got a chance I was in Ohio in a youth meeting I think this 1985 and I was preaching a youth meeting the morning and these brothers come to me and said brother Tim um why don't brother Ernie came said brother Tim what't you ride with us there's a man that we're witnessing to in town and you know he's um um owns a Greek restaurant and we want to go to and eat at his restaurant and witness to him and whatever we've been staying at his home and we're talking about the Lord his wife's a Believer and whatever and I said okay I'll go I said I don't have to preach this evening I get in the car with them and they go to tell them me their testimony and they just laughing and shouting and rejoicing yeah brother AR he said I I received the Holy Ghost you know I i' I've got it well I know he don't he said smoking well he you know but um you know I tell you I got I tell you I brother Ernie came in I I was at a business meeting and I went to breakfast and I heard him talking a little bit and I walked up to his table and said you sound like an eagle to me he said an eagle what are you talking about he said well um sound like an eagle sound like you're you you're you're an eagle you're you're a real eagle and he started talking to him about the message well brother Ernie was he was UPC preacher and he said I was trying to help him and I I I began to try to explain to him that what he believed wasn't true well he got all upset because I wasn't getting it he couldn't explain it right so he walked out and smoked to join the marijuana come back in anointed and man now his mouth is going like a motor and he's saying it all and he's giving it now he's telling him what happen because he's anointed so they're laughing and they're telling me all about it you know how how that yeah and then Ernie said yeah he come and brought me a bunch of books and said You know here you know or gave me a book and said read this so I read he said well this is the truth but what I'm seeing here ain't the truth so he said I he said this is the truth man he said got any more he said yeah so he comes and brings a whole box of books and he sit there all weekend and and he Embraces the message so I began to talk with them and I began to explain to him Ezekiel 36:26 I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new desire I'll give you I give you a new spirit the one you got will get along with the Holy Spirit I'll give you a new spirit so I you got a new desire and a new I want to do right and and and and a new intellect to think with but you don't have the Holy Ghost I said sir it's impossible for you to have the Holy Ghost and sin still being in your life I don't care how much you believe the message I don't care how much you believe God sent a prophet it's a lie you don't have the Holy Spirit of God and you need to rep H and get right with God and as I talk with them man there in a mansion of a home that I ain't never seen one like since that was sitting there with with beautiful Furniture everywhere thousands of dollars of worth of of coffee tables and them men fell down the anointing dropped and the spirit of God came down and that day Ernie villain a waa and also Arie M got the Holy Ghost God changed their life radically because finally even though they had the word now they got in the spirit amen without the spirit there was no power to live an overcoming life but with the Holy Ghost in your life you can live an overcoming life hallelujah oh it's time we as a church get in the spirit every one of us no matter who we are no matter how long we've been spirit filled John Spirit fill say I was in the spirit on the Lord day
