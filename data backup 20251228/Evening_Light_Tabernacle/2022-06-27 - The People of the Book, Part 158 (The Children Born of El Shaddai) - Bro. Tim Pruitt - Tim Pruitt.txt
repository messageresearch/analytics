here we are children of the king hey man i'm looking over men and women today that's got a passion in their life you know why because the holy ghost came in you and changed you and made a new creature out of you men and women with a drive with a desire amen with an unquenchable fire on the inside amen that we just keep throwing more of the wood of the word of god on amen with baptism after baptism of the holy ghost one day we're going to get the last baptism of it to be an outpouring from the holy ghost take it right into a rapture what an hour what a day what a promise that is amen amen good to see young people with a passion i showed the church um to one of karen's relatives during brother jerome's funeral he asked me when the first cousin said you know will you take me by the new church and show it to me so i took her and her daughter they looked around the sanctuary and pointed out the mezzanine and said i bet that's where all the young people get isn't it i said no our young people are right here on the front not because they're made but because they have a passion they have a passion they have a desire amen an unquenchable desire to serve god amen your tribute to the world and i want you to know we're grateful to god for the changes in your life amen amen let's just go to him in prayer right now and just commit the service amen lord we commit the service in your hands we are yours from the front to the back we're yours we have young people we mentioned on the front here with the passion we have other all the way back to the mezzanine and through it people with a passion i think of some of them the many years they have served you the fervency and the desire to please you we want to thank you lord we want to thank you for a church of believers that love you and are serving you with all of their hearts i pray lord that you'll bless us all in in a special way today god just pour out your anointing anoint the scripture lord anoint it to our hearts lord let your word just be formed within us let it be anointed word send out with power with demonstration because you are the same yesterday today and forever in every detail the same the same things you did 2 000 years ago you're here now in a bright body finishing the work for you said the words that i do shall you do also and greater and we are here doing the greater works in a multi-membered body we thank you for that thank you for every healing deliverance thank you for the miracle of salvation lord for the baptism of the holy ghost that empowers us as sons of god we are asking in jesus name amen amen amen thank you if you turn with me to genesis chapter 17 we'll read from verse 5 down to verse 7 then i want to pick up in verse 15. so right now we'll just look at genesis 17 5 and i've just got a couple more services on this and we'll move on but you know i a lot of times um teaching is establishing us in the in the present truth we use sunday morning for that a lot um because um you know wednesday night we usually have um one of our other brothers to minister and many times it's an evangelistic service so um but you know teaching grounds us in the word of god and so we want to be grounded in the scripture in the bible amen we in fact to the matter is we want our bible to be our absolute so that when we point to um any doctrine that we believe that we go back to the bible because that is our absolute genesis 17 verse 5 neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and verse 15 and god said unto abraham as far as sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarah sarai but sarah shall be her name shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nation and kings of people shall be of her amen god bless you can be seated today we're going to be speaking on the children born of el shaddai and um as we speak of these children we are speaking of a bride who is bringing forth christ here upon the earth and manifesting i himself in his power in his glory and producing offspring that is of his that is of his gene amen as we look right here we've got a written up when the bride will get back to being a word bride what's these things a word bright she will produce the very works that jesus produced so you see there is the whole goal is to be a word bride amen to and therefore in this bring forth a people from that who are the children of el shaddai the almighty god now as a bride coming approaches which that's where i believe that we're at we are in the bride coming of christ where that christ will manifest himself completely and fully in bright form and then the rapture will take place and revelation 10 7 tells us that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished in other words the whole counsel of god would be made known and the light would be shown on scripture from genesis to revelation man and that brings us back to the full word into manifestation with the fullness of the word then comes the fullness of the power so therefore you know we cannot expect to walk in for a word without without also anticipating and experiencing the full power of the word now here in genesis 17 we are actually seeing children in type born of el in shaddai words the almighty god was in tight giving birth to sons and this is shown as he names his children we didn't read it but he would also name isaac and uh and and but he would change the name of abram to abraham by putting a letter of his own name into there also he would do the same for sarah because he was showing in type i am coming down into you in type of the baptism of the holy ghost so that you will bring forth an offspring of the supernatural now so this is shown as he names his children and um and names the three of them as abraham sarah and isaac because all of god's children are named by him he has a right to name his own then god gives them their name this shows god as a father giving birth to sons or to children now of course when we're talking about sons we're talking about who we are in christ we are sons of god we are also the bride of christ it all depends on how we're referring to it but it's all the same sons of god amen include all the all men and women who are born of the spirit of god they are the sons of god the bride of christ includes all men and women that are part of that body they are the bride of christ now this is why god refers now to the children of denomination as names of blasphemy they have a name of their mother but not the name of a father if you'll turn with me to revelation 17 3 and he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman set up on a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy heaven has seven heads and ten horns now this is symbolic we know that so there are names of blasphemy that that she is full of she's sitting on a scarlet colored beast and it's a woman and verse 5 is said and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth now this mystery woman whose roots were in pagan babylonian religion is the catholic church and she went whoring and of course she produced offsprings and as she did she became the mother of harlots and these harlots are churches too and her daughters are the protestant denominations that came out of her so you see they're all guilty before god that's why god is calling a bride who will be a virgin to his word you see she claims to be the wife of almighty god but she has taken in the seeds of man through their through their dogmas and creeds and and seminary teachings and everything else mixing and hybridizing the word of god and they enter offspring are illegitimate so rather than god naming them he they take on the name of an an identification for of their rebellion they are actually identified with their rebellion against their mother her mother got so wicked they had to leave her and so instead of taking on the name of christ then you see they take on a name from their protest of their mother's wickedness and although they tried to reform their mother they too became a harlot like her by again when they come to marriage age they married a denomination instead and and their and their take on their own name of baptist and methodist and presbyterian episcopalian and nazarene or pentecostal and these are blasphemous names why are they blasphemous names because it is blasphemous for the bride the church of jesus christ the children of god to be called up by any other name than the name of jesus christ you see they must take on the name of their father and they're not they're taking on the name of their mother because she's a headless woman who rejects the word of god this is why we're baptized in the name of jesus christ is because that we are taking on the name of our savior we are walking out identified we have now been identified and named after him with our new life amen now when a child comes from forth from el shaddai when the word brings forth it you see it will bring forth the word in its fullness and will be called by his name now these are sons they are not grandsons you see brother branham got a statement that he garnered from david duplis who was also known named mr pentecost and and uh he he was a preacher back in the the 60s moved a lot of people into the ecumenical um circles he actually wound up uniting the gospel movement with the catholics and so on with the economical move but nevertheless you know he realized he realized himself as he spoke of it god has no grandchildren he realized the danger of people coming in the church and not getting an experience with god therefore becoming grandchildren and i wonder today if history is not repeating itself and see that we see uh that there's not and we see that there's again another new generation of grandchildren this is why we strive so hard to get you to have a real genuine holy ghost experience with god because you cannot just simply accept this message on the basis that's where your mom and dad took you to church and you were born on the pew you've got to have your own experience with god and become a child of god because god has no grandchildren now i'm going to read this excerpt from his article because brother branham was quoting from it and i i just want to share with you just a little bit from it where you can kind of see where he was coming from when he repeated and used brother uh duplicitous statement on god has no grandchildren you'll find this in a in a full gospel businessman's voice magazine but in his article he he said every gentile that came into the christian church did so by repentance or conversion or being born of the spirit everyone had a definite very definite encounter with the living christ the resurrected son of god this record in acts also shows that they received the holy spirit and of this paul was so sure that when he met the disciples at ephesus he asked him have you received the holy ghost since you believed this revival continued and the church grew and christianity swept the world of that time then some jew or some gentile begin to reason i was a jew or a gentile whichever the case and became a christian by repentance for sin and conversion from judaism or paganism again whatever the case was and so is my wife but this boy of mine he's never been a jew he's never been a pagan he didn't grow up in the temple he was born from christian parents in a christian home and was brought up in a christian church he is born a christian now this may be all true but he has never been born of the spirit and that child is not repented as a sinner because he has had a strict training as the son of christian parents he was taught to try and live like a christian for he is the son of god's children the nicest thing you could say about him is that being the son of two of god's children who became a son or daughter of god by regeneration he is now a grandson of god but there it is god has no grandsons so gradually the early church began to accept members into their churches their well-trained but unregenerated children until the pews were packed with members that had no encounter with christ as savior and much less a pentecostal experience they were not born of the spirit therefore it could not be filled with the spirit god said it's not by power nor by might nor by but by my spirit the spirit found no more blood cleansed hearts in the church to dwell in and the church cooled off spiritually until even in the pulpit stood unregenerated but well-trained preachers that spoke the letter but had not the spirit when emperor constantine caused his whole army to be baptized into the church the church was so already dead with a generation of unregenerated grandsons that these sinful soldiers fell right at home in the christian society spiritually the church was dead but god didn't leave it at that time and time again the holy spirit found a heart through which he could reach the ears of the people and such men were the exception and were looked upon as fanatics and usually they were persecuted or martyred and there came for instance martin luther and out of his ministry came to reformation and there seemed to come into and there seemed to come into life a new church with membership that had a fresh and very real encounter with christ and with the holy spirit but however it was not long before some of the lutheran parents begin to reason and say but our children have never been born roman catholics and they have never been born lutherans and right there was it began again grandsons forgot in the lutheran reformation churches then john wesley in england we had a wesley revival when he came and again men and women were challenged to seek god and be born in the spirit but after two or three generations some parents began to reason our children have never been anglicans or lutherans our roman catholics they're born wesleyans are methodists and soon grandsons filled the church and the revival is over so now you look at the condition of that church what do you have in that church you have sin of every kind things that are against the bible the word of god and then he said now at the very turn of this century came the pentecostal revival and all we're called to repentance and everyone that was born of the spirit was now encouraged to seek and receive the baptism in the spirit with the new testament evidence of speaking in tongues remember this is a pentecostal writing this with manifestations of the holy spirit such as prophecy and healing no matter how the older churches objected the revival spread it was the same in catholic countries as protestant countries and and in pagan lands and when people are born of the spirit they live and when such people are filled with the spirit they receive power to become witnesses but what is happening now we find that in the beginning this revival 50 years ago everyone was expected to be filled with the spirit with the confirmation of tongues before they could hold any office in a pentecostal church or a pentecostal assembly but today the sons and grandsons of pentecostal pioneers who are teaching in sunday school and holding all kinds of offices in the local church without ever having a real baptism of the spirit according to acts 2 and 4. these waves the waves of pentecost of power and revival are receding fast there is no there is a danger that in another generation we may be just a pentecostal movement without pentecost and that is without the experience but still holding to the letter the doctrine just like the other revival still emphasize some other some other truth but never experience it revivals crystallize into societies and and establish churches when grandsons take over but god has no grandsons now brother branham would quote him like this for example in the message why in hot springs in 63 as david duplessis once said god don't have no grandchildren that's right where our pentecostal brothers are becoming their children come into church and just say well we're pentecostal because papa was if papa was a pentecostal got the baptism of the holy ghost you'll have to get it the same way papa did he don't have grandchildren he just has sons and daughters not grandsons and granddaughters just sons and daughters is true so you've got to do the same thing they did on the day of pentecost you got to have the same experience you've got to have the same thing they had god don't never change his program he never changes his ways he just does the same thing all the time the way he lays down his program it must toe to that each time it's got to be the same thing and if you will do the same thing the same results will come amen so again in question answer 64 he has answers a question in his own church do your children have to have an experience with the holy ghost or to have the holy ghost or holy spirit if they see the end time message do they have the holy spirit now this is what is commonly thought today if they see the end time message they already got it and he he replies to this question everyone must have an experience your children cannot go in on no other way but the same way you do they've got to be born again there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of god they're all children they must have it you must have an experience with god to go in just the same as you so you know we we're living in a very hour of deception where that the devil is doing everything to destroy the children amen amen amen they've set it up in schools they've set it up in colleges to do the same thing they did in the days of moses to try to kill the children as soon as they're born they want to wipe god out of their lives out of their mind they want to reason it out and turn them into a bunch of of reprobates amen now you know you know the first seed was the early church that was a mature grain that could have been raptured but were sown as a seed for an end-time crop amen so that sea church went in the ground and it began to decay and and part of that decay was men not getting the same experience and this and having the same vision that the early fathers had and jude was warning before the age would even end you know let us earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now you know this this was even in that age he was seeing a cooling off because the church was decayed but i want you to know this church is not to go down in decay it is not being planted it is predestined for a rapture hallelujah so there's going to be a grain taken a rapture that has no decay in it [Applause] i'd like you to look at some of the problems in the early church acts chapter 15 and verse 1. and we're not going to read the whole chapter but you could and certain men which came down from judea taught the brethren except to be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved now i want you to notice this they were bringing the messages of the age past it would be like someone standing and saying well you know if you believe the message you got the holy ghost because why that was the message of the evangelicals or reformers just be baptized and believe on christ and you got it amen or it would be like someone come and say well you got to speak in tongues to get the holy ghost because what they are drawing from their past i'm glad i don't have a pass to draw from except what was in god's mind before the foundation of the world say brother tim you preached like you do because you were at pentecost i was born again in this message i've never preached anything but this message amen i've never been schooled in any of their teachings amen my schooling that i have received is from the message of the hour amen with this transforming power that's where i got the holy ghost amen in acts 15 and 5 but there rose up a certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and command them to keep the law of moses now this was a law men couldn't keep on their own this was circumstance circumcision that was to no avail because now it had been fulfilled by the circumcision of the heart you may circumcise the flesh all you want to in the foreskin of the flesh that don't save you don't leave the circumcision of the heart so a corner had been turned but i want you to know that there were certain other set of pharisees which believed now my question has always been why were there still pharisees within the church if they had got the new birth they would have no longer been a pharisee they would have no longer been trying to bring the message of an age past circumcision was all right up to the day jesus died so why were they still pharisees they had missed a new birth they had missed the holy ghost that's why they were still pharisees and this is why we're having problems today even in the around the ranks the message we still got people are a baptist or lutheran or whatever they'll say what came in and they try to hybridize the message with their past and you can't mix it that was good for that time but it's not good today amen look paul paul would say of himself he said look i was a pharisee listen philippians 3 and 5 i was circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrew it's touching the law of pharisee verse seven but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yea doubtless i counted all things as lo but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i've suffered the loss of all things and to count them as done that i might win christ you see this is a reflection of a new birth of a real baptism of the holy ghost that washes you from the sins of the of the wickedness of false doctrines of the past amen but you know there are still those who who are still evangelical in their beliefs they have an easy believism a easy believism mentality they've been brought over as an unconverted pharisee from baptist methodist presbyterian saying the baptism of the holy ghost is not an experience just accept the message and you got it this is why that he would say to that first age revelation two and four nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love now again you see it wasn't the children losing it it was the grandchildren the church he's talking to the church now in general has now lost that first passion that verse igniting of the spirit that real experience with god they've lost it see what the devil wants to do to us children take away that from us take that away remove it from us just have a bunch of grandkids in the church that are grandfathered into the church you know can do anything and live any kind of life listen the very name ephesus has a strange compound meaning it means aimed at and relaxed you see they aimed at the high calling because when they had high aspirations at the beginning of this age that it began with the fullness of the spirit and then in before it was the depth of god and i tell you that's what god left us with with a message come on church that was the depths of god amen and we began with full aspiration you know we're going to be everything that word said we could be but then while they begin to give way to a less watchful attitude a less ardent following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that the future ages in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of satan amen actually what i read to you about was the church that started on the day of pentecost that decayed into a catholic church come on amen they they they want to say we were the original they started out but then brought in grandchildren men without the same vision without the same passion without the same experience that brings that passion and they're lost because they had aimed at the high calling and relaxed brother we have aimed at a rapture we've aimed at the chains of the body we've aimed at the fullness of his power don't let go of it [Applause] you see it become relaxed and drifting it left his first love the tiny seed planted in the feast and age would one that grow into a spirit of era until all the foul birds are there i'm quoting from the church book you know who would roost in its branches so inoffensive to human reasoning would be that little plant would appear to that new eat the new church and again she would be deceived by satan and the fees and age had presented to her the opportunity for god's best and after for a while she prevailed and then she relaxed and in that unguarded moment satan planted the seed of complete ruination you know you say well brother tim how could the catholic church be be there in the book of acts i just read it to you from acts 15. that's right it was men that come in without getting that same experience and the first thing you know here it's it's like a vine you know the false vine twisting itself around the real plant now he would come down to say i have somewhat against you you left us first your first love he said now to realize this to understand this you must realize the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself and in the generations of israel we see the revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation's embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige water whatsoever of the original flame then god lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren he's still again quoting david duplicious saints salvation is not passed on by natural birth you start out with truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they are no longer just plain christians but they're taking on a denominational name and are now baptist methods and so forth this that is exactly what they are to they are not christian you have to be born of the of the will of god not the will of man to be saved but these folks are coming together not by the will of man and i don't say that some of them aren't right with god not to a minute do i say that but the original fire has died down they're not the same anymore and i i just want to say that there's still maybe good people out there in that we're not we're not castigating them or condemning them we're just saying that the original fire has gone down they lose their passion and that passion is one of the greatest evidences of a spirit-filled church i want that to sink amen they lose their passion and that passion is one of the greatest evidences of a spirit-filled church that fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit it all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire god it cools off and it's become a bit formal and that was what was happening back in ephesus they were getting a little bit farmer formal the abandonment to god was dying now people weren't too careful about what god taught them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them that second generation coming on was just like israel they demanded the king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected god but they did it anyway that's the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing things that used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially and and they changed their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lacks that's what ephesus means relaxed and drifting so the cycle of revival and death has never failed but i'm telling you today that there are going to be a people could i say unto you there is a people that is going to break that cycle where the rest of them had revival and death there is a people leaving out of here within revival still have a passion they'll still have a drive within them they still have an ambition to see the word reign and preeminence all you have to do is recall this last move of god and he's referring back now to the pentecostals the last move of god in the spirit when men and women dress like christians that went to church prayed all night took to the street corners wasn't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough enough money to build find new churches and they put in a choir instead of singing them to god from zeal now brother branham built his own self a new church he also had choirs that's not what he's talking about he's talking about how what they did as they began to move out because in indebting the church it made them to have to compromise for membership i dare not preach on this i lose that one and we got this note to pay and you know i don't want to offend so-and-so that's why this church has always been debt-free because i will not be enslaved to anyone amen that's why we paid cash for every building because we won't be obligated to nobody nobody will pull the strings of this ministry we'll preach what god put on our heart we'll proclaim the word of god we will do it without fear or favor but he said you know they organized the movement and ran it by man and soon to begin to read books that weren't fit to read they left down the bars and goats came in and took over and the cry of joy was gone and the freedom of the spirit was gone am i talking to some of these message churches today i think i am amen oh they kept on with the thorn but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes is all about that is left but you see this is a word born bride she's not a harlot she's a virgin to the word and she has precious virtues and that virtue is to reproduce christ to bring forth sons and daughters of god word sons who the signs follow word sons that are endowed with gifts word sons that have his power they look like him they talk like him they believe like him they cast out devils like him they feel like him they are in his image and in his likeness and the church has been entrusted to bring forth his children remember brother madam tells us this an invisible union is a sermon that he would have preached in his own church but he didn't have time he was running out of time and he said i've got to preach this important message here at life tabernacle i have to be present in that service when many people walked out because of what he was preaching what of sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman as a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has the same sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to christ and christ is the anointing just the same as a woman has responsibilities the church has sacred responsibilities she is a type she has the same precious virtues by spirit given to her to preserve the spirit and the word notice what not just preserve the word and the doctrine but preserve the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything in the world stay virgin to the word as a woman is to say virtuster husband it's a sacred trust to honor her lord's word above every man-made creed wisdom denomination there is the church is given that trust now i want you to watch what the trust is if they say well my church he said i don't care what your church believes it is contrary to the word stay away from it then he explains and emphasizes what he means the bible said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever mark 16 said these signs shall follow them that believe if a church preaches different from that don't you you die to that thing be born again into the word of god go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature that's how far it was to go these signs shall follow them that believe in all the world and every creature that will believe see how we've got away from it but she's responsible for it think about it we and even like tabernacle are to be a chaste virgin to god and preserve the word and the spirit amen and the church is responsible to motherhood to bring forth offspring of el salvador amen not offspring of the church because that's grandchildren offspring of el shaddai the almighty you see that the church is bringing forth children but what kind of children you see brother branham said she's impregnated with something and it's cause she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want any of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it was certainly her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belongs to here they would throw her out at the next council that she can't have it so she don't want to be impregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joined creed going bob hair painted faith there's no such a thing as that at all you don't find that in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god [Applause] hallelujah amen and another thing notice what kind of children should bear that tells what their papa is whether it's the first adam or the second adam if the church brings forth the child of the second item he acts the second adam's way of acting like they did on the day of pentecost that is a really true second adam's children amen look at the trouble we're having in our land look at the supreme court of our land has had to have to have has actually had to tell women that not to kill their babies can you imagine the insanity can you imagine they have cast down roe versus wade and and women are now rioting in the street screaming demanding the right to kill their children and their pennywise men are right behind them screaming and they're all saying it's my body it's the woman's rights and preachers are in the pulpit screaming we don't want live-borne children kill them in the womb let them be still born instead of acts 238 saudi blabbering screaming tongue talking children we don't want no such thing we don't want live children we want a dead dead dead dead amen listen we all believe the word you know we wanna and if we believe all the word we want all the spirit hallelujah now there is a true church that will bring forth children that will nurse oh now shed eye on almighty god as brother joe pointed out there's 8 810 promises lay in there for you there's enough vitamins for healing not vitamins to destroy every spirit of the enemy enough antibiotics in it to deal with pornography and sin and sex sin and habits of the word come on there's enough power in it to energize a person to give them power over sin and gladness so there has to be a true church that will nurse from el salvador and the nurse from both sides loved that song they sang just a minute ago amen you see they nurse from both sides from because the god of the old is the god of the new come on somebody help me preach amen the jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new so they mercy from both sides they are balanced both word and spirit drink it from both sides word and spirit they're not deniers of the word and they're not deniers of the spirit all the word yes we believe in this all the word all the word when we get back to being a word bride all the word you see so we believe in his personal presence we believe in the seven thunders and the revelation that was given we believe that not some of the book is open we believe every promise of god is open to us that all the book is open we believe in the mystery truths but we believe in healing and we believe in miracles we believe in holiness and we believe in gifts of the spirit we believe it all and that's the bride a people who believes it all [Applause] brother branham would say there's only one evidence of the spirit i know of and that's a genuine faith in the promised word of god and he promises it all everything from our healing to our salvation and there and there is altar calls amen come on and there's prayer lines i don't see no prayer line in the bible well what do you think they did one come up for prayer for jesus for jesus to pray for him another got behind him for his turn next one got behind that one we still believe in prayer lines because we believe in casting out devils and notice here the promised word of malachi 4 turns our heart back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers because brother branham would see her by vision and he would see her coming out that virtuous woman and step with the word then he would see her degenerate into uh awful women all the way down into miss america and then if i finally see that same bride come back again and he said what is it she should be the same bride the same kind built under the same kind of material that she was in the first place he said now read malachi 4 and see if we're not to have a message in the last day that had turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original pentecostal message word by word and he says brothers we are here and i want to say we're here we have been turned back listen the spirit of god will make you believe the message but everything that professes to believe doesn't have the spirit the same is true the the spirit of god will cause you to shout or speak with tongues or dance in the spirit but everything that speaks in tongues or dances and shouts isn't the holy ghost and brother branham would deal with this when he's dealing with the passion notice he would tell about uh in ezekiel how that ezekiel would see the holy spirit going forth with a um with a with uh an ink horn and marking those who sighed and cried for the abominations that were done in the city and let me just say before we go on we we can talk about sin you know it's abomination we should be crying about all these children being aborted and we should cry about our laws you know being being abused and stealing and robbing and and raping and everything and we should cry but i tell you we all also be crying because the word of god is not being given preeminence because faith isn't in the church to heal the sick and there ain't enough there isn't enough of the atmosphere of the holy ghost to birth the sun them are abominations listen jesus has nothing but sheep i'm quoting from brother branham in question answer 54 10 years later he picks up this same thing he never changes in this he says the shepherd knows his sheep anyone here anybody in here ever hear a goat cry brother you better be a shepherd if you want to know the difference a goat will cry just exactly like a sheep on huh let an old billy go get hung up out there and little sheep going on one side going bye bye they sound the same he said i've heard them down the altar just to crying and crying oh god sobbing away like that oh god and a goat all the time that's right shouting i've seen them shout just as uh until they've run across the floor and jump up and down the shout now you say brother branham you don't believe in crying don't take me wrong sure i believe in crying but that's no evidence because both cry i've seen them shout just as hard as they could shout and just carry on like that that's a long way from you you know what i'm talking about i've heard them speak with tongues and go out and live any kind of life just do anything there was no sign you've heard me tell you've heard me tell of a woman who had was demon possessed because of that by the grace of god that we cast out but she was she was there a pentecostal girl that chased men and lived you know one i think she had four husbands and living with a fifth one and when i came to when i came to know her and she she was about to run out and marry that one and got convicted come back brother said brother tim i got to have some help i got a devil and i went to praying for her and she began to speak in other tongues i stood and watched that for a minute i just a young preacher myself still probably in my 20s and i said satan you've hid behind tongues all these times you you you brought this girl you get one man and and and then leave him and then get her another and then go back and speak in tongues and you is all right i've seen you before now you're exposed come out of her in the name of jesus christ she bowed to me about seven times to the name of jesus christ and claps on the floor never to live that kind of life again delivered that's the power of the gospel but satan will try to hide but behind what seemingly is manifestations of the spirit oh yeah i'd seen them in my time where boys would come to the altar and and i saw them as a at least heard my parents talk about them when they were young pentecostal boy the girl wouldn't marry him because he had never got the holy ghost see comes up and speaks in tongues and and gets the holy ghost and goes out and lives a drunken life gets what he wants you see again that was no sign and brother brandon said well then you say you're against it no i'm not i believe in speaking in tongues it's god's gift in the church if i took it out i'd take part of blood out if i had if i take my tongue out of my body here i wouldn't have a complete body the body of jesus christ has tongues in it the body of jesus christ here has tongues and and you take it out you take part of christ out and you still can't say that that's the body tongues is not the body but it's part of it but he said it's accepting the person christ jesus and then all these other things will come right with it and fit together now you see let let every member in this body this morning let this little group of people if we could pull the curtains down along on each side and every person in here receive a person the person of christ jesus there'd never be a flesh it wouldn't be an argument there'd be perfect love you'd still believe this or that and believe that but it'd be full of love see jesus said by your fruit you will know them and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness now he said i'm going to give you my estimation of what i think the closest thing to an evidence that a man that is a christian that anything i know of you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungering and thirsting for god they just simply day and night they can't stand it they just got to do something for god they're full of love they just told travail travailing all the time the bible said he that goes forth sowing in tears well doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sheeps is that right now he said if i said this morning of the to this little group of people he's talking to his church now look god would say look william branham i'm going to make you answer for that group of people what would you tell them now do you want them all to shout and he said sure i want them to shout now he's answering god god's asking the question do you want them to shout yes i want them to shout do you want them all to speak with tongues i want every one of them to paul said that too i wouldn't that you all spoke with tongues dude do you want them to all dance in the spirit i want all of them too all right well very good but what would you rather them do i'd rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer they stated this altar would be here day and night and everything in their house and was constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to god and making calls the hospital business sick and trying to get people to come to church and do right i'd rather have that than all of the other put together although the other is right it belongs in the church in other words he said i would rather see people with a passion for god than to speak in tongues prophesy dance in the spirit but to have that passion notice what he goes on to say and and then speaking of an evidence but if i had to have it i put that soul travail first because if you got that the other will take place if you got that if you just get so hungry for god shouting will take place if you get so hungry for god's speaking in tongues will take place if you get so hungry for god you know and just keep on hunger and keep yourself and you go to se but now remember if you see yourself getting indifferent then there's another spirit trying to work itself in there so you see this is what he didn't want to see and then different spirit well i don't care i hope we hurry through church today ah i'll take it or leave it read my bible praying it's an option when in souls uh i ain't telling nobody about this indifference indifference about holiness indifference about church attendance are you with me amen if you that's another spirit trying to work in he said i can prove by the bible that the first time the angels of of god went over the land to seal the with the holy ghost he see only seal those who sighed and cried for the abominations done in the city ezekiel 9th chapter is that right set a seal on the forehead of those who sighed and cried for the abominations i want to ask you a question what if would take place that the holy ghost went through jeffersonville new albany louisville to seal those this afternoon who would be at home now watch here's their zeal god send a revival here's the zeal here's the passage here's what they're praying about god send a revival what ought to be the passion of holy ghost filled men and women god we gotta have that revival all revival's over that's for the world but you can have your own revival hallelujah amen you can have that stir within you oh god look at the sins of the city isn't it terrible oh god oh won't you send some revival i'm so hungry for a meeting send some good preacher send someone oh lord let that the holy ghost now where would he seal think of it now this is the same evidence that he points to in 1964 after the seals so it didn't change and he said just let me give you a twister who has the holy ghost raise your hand said all right i'll see if you have it the bible said they had the holy ghost sighed and cried day and night for the abomination done in this city how how many hands would go up how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy and power of god and so sad for the people that's lost that day and night you weep and cry for the abominations what about your own self and your own experience i'm not trying to condemn you i'm trying to point out something that our passion must continue you know how long has it been since you yourself drank from el shaddai and received that energizing force coming down to your mortal body quickening can't rest day and night so full of joy and the power of god i know a lot of people you know that are that are missing that so sad for the people that's lost day and night you cry for abominations amen who would that be in the city amen how many of that's in the church that's what the bible said holy spirit of evidence was amen in other words people longing for god send a revival anoint the preacher anoint me in service anoint me in my home fill me again lord i gotta have you i need you today yesterday was good i want another outpouring give me another drink i'm a fretting child [Applause] don't think for a moment that it ain't that way in your life because why you hate sin you don't want to be that way you want to be cleansed purged a real son of god not even an evil thought or anything anything will so wound you why the holy spirit is there saying that sin that's wrong and the devil's trying to come along and say but that's you that's you it's not me amen i'm dead to that i'm no more that this is not me i'm a son of god i've been birthed by the spirit i'm not in the world i belong to christ that's those he marks when joshua entered the land of canaan he said don't let one of them live there's a cute little baby i'm still quoting from brother branham reading from him a malachite or amorite kill it remember he'll grow up to be an adult amalekite he'll pollute the camp and will when little things come in like that disagreeing with the word get rid of the things notice that you see if the ceiling angel now i'm gonna i'm gonna get a little tough here you might think this is a little stern but the sealant angel the holy ghost if it can't put his seal of approval on your movie kill it if you can't put his seal of approval on your video game kill it if he can't put his seal of approval listen he's marking those come on and if you can't put seal of approval on your dress kill it [Applause] on your hair boy or girl kill it friendship with certain people kill that friendship come on now if you love the world or the things the world the love of god isn't in you and so you see the passion is the drive is is drive out ever inhabited of the land that would hold me back from my promise so i'm going to be as holy as god is holy righteous as he is righteous spirit-filled as he is spirit-filled have the faith of god in my heart come on somebody help me preach he said well they're good people i don't care how good they are if they contrary that word get it out of you it's growing a little a malachi well i'll tell you what this denominational person either good he's going to go to heaven well maybe he will but are you counting yourself just going to heaven are you going to be part of the bride in the new jerusalem don't let anything of the world influence you friends school teaching whatever else let only the word of god have preeminence in your life amen remember anything that denies the word stay away from it have nothing to do with it at all oh yeah so he said he spoke about signing crying for the abominations he said i'd i'd show you ten thousand speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin that can't pray an hour but did you know the bible said to mark only those who sighed and cried for the abominations done the city that was the holy spirit coming to mark the people said to destroy an angel go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have a mark upon it and the mark of god is the holy ghost is the seal of god where are them people that's interested i can show you people that jump up and down crying church i can show you people shout and run over the building i can show you people that are prophesying they come to pass i can show you those that speak in tongues and run up and down the building and say things that actually interpret and come to pass but where is that person that sides in christ where are the people that the word has preeminence that believes the full word where is that burdened soul now and i didn't want to say what brother branham was describing used to be the case people did jump and shout and run all over the building prophesied yet didn't live it at home or work it was so superficial that religion didn't go home with him it stayed in the church it wouldn't live through the week but i'd like to say in 2022 not so anymore oh that might be so in a few charismatic or pentecostal churches but we have so advanced in laodicean darkness until churches are now so cold their spiritual thermometer is 50 below zero and there hadn't been a shout or speaking in tongues nor a true interpretation in so long the new generation has never seen it much less experienced it don't hang up on me where are those signs crying god send a revival i'm so hungry for a meeting god look at the sins of the city terrible god won't you please send a revival god sent some good preachers you know did you notice he it wasn't why sign and cry kill them all god wipe all them hypocrites off kill all them sodomites burn them all with fire take me into heaven that's not what he said you're signing and crying send them a revival turn their hearts deal with their soul change their attitudes quicken that seed if there's a seed in them quaking them amen a burden for those that are lost not smug and it's us foreign no more amen got me and my little family saved and that's all i care about you see if you got that passion you get so hungry for god shouting will take place i've never shouted brother you've never been hungry enough you get an appetite for well you say how did how how in the world but tim i ain't been hungry enough well i'll tell you why because you'll you're satisfied on things of this world but when you start having a passion for god and a hunger within your soul there will be a deep calling unto the deep amen and your religion will go to work with you hello amen it'll go to school with you it'll live at home the children will see it it'll check you up out of your lazy chair on wednesday night and bring you to church you can't get enough of it you just don't feel up on sunday and you can miss the next three hello somebody you're gonna hung up on me you see brother madam even gave us an example of living and he said he told him hunting squirrels the limit was six one of the brothers killed nine and he asked where is the holy ghost conviction that would tell them they were doing wrong in other words you're to live a model christian no wonder our kids don't want what we got your attitude toward christ has a great impact on them hello you know i i i i realize we got people with passion and we got people with drive i can look at them all over this building but i'm telling you laodicea is creeping up on us until the passion isn't there even the way it used to be as we see the delay that is coming that is here where men are saying the lord is delayed is coming and therefore we begin lights in our in our in our attitude we get an attitude well you know i've worked so hard i don't feel like going to church let's go camping you know it's and so this sunday is camping and next sunday it's fishing and the next sunday it's turkey hunting and the next sunday it's deer sorry you didn't bring no eggs today maybe you're sorry even some of our retired folks are semi-retired you watch them they're home all week sunday rolls around and they're gone no respect to the house of god no respect to honor and the resurrection no travail of soul to come praying expecting believing for miracles of healing for the sick or for the law no no coming together to help bring an atmosphere you see christian isn't what you say it's what you live and what you do is an example you see and look look let me just go over this again this is the evidence that brother branham said that we should be have first off is a passion a passion to drive for christ for his word to give it all preeminence now the evangelicals took for their evidence of confession jesus christ the son of god listen i sat with a baptist man he was a good old boy he was now you know getting ready to marry for his 34th time and she was a girl that had been married before and all of this is against the scripture even against his baptist teaching and so on like that but you know he was talking to me about it and and he he's puffing on one cigarette lights the other and does that three weeks before he's been arrested for drunk driving that's been a few days in the slammer and he sits there and he looks at me sincerely brother tim i am not here to talk about my salvation i am secure in christ i have believed on him he is my lord and savior and i am ready to go to heaven this minute if the rapture can take would take place i am ready to go you know why because he had believed a lie that just saying jesus is my savior was always needed and there was no change i wonder how many are believing that lie around the message we say brandon branham and we're saved the devil's confessed jesus too they acknowledged him as son of god what have we got to do with thee thou son of god they recognize him as son of god they believe god is one and tremble amen pentecostals full gospel rely on i spoke in tongues so that's how they know they're a child of god yet you can speak with tongues of men and angels and like charity the love of god which is is his basic nature people in the message community let's deal with us for a minute you know trouble ain't out there anymore it's right here take the thought as proof of their sonship we know all the mysteries my god i've got a revelation i i understand we understand all the mysteries and yet many of them lack that elementary basic nature of god and they still have the love of the world and the things of the world all the while claiming to be so grown up and mature sons that they don't even know how to pray the prayer of faith anymore you see brother branham couldn't be against shouting and dancing in the spirit without being against the bible he couldn't be against speaking in tongues and signs and wonders without going against the great commission the great commission says that you know i go into all the world preach the gospel in my name you will cast out devils that's healed the sick amen in my name you will cast out devils in my name you will speak with newton he couldn't be against that without being against the great commission you see they misunderstood him when he preached because satan was there to twist his words and their ears and distort his truth after preaching for future home i'll give you an example people are so carnal in fact just go to the seals and when he mentions 500 or 700 instead of 7 000 everybody made something spiritual that did he got so many questions is it going to really just be 700 in the rapture and brother brown said no i made a misstatement the bible says seven thousand well i still believe it and after preaching future home people would actually be so carnal that they would have to ask brother branham a question brother branham because he uses the illustration you know he said that the the new jerusalem is like gonna be 1500 miles that'd be like from here to florida and over here there and up to maine and and now and and what did they do they turned around and asked brother branham do we all have to live within that 1500 miles make the rapture they misunderstood when he pointed out the impersonation of the holy ghost by depending on speaking in tongues instead of a changed life until they totally done away with speaking in tongues the question answered brother branham explains all that yeah and just what i just was telling you i i got that from this from what he had said he said now then if people say well then brother branham you don't believe we ought to speak with tongues he said then you get it exactly backwards from what i just said i believe you should speak with tongues and some of your people and you get these i get these like back here 1500 miles you see being at the tabernacle you see all that satan was there to twist those words and when he explained his position on tongues it's not the evidence of the holy ghost and that you could speak with tongues without having the indwelling spirit and all of this is true the same as you can shout it's not and not have it then people dismiss shouting speaking in tongues saying brother branham didn't believe in the gifts and we're beyond that and if you decide to have what the bible declares is our inheritance you're just a baby you're immature and saved because when we are mature we put away childish things like that of prophecy and tongues and gifts of the spirit i like to deal with that for a moment we're still teaching and it ain't two o'clock yet amen first corinthians 13 8 charity never faileth now let's talk about charity this is love divine love which brother branham said is the holy ghost when he went beyond the curtain of time he said this is the holy ghost that is god is love when you receive the love of god it gives you a love for truth so you won't get a strong delusion then because you got a love for truth amen when you get the holy ghost on the inside of you you've got a love for the things of god you've got a hatred for the things of the world come on amen it's the basic nature of god jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commandments so charity that love the holy ghost will never fail but whether they're prophecies they shall fail whether to be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away and when i thought as a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish thing and that's what they say oh but we've become men you see brother tim you're using the whole wrong type of using drinking from el shaddai and we're babies oh no i'm not that's a different type because we will nurse on el shaddai until our bodies are changed and until we are transformed in a moment twinkling of an eye we're going to be nursing from the holy ghost daily hour by hour are you with me now let me just read it again a little plainer translation and first corinthians 13 8 charity never faileth but whether it be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall cease whether it be knowledge itself vanish away so here we come right here just a moment even knowledge will vanish away when that which is perfect has come and then he sums it all up in verse 1 of which is the next continue the same thought follow after charity seek love and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so after he said all that he said about love he comes and says but follow after love but desire spiritual gifts and but rather that you may prophesy oh we don't read that one we ex that one out so let's just go back and i'm gonna start at verse eight and let's try this and this is another translation but i think it's helpful love will never become obsolete you see in heaven god will still be there now as far as the prophetic gifts they will not last unknown languages will become silent and the gift of knowledge will no longer be needed gifts of knowledge and prophecy are partial at best at least for now think about the prophecy think about the prophecies of brother branham when when he spoke of of um let's just say the driverless car and this is a prophecy of it think about how incomplete that is did he tell you what year come on somebody it didn't tell you all the details it told you it would come didn't say when didn't say who would be the president you see prophecy it was in part it didn't give all the information now watch love will never give some knowledge verse 9 gives a knowledge prophecy are partial at best at least for now but when the perfection and fullness of god's kingdom arrives all parts will end when i was a child i spoke or thought and reasoned and childlike way as we all do but when i became a man i left my childish ways behind for now right now we can only see a dim and blurry pictures of things as when we stare into a polished metal because that's what they had for a mirror polished a piece of metal till they had a reflection but it was dim and it was blurry and he says i realize that everything i know is only part of the big picture but one day when jesus arrives we will clearly see clearly face to face in that day i will know just as i've been holy known by god but now faith hopes and love remain and these three virtues must characterize our lives and the greatest of these is love so when everything verse 1 try to strive to love passionately seek the gifts of the spirit especially the gift of prophecy what so why wouldn't we follow after love as paul admonishes to and desire spiritual gifts but rather to prophesy for telling and speaking as the voice of god somebody has to be doing what the bible said he said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh my sons and daughters shall prophesy the old will drink dreams the young will see vision and this spirit will be upon men and women among all the church amen so you see this whole deal of when we are perfect is not now right now we need prophecy we need the voice of god to speak out right now we need the workings of the holy spirit but when we are transformed and they're on the other side then we won't need that anymore because we will know fully as we are known don't get it out of picture paul was talking about the future when we are changed that's when that which is perfect will come oh you said well brother tim but brother branham said now we have the perfect interpretation of of the word of god by divine inspiration or vindication and so therefore jumping up and down and trying to speak with tongues like kids has done away with and it is we have the perfect word given to us by divine vindication and trying to speak with tongues is over with jumping up and down like a kid and trying to speak in tongues is finished with that's babylonian that's confusion are you with me so why wouldn't shouldn't we follow absolute love as paul had monisters to and desire spiritual gifts but rather that we were prophesying because it said somebody's got to finish the work and it takes more than the promise the word is the promise but there has to be a faith to anoint that promise so we can give voice to it while we're beyond the gifts of spirit you know when the gifts of spirit is faith do you know when the gifts of spirit is healing guess what the resurrection is going to be a healing guess what the body changes is going to be a massive total divine healing it is we're not going to be beyond that until we are in perfect bodies and then we will have perfect knowledge what did sharon rose tell brother branham things he didn't know we're not babies here it's like you preached it and he hadn't preached it yet this is heaven he went there as a mortal and as a mortal he didn't know all things and so he's visiting there as a mortal but sherrod rose knows a lot of things he don't know look at beyond the curtain of time do you eat here no we don't eat here well why didn't he know that he was immortal but they knew it one day jesus will come and you'll be judged by what you preached all of these things everything as he went there he he was getting knowledge you know as a mortal going there but when you step from mortal into immortality in theophany theophany is a word form and so therefore you will know all things amen now let me just tell you there has to be a faith to anoint the word we're not going to meet devils we are meeting devils and we are casting them out why because we are once fulfilling the great commission recently we had a prayer line here how many were healed in that prayer line raise your hand oh look at there we got hands lifted up here the people healed in that prayer line what was we doing casting out devils amen these demons are real they push our kids into porn to drinking to lying to cutting themselves and even suicide amen there's all kinds of demons there of all different kinds of feminine abusers of themselves mankind fornicators porn addicts drunkards all kinds and they have a right to stay as long as sins are unconfessed but when sins have been repented up the devil has no right to stay amen and you cannot find the cure until you find the cause and the cause is always on repentance the reason people don't get the baptism of the holy ghost it didn't fully repent that's always the cause you know desperate people are bringing their children all the way from across the seas because of situations in their lives and that's a different it's just like in the days of bible i brought your i brought my lunatic child to to your disciples they couldn't cure him and that's a condition of too many message churches today they cannot cure them so they try psychology instead try easy believism and they continue right on the sin they claim the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but that's not all of it but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did come on amen so just perform the works that jesus did he spoke in tongues he prophesied he cast out devils he healed the sick he worked miracles he opened the ears of the dead and the eyes of the blind just do what jesus did amen that's the baptism of the holy ghost the person of christ listen performing in you the works that he did are you still with me now these are worse than pentecostals they're weaker than baptists they're more faithless than a reprobate candlelight preacher who say the days of miracles are passed the same type that opposed brother branham and f.f bosworth and pointed their fingers in his face and god refused their picture to be taken instead vindicated a prophet so well today brother tim we got the interpretation of the divine word of god well okay when we need a devil cast out where is your perfect word now you claim to have well brother branham said that we have it with divine and divine vindication you claim to have perfect interpretation of word and words divine vindication you see we you see again divine vindication not sensation divine vindication not something you worked up divine vindication are you with me amen what what what you have is still a powerless religion whose only weapon is argument now so again first corinthians first corinthians says that which is important when that which is perfect has come that which is part shall be done away with so all these little things like jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect but now in the same sermon brother brandon says this now in the same sermon he says i would like i would that every member of my church spoke with tongues i would like for them to do that and i believe if you would ask god god will grant it to you so the same what the same sermon that he says jumping up and down like a kid trying to speak with tongues is over because now we have the perfect interpretation of the word in the same ceremony he turns around and says what did everybody here spoke in tongues hmm well brother tim here's the deal we would rather have perfect love than any divine gift well okay i'm having trouble finding perfect love or any get divine gift where's your display of divine love that makes a bull go lay down and harness back to their nest that makes demons fall at your feet we have perfect love and now all the gifts are on the shelf how many times the devil get to use that you know how the devil loves to twist the prophet's words that was never what the prophet said he never taught that that now tongues interpretation prophecy discerning the spirits working the miracles the gift of healing gift of wisdom word of knowledge faith and all of these are now laid on the shelf that's what's been taught around the world so here's what he said and then jesus came 1957 quote in his church jeffersonville and after this morning the holy spirit so beautifully came down and bathed in us in his great beauty i was just inspired to speak them words and say some glorious day that all the gifts that is in the church will just be set aside on the mantle as it was and the holy spirit himself will take the church in such control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk without hands being laid on them it will be one great big unity oh so when this great divine love comes and sweeps over the building blind eyes will come open death will hear lame will walk without even hands being laid on them now when in the world is it going to be that we get this great outpouring of divine love that puts gifts on the shelf whether when is that going to happen so it's already happened well it happened that ain't true when is this going to happen you see in the message before where that he's referring to he was speaking about and you can go listen to the sermon before this one that right now signs and wonders are done through laying on a hand because preaching because of preaching but one day when the when the day of preaching is over and the last one has come in and it's over then these wonderful gifts will be laid on the mantle and the love of god which is the holy ghost will come with a higher standard than all the gifts and love and will love will just settle over the people and in that great outpouring of in that great outpouring of love every sickness will flee every blind eye will be opened well this ain't happened yet but it's going to happen let me tell you here's what the prophet said about that great outpouring because divine love is the holy ghost do we agree with that the hour that we're living in oh god the world is falling apart they're hangs in the hangars bombs their hangs the things to do just exactly the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because christ's ministry is in the bride which is a supernatural body of his on the earth his spirit is living his life right out until him and the church become one in the wedding amen this great outpouring of love will do away from what listen on that day there will not be anybody waving a wand or a hand going out to the graveyard raising the dead there won't be a preacher laying hands on you and say gray hair come back the right color amen come on divine love the holy ghost will so come down in an outpouring that the dead in christ has been dead for 2 000 years will rise completely totally restored this is what he said the dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the holy ghost we have worked it in a small measure but when it comes in its fullness missing limbs will be restored amen your old eyeball you think i bought a pop out of your head and your new one will come in a god-given one false teeth will fall out and big great big new ones coming back in great hair will come back the right color amen your own artificial knee you won't need it anymore and you'll be dancing around in a new body hallelujah what will it be an outpouring of divine love the holy ghost and every gift will be laid on the mantle as it was [Applause] that's when every gift will be laid on the mantle you see that's the thing the devil tries to do to twist it he tries to make you make things that are for the future and try to make them now that's why the era demons worked in the early church saying the days that that the resurrection was already passed they were taking the words of paul that paul used and positionally said listen you're resurrected in christ you're raised from the dead and they took that and preached it and spiritualized it until nobody now believed in the resurrection they were preaching the physical resurrection was over these same demons say the millennium's already here the gifts are already on the mantle that's a devil and that perfect love the full power of the holy ghost comes on the church every sickness will go every missing limb restored and we now get ready for this this is going to be rough tighten up your belt seat belt repair pilot's coming on this is going to be rough what's out when that perfect love when when that perfect love the full power of the holy ghost comes upon the church every sickness will go every missing limb restored and we with one accord will all speak in tongues oh you didn't say that brother tim yes i did you don't know that you think you're going to be speaking english or french no rapture day we won't be talking an earthly language anymore we'll all be speaking a heavenly language hallelujah did you know brother branham said in the millennium ahead we would all speak in tongues of a heavenly language it won't be a flag of america over here and a flag of prince over there and a flag of this but there'll be one flag hallelujah that's the flag of the cross and there we will all speak not of babylonian language but we'll speak in a heavenly language [Applause] and i quote but there's one kingdom that we believe that's coming the lord jesus christ has set up a everlasting kingdom and all the nations of the world that say will live in that kingdom there be one flag one nation one people speaking one language and that's the heavenly language hallelujah when you talk about supernatural friends this church is a supernatural church amen brother branham even said now this is what he said and faith is our victory to his own church he says if you went to foreign country he said you wouldn't try to learn their slang he said you think you'd be trying to do is learn a few words of that language there maybe it's much to say how do you do probably for most of us is where can i eat but nevertheless he said you'd be trying to learn a few words of that language of that country and much to say how do you do and i think it would behoove christians today more today if they were trying to learn some heavenly language the praises of god that we're going to sing over there and enjoy and the people that does not believe in shouting what would you do when you get over there you would be out so out of place better get faith and overcome now for faith is the victory that overcomes and then he went on to explain how to learn that heavenly language you would do it by surrendering yourself so much to him yielding and submitting until it flows out of you until you're quickened oh that was before the seals brother tim okay easter seal 1965 and this and you're quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already what quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already notice the pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the holy spirit listen to me that penteco those pentecostal group up there on the day of pentecost receive their abstract deed from god sure it glorified their soul they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated on each other and it's so quick in their body listen quick in their body in a pre-rupture condition what's what he said till they couldn't speak in an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to heavenly language the place they are going to amen quickening powers shook their mortal bodies until their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it shall also quicken your mortal body we are quickened by the power of the living god tongues quicken to a heavenly new heavenly language to speak them a rapture enough raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived and also that new quickening life to them then it come to them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues oh yes now watch them it was designed to give them after this abstract design to give them every promise that was on the ground i say watchtopic tongues why don't we take everything pentecost wanted to stop at tongues and make a denomination but why don't we take everything come on every promise on the ground every promise on the grounds of god's word that was promised in the bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to therefore they laid hands on the sick they were healed they spoke in new tongues they'd done great signs and wonders because that was in god's promise and when jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to sons of god he demonstrated what god was how dare we to socialize that and put in an organization we have no right to it how dare we just say that's just for a zeus of pentecost it wasn't for them it's for us it's the holy spirit today honey in our honest hearts that believe that message everything in the bible that was promised is that believer and when you accept it in his fullness somebody with me when you accept it in his fullness and god knows that you do he gives you the abstract to that and then every promise that's made is in your possession and the holy spirit is there to quicken that to you what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see the great holy spirit here to do that power think of it though when the holy spirit its holy ghost itself is here to bear record of this hour jesus christ said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there the works that i do so you do also john 14 12. these signs have followed them that believe that is assurance and when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifest himself that is the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's property of god hallelujah amen you say well brother tim but that was to a full gospel businessman meeting he's talking to pentecostal uh so it was a pentecostal group and he was just kind of uh kissing up to them oh well let's tell you then what about the last easter message to his own church it is the rising of the sun notice at pentecost their bodies were quickened to a new life look at that little bunch of cowards oh but they had the mechanics but they were sitting back there saying oh i'm afraid of them i'm afraid to go out and make a claim because all of them are big bishops and things out there i'm i'm so afraid and priests and and the them preaching things i'm afraid to make that claim afraid to say i believed on him i can't do it but all of a sudden the dynamics come and what it do it not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were kicking there were no more cowards they went right out in the face of those people and said yes sir you man of judea you that dwell in jerusalem when before the dynamics came they were just mechanics you men see you men that dwell in jerusalem let's be known to you hearken to my words these are not drunkards you suppose i'm one of them this is that and i'll show you what it is it's the scripture this is that and i've always said if this ain't that let me keep this so that comes i'm gonna say with the prophet right there if this ain't that let me stay with this till that comes amen no this is that spirit that was spoken of this is that which was spoken about the prophet joel it shall come to pass in the last days said god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh see the dynamics coming to the mechanics they wasn't afraid no more some of you women are afraid some woman will laugh at you for having long hair quit wearing makeup some of you men are afraid your organization will throw you out when you're baptized in the name of jesus christ and spiritual baptism where you you need to close yourself in the upper room till the dynamics come it change them and quickened them it made them different they would change people from then on it quickened them from an old life of being a coward to to martyrdom uh to be like the the lion of the tribe of judah they faced martyrdom nailed to the cross crucified upside down burnt thrown in the lion's den no more cowards about them death had no victory over them at all dynamics was in the mechanics it quickened their mortal bodies now here's another thing for proof i'm quoting now here listen now listen here's another thing for proof it's so quick in them in such a way to you know what they were lifted up to heavenly places and their mortal bodies was so quickened until their language changed it quickened their language that's what the bible said and their mortal bodies being quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quickened their spirits were quickened their life was quickened they were quickened all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk anymore in human languages they were so quickened up in the presence of god till they spoke in new tongues a heavenly language what a quickening power if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you all hallelujah it'll quicken your mortal body it'll make you do things you wouldn't do before that was full so full of quickening power then your body ain't subject to sin anymore your desires what did they do they spoke in another language the bible said they spoke in every tongue under heaven could you imagine demo mortal bodies that's in there well i don't know whether i can believe this or not and all once it was so quick till the bravery of the lion of the tribe of judah fell into them over that waving sheep sheath and that eagle come to call its own and they love not their lives and death and there's going to be more who give their lives blood for this holy gospel than this crimson flood and the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day the quickening power has to come quicken them them out of this dead denomination creeds to the living word of god it quaking them to new life it does the same thing for us now notice they were so quick and in that quickening power and brother brandon says listen close now i'm trying to show you the quickening power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them not only the dynamics come in the quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what i mean they were so quick until their tongue began to speak in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of christ with quickening power till they laid their hands on the sick and they got well it quickened their mortal body they were healed by laying on their hands and the holy spirit quickened their fellowship together with god until there was so quicken in the presence of god that when a person died and that soul had gone off it called him back to life again amen glory said i'm feeling religious that's right quicken not only was his resurrection power for him self but whosoever will to this predestinated seed that's laying there quicken quickens the mortal body lay hands on the sick they recover that prayed in the spirit they saw vision they called the dead back to life that's right quick in their mortal bodies that's what the holy ghost did then that's what the holy ghost would do now that's what the prophet was preaching we have to see quickening power the holy ghost self shady i is here to energize the pride to fill him with his life and his power hallelujah now how long are we going to nurse on el shaddai until our bodies are changed it's not a one-time nursing it's a power for every day it's an inexhaustible resource brother branham said when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs i know you're so in love with christ and believe every word he says to be the truth that's the evidence you have the holy ghost and your life is so full of joy and everything oh my it's different from what it used to be that's the holy spirit now let me bring it down too close this can be really intense when you're born of the spirit you can get in the spirit any day any hour el shaddai is for everybody all times any moment any place driving down the road in your prayer closet home in the church it's not just reserved for church a drink from el shaddai can happen all the time he said if we would pray until our soul comes into the presence of god and then just relax and listen to his voice now let me just take a few minutes did you know that tongues were the result of the spirit himself speaking through the people and they were all filled with the spirit the bible said and began to talk in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so tongues was the result of the spirit speaking through the people think of that as i said it's not a one and done affair you see we got to follow christ every day or we have taken an organizational life so think of it we can nurse on him and receive a refreshing from his spirit any time how many would like to be refreshed in the spirit it's for you now i'm just going to say part of that is praying until you get in the spirit until you actually break out into a heavenly language you say i don't know that brother tim that's not bible well let me just tell you what the bible had to say about it in private prayer the bible teaches paul taught us that tongues aided the believer or the speaker to praise god tongues aided the believer or the speaker to praise god they let the speaker pray even at those times when they wasn't sure to ask for tongues are for that reason when you don't even know what to ask for you pray until you break out into that heavenly language and in public worship when accompanied by another the nine gifts interpretation tongues provided a vehicle of direct communication between god and his people in the case of tongues let's just put up first corinthians 14 and 4 the purpose of them is the strengthening of the one who uses them he that speaketh in tongues edifieth builds up or strengthens himself so here is a reason for speaking in tongues it strengthens the one who's speaking in tongues also paul refers to this as a form of prayer now you can see why the devil don't want this happening he don't want to church strong he don't want you to he he don't want you to to to have that as a form of prayer verse 14 chapter 14 14 if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth so tongues is a form of prayer it's when your spirit prayeth now you can pray with your intelligence and with your mouth but when your spirit prays it's in another language a heavenly language all right so what is it then verse 15 i will pray with the spirit i will pray with understanding also i won't do all my praying in tongues i will also pray in with understanding i will sing in the spirit and i will i will sing with the understanding also else then when i bless with the spirit how then shall he that occupied the room of the unlearned say amen at that giving of thanks we have seen that he understands not what they're saying so why should we pray in tongues it allows me to worship god and bless god in the spirit thou shalt bless with the spirit i just read that so it allows you to worship god and bless god in the spirit what else it allows me to pray in the spirit for he says i will pray in the spirit and with understanding also so it allows me to pray in the spirit i can even worship in the spirit i will sing in the spirit and i will sing with understanding also so it allows me to worship in the spirit it builds and encourages and strengthens the speaker because he that speaketh in and and an unknown tongue edifies himself it builds you up it edifies you it refreshes you now paul also taught us in romans 8 26 he taught us he see that he saw tongues as a way to pray when your mind is perplexed when you don't know what to ask for how do i pray about this what's this likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for when we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered so you see and then he goes on the next verse where he says what's and he's he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh the intercession for the saints according to the will of god so when i pray and i don't know what the will of god is i can get in the spirit and i can pray in other tongues and the spirit is making intercession so in the same way the spirit comes to the aid of our weakness we don't know how we ought to pray but through our groans are lust for words the spirit himself is pleading for us and god who searches our innermost being knows what the spirit means because he pleads for his god's own people in god's own way it's a way for god to make intercession for it through you now church this isn't just new testament this is message listen there are two different kinds of tongues there are tons of angels that is men and private prayer out yonder somewhere speaking of god speaking to god in angelic tongues inside the illinois brother branham tells of having a meeting he felt so pressed in the spirit he just couldn't get ready to go for the meeting it was so heavy and was praying and praying and just so heavy and billy paul come knocked on his door says time to go to church he said i can't go billy and he just kept praying and praying billy went and got him a coke or something and waiting around to see if his dad would be ready in a few minutes in a few minutes brother branham was down praying and he says i heard someone speaking in other tongues it sounded like german to me and he said i thought who is that german what are they saying and he says as i listened to it trying to hear the source it come from i realized he was coming out of my own mouth and he said after it finished after it got through the burden lifted and he went on to the meeting you know brother baxter as he was singing another song and whatever waiting he's i thought she wasn't coming he said well you know i i'm here and he gets up and he starts speaking and just as he gets through preaching at the end of the service a lady comes into church and she's shouting and screaming back there they run back with a microphone to see what it what what her deal was what what she was screaming about and she had been on her way to the meeting she had it was in an ambulance she had tuberculosis she started hemorrhaging in her lungs and that blood was just coming out and then she said i don't want to die in the sandwich get me out on the grass get me on the grass i'll die there but i don't want to die in this in this ambulance and they put her on the grass and as they were praying around her the bleeding suddenly stopped and she was healed and come to find out it was a very same time that brother branham was speaking in other tongues making the intercession what's wrong with that that's a new testament church amen that's what's supposed to be in the church we need the power of el salvador the almighty god to pray the prayer of intercession to refresh to strengthen to encourage us dear god we know we need encourage in this hour and when it is interpreted god will speak to it through it and and when it's spoken it will bless god in a heavenly language and that is given to us to nurse on until the body is changed the holy ghost is el shaddai that we are to drink of refreshing after refreshing hallelujah i say hallelujah everybody stand together rejoice with me this morning amen we ought to rejoice we're our new testament church we're a bible believing church we believe the full word of god not part of it all of it we shall see miracles we shall see giants fall we will walk on our waters hallelujah in my name they will speak with new tongues they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we'll have every divine promise of god we'll take holiness we'll take the power of god we'll take the seven thunders being revealed the book is open and every promise for the bride is mine once you worship the lord together with me raise your hands and thank him thank you lord thank you lord thank you jesus how we appreciate you lord r [Music] worthy
