we're looking for this morning we love you father and appreciate you and thank you now in Jesus name [Music] amen let's turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 23. also John chapter 16 if you would it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen I was glad when they said unto me let us go how many how many glad people do we have here this morning amen Hallelujah I'd like to speak to you again on the light the light the guide amen I believe he is our God thing I'm thankful for that guide amen Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20 and I'll be honest with you it's hard to read this one verse without shouting amen behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee and to the place which I have prepared Amen to keep thee to bring thee to a prepared Place John chapter 16 and verse 7 says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away that if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because of the prince of this world is judged I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that he shall speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall he shall receive save of mine and shall show it unto you amen we let you be seated today I said I'd like to speak to you on the light the guide a guide is someone that you get you know when you go to a place that's unfamiliar and you don't know exactly what roads you might want to take or or what things you want to see or or maybe you want to go on a special fishing trip or a hunt you find somebody who who's been there before a man who's there to get that's to guide you someone to show you around and amen you have to have a god when you don't know where you're going and you know I was thinking about this one here a few years ago me and sister Ruth and brother Danny and sister Michelle steamman amen took a trip over to Europe Priests of youth meeting there and then would go from there to spend a few days in Paris and Paris was a very big city it's uh it's almost uh Indescribable how how massive it is and how far reaching it is and an airplane seems like you can fly over it for a long time and you look down you see all these things and all these buildings and then you get down there there's many streets that leaves many directions there's many things down there that you would like to see but you don't necessarily know how to go about it and you don't know the language you don't know the signs you don't know amen because you're not from there you've never been there and so you know we what we did we found a guide that was a sister in Brother David Mayer's church had been to Paris many times and she knew the area she spoke the language and so it was very easy with for her to go down and decide okay we want to go here so we're going to take this street we're going to take this this bus we're going to take this whatever we would have to take to get there she knew exactly the way that we would go and it made it very very easy for us and saved us a lot of trouble and saved us a lot of Heartache amen even though there was things that were not working specifically right in that time because there was strikes going on and and the underground stuff that was supposed to be easier was not available but she was able to navigate around all of that and get us to the place that we wanted to go and I'm thankful today that we have a guide we you know we've never been here but he's already been here he's already been through whatever we're going through in whatever situation that we find ourselves so amen things may not be working rights things may seem to be going against what we think or how we think but he's able to navigate it all he's able to go around it he's able to move through it he's able to move above it he's a guide amen and I'm thankful for that God today a God has to know the way he has to know what what he's doing he has to know where he's going he has to know how to take care of you along the road amen he's got to see that you don't become of Lost Hallelujah this God you know is a selected man if anything happens to you it is his responsibility come on now it is his responsibility he's got to take care of you he's got to see that you not get lost he's got to see that you make it to your destination and I'm thankful that I have a God that I can rely on it's not a GPS system that'll that'll lead you down some back road somewhere and you realize where am I at why am I doing here or some man that maybe maybe thought he knew a Direction but didn't realize a bridge was out or didn't realize this was going on or didn't realize that this God knows all about it he knows every pothole he knows every ditch he knows every struggle he knows every trouble he knows how to navigate above above and beyond it all amen there's nothing that he cannot go through or get around so if you get lost he knows exactly how to get you out [Applause] amen if you find yourself in a lost situation he knows exactly how to save you there's nobody too lost there's no fighting too far that this God cannot go to where they're at and bring them out and bring them back to safety amen it's his responsibility to find every one of his that are lost every one of his that are broke down every one of his that are having issues in trouble he is a God and he will make sure they make it safely through amen you you cannot be a god unless you go through certain tests or you go through certain things amen if you want to be a God to go out into the Wilderness say you just can't decide that you've got to go through train and you got to go through testing you got to go through things of life amen there's a brother accident Brother David Mayer's Church who's a guy to go up into the Alps and take you hiking up there that's what you desire to do and you can go up there and he can take you through every Trail he knows the markings he knows the way amen he's took in thousands maybe up through there and he's as far as I know he's now ever lost to one he's a good guy that's what you want when you're going through difficulties of life you want a good God you don't want just any God you want the best God Amen if you get out in the wilderness and there's dangers around you and there's grizzly bears and there's this that and the other you want somebody that knows what they're doing you want somebody that can hear things that can see things they can and look at things and say no we don't need to go that way there's some danger down there that we don't want to go that way there's let's go this way you want a God who knows exactly what he's doing and I thank God the Church of the Living God has a God that knows exactly the dangers that are down this road or down that road and he knows exactly how to direct every person to their destination for it is his responsibility to get them there it's not my responsibility it's his responsibility it's not your responsibility it's his responsibility and he's more than capable of getting this bride through the darkness of him changes into a rapture Hallelujah he's a god regardless of the weather regardless of the climate regardless of the problems regardless if there's clouds or no clouds regardless of their storms or no storms he will get us through amen the God knows how to look at certain things he knows how to how to see brother Brown said there's tricks to a good God he can see stars he can watch the stars and and there's the North Stars we know as it stands there in a certain place in a certain position he's standing there as a testimony of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it Remains the Same it's never changing but just say there's some clouds over those stars and you can't see them amen if a reason a real God he can go to something else he can look at the moss on a certain side of a tree he can he can touch certain things maybe maybe the wind's blowing so hard and it's so dark he can't see the Moss but he can put his hands on his on a tree and he can feel the bark and he can tell you if it's north or if it's South amen because he has been trained in those matters glory to God I'm thankful we serve a god who's trained in these matters in the matters of what matters to humanity he is trained what matters to you he is trained what matters to the Church of the Living God he is trying amen you can feel it maybe I don't feel don't feel no difference that don't matter to him he can feel and say it's already done come on now he can feel it and say it's over with it's finished amen it's done you you may not feel no different you can feel on it all you want to and not feel no different but this guy is sensitive to know that his word will be fulfilled his word will not fall the side to the Wayside and become void and unfulfilled but it will be fulfilled so it doesn't matter if you can feel it or not it matters if he knows it or not and he knows that his word will be fulfilled you ever see a man that's lost a man that gets real lost out in the woods it can be very pitiful thing they can actually what they call go on an Indian Death March and just go around in circles thinking they're going the right direction anyway if he gets lost many times they'll lose their minds and they'll uh they'll actually forget who they are and all kind it can get very very difficult because Panic sets in and anxiety Takes Over In Fear And it dulls the senses to where they can't tell directions no more and they'll just circle around the same old place and the same old place why because they're lost amen and they'll go around the same old places of what used to be and what used to be and what used to be not realizing their own Indian Death March amen but if it's a God God there he can say no you're going around in a circle what you need to do is change direction what you need to do is go down this path amen straight is the way and narrow is the gate and few there be that find it but I'm a God and I'm going to be here to make sure you make it Amen brother animals say you don't need a guy to go down the Broadway it's the easy way anybody can find that way but to find the straight and narrow path you're going to need a guy you're going to need a light to guide you you're going to need a light to bring you you're going to need a light to keep you you're going to be the light maybe the devil has prepared us something for you and he's prepared amen Destruction for you and he's prepared hell for you and he's prepared this for you and that for you but God has a prepared place [Applause] Hallelujah in his preparation goes beyond and supersedes anything the devil ever had for you the devil may have you on the Indian Death March and you're going around in a circle but there's a light here this morning that'll tap you on the shoulder and say boy go this way I have a place prepared for you and there's a light that can come and guide you through the darkest of times that God has understanding of which way to go and what to do in every moment amen he sent to God God's people God has never failed so he sends a God but you have to accept that God now what would have been if I'd have been in Paris and this sister who speaks the language and she reads the signs and and she says now we need to go down this way and I say no I think it's better to go this way well I can tell you anybody in that group that followed me was a bunch of dummies because I I don't know nothing about Paris you get me out in jail Pruitt I can take you down some roads claiming Parish I can take you down a lot of Roads maybe around some of the surrounding parishes maybe a few more roads but you get me in some of those places maybe I wouldn't know where to go one way to find anything but she had been there she had read the signs before she had been down this she had taken others this direction amen she has led others down this way and she had brought them safely to their destination now I'm not talking about a woman this morning that's not the guide I'm trying to get you to follow that God I'm trying to get you to follow is the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about a man today that's not our God that God is the Holy Ghost and he has led others this way he has brought others safely this way you think you're the only one that's ever been through sickness and the God got this is not is going to leave you no he's brought others through cancer he's brought others to ever disease he's brought others to depression he's brought them all down through there and he got them safely to their destination Florida car and if he brought others he'll bring you Hallelujah but you must trust the God he'll lead down ways that don't seem right but you must trust him you must remember who he is that he's been this way before Hallelujah Jesus said I will not leave you but I pray the father and he'll send you a comforter in this comforter when he comes he was to guide us to all truth the word of God is the truth Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life amen he's the word in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh unto what among us then if we follow the true real God the Holy Spirit he will tell us what he sees he'll tell us what he's heard he'll show us things that are to come thank you Hallelujah he'll show us things that are to come there you are he's going to show you things to come and when the church today rejects that how they ever going to expect to get to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent for a guy we'll take some Cardinal some Bishop some general overseer or something like that to guide us when the Holy Spirit was given to us to God who said well praise God I got the Holy Spirit I don't need the church I don't need to go to church no more I got the Holy Ghost you're not to come to church shows you you don't got it because the word the spirit never divide never never denies the word it's the word when I'm following the god you're not following this guy no sir you well I tell you what I got enough I got enough Holy Ghost I don't have to go to church anymore well you've got the wrong God you're on your way to a crash amen you're on your way to destruction you've tricked yourself you're walking in a death Circle amen but there is a God who can lead you out of that and you say well I got hurt feelings will you think that God ain't never dealt with that before and helped somebody else through hurt feelings he knows how to direct the path he knows how to move you past the hurts and pass the difficulties and pass the problems and pass the situation but the problem is you don't trust the god you trust yourself more dare anybody to try to substitute anything other than the god if you do you'll go off the line that God knows the way he knows every inch of the way oh man we can Rejoice right there whatever inch you're on today whatever little itch you're on right now whatever Little Dot on the map you're on he knows the way whether you're on a little dot of sickness today he knows the way through this sickness if you're on a little dot of Torment today he knows the way through that torment if you're on a little daughter of a herd or a bruise he knows the way through that trust the god if you're on a little daughter called Death he can push you through that [Applause] if you lost loved ones he knows how to you're not the only one he'll bring you through just like he brought everybody else through [Music] he knows every thought in your heart he knows everybody that's here he knows what you are who you are what you've done all about you he's God's guide the Holy Spirit and he will reveal things and tell you that he's heard and can repeat your words right back to you and say what you said he said well that only happened to brother Brandon say no it didn't the word is still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart brother Branham was not the god the God's still here hallelujah amen that God used him but he was not the god the God is still here the correct God he will guide you to all true and his word is the truth when Israel left Egypt for the promised land in Exodus 13 21 God knew the very Road they were going to travel before they ever took a step they didn't know but the god knew they didn't know they was about to go to their very first test right off the bat and they was going to be brought right to a place so it looked like a trap and it looked impossible they didn't know that but the god knew that God was not lost when he took him and he said I'm going to take them and I'm going to make them go this way in that way so Pharaoh will say they are entangled in the wilderness amen that God was taking them a certain way for a certain time or for a certain things those Pharaoh would come to that place where he would think wow they're trapped let's go get them let's go take them so he would come and he would unleash his Force why did he come because the God brought him there come on now he didn't come just because he thought it was a good idea he came because the god tricked him into coming he brought him there not for amen the destruction of Israel but for his destruction he said because I'm going to have my way my final victory over there is going to be right here and in the in the very beginning of time that God was already working on his path when he put a mountain in a certain place and are seeing a certain place and a desert in a certain place and he said look at here this looks like a good place for a trap I'm going to bring him right down through here I'm already rejoicing because my people is going to come right here and I can see it already amen I can see the chariot wheels coming off I can see Pharaoh die his army died I can see it all taking place [Applause] amen Pharaoh got up that morning he said where send me send me a somebody tell me what's going on out there they made it yeah well they took a wrong path looks like I can show you by our great abilities that we have and the science that we got that they have went the wrong direction they have went the opposite way and they have walked around look here I can look at them they look look at that trail they've taken it looks impossible it looks at what why what is going on there lost because Israel where they say their promised land is it's up here and they went the wrong direction they have went the wrong path and they they they don't even know what they're doing Moses I thought he learned more than that and he's just I thought he learned how to tell directions I thought we taught him the stars and I thought we taught him all about how to direct an army and how to direct people but look at him he's lost as a Goose let's go get him and he brings them out there and he gets all of his army together and he's riding towards amen he tells I know a shortcut we'll get there before they can ever get enough boats to get across that water we'll get there before they can ever build a bridge and he gets there and all of a sudden as he's coming up he sees this mass of people before he can get there he sees his light that's whirling and I'm sure about things like what is that and it comes and it stands between him and the Israelites who was that that was the god that was the pillar of fire to guide them to the promised land amen the children of Israel followed that God A Cloud by day and a fire by night it stopped they stopped it moved they moved it journeyed they journeyed if it stayed for three days they stayed for three days it was the god Moses was not the god the God was that light well what do you mean well since you brought us out here to die where they're not in graves in Egypt I'm sure it was probably more through it than that it's been almost it's been what almost 60 years since the prophet died why are we still here because the God's still here when the god moves we're going to move that God has only erased all of this so that all the enemy can flood into this place and he's allowed there you River of Euphrates to be opened up the who has allowed it the God has allowed it not the devil the god he has allowed them to come to this place why for their destruction hey he has not brought you to 2022 to die in a in a wallow and die in your grief and you're hacking it he's brought you here for one moment I want you to understand the Red Sea is not a place of Agony the great sea is not a praise of crying and moaning the Red Sea is a place of victory Hallelujah and I want you to understand whatever hits you're on this morning is not a place for Agony it's not a place for greed it's not a place for you to get down and adultery you realize this inch that I'm all he's only with me and as long as he's here I'm still moving and I'm still breathing and I'm still living this itch is a place of victory you need to declare that this morning this is that I'm on is a place of victory [Applause] Moses couldn't do this even with all of his learning that he had he couldn't provide all that was needed he needed a guide foreign Moses and his people brother Andrew Spencer sent me this this morning I said Hallelujah and I copied it and I pasted it Moses and the people were in the desert what was he going to do with two million people in a desert that's more than an inch they had to be fed into whatever two to three million people requires a whole lot of food let's just hear what our God can do according to the quartermaster General in the Army it is reported that Moses would have to have 1500 tons of food each day just to satisfy their appetite Moses gonna Supply that no no do you know that to bring that much food in each day two freight trains at least a mile long would be required besides you must remember they were in a desert so they would have to have firewood to cook the food so it would take four thousand tons of wood and a few more freight trains each a mile long just for one day and just think there were 40 years in transit oh yes they would have to have water and they only had enough just to have enough water to drink and maybe wash a few dishes it would take 11 million gallons of water a day and a Frank freight train with tank cars 1800 miles long to bring enough water for one day and then another thing they had to get across this Red Sea now if they went on a narrow path double file the line would be 800 miles long and it would require 35 days and nights to get through it so there had to be a space in the Red Sea three miles wide so they could walk five thousands of five thousand oppressed to get over in one night but then there's another problem each time they camped at the end of the day a campground two-thirds the size of the State of Rhode Island was required and a total of 750 square miles long this much space for camping do you think Moses figured all that out before he left Egypt you see Moses believed in his God and God took care of all of that Moses wasn't fretting about the firewood and none of he had all he had to do was call unto his God and God would provide it now do you think God has any problem taking care of all your needs come on somebody our God is an awesome God so in the road you're traveling seems difficult at best just remember trust the God he will do the rest can you trust the god this morning if he can provide enough water and enough firewood and enough food Amen to two million people don't you think he's got enough power for your little inch let's add all the inches up in here do you think he's got enough power let's give you a square foot the fire marshal says that each person is required I believe it was what was it three square foot of person or five somewhere right in there so I'll give you that much foreign I believe God's got enough of it we just read about what he did so if he was able to get them through to their destination the guy this guy that I'm talking about this Pillar of Fire that has that by the way has never left the church he is still here he said well I don't know about that I'd haven't seen him well don't worry about it just believe him that's all he requires do you know he does not require that you see him he requires that you believe him oh it'd be wonderful to be able to see him one day going to be able to see him face to face but what he's looking for is somebody to believe him oh it's easy to believe a god when you're in an air-conditioned car and you're riding down a highway and you you got it all figured out but when you get on foot and you're an unfamiliar City and there's all kind of dangers around let me just be honest with you we went through some sketchy looking places I know you teenagers know that word that's sketch I hear it all the time that's sketchy well it was sketchy there was people laying in tents there were Lord Jesus there was human feces all over the wall you say I can't wait to go to Paris well let me tell you some of the dirty things it may look all good from up above and pictures may make it look all great but you get down with your boots on in the city you realize wow places filthy places nasty this place is unbelievable can we make it through well the guy had said we're going this way so you know what I did I followed the guide because I felt like if I got off on any place more any other place it might be more sketchy and I didn't want more sketchy I wanted to get to where we was going amen it was a church that was on a hill that you can climb 300 something steps up and you can see a beautiful view of Paris and it was nice and it was wonderful and I was glad I made it and I was glad I made it back to my room but why because I was following the guide amen laodicea as it looks all beautiful looks all great in the pictures it looks wonderful but sometimes you get your boots on the ground and you start going through some very difficult places and it seems so dirty and so filthy and am I going to make it through and the devils are halting at you and camping out and making fun and saying this and you don't know what all he's saying he making all kind of noises and he's making all kind might be threats may not be threats I don't know and it's going out and it's going to this and saying it but if you'll just keep following the light if you'll just keep following the guy he's going to bring you safely through he's already done it before nature needs God science calls it an instinct but it's truly a guide it's the god that placed that there so they can find their way in places you know brother Adam talks about this he said have you noticed the wild geese or the Ducks going south you remember that little duck was born under on a pond somewhere he don't know east north west or south he knows nothing but what the pawn he was born in he never been off the pond but inside of him was something that was moving he was a born leader there he was born to be a leader the first thing you know one night a big snow comes across the top of the mountains what happened that cold breeze comes off of those mountains begin to blow across that that little Pond and Mammy what does this mean is he shivering I never felt that cold weather before but he began to notice around the edges of the pond things were freezing up just ain't quite as many amens no more not quite as many shouting going on no more there's a cold breeze that's blowing through it's called level to seal the flu of laodicea I know a lot of us been sick with the flu and been dealing with it listen there's a whole lot worse flu than what you've been dealing with in the last week there's recovery with that there's medications as you can take or there's whatever God can move into I see to move very supernaturally and change things God can do whatever he wants to but there's a worse flu than this flu that's going around it's the flu of laodicea and the same filtrating homes and churches and lives and things are getting froze up but if that little duck has an instinct put in there by God he'll realize listen things are getting a little tough around here and I can't handle have as much room to swim anymore come on now I don't have enough room anymore to just worship God and to give God all the praise and all the glory amen because that flu has been it's been freezing up the bank edges and it's coming closer and it's coming closer and I'm not going to stay here until I become one of the Frozen chosen no something begins to honk on the inside of him this is the prophet of God he starts jumping up in the middle of pond something strikes him you can call it what you want to I call it inspiration [Applause] you can call it Holy Roller you can call it work up you can call it emotion he said I call it inspiration it's down on the inside of him he starts jumping up and flapping those wings in the middle of that pond all right the water's me in trouble that's exactly right brother here he's traveling the water and things are beginning to move and something out of him again amen amen amen what is it that God put it down there [Applause] he'll honk and honk and honk to every duck that's destinated predestinated to life will gather around him and then pretty soon he'll honk and he'll swing those wings and out of that pond he's going to go Hallelujah let's bring it tomorrow amen not just about a church let's bring it to a universal bride hey man listen laodicea is trying to freeze the edges trying to freeze up our worship frees up the things of God freeze up the moving of the spirit frees up the inspiration of the Holy Ghost frees it all up the world is doing that if you're you're a part of it then you're part of the world because that's where it's coming from it's the anointing of Satan that's trying to freeze up the Waters of God hey remember what is it going to do it's going to cause some to gather in the middle and they're going to begin the rally around the word of God and the anointing of God and the shouts of God and the sound of the king that's in the camp and the fire of God Is Burning above them and they're going to start flapping those waves amen they're going to start to move and of that inspiration when that Holy Ghost moves through they're going to move with it and pretty soon that air is going to blow hard enough it's going to lift them up into a body change if he'd done it before he can do it again well how do you know he's done it before well I got a Bible That's Enoch walked with God and was not maybe he couldn't get no more ducks to go with him but he went why because there was something in him wanting more such a jubilee they'll have right in the middle of that pond turning it over and over and over and after a while he feels it moving on him he's got to leave he'll set those little wings down and fly off that pond and go and turn up in the air about four or five times and go straight to Louisiana as he can ever duck right behind him honk honk honk honk here he comes what was it the duck knows their guide and if a dump duck can follow a God how come we can't follow him if a duck can follow and trust him to lead him to places he'd never been before Amen to an area he's never been before all he's ever known is up there but something on the inside of him then why can't we trust him in sickness why can't we trust him we can brother Graham talks about in a magazine called look there was an old Gander one time he said an old Gander didn't know what he was doing and he led a bunch of geese all the way over to England they ever they've never been to England before but they didn't pay attention to their God said the old Gander didn't know what he was where he was going and now they're over there and they can't get back that's what's the matter with a whole lot of these Geeks today oh they still swarm these geese swarm and fly over England but they don't know how to get back to where they belong he said you can swarm you can have big great protracted meetings and have revivalists come along preach a while but you don't know where you're going swarming around around because you got some Gander to lead you off to a dominational spree and not back to the word of God not back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we wonder why we ain't got Revival in our days you got that you got to get that certain sound that sound is the gospel trumpet breathing out the gospel every word of God not Creed not denomination but the Bible the Holy Spirit the signs following them that believe there's another he's on another old Gander got a bunch of them killed trying to fly through the darkness hit up against the mountain burst them into pieces you got to find somebody something is a certain sound and that certain sound lines up with his word hallelujahs don't line up with old formalities and Creeds and dogmas and it's a GL It lines up it's glorious he said it lines up with a wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it brings virtue knowledge patient godliness in the Holy Spirit that's what the real God will lead you to because he'll breathe out nothing but the gospel just the word of God you need a guide brother Brown will say like he said I'm 53 years old been preaching the gospel here for 33 and a half years and I've never seen it fail I'm going to contestify that I've seen a test or tested seven times around the world all kind of religions everything else before as many as a half a million at one time and never had it fail I don't speak from some book I speak from personal experience and I know that God stands behind his word and he honors it every time now if you have some kind of creed you better watch out but the holy spirit will back up the word of God he is the word he is the god in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among his mind he said Paul was guided to say on Acts 2 38 repent every one of you and they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and then the God will take you on from there that God will take you on from there that's the thing to do reverse repent of all your unbelief and you disappoint you disbelieve things repent and then be baptized and the God will take you from there hallelujah it's the God is on duty from their own my Mark was led by the Holy Ghost to write mark 16. John was led by the Holy Ghost wrote Revelations he was led by the God he was led by the god to say whatsoever whosoever so take one word out of it add one word to it the same shall be taken as part out of the book of life we must have the god he's been my God through life he's guided me unto life he is the one that led me to life he is my life without him I have no life without him I want nothing else he is My All In All in the hours of my trouble he stands by me yesterday he blessed me today he'll do the same what can I expect the same forever bless His holy name he promised it he'll do it he's my life he's my God he's My All In All I've trusted it I've had hard trials I've went through them I trust him wherever I go and I want you to do the same if you go to woman wash him trust him talking to somebody in the audience if you go downtown trust him wherever you're at trust him he's trustworthy Hallelujah and this God won't quit you might go out to somewhere wherever and buying you a guide and he might quit you halfway through and leave you to your troubles it might get too great for even him I'm a trained man and he might decide he wants to preserve his life and leave but this God won't quit he said well I made a lot of trouble I made a lot of trouble for him this guide won't quit he won't give up let's turn to Nehemiah 9 and verse 12 moreover thou led us in the day by the Cloudy pillar and in the Night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go that thou cometh down also upon Mount Sinai and speaketh unto them from the heaven and gave them right judgments and true laws and good statues and Commandments and made known unto them thy holy Sabbath and command us them precepts and statues and law by the hand of Moses I servant thou gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought forth water oh and I would see what the God's been doing and when Moses it was him the guy brought forth water out of the rock for their thirst and promised them that they should go in the promise into the possess the land which I was sworn to give them but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearken not into thy Commandments and refuse to obey neither were mindful of their Wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and their Rebellion appointed a captain and returned to their bondage but Thou Art of God ready to pardon Hallelujah let's look at the nature of this God Thou Art of God ready to Pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of good kindness and forsook them not yea when thou have made them a moat they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy God that brought thee out of Egypt and it wrote great provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness the pillar of cloud departed not for them by day and led them in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them in life the way wherein they should go he never left them so they left him though they tried to walk away though they built him another God and said this is the one that brought you out of Egypt he wouldn't leave them this God don't quit he may be this morning suffering from some torment in your life because of where you quit the guide and agony I left him don't worry the God's still there he won't leave amen he has promised himself to you and he doesn't break a promise you might break promises you may walk away from him you may say things and do things walk away from him but he won't walk away from me from here he's always there he's always been there I'm making testify of that how many can say for what I wait but listen we ain't none of us better than anybody else in here we all were born in sin shaped iniquity come into this world speaking lies so you know what you were when you got here a liar you know what you were full of iniquities sin every kind of thing that held upon your life but God rich in Mercy came down and he found you in that pit where you was at and that pit of despair despondency and it seemed like it wasn't no way you was ever going to get out it was so dark and so deep and so slimy you tried you had tried to claw your way out of drugs you'd try to call your way out of drinking and smoking and every kind of other sin of life you tried it all and you'd clawed and you'd claw and you found yourself sinking down and down and down and down and all of a sudden though you looked up out of the darkness of that pit and up there was a light and it was whirling right over your square inch right over your little part where you was at and when you was in your despondency and your spare Despair and it reads and all of a sudden out of that light you saw it all of the complected hand reach down and thank God you never got far enough that that hand couldn't reach down far enough and it didn't call you sorry and lost and undeserving and I told you saw it and you shouldn't have ever done this you lousy person though it said I'm here with grace and mercy I'm here to reach down and pick you up and it brought you out of that pit and it began to guide you and it began to lead you and it began to move in your life and it took things off of you that you tried so hard to get off of your life and you never could break free from it you tried to quit this and you tried to quit that but all of a sudden that all of complected hand would reach over to grab that thing and just pluck It Off and just reach over there out of that dirty heart and grab that old root of lust and pick it off hey man it just kept walking with you and guiding you and leading you oh God and you would fall over here and the God would reach over and grab you and bring you back and you would fall on this side of the dish and that God would reach down and bring you back come on somebody I know I'm talking to somebody this morning he never left you you may have fallen away from him but he has not Fallen away from you you may have walked away from him but he has not walked away from you [Applause] his manifold Mercies Psalms 119 will say 10 and 105 would say Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path proverbs 4 18 and 19 says but the path of the just is as a Shining Light I love the scripture right here is as a shining light that shineth more and more unto perfect day did I just y'all reading something different the path of the just is as a Shining Light that gets dimmer that goes out that turns off that signeth more and more why is it going to shine more and more because it's going to get darker listen we're not going we're not in a age it's full of light we're in an age of Darkness darkness is so covering this world to where their minds are just being totally they're lost so they become so lost they forget who they are and a man believes he's a woman and a woman believes he's a man why because they're on the Indian Death March and they're going around in a circle and they lift up the creation and begin to worship him more amen you can you can listen you can kill a baby and you can kill 100 babies they don't care but you kill one little egg of a bald eagle how many people got up in arms when there's Dr Palmer killed a lion over there and I believe it was in Africa and he killed this line that you know the media blew it up and they made all kind of accusations and things it got so bad this Dr Palmer was actually I believe from Minnesota if I remember right or somewhere way up North it got so bad that Dr Palmer and Homer started getting death threats he couldn't even hardly answer his phone no more because these people were so incensed that somebody would take a poor little Lion's eye and I understand be we need conservation I understand all of that amen but we also need men amen that abide by conservation they say Don't Do no harm it actually is helping things for hunters to be out there I know the world don't like you to know that but that's the truth amen but they get so incense and and then they can then they're going to get so incense because we dare try to take a right from them to Kill The Unborn that's in their own womb what is wrong they've been walking in darkness so long and they're walking in darkness until they've gotten so confused and they don't know what's right what's wrong what's this what's that they don't know what's what colors is pink and what colors is blue if you know what I mean they don't know nothing about anything they have completely lost all sense unto where a man or a woman can declare them whatever they want to declare themselves they can declare themselves to be a cat they can declare themselves to identify themselves to be a dog they can identify themselves of any animal any type anything whatever they want to if they want to be a wall they can be a wall what is going on they are walking in darkness so why is the light that we're walking in going to shine brighter and brighter because it's getting darker and darker in this light is leading us somewhere it's doing what it's doing on purpose I want you to understand where in 2022 on purpose maybe not on my purpose or anybody else's purpose but it must be in on God's purpose God has a purpose that we are still here and he's not left us we are not by ourselves we are not alone he's still leading he's still guided he's still moving he's still directed he's still touching your life in the darkest of moment all of a sudden you he'll feel a hand bump you and he moves you over just a step take you down this way and he bumps you and it moves you back another step what is he doing he's keeping you from destruction but the Way of the Wicked verse 19 is as Darkness they know not at what they stumble did you hear that you ever been walking down a dark path and if you you know I always said this and I think I've said it from here I've not ever been scared of the dark you just get scared of the things in the dark yeah darkness of his just darkness I'd be all right but this is the stuff that's hiding in the Darkness and in the darkness your mind can go nuts we've been talking about it and then but I'm talking about just actual just darkness your mind can actually imagine things how many of you woke up in the middle of the night and you left a coat hanging over somewhere and you're absolutely 100 percent that's a serial killer I'm not talking about s or c-e-r-e-a-l killer I'm done by s-e-r-i-a-l killer serial killer and he's got a knife or a gun and he's been I can all of a sudden your mind can hear breathing it can see movement because why it's dark and it looks like something is about to get me I know and you start trying to put like you're pulling the covers it's going to do you any good but somehow in our minds in the darkness covers just feel better and we throw them covers over our head and we're just safe under our covers we are never safe under our own covering what's the first thing person a person does in darkness they start pulling up their covers something can happen and get bumped around a little bit and they pull up their religious coverage they pull up this cover and they pull up that cover trying to keep them in darkness but what you need is light amen if you'll turn on the light you'll realize hey that's my suit coat over there that's my move that's my old fur coat over there I thought for sure that was a bear that just somehow opened the door got in my room and come all the way open up three doors matter of fact I didn't hear nothing but all of a sudden that big bully bear no it's my coat why do you know that because the light started coming on as the daylight began to break it began to reveal what was around you and amen the world doesn't know it what they stumble at but you know because there's light when you stumble over something oh I didn't mean to make that mistake I didn't mean to make that why can you say that because you got like to see what it was [Applause] they don't have that so they think Well everybody's going to make it to heaven they can be Sinners they can be this they can be that long as they love Jesus and they pull that covering over his Darkness and this world is getting darker I know in our flesh we want it to get better it would be better if gas was cheaper it would be better if milk was cheaper and it's all about Earth it's all about this God's not worried about your milk being cheap he's not worried about your gas being cheap he's not worried about any of that what he's concentrating on and the angel was looking at this morning is what we read I have sent my angel before thee to keep thee so it doesn't matter if it's high or if it's low if it's good or if it's bad I'm going to keep you it doesn't matter if I'm having a you're having a good day or a bad day or up or down or your Valley or Mountain this that I'm going to keep you and not only am I keeping you I'm bringing you I am I am the one if you look back there's not two sets of footprints there's one set of footprints because I'm carrying you you are my desire you are what I I'm longing for you you are all you're the in the the the encapsulation or the Capstone of everything that's been done for 6 000 years and you think I'm gonna let it come to this moment and lose you oh God I'm not going to lose you little bride I'm going to be with you and I'm going to keep you and I'm going to bring you to a prepared place Hallelujah and if there wasn't enough Devils to stop them from going over there there's not enough Devils to stop you because the same Pillar of Fire that led them is leading you this morning You are not alone you were not by yourself God is with you and if God be for you who can be against you it's the light is guiding you it's the light that's leading you you are not doing this alone it was so brother Timothy nobody calls nobody understood cares about you are not alone it does not matter if anybody ever calls or anybody ever checks on you understand what I'm saying what I'm trying to get to you is you are not alone he's with you and that's all that matters Matthew 2 and verse 1 said now Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and to come to worship Him so what brought them to that worship a light it was a god LeBron would talk about it like this he'd say this is a wonderful sermon might be a good thing to go listen to during this season that we're coming to this is a time of seasons we focus our thinking towards Christmas he said it's too bad we have a lot of the myth called Santa Claus instead of the real Christmas that it was supposed to be many children of the land today no more nothing more than Christmas Means and a slate full of toys and some Mystic reindeer pouncing on the house and only later learned that this is a myth to even hurt their faith he said when it comes to know the true Christmas Story that it had nothing to do with reindeers or a man smoking a pipe and a fur coat around fur around his coat but it was about the birth of our blessed Lord Jesus and this most unusual to see how God worked in this manner because no other time would it have ever worked and all the history of the world did you hear that there was no other time that the birth would have worked like this then all the history of the world so the guide knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly the times and the moments and the seasons and the right direct time it was a time that when Harry there was a murderer was key it had to be this heartless man had to be king and on the throne so we're acquainted with scriptures how he slew all the children from two-year-old down trying to kill the Christ it had to be just at that time then there had to be at that time there had to be a raise in taxation do you notice similarities that take place at every Exodus there was the killing of the of the children at every Exodus there was an increase of burdens you go make bricks without straw there's a taxation I need all of y'all I don't care who you are go to your home cities so it wasn't an easy thing they didn't have a GMC truck to jump in with air conditioning go down the road in a few minutes and be Israel's not that big just there not too many years ago and you could be on one end to the other and just seemed like maybe an hour an hour and a half it's not that big but on a donkey it's real big I was on a bus and I had a guide he knew the dangers he knew the situations he knew where he was supposed to be and where you wasn't supposed to be he had a connection that I didn't have because there were places that we thought you know that was that was on the program and we was going to go down the mountain where they found Mount Sinai now and they found the encampments they found stuff around it and and you know over there there's all kinds of things over there that that the Catholic Church camped on and said this is that and this that some of it may be true some of it may not be but there are certain places that are true and you know and they did a good thing in some sense because it wasn't destroyed they kept it so I mean God used it but you know they would they would say well this is where it was the baptism took place of of Jesus and it was it was actually miles and miles away from where it actually took place or where the crossing of the Jordan River because the Bible is a GPS our our brother that went with us the the guide he as well he said the Bible is always true and he actually took the Bible and found where the city what city was that it was by Jericho can't think of it right off but he found that City and he found right there where the crossing would have took place they actually had a celebration in Israel too and made a celebration invited him up and everything because of what he had found because he used the Bible to show him where it was at that's amazing ain't it well anyway well you know we thought we was going to go to Mount Sinai we actually sat down as a group and debated this that and the other and decided you know there was maybe dangers it was right down the Egyptian border and we had to get permission of the soldiers we had to get this hat and the other and you know during the night I went to bed that night thinking I was going to get on the bus the next morning and I'm headed straight down to Mount Sinai and I woke up the next morning I got my stuff together me and sister Ruth we put it on the bus we got up our seat and we're ready to go to Mount Sinai and the god gets on said well we're not going to Mount Sinai he said there's dangers down there that come up and we're not we not got permission he had connections that I didn't get a phone call that night I didn't get a text message that night but apparently somewhere between our meeting and the next morning on the bus he had got information it wasn't safe to go down that way no more and you know what I didn't sit there and say Mr God I want to go that way Mr God I'm determined to go that way no I felt like I could trust him he had been there before he knew the all the Dynamics that was going on around that country he had connections he had been there he had said he had taken people safely before but this was not a safe time to go so if it wasn't a safe time to go I didn't want to go and I was going to trust the god but we found similarities if you look death of babies higher increases people in leadership that doesn't know God first second third Exodus that God is trying to show us something let's don't get our eyes off the guide he said there had to be registered their births was on record of the courts and the temple and they had to be taxed he said well really what was this all about there was a word spoken that said he had to be born in Bethlehem so God was going to use whatever methods he had to use that God was going to pull whatever strings he had to pull to make his word be fulfilled and all of what we're seeing amen listen Russia in this place in the U.S and all that's going the God is in control don't get your eyes off of what's really going on we get our eyes on politics and this that and the other the Republicans has got this and the Democrats has got that and God's got it [Applause] Amen brother van will say he said politics he said I don't care what side it is it's all of the devil and so who's got the devil in his control who made him is the creation more powerful than the Creator he's pulling the strings he's getting the right person in the place to do what it takes to fulfill his word the God has got this we ought to be to rest this morning because we saw how he brought it all to pass in the first Exodus and now we're looking how he's bringing it to pass in the second for Exodus and it all worked hello not one of his words went unfulfilled they all everything that spoke of that time was fulfilled some of it was fulfilled in the last few minutes on the cross but it was fulfilled all the words spoke about this Exodus will be fulfilled it might be fulfilled in the last few moments he said notice they didn't have a nice great fine plush ambulance to take Mary there they didn't have that but it was a king's orders no excuses was good enough it must be fulfilled the king said no matter her conditions and she wasn't in the greatest condition she was right at the time of giving birth any husband in here knows if you ever want to get your wife on a donkey that ain't the time it's uncomfortable in a good car it seemed like God why are you putting us through this heartache why am I going through this so his word can be fulfilled so his word can be fulfilled why I'm honest donkey going across this Wilderness wise robbers there's this there's all kind of dangers there's every kind of thing around me why am I going so his word can be fulfilled why are we still here so his word can be fulfilled why am I going through what I'm going through so this word can be fulfilled foreign he's the god Mary expecting any time sitting on the back of a donkey if anybody ever wrote a donkey it's a rough ride little fella along a narrow Trail winding over the mountains listen it was a rough ride many times in a good and Plush Bus but over these little nail Trails winds blowing dust blowing rough rugged Road robbers taking good slaying people what a thing it was for this young married couple that they had to face God why are they having to go through that that his word might be fulfilled also what is some wild beasts would destroy them took that little party in an instant with some wild beast Joseph didn't have nothing but a stick his wife could hardly move but they had to face it he said but that gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so and there is nothing that will ever interrupt the program of God that gives me something to shout about because Cancer Cannot interrupt it every kind of disease will not interrupted any kind of sin will not interrupt it family issues will not interrupt it but his word will be fulfilled he said oh we see this dark enveloping of time but God's great hand his guide is moving steadily on and nothing everybody say nothing nothing shall stop it Hallelujah is that I can see as they make that one last curve and they find them a good spot to maybe lay down a little bit and he said I see Joseph get the little Maps together and he said I see him try to find a few sticks to build a fire and they're looking over the Hillside and they can kind of see Bethlehem over across there maybe a few lights he said but all of a sudden as he's laying that mat down he said I see him look up a little higher and yes I see the stars starts twinkling and they start twinkling a little bit and brightening up and they begin to shine he said what was taking place God like this great Shining Light was beginning to shine out because he knew that two years down the road he would be a little child in the house and there would be some men that would come with gifts and there had to be something that would draw them to that place and he said why listen to the prophet of God he said why would they know that that light meant something he said because years before that Daniel was exiled down into that place and his life began to had such a testimony of a living God and he left behind Scrolls and he showed them what a really Living God was all about that's why Daniel had to go through the Lion's Den that's why the three huge review children had to go through the fire so God could fulfill his word it blows your mind when you think about all that God had to do to get he said now he said scripture doesn't say it but he said we look at it and we believe that three came because it was three gifts and he said normally they traveled in about three or four he said so we'll say three he said but to put all of that together that they would have something in their heart that they were looking for a sign he said because Daniel had spoken to them and he had told them that in the last days the people that know their God shall do exploits he had left them words and they had been studying those words they had been looking at those words and they had been diligently studying the bodies of the stars and watching for the sign he said if Christians would only do that not just watch the stars but what's God's word as it's unfolding if we would only notice it today and see how God has promised in this day the things that we so gallantly stand for God has promised to do the same and he's doing them he's Healing The Sick he's doing great miracles and the same Daniel that taught them of them events is the same God today that spoke through Daniel and said in the last days the people that know their God shall do exploits so if God could design it to where three wise men down hundreds of years later would still be looking for a star and he would put a word down there that hundreds of years there was still something pricking on them and looking and and wondering what is it going to take place and all of a sudden he said I can see one of them as he took that little scroll up to that Watch Tower and he laid it out and he looked up and up there became one became a great Shining Light as them Stars moved together he said I can see him become Spellbound that's the word brother Branham he used it several times he said Spellbound as he just watched it he said I've waited for it I've hold on for it but here it is here it is right here I waited for it I've longed for it I've looked for it and here it is here it is here it is and he said he got so excited he rolled his little scroll up and he took off down them stairs down to his buddy's house and he knocked on the door he said it's here it's here it's here here it is here it is here it is he's on all today if I could just you get you to realize he's here that same light is here here he is he's Among Us he's healing us he's delivering us oh God is there somebody that's spelled Bound by his presence that has caught their attention and they're not paying attention to nothing else he's here he said even notice God reveals himself to those who are searching and longing to see him draw an eye to me and I'll draw an eye unto you he said well what was going on he said why why did they catch it when it happened he said because I can see them mind let me back up a little bit foreign he said I can see them he said they were in a spiritual attitude they were looking for something he said they must have been singing some hymns or praying but whatever however they must have been in a spiritual attitude to receive it oh my so many good things here he said they watch The Heavenly lights but this light was different than the rest of them and he said today we've watched Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian lights but to those who look for him there seems to be a different light that's Shining that's declaring him that's saying he's the same yesterday today and forever that he is with us that he is moving that he is moving Among Us he said oh they as they stood there Spellbound one could not speak to the other for the glory of this life had Spellbound them he said how is the day my poor decrepit friend that when the man who has never known his pie that when man who has never known his power to give new light New Hope when he walks into the presence of the Divine person of Christ with the faith that holds him Spellbound to his majesty it isn't like walking to the Altar and giving the ministers just another handshake but you're walking into the light that you've never witnessed before and it puts New Life in you it gives hope to those that are dying it gives courage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessing to the unfavored how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence it's not a myth frizz truth another place he said those Magi stood Spellbound as they watch that light God was moving among them he said it's only for those who look for him that'll see him if you're not looking for him in this service you won't see him but if you are you will hallelujah it's only those who believe in him shall enjoy his blessings it's only to those who believe in healing that shall receive healing it's only those who believe in Salvation that obtain it it's only those who believe all things that are possible that'll see all things are possible we know the stories they would come and they would I ain't got time to go and do it all but they would come and they would find themselves in Jerusalem and when they went into to Jerusalem and went before Herod he said the light left them he said but when they came back out the light was still there Hallelujah you may have found yourself off the beaten path this morning but if you'll just come back out the light's still there the light's still given a testimony that the king is Among Us amen we could go into the gold and all the things that they gave him it's a wonderful wonderful thing but I want to get to something brother Brandon would bring it down he says you are a star you are a star every Christian is a star to guide the Lost to guide the weary the foot of the traveler to those who are seeking then the star cannot be guided by itself it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the brilliancy of God in his life to obtain it's abstain from those things of the world to live Godly and soberly in this present life it must reflect the light of the great one that has signed Among Us what are we to do then to rise and Shine the Light Of God to the dying world it's in depth darkness of the world we are to reflect and Shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his resurrecting power as he is yesterday so he is today and so he will be tomorrow that's what God wants he wants a church that'll shine out and say God's still the same he still heals he's still saves he still delivers he's still sets free he still does it impossible he's still God foreign is going to keep shining skipping through all kinds of stuff because I got to get down to the moments of closing these wise men saw that the word of God said a star would rise out of Jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of Eternal Light so will wise men today who's not blinded by creeds they will follow the god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power of God blooming in this hour no matter how many of observatories how many other things told the wise men while you're out of your mind two years they was in travel they passed by many nations and they'd ask where are you going we've seen his star and we're going to worship Him when they lined up in Jerusalem the nominational headquarters they didn't have the answer they went up and down the streets crying where is he born King of the Jews they know nothing about it they called on the word to find out they had followed know that the star was leading them to that eternal life God is to thy Perfect Light and the word is what guides you to the light and the light is what makes the word Vindicated notice they were wise men do we have any wise men among us today and wise men today all the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God all your scientists all your people depending on some great scholarship or something another telling you how to split an atom that won't give you life that'll give you death there's nothing can take you to life but the spoken word of God it's only where the life can come it's through a spoken word how know how to spit it Adam I wish they'd never found out how because it's going to burst this world up into pieces he said well the righteous will walk out on the dust of the wicked where sin will be forgotten everything has a way of renewing itself and man who's given to life on this Earth by his wisdom taking the tree of knowledge into the tree of life he'll destroy the Earth that God has given and live on but those who are still on the Tree of Life shall come to the new heavens and the new Earth where there's no sickness where there's no death there's nothing but light light light light light there's no darkness no more what a day that's going to be it was the angels of God that showed light upon a hill to some Shepherds to guide them to Eternal Light see it only comes by light life can only come by light so if you don't have the light you don't have the life well I got the word well the light follows the word and the word follows the light they go hand in hand you can't have one without the other amen because the light is to lead you into all truth we say well I got the Bible well so if they had it for two thousand years or however many years it has been they've had Scrolls and but then they finally printed it what three or four hundred six hundred years ago so the Bible they had the Bible for 600 years but they still believed in three gods they still had the wrong baptism they still snaught never saw the the trail of the serpent why because there wasn't enough light but when light began to shine the light of this world began to shine upon this word out of it and begin to open the seals been to show who all the horses were showed who all the spirits of God were and how they were working oh well they're the trail of the serpent is let's follow him see him go right down to the Garden all the way down see him move all the way through he saw it Cain and he saw it look look at his Trail all the way down all the way down to June he says Kane who was of that Wicked one what what happened light shining they had read that for years what was shining to show that there was a two-year-old little boy is it light there was many other maybe two-year-old little boys a lot of them got killed [Music] why was he there because there was a light that came to us the Father Joseph said get up and go to Egypt and it guided him to Egypt and it stayed there for two years and it guided him right back this God's been in business a long time now I want you to understand something when I want to go catch me a good fish and I don't know how to fish there I don't want just any God I want one that knows how to catch fish we remember Tim took a trip here back in May and we was over in the mountains there in British Columbia and revel Stoke Brother Sam Ray and his wife had had just kind of poured some blessings upon us and gave us a little spot to stay in and they they've set us up a guide and listen sister Rebecca had searched it out she told me she said I want you to have a good spot and I wanted you to have a good guide he said because I want you to catch fish I don't want you to just have a good time I want you to catch fish so I searched him out and I looked at reviews and I looked at the I found somebody that knew what they were doing and listen it was a hard day of fishing it wasn't but there was many that pulled up that Dock and they didn't have no fish on their boat but we did and it wasn't because I knew what lure to use it wasn't because I knew what depth it had to go it was fishing like I had never done before I'd never used the things the equipment that he had used I never but he had and he told me he said you know people think this is a big easy job you just kick back and relax he said I can't tell you how many hours I spend spending my own gas and spending my own time trying to find these fish and trying to find what's what they're eating what they're biting where they're at what's going on he said because I want my customers not to just come out and enjoy the mountains and enjoy the scenery I want them to catch fish because that's what I'm a guy I ain't a guy to show them the water I ain't a guy to show them all the scenery around them I am a guy just show them where the fish are at Hallelujah he was a God that knew what he was doing I don't know you won't don't want to depend on something that hasn't been proven amen you said well I'm going to depend on myself self is not proven what it's proven to do is to die and to go down to hell but there is a God there is a light that can guide you into eternal life he knows what he's going he's got a place prepared he's been there working on it and when you didn't see him working he was still working well you didn't see him moving he was still moving Hallelujah this God knows what he's doing you can trust Jesus oh yeah he'll not leave you in the darkness he'll not leave you in your sickness he'll not leave you in your trouble but he'll just grab a hold of your hand and say come on child we're going through this thing Hallelujah there is a God who can handle every situation he's battle tested Hallelujah we can just stand the Angels were lights that showed what the word of God was doing today in the city of David and Bethlehem was born Christ the Savior the Angels had the word but the word came by light to God they follow the words of the Angel to eternal light and they found a baby wrapped in swallowing cloth and they had said for you shall see life only comes by light Hallelujah we could go all through the scriptures if I'll bring it down to this last moment the god Dess down through life and you say well we're in a dark place brother Timothy well the God knows where the light is I'm in a dark spot trust the god he knows where the switch is at oh my now you see we're going past tons of stuff but Brandon would talk about it and we went to this store before but in Carlsbad New Mexico was a little girl and a little brother down in a hole looking at some Caverns all of a sudden they shut they're going to shut the lights down he said before it happened he said little brother caught glimpse of the guide standing over there by the switch and he said the lights went off he said how did this boy know what was happening he said because he was watching the guide and it got dark got so dark you couldn't see and the little girl began to scream screamed to the top of her lungs help it's dark little boy put his arm around his little sister and said oh little sister she said what brother don't be scared there's a man here that can turn on the lights It seems impossible how am I going to get out of this situation how am I going to move past where I'm at I can't see my way out I can't see it I'm stumbling what am I going to do brother Timothy let me just put my arm around you this morning let me just put my arm around you say my little sister my little brother don't worry there's a man here oh Hallelujah it ain't brother Joe it ain't brother Aaron hey brother Tim it ain't me there's a man here that man is Christ Jesus he's the God and he's here to turn on the light he knows how to flip the switch or can we say it like this flip the script you can be one moment walking in darkness and walk and next moment walking in light you can be coming this morning with depression and the man flipped the switch and you can walk out Siegen and Shout the Praises of almighty God Hallelujah you can walk out of here with every kind of suicide Spirit lay it upon you and the next moment a flip the switch is flipped it says devil get your hand off of my child and light began to shine and expose him there is a man that can turn on any light he's Jehovah Jireh there's a man the Holy Spirit he can turn on all the lights he is the word a man that can turn on the lights I don't know how you'd do it it's not for me to know how he's going to do it I know that he's going to turn it on Hallelujah well how's it going to turn it from this dark day of Leo to seal into a brand new life into a Rapture into a moment I don't know how but one day the children of Israel woke up slaves and by that evening they were walking out carrying the loads of Egypt and they were walking out shouting the victory I know one day they were standing by the Red Sea and the next moment it was a gap miles wide that they could walk across 5 000 wide I know if he did it there he can do it now Hallelujah I don't know I know one day there was a man that was down in the Lion's Den and the lions were trying but a man flipped a switch and there was light and then lines didn't look at him as a Divine to be divine no more they looked at Daniel as a place of comfort it was um three men that were in a fire and God flipped the switch and the fire that was meant to destroy them they were standing around walking and talking somebody flipped the switch how many's ever stuck their hand or been burnt by fire it hurts we're not talking about a little campfire here we're talking about a consuming fire heated up seven times hotter to try to destroy them and the next thing you know they got their hands in their pockets or they got their hands raised whatever and they're fellowshipping with a Fourth Man there's a man who knows how to flip that switch follow the guide he's got the switch keep your eye on him watch for him he's moving he has sent his Angel before us there is an angel that accompanied the first Exodus there was an angel that accompanied the second Exodus there was a there is an angel that accompanies the Third Exodus and the angel don't quit till his family is safe till the word is fulfilled he's not going somewhere he's Among Us he's walking Among Us he's talking and he says I'm going to go before you keep you how about how many needs to be kept and I'm going to bring you how many needs to be brought to a prepared place I do you know what a prepared place is it's a place prepared so therefore he knows what you like he knows exactly how to please you he knows what satisfies you he knows what makes you happy therefore he has prepared it for your pleasure for your good and he's going to bring you there I love this story because I've seen this somebody told me seen it I don't remember it seemed like I saw it t-shirt said this before but it goes real good right here this old wimpy looking sheep scrawny look like nothing you know he's walking on his back feet as a cartoon so bear with me and he had his whole head is one foot up here his little cloven hoof but it was wrapped around his hand in this hand you looked it was Jesus but over in this ditch with this whole toothless line he's growling it's threatening and his old dorky sheep is
