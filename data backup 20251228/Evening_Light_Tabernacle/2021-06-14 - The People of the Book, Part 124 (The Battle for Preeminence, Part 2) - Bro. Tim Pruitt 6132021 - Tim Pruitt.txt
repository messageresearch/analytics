bring before you today we want to continue to continue to remember all the shut-ins that's not able to come would love to be here the hollis says to i remember the kenny camp that would love to be here as well different ones today got a lot of a lot of surgeries going on seems like this week seemed like this is the week of surgeries but joe adams actually will be having elbow surgery this tuesday brother george hamilton will be having shoulder surgery i believe tomorrow also sister ann mayer brother david mayer's wife will be having to have hip replacement surgery tomorrow and just asking the lord to be merciful on their behalves also brother we want to remember brother ron spencer he's been ministering this weekend just seems to be doing really well but um i actually got to listen to last night's service it's a wonderful service to listen to and god's really using him in a in a mighty way in a personal way he's preaching on praise him in the storm and he said a lot of people can talk about preaching about praising him after a storm or during a storm but there's you know he's able to preach while he's in the storm and just know that jesus is there and taking care of his needs and situations such a message of faith and uh he's we're just looking for some good reports but no matter what the report we believe the lord's report and the lord's report is by his stripes he's healed and so that's what we're holding on to today also sister karen pruitt is not here with us this morning we had to yesterday we had to take her to the er in in in lsu there in shreveport she's just this week been having a lot of issues with being cognized and also with her memory and just a lot of confusion doctors seem to think maybe this has something to do with their medicine so they're trying to get all that figured out and uh i'm just i'm just once again believing in the lord's report we're at right out a year of her having that major brain bleed and major surgery and it was right there at that same time that brother ron spencer had planned to come down and had felt on his heart to come here and to be brave for felt like it was a unction of the holy holy spirit to lead him here and from that time and and those moments there at the lake house the devil tried to block it and uh it was during that time my mom went into the hospital with that severe brain bleed and and he he ended up coming anyway and we spent some wonderful days there in prayer and from that time god has moved on his behalf we saw him move on sister karen's behalf and as we've been preaching he's the author and the finisher and we believe he is the finisher i i don't believe he does anything halfway it's just the devil trying to raise his own ugly head and i'm here to tell you the devil's in trouble this morning amen i had a late night he's in trouble amen brother tim had a late night last night but he's he's the devil's in trouble amen because we've reported here to duty for our duty as believers and we're going to bind together and we're going to bind this devil that's been tormenting her and her mind whether it be through the medication or whatever it is god's greater than anything and we're going to stand on the promises of god he's omnipotent he's greater than any issues he's greater than any circumstances he's greater than anything any of these surgeries that's coming up he's he's in control amen you believe that this morning amen so we're going to come together in prayer as brother johnny if he'd come i just really felt to have you pray this morning amen ask god to move on the behalf of his believers and the situations that we have going on we have a lot of needs but we serve a great god for our needs and he's got the answer now as i've said before brother johnny i'm inviting him to come lead in prayer but let's all pray together take these needs upon your heart as if it was your mother if it was your daddy or if it was your aunt uncle whatever that god i need you to touch these needs how many would have a need you want to make known amen we'll pray for your neighbor that god had come by this way and got a minister got a touch got to speak i believe god has something in store for us this morning even you know last sunday the electricity went out you know it seemed to try to whatever the devil's trying to do everything he can to hinder i mean a tree from all the way on the other side of the road it's the line amen but the devil ain't got enough we're going to praise him anyhow we're going to magnify his name anyhow we're going to glorify his name anyhow we're going to we're going to lift him up out of history because i don't serve a god of history he was a god there in history being the same god today amen we're just asking for him to move and to touch hearts amen let's all pray together for these needs let us bow the heads father in the name of jesus this morning we are gathered here before thy presence thanking you lord god again for another day another opportunity that's been given unto us oh lord god lord we had anticipation o lord god this morning lord standing here oh lord god waiting to heal lord god a word

your name we're just asking for inspiration lord you know the weirdness in our own flesh but we press toward beyond that and we press lord into the realm of the spirit of god where all things are possible to them that believe we send the word from this place out in the realms of the invisible the invisible realms of the of the word of god and the power of the holy spirit we send the word out to those that are sick and needy and we rebuke the adversary and claim the divine promise for every child of god this morning i pray lord you'll loose the bands oh god of sickness often men and women may they know they're free and lord to sin deliver you them all from sin lord you're you're still a wonderful savior do a work of grace in your people lord in their lives as we look to you in jesus name amen amen and amen god bless you turn with me to revelation chapter 12 and verse 7 revelation chapter 12 and verse 7 and while you're just finding your place in the bible i i just wanted to mention today that um you know this past week i i was able to speak for nearly three hours with um on a zoom conference call with about 18 uh different russian-speaking ministers um from russia ukraine i'm not sure uh each each one what country maybe somewhere from lithuania or latvia but anyway they were they all gathered and we had a wonderful time of fellowship with them and ministering to them uh this week and um you know so when we when we think of the the services here it's more than just that what you see here in this building but there are many many that are represented around the world that are actually listening in or will hear this service and we want to bring them into heavenly places amen by by the word of god and by the power of christ i was really touched when one brother introduced himself he is in the ukraine he was he was speaking to me from prison he was uh he's a life in prison for a crime that he did not commit and uh i don't know all his story or whatever but i asked him us because he had kind of organized the meeting and and had requesting that i come and and speak to them and so through his inspiration we kind of they kind of got it together and we men we ministered to them this past thursday and um and so i asked him well how in the world do you know me you're in prison in in um in ukraine and he said um well um i've heard dvds of you in ministers meetings where you spoke and where they translated in into russian and conventions and things like that but said i also get online and i listen to you preach i don't understand english i catch the inspiration from the service amen so you know you think about that you're inspiring a little heart that it's there that's in prison and and you know the devil isn't bigger than god and god has a purpose for everything so if he's in prison for a crime that he didn't even commit god's got him there as and he's got a little group of men there that he's been ministering to and trying to bring the gospel of jesus christ to so you know it's um when you are in service like this there are a host of unseen witnesses everywhere that are part of our service and you know i see a little bright spot in our service today again sister catherine right there and she used to be one of those that were listening in just like that and and receiving um the services and and so on so that you know it ministered to her so she knows what i'm talking about amen and there are thousands of others around the world and you know it's fulfilling the gospel amen that this gospel must be preached into all nations so the end can come so we got a purpose and a place and a plan that god has for us amen revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not and neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives and to the death therefore rejoice your heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down to you having great wrath because he hath knoweth he hath but a short time amen and i'll tell you what his time is even short now the rapture is really soon amen this battle is about to be over god bless you can be seated we're going to focus more on this statement concerning the devil where he says neither was their place found anymore in heaven now we um we're going to be speaking today on the battle for preeminence again i was speaking on this last sunday and got a little little ways into my thought and of course we lost electricity because of a tree falling on a power line some four or five miles away and and uh knocked us out of electricity for a little bit but we persevered and prevailed and went right on and ministered and and the good news is is that you know brother michael dexter he's johnny on the spot so he he just really him and his brother david went to recording some other way and they pieced it all together and got it out there anyhow so you know the devil can't stop us amen we're pressing on amen so today we're we want to as we look at this we i find this really curious where it says that of concerning the devil neither was their place found any more in heaven and and so we want to find out why he is in heaven why is the devil in heaven and whose place is he occupying there because he doesn't have a real place there amen and and then we want to find out how to cast him down from that place now and so we we're we're looking and we're pondering in the scripture of how is it that satan is occupying a place in heaven that is not his rightful place now i know you know a place in heaven represents authority and power and we can see from the beginning of how satan wanted preeminence over what he at what was not his it's just as we see here on the earth right now the the battles that are happening everywhere as you know we are at war and there are wars that are happening everywhere there's a war between right and wrong and good and evil there's a right a war in politics among nations and families even in homes um everywhere i mean i was in the hospital until about um until nearly midnight last night with my wife and and there you know the television is showing on uh on there oh at nothing it was a computer i'm sorry was uh there that was showing um uh just a uh um you know a flag of the gay the gay flag and you know with its uh false rainbow rainbow covenant is is god's covenant it's not the gay covenant god's color is seven theirs is six number of men and they want to change it into something evil and you know make it all inclusive and i i as i watch them you know advertising for the hospital well we want to represent all all uh uh every everybody and and everything well why isn't there a flag flown for um for real marriages and real homes you know why why is it why isn't i mean they're they're having what they call their pride why isn't there a pride in in in truth and reality and what's real and what's holy are you with me but anyway we we we know there's wars that are going on jesus said this end time would be with wars and rumors of wars so there's wars on every on every front satanic attacks and we see even in israel of late they have been uh under real battle and um and we were talking about that how that this contest over jerusalem and as you know every denomination wants to be the jerusalem the place where god puts his name and the claim uh they're the place for heaven and um and again the the battles that have been uh here of late in jerusalem just to recap that for a moment it's been about removing squatters a squatter is a person who unlawfully occupies an uninhabited building or piece of land and so these rights that has been taking place in gaza has been over a supreme court uh ruling where they were going to rule you know to give rights to israelis to legally remove these palestinians from properties that were actually purchased by the jews the jews own title to it they bought it with money and yet there and they bought it from the palestinians but they won't leave the property and so they want to be a squatter on there and and so in 1982 they even signed an agreement accepting jewish ownership of the land while being allowed to live there is protected tenants and but they uh since that time have refused to pay rent and you know they're laying claim to what is not legally theirs and and let me just talk about that for a minute furthermore all the land that the jews owned prior to israel becoming a nation was purchased they paid for it for decades they bought swamps and deserts and they rehabilitated the land this and then the same arabs that sold it to him wanted it back when they saw it to be developed you know and the um the land changes hands by two-way by purchase or through war but the jews have gained this property in jerusalem by buying it and but they can't possess it because of squatters illegally possessing the property and you know people forget that before the jews returned to israel and by the way her name is israel and not palestine it was labeled palestine by the romans but before they returned to israel it was a desolate mainly swamps and deserts they in fact the well-known mark twain um that that we know here in america is a literary figure he visited palestine in 1867 and he said it was a hopeless dreary heartbroken land and this is really important statement to think about what kind of condition it was in for two millennium of abuse two thousand years of abuse there um the land with wind and water erosion as a result in the land being non-productive and so as the jews returned to israel they purchased a lot of this swamp and and desert lands and they lovingly restored the land literally and it became one of the most productive places on the face of the earth if you ever go there you'll see what i'm talking about places that was formerly just swamps and are barren and desert and and it's fulfilling the scripture isaiah 35 and verse 1. the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing and the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it and and the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god so we we actually saw uh witnessed in our day a barren land becoming fruitful uh a desert land blossoming like a robes what was swamps and full of mosquitoes now um it is is productive land and uh so you know we we have seen that but we've also seen neglected and abandoned areas of the word of god that would blossom abundantly too come on now we saw healing that had been neglected promises of healing that had been neglected and abandoned by the church and we've seen it repossessed amen we've seen it blossom and bring forth abundantly miracles among gifts of the spirit and mystery truths of the word that was just stagnant scriptures of murky waters and when the swamp water was drained and the disease bearing mosquitoes the demons of affliction tormented spirits were cast out amen leaving them no habitation and that's what i want for our land this promised land of the word of god i don't want the devils to be able to squat on one promise and say you can't have it that i possess it you you cannot occupy this but we want to be complete total believers in total deliverance and total victory we're not going to accept something less than that but total victory amen now of course it's our land it's been purchased by the blood of jesus christ how many believes that i mean we we've got a title deed to it amen but satan wants to squat on the promise he wants to stand there and possess that and keep you from occupying it and bring all of hell against you but i'm telling you right now it's been purchased by the blood of jesus christ and how dare us to let one purchase parcel of god's word lay there with the devil sitting upon it amen without challenging him and saying you have no right to this promise you have no right to keep the children of god from enjoying the blessing of healing of signs of wonders of deliverance of the power of god you have no right to it [Applause] and i'm here to declare today the devil has no right he has no right to you he has no right to your body he has no right to your soul he has no right to your mind he has no right to the word of god he has no right to your joy he has no right to your peace he has no right to your victory he has no rights the blood has totally paid for it all [Applause] he wants to sit there as a squatter try to hold you off and bluff you sit in the very places and heavenly places that you are designed to dwell in and argue with you over it i'll tell you what it's a time to fight the bible said in verse 3 strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees how many is ready for that strengthen my feeble hands say what my faith has been weak brother tim will strengthen that feeble hand of faith amen increase my faith let's press on to the battle notice he says confirmed of evil knees say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you that's what we see in this battle in revelation 12 michael and his angels fight against the dragon man we're reading here he will come and save you watch what happened he said the eyes of the blind shall be open the ears of the death unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall break waters that waters break out and streams in the desert look at this look at this look what he says the miraculous is going to take place this word is going to bloom it's going to blossom the bright tree will blossom again she's going to bring fruit of the word she's going to bring on her fruit will be every sign every wonder every promise amen the lame belief has a heart the tongues of the dumb shall sing the blind eye shall be opened and the ears of the death shall be unstopped this is not history this is prophecy and i want you to look at it and say this is my god's word to me today amen and the parts ground shall become a pool and the thirsted lands spring of water and and um and in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness and the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the way turned man though fools shall not err their end now remember this is exactly what john the baptist the malachi 4 was to do it was a voice of him crying in the wilderness asked john the baptist don't you realize what we've had this week on june 11th 88 years ago god thundered from heaven saying as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ don't you see what it's done it's made a highway in the desert for our god we have to we are take listen the path has been blazed we can ride right down the highway beautiful highways that have been made for us the valleys of neglected truth have been raised up the mountains of exalted man's ideas have been pulled down a highway has been made for our god and for the people of god to put to press and go right to any divine promise i like what he says in verse 9 no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beasts shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there let's say it like that this morning let's realize the redeemed shall walk here where i'm walking devils ain't got a right to trod where i'm walking amen that ravenous beast cannot be found there where i'm walking where i'm walking in this path in this promised land it is not for the enemy to trot there it's for the redeemed of the lord to go from victory to victory to victory and the ransom of the lord shall the ransom of the lord don't be missed this is the redeemed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads and they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sign shall flee away are you ready for that this morning let the joy then fall amen let sorrow and sadness flee away there's been a highway made but you know what riots work you're right against the police and we defund them please instead of defunding and attacking crime we attack the police the palestinians have learned riot make a bunch of noise threaten send thousands of missiles and you can even make laws ineffective because laws are worthless when authorities are afraid to enforce them are you with me amen exactly right the the path this is what the palestinian and the devil knows when you step on the promise of god all he has to do is make a bunch of noise ride and start throwing missiles because why people will back up whoa yes ours it's our land it's our promise the word of god is ours but that word is worthless when you're afraid to enforce it i want you to look what happened with the with the blm movement it's a homosexual anti-nuclear family movement where they're you know um they're against the nuclear family which is where a father is in the home and it's based on christian principles and you look at their movement what do they learn right burn loot while the police stand helplessly buy not backed up by mayors and governors teaching their people to resist authority and a risk as resist arrest and if you get killed what happens to you if you get killed you get memorials built in your honor you get streets named after you you you get memorials that are and towers that are builds and signs that are put up in your honor and even though your life was a crime-ridden life millions of dollars will be paid to you your family even though you're a career criminal and they learn they learn this and the devil knows too that riot's work just put your foot on a promise to take authority and a preeminence on a promise to er and you'll watch the devil how scream riot he'll deny you possession if he can of the promise with the support of the whole world behind him let me just tell you heaven's supreme court has taken the seals off of the ancient records and it shows plainly that the throne is ours come on somebody help me preach now amen we're talking about satan being dethroned we're seeing him in a heavenly place the day in his it belongs to you the children of god where you stand in authority over every spirit over every enemy but he's there to resist you remember in the church ages and i kind of ended with this note the other day but what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifesting to die the signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost inalienable rights or rights that are unable to be taken away are given away amen you know i mean we we today we want to give away parts of the promise well you know we'll just give away we'll just give away the gifts of the spirit that's that's babyhood what are you talking about that's babyhood how can you plan on having the fuller word of god and some of it's missing how can you claim to be perfectly uh mature and built up in christ and yet some of it doesn't work it is ineffective in your life come on somebody i mean you can't give it away and i'm just going to tell you you cannot give any promise of god away whether it's healing or whether it's deliverance whether it's a gift of the spirit whether it's water baptism in jesus name if it's one god truth or whatever it is it can't be given away come on now amen and it and the devil is unable to take it away from us today what the church had at pentecost is still our inalienable right and cannot be taken away or given away by us as a possessor but when we began moving squatters from the land from our title deed inheritance that's when war begins i want you to know brother branham placed the rapture right here revelation 12 and 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and brother branham ties this to the rapture in the second seal and the fourth seal he tells us clearly that when satan is cast down here in revelation 12 the bride goes up so what you're seeing by the casting down of satan you are also seeing there the ascendant of the bride that's why you're hearing there there when satan is cast down there is rejoicing in heaven why is it is because the the saints have taken their position there and so so again we you know the rapture itself is a battle it's a war you're not on a picnic you're not here for somebody to feed you cheerios and spoon-feed you applesauce you're not babies anymore you're sons and daughters of god you're here to take your inheritance amen it's you know it's time you know where where the churches be got to be diapered and their messes cleaned up and bottle fed that should be over with we should be mature sons and daughters of god now amen now so what in the world was satan doing in heaven how did he get there and whose place did he have there i'd like you to turn with me to ezekiel 28 verse 12 and because he was once the anointed cherub it covered it's perfect in all his way until iniquity was found in him verse 12 says son of man take up a lamentation unto the king of tires now i want to just give you something here he's speaking to a man on the earth but he's addressing the spirit that is in him because the man is in all of this that the bible says it's the spirit that he's talking to remember when he's addressing this king he is addressing the spirit behind it and he said take this lamentation upon the king of paris and say in him thus saith the lord thou sealeth that the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was that covered the sardis the topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and the gold and the workmanship of that tablets and all thy pipes was crea was prepared in the in the day that that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and this is what satan's original position was in the heavens he was a protector of the word brother branham would call him you know god's right-hand man all but a creator and he was there to like all angels are to see that the word is carried out that the word is kept pure angels are messengers and messengers you know can't be a true message and the messenger unless they're telling what the real message was hey man any messenger that has his own message or embellishes or changes it is not a true messenger [Applause] so you see he said thou art the anointed cherub that covet and i have set thee so thou has walked upon the holy mountain of god that was walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in me so now notice again you know there there was this time where where that he was the anointed cherub that covered but then iniquity was found in him going with me to isaiah 14 12. howard thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how could the art thou cut down to the ground which didn't weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my star my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the cloud i will be like the most high how many wants to be like jesus that's not what lucifer wanted he wanted worship i'll be like the most high i'm going to exalt myself this is where it is found fulfilled in 2 thessalonians where he sits in the temple of god worshipped as god are you with me convincing all that he's god but i want you to know where he here's the ultimate end yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit he's got a scheme he's got a plan and he's been working now for thousands of years and he's he's he's got his skills all honed because he's worked against men down through the ages but notice he was cast out of heaven but now we see in revelation 12 verse 9 he's cast out of heaven again but how did he get back into heaven that's the million dollar question he got cast out and he come to the earth walked in eden in the very garden of god but how how was it when he got cast out and that he wound up getting back and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth his angels cast out with him so here in revelation he's in heaven but he's not i want you to notice he's not a garden a guardian cherub with wings spread over the word i mean he is a tormentor he is called a devil that's a tormentor he is accusing the brethren and by accusations and by bluffing you trying to take you and keep you from your rightful position of authority of sinship now you want to ask the question well how did he get back in the heavens after being cast down in the first rebellion because the bible said his tale through the third part of the stars so not only did he fall but his angels fell with him and then we find out here again he gets back into heaven somehow it's kind of a mystery isn't it i mean he's cast out in the beginning and now in the end he's got to be cast out again well how did he get back well you see he had been cast out the heavens and he comes to the earth looking far away back now he is the tree of death in the garden of eden and by his anointing upon the serpent who was a beast that could talk he was not a reptile but his upright creature at the top of the animal world being the most subtle the most shrewd sensible intelligent beast of the field notice he's a beast not a reptile he could reason he could talk amen and the devil using this serpent anointing this serpent this one we're calling the serpent the beast we think of the serpent now a snake that's crawling he was no snake in the tree and man it was it was an upright creature he cursed him and said on your belly you'll you'll crawl the rest of your life what good was it do just curse him if he's already on his belly right he was an upright creature he's standing there he could reason he could talk he could be convinced with cunning words and come to come to eve now notice and and using the serpent he convinces eve that she'll be as wise as god now notice the whole spirit of the devil is for preeminence it's to exalt himself you watch a person always wanting to exalt themselves you watch a preacher always craving the position and exalting you'll see a satanic anointing is what you'll see you see the devil was used in there and and he convinces he that she'll be as wise as god and knowing good and evil well she was already his god she was a daughter of god come on she was adam was made in the image of god and and she already knew the good everything god had ever done was good the whole world when he made it and he said and he finished all his creation he said oh it's very good and she knew evil it was now personified in the tree of knowledge and it was evil that satan offered her to know he got her to doubt her position i want you to catch a key there she was already positioned but he got her to doubt her position to question to question now uh you know that and and wanting to push herself out into an area into a realm that she didn't belong in are you with me now and so he gives her to doubt her position and she fell i mean come on it's like the stars that are in heaven get one of them off its path get one of them moving out of its cycle and what will happen it'll crash into another and crash into another and crash into another and first thing you know the whole universe would be in chaos but god's got every one of them hung in a certain place in a certain orbit are you with me now amen now so again it was it was here that satan offered her knowledge and got her to doubt her position you know trying to bring something that was better than what god said now remember this is exactly where our contest is we have to cast down every high thing that exalts itself against the word of god i don't care if it's a doctor's report we take what god's word said over what the doctor said the doctor he's telling you what he knows as far as what his signs can tell him but he's not the ultimate he's not the final say he's not the authority god is the authority amen there is there is no devil can take your life until god is through with you satan can only go so far he's limited i want you to know you're dealing with a limited devil he does not have supreme power he doesn't have supreme control he's not in control of your situation he's not in control of my home he's not in control of my wife's health he's not in control of me he's not in control of my health he's not in control of the church he's not in control of the bride of jesus christ he is not in control there is a god in heaven and he's the one that's in control hallelujah now adam was not the seed but he was also in the transgression when he took his wife quickly to himself now the discovery of their nakedness learned from the servant calls eve to bring forth from the serpent that knowledge that she learned the discovery of nakedness caused her to bring forth cain who was that wicked one and then through that knowledge she brought to adam and they brought forth abel now in doing this adam's fall decreed that every child of his would be born of sexual birth and and so they would be born of sexual knowledge that was taught to them by the serpent that made them realize they were naked and then every human child born would now be born with sins nature having preeminence and ruling over them and all would be born wrong and would have to be born again and the only way that salvation could come was one we born without sex without the original sin come on and would be born there of the spoken word and when he came forth he was not under the rule and dominion of satan satan had no control over him he said the that that's that satan has come and he had found no place in me he don't have a right to me anymore at all he never did have now so all all of us was born that was in nature having preeminence we would all be born wrong and we would have to be born again and this would cause our fall from immortality to mortality now subjugated and brought under satan's dominion satan as adam rather could no longer rule from the heavenly realms but only through strength and human strength and human intellect and and his abilities could he rule the earth and adam and all of mankind came under satan's lordship but satan is not the true owner of the earth he didn't create it it wasn't created for him he is a squatter on the earth and he's even the squatter on your body your body of this earth come on your earthly body amen in his death and his mortality reigns within our mortal frame now from then on every time the sons of god appears satan appears with him what's this in the book of job turn with me jobs one and six when the sons of god appear satan's right there with him what is he there for accuse him what's what he's he's the accuser he is finding fault as to why job should not be considered a perfect man why he shouldn't have authority so now there's a battle going on god says he's perfect come on amen satan says but i can make him curse you so there is a war that goes on and it winds up in job's body and it depends now on which one job believes as to what wins [Applause] and as long as job is accusing god of his problem and not getting his eyes on who the real problem is then the devil is winning but when job gets his eyes on the redeemer when he gets his eyes on the promise and he says i know my redeemer liver and i know america if it means that i come for that i go through all of this and be purged i will come forth as pure gold all the beating that the devil is going to do to me is going to just beat the impurities out of me like the beaten gold now look there come a day when the sons of god came to present himself and satan came also among them now what right did satan have among the sons of god it was because of the fall then the lord said to satan where comes that where you been and he said from going to and fro and through the earth from walking up and down in it now the earth don't belong to him it wasn't made for him it wasn't created for him he wasn't created for the earth come on somebody the earth belongs to god it's to be the place that he will dwell in the great new jerusalem ahead it's god's dwelling place is that right and he put man to have dominion over it but he never gave the devil that but man did through the fall now notice and so he says i come from going to and fro through the earth walking up and down in it as tormentor he walks to and fro he stirs up stripes and nations he's trying to stirs up strife and family strife in the weather with typhoons and floods and hurricanes and destruction think about this the nature that adam once controlled now controls and dominates his thoughts his plans towards his efforts freezes burns brings torments of famine and destruction all of this happens under satanic lordship over mankind in his earthly home in the book of zechariah we find that when joshua the high priest appears before god and satan is at his right hand to oppose him look at zechariah 3 1. the lord and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him amen so here here again sons of god appeared before god and you would read the book of zechariah he would he would dress and put the fair minor on him put clean garments upon him all these things preparing him for the presence of god right but you see when but when he goes to appear before god satan is there at his right hand to resist him let me tell you you can't pray a prayer without there being war in heaven you cannot start toward a promise without the devil standing there to resist you those of you seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost you can't walk toward that promise without the devil telling you it ain't for you or it ain't real or it won't happen to me that way now let me tell you jesus is no exception as the first one filled with the spirit who the spirit indwells now not just simply anoints but he dwelt him jesus having received his position of sonship when heaven opened i want you to notice heaven open and the atmosphere like a dub of heaven came down in him i want you to get this amen jesus there was told this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased this is the son i love this is my son you see that's what the baptism of the holy ghost is it's not you recognizing god it's god recognizing you when you come to the altar and you accept christ as your savior you're accepting christ but when you get the holy ghost that's christ accepting you that's when he recognizes your faith now jesus having received his position of sonship when heaven opened and was recognized as god's son the tempter comes down accusing now here comes the fight look with me in matthew chapter 4 verse 3 and the tempter came to him look he just been baptized with the holy ghost let me just say this if you're a holy ghost-filled person today god isn't afraid of the devil he isn't afraid of any trial you go through he isn't afraid that you're going to cave in that you're going to throw in the towel and quit he knows you're going to prevail come on somebody amen the matthew there says the chapter came to him and said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread in other words prove it you gotta you know try to prove it to me and the and every time that he comes as a chapter he comes questioning his sonship if you're the son questioning his position here jesus now just now baptized with the holy ghost the spirit comes in and dwells him and the moment that he does here comes lucifer trying to jesus to doubt i'm trying to get something to you when you take a promise of the word of god the devil's going to come with every kind of accusation he's going to tell you you're not a son you're not a daughter you don't belong to god see it might be for some people but it ain't for you you've done blasphemed the holy ghost or has done something and he'll never come to you he'll do everything he can to keep you from the promise he'll throw fear on you doubt on you unbelief he'll cover you in every way that he can and jesus had to fight satan in order to operate as a son from the heavenly realm it was war his position was was questioned the very moment he stood into his position of sonship a man he was questioned because though he was a son of god his dominion only was in recognizing who he was don't let that go over your head because though you're a son of god your dominion only lies and you recognizing who you are i am a blood wash bloodbath son or daughter of the living god and the devil has no right to me he has no right to my home he has no right to my life he has no right to my spiritual walk he has no right to me i am a son of god i don't belong to the devil i belong to god that's who i belong to i was purchased by the blood of jesus and satan has no power over me unless i give it that's right but it's not mine to give away now jesus dominion was only in recognizing who he was and operating as a son of god with power and authority from his position of head of sonship in the heavens now would god's word have preeminence here's the battle with jesus would god's word add preeminence what god said to him or would satan's doubt have preeminence here's the war which one is he going to give preeminence to here's this one coming with his dark depression his evil spirit haunting coming down you could see it in the spiritual realm maybe it was like a dark cloud maybe it was a disfigured figure may i don't know what it was like but here he comes haunting breathing right down on him if you are the son of god if you're really who you say you are if you're really a son prove it but jesus didn't have nothing to prove to the devil and trying to prove to the devil he would have only been doubting his own position are you with me amen so it was with god's word that preeminence or would satan's doubt have reminisce now jesus knowing his authority and his position cast out devils by his authority of sonship taken his position in the word he healed the sick by the authority of his sonship he literally brought heaven's rule to earth let me show you matthew chapter 4 verse 23 jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogue preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manners of sickness and all manner of diseases among the people what was he doing he was bringing heaven down hallelujah heaven's rule began now casting out the devils casting out sickness casting out maniac spirits casting out seven devils of mary magdalene casting out come on healing the sick that's right hallelujah he could so wrong rule in that realm he could call a man that had traveled four days journey from his body back in just a moment's time and raise him up from the dead his name was lazarus are you with me in luke 10 we see that jesus authorized 70 to act by the authority of his position here's what you can do now remember he he said you can act by the authority of my position by acting in my name i'm going to send you out to act in my position luke chapter 10 verse 9 and heal the sick that are therein and say to them the kingdom of god or the rule of god has come nigh to you right when the sick are healed it's a battle in the unseen heavenly in that unseen heavenly realm and it's there when satan falls as a believer takes god's word and conquers look at verse 17 and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them thou i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven can't you can't you get it yes sir he would say yeah i saw it i saw it that they were subject to my name he said i saw the great battle in the spirit realm and i saw every devil that you conquered and i saw it like satan fallen from heaven i saw when you believed in my name and when you proclaimed my name and you took authority i saw the devil had the vow to that and fall from that position and i saw healing take place and i saw deliverance take place i saw miracles take place because satan was cast out behold verse 19 i give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over every power all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding and disrejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven rejoice because this shows your authority in the heavenly places this authority is with me through my name amen now listen this war if you go with me to ephesians 6 10 you'll see what i'm talking about it says finally my brother be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god what is a good world is a armor for if you're not going to fight you're just going to parade that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities is against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places do you know what that word is heavenly places it's exact same greek word is where he says in ephesians 1 and he have made us to sit in heavenly places but i want you to notice here that there is spiritual wickedness in high places or heavenly places amen so he says you're gonna have to fight to have dominion you want dominion over disease you want dominion over sin you want dominion over affliction you're gonna have to fight for it i'm putting a sword in your hand i'm putting a weapon and i'm doing more than that i'm putting a helmet up on you i'm putting a breastplate i'm preparing you from head to toe and i want you to fight and you're going to fight for your position you're going to fight to possess your inheritance oh god just take the enemy and drive him out of our land for us and let me sit back and drink iced tea no he said i i'm going to beat him i'm going to whip the devil but i'm going to use you to do it you're the one you're the one you're the body i'm going to work through i showed you what i would do in my body now i'm showing you what i'm going to do in the bride body take your position you see he says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers against satan himself the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places spiritual wickedness that opposes you as you take your position of sonship wherefore taking you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having all done all to stand what stand don't be a quitter don't run you know what i've done everything i could to stand but keep standing there come on now keep that sword out don't turn and run don't back up from the promise it's god he possessed it with his own blood he paid for it do not let a position that jesus paid for escaping from you it's your promise dress yourself for war do all yours can do to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with the truth having the breastplate of righteousness having your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith whereby we're with you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication of the spirit and watching there too with all perseverance that means not giving up and supplications for all saints amen so what are you doing you're bringing in heaven's atmosphere and the power of faith into the church where all things are possible like i told the brothers from russia the other day if you want healing you got to preach healing you want faith in the church you got to preach faith you want to see miracles you got to preach miracles and whatever it is you gotta preach it remember because faith comes by hearing i hear the word of god [Music] so what are you doing you're bringing heaven's atmosphere that that's exactly why when satan attacked one of our sisters their sister atlanta there immediately when she come down with that cancer i immediately began to preach faith every service faith faith faith faith faith faith what was i doing building her up for victory building the church up to believe for victory amen and that one as well caused another victory and another victory and another victory and we're not through hallelujah we're not thrilled there's more battles to win there's more enemies to be conquered amen the enemy is already a defeated enemy jesus defeated him with calgary hallelujah we know he's the squatter on the land he doesn't have a right to it he does it it's not his possession so what are you doing when you believe you're starting to bring heaven's atmosphere and power of faith into the church where all things are possible you're bringing heaven down to the earth brother branham said this in a wedding supper he said then you say well we'll gather in his name speaking the name of jesus by word is not what he meant so much is the attitude that you're gathered in the environment of the name of jesus when you gather in my name then ask what you will it's the motive that you come in the attitude is the attitude instead of so much calling the name sinners call them that name on the street and curse it and everything else but it's the environment or the surrounding atmosphere that you're in the attitude that you come coming in the name of jesus amen do you realize when you come in the name of jesus are you with me it represents every redemptive work that he done amen the healing that was wrong in calvary the deliverance of salvation everything when you when you call on the name of jesus you are calling on all the redemptive qualities of the name of jesus christ with some mercy's faith he said now you find out those atmospheres when you get whenever where faith is taught in the church you'll find a church in that atmosphere that's right oh god let me get this to you you see it see that's the reason people come among the saints where they're praying and where they're believing paul didn't find any in the city only timothy that was like a precious faith he had you know the rest of him was all denominationless but when he got into that atmosphere you find things coming on that atmosphere was created you find people living by faith when you get into a place where it says my why the bible is true god heals and you walk around their congregation and you find while i was dying with cancer i was healed i was once blind i see and the stranger says my why what do you mean what's the matter with you i'll show you my record come on with me come eat dinner with me i'll show you i got a record up there my neighbors know that i was this kind of condition i was paralyzed for years i was prayed for what is it that word in that church that group of believers has created that atmosphere amen you realize you this morning have the power to bring heaven down amen to create an atmosphere of heavenly places where miracles take place where healing takes place where salvation takes place what joy comes come on don't fuss us at us about our joy and our shouting and our dancing in the spirit heaven came down my goodness if ever never comes down in your soul like that it'll get your methodist foot patterned too and you'll begin to rejoice and get out in the spirit too hallelujah see that word in that church that group of believers has created that atmosphere he speaks about two atmospheres in wisdom versus faith he said how is the word in simplicity yet in its completion ever going to grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that and says it can't be so i want to ask that question i want to ask my brothers around the world how in the world is the word in its simplicity yet in its completion ever gonna grow to a place where where knowledge is overshadowing and that knowledge says it can't be so we're beyond that uh we got the perfect word and because we have the perfect word we no longer have uh the the gifts of the spirit we no longer have the promises that are there you know it it's a it's a minor not a major what have you got to major where's the miner how can you claim to have a perfect word and part of his mission when that which is perfect he's come then just having part is done away with so when we get the prayer when we have the perfect word then having just part of it is done away what was this message to do to bring you the word and his completion so well brother tim you know that's in past you know there was justification sanctification restoration of the gifts and we're beyond that oh you are well where are they well you know but that's all past you see john 14 12 was just for brother branham that's a lie and brother branham refuted that over and over again a demon from hell taught that ministers got under that anointing it's against the word of god the signs follow them that believe john 14 12 is your belief it's your your personal property every one of you come on now amen this is the word when faith is preached from the word brother branham said the children live where knowledge is preached from a seminary the children die and the same thing happened in the garden of eden that's what happened to them two atmospheres there when eve got off the right one on the wrong one she died and it'll do it every time so they cannot say you if your church has got that kind of atmosphere oh child if you want to live you believe the word so when man forsook god's word he died to heaven's atmospheres or it became close to him and he could only operate in earth's atmosphere now an atmosphere of faith now that's what elijah was supposed to do in our day how many knows that elijah was to do what turn our hearts back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers now i don't want pentecost well that's what elijah was to do you missed his message to turn us back to the same faith the same doctrine word by word the same power the same signs the same wonder the same holy ghost come on with the shout of the king in their midst that's what it was to do malachi 4 was to turn your heart back to believing again and when you've got more and more unbelief that's being preached what that's why you're not seeing miracles that's why you're not seeing signs and wonders follow them that believe the signs and wonders will follow the word the bible said jesus went with them everywhere confirming the word with signs following paul said the word that i preached was not preached by the knowledge of man but by by though but the word he said came not when word only but with power and with demonstration that's how the word got brother branham told us you're you're just a teacher if there's no signs that are following if you're a real preacher signs follow a preaching of the word he said we were commanded to go the world and preach it deliver the people bring heaven's atmosphere down bring the holy ghost in the meeting see heaven come down and when heaven comes down nature's change [Applause] the animals get to quarrel and among themselves in eden and a little something coming up you know the lion was a lion the lamb was a lamb and you know here here there all adam did is brought heaven's atmosphere down had a millennium amen come on somebody it'll happen for you you see the atmosphere of faith comes by the elijah message to turn our hearts back to faith again to believing now because of the fall adam's position the heavens of sonship was closed off to man and and lucifer becomes the accuser of the brethren in heaven keeping us from our rightful position this is what brother branham would tell us in the future both the heavens and the earth now is contaminated with devils that can accuse us before god but jesus is there to intercede for us while the accuser keeps pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem the elected that he foresaw but that's why it's so filthy today because your heavens and earth is contaminated with devils every time you move toward god here satan comes to resist you every time you pray every time you reach out come on now when brother branham was there in a in a meeting and there was a man just before he went into the meeting in a very crowded place this is the same place that the blind-eyed uh colored girl received her sight that she he got a a man there stopped him and said if you would just for a moment said come over here to this ambulance and pray for this woman said i've driven her and you know her husband is heartbreaking heartbroken he's he she his wife just died and he said well if she died she went to heaven she's better off than us i got to get this meeting said no please come come come and he said you know and he he he was compelled to go that way he got it that meant some men got him over to the ambulance where the woman was laying and there you know her husband was crying and he was he was just weeping there just saying oh brother oh it's you brother branham well it's too late now i guess my wife was a good woman we sold but all our blackberry jam and stuff to make it to this meeting we took our quilts and sold them and we've tried and we've just tried to serve god with all our hearts and we're trying to make it to the meeting and and i couldn't get her to you brother brandon we you know and brother branham said well let's let's just pray and he took her by the hand and he began to pray with her and he said as he began to pray you know he he he felt like you know there was a little squeeze come to his hand and and he said as he did the devil said to him you just imagined that you see what i'm talking about he's right there to oppose he said but i just kept on praying i just ignored that and i kept on praying and believing god and he said in a little bit he said i felt the cancer stop as i had her by my hand and i said the disease was being felt there by my hand and he said i felt the disease stop i knew the cancer was dead and i got just praying and a moment she licked her lips and she opened her eyes and she said oh is that who are you and he said i'm brother branham and about that time you know her husband began to hear her talk and begin to scream oh mama mommy you're alive and they began to hug one another and he got out the door on the other side and slipped away and that's where he met the blind girl and where she was healed but you know all of that but again the point is the devil said to him you see in the future home he said all the sin that's in the heavens above he's a prince of the power of the air you know the bible said that air is atmospheres and he wards off and keeps off the blessings from god in there comes thunderbolts and lightnings and strikes the earth and everything from the heavens sheets of ice and rain and typhoons and storms and everything else comes from above which is satan the prince of the power of the air but i want to remind you he may be the prince of powers of atmosphere to bring doubt and confusion and try to get you to disbelieve the word but i want you to know my jesus paid for every divine promise there is and the devil has no right to keep resisting you when you take that name of jesus and you press that word to the heart of the enemy i want you to know he is not the one in authority you are the son or daughter of god in authority you are a washed black thought saturday i believe in god you don't belong the devil and you was never originally his you were gods before the foundational world he saw you in his mind he knew who you were he called you to this place hallelujah and he told you when you meet the devil resist the devil and he will flee from you his word tells you what's going to happen if you resist it he's going to pray hallelujah jesus paid for it at calvary he's only a squatter in that position yeah he tricked eve he tricked adam but i'm not born of just sex i've been born again come on by the same word that spoke jesus into existence the bible said we're born again not a corruptible seed but of the word of god that liveth in the body forever hallelujah i'm speaking to people that were true in their second verse they were born out of a birth from the word of god your word born bride [Applause] hallelujah the devil has no claim on your second birth oh man that's the son of god the devil has no authority over you he has no power over you you're a people of dominion you're people that take possession you're a people of an inheritance you're a people of a promise you're the people of the book and the supreme court has opened the book and showed you your name in blood in blood in his own blood he wrote your name in the book of life before the foundation of the world hallelujah oh hallelujah satan you gotta go in the name of jesus you gotta turn god's people loose we are a people of authority we are people who know our god we are people who will do exploits hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah worship him just for a moment give him praises for a moment speak your promise claim your inheritance [Applause] every redemptive promise in this word of god is our inheritance that jesus paid with his own blood and there ain't no devil got a right to any promise of god he hasn't got a right to your healing he hasn't got a right to your children he hasn't got a right to your husband to your wife he hasn't got right to the church of jesus christ he hasn't got it right he's got to take his hands off of god's people you've god's people you've been bought with the blood don't you know who you are and what your position is [Applause] i can speak in a thousand tongues right now hallelujah i hear brother branham taking authority says satan you can't hold them no more they're god's children right now and i'm bringing that before you you have to take your hands off of their life they belong to god now i claim them for him i claim them as trophies of christ's love at calvary and i challenge you in a debate you don't have no legal power you don't have no power over them you didn't have it in the first place you were only bluffing you were only bluffing christ stripped you of everything you had at calgary he stripped every power that you ever have and you're nothing but a bluff and we've called your bluff they're children of god now it's time to call the devil's bluff he's only blessed he has no legal right [Applause] [Music] he says and he says again jesus constantly said fear not fear not i am he that was dead and i am alive forevermore fear not fear not i am with thee always to the end of the world fear not and the christian just keeps sitting back oh i just wonder he said oh my turn it loose amen get all those things away from me and say mr satan you are defeated jesus christ tripped you every power that you had when he died at calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and you can't buff me i'm made of stuff that don't bluff that came from calvary don't love it go receive it just step aside i'm moving on for christ he said you'll see his red light go over the hill where he left that's right god will take care of his own and all things work together for the good of them that loving god hallelujah i hear him say in waters of separation i often wonder what's the matter with the christian church they're so scared of things why you're nothing to be scared of the first word nearly jesus said after the resurrection fear not don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a christian not even death itself can touch the christian he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath every everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life death itself has no more rain over a christian christ died in your stead what faith that ought to build up in the people something at a to the mark you'll never get nothing being a little jellyfish christian no sir you ever see a jellyfish you just hit him he splatters everything and and a jellyfish you don't get what he usually eats from the crabs and things along the seashore just comes up with his pictures and cuts them into and takes him down because a jellyfish just lays there brother we need some christians not jellyfish but with a backbone that's right that is stan i don't mean fuss with people but stand for your god-given rights that christ died for certainly not pushed around we don't have to no sir we got an inheritance and our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited to accept in jesus christ and dying yourself how marvelous yes sir satan said well i tell you what i'm going to do and he says no you're not going to do nothing and he said that's a way to talk back to him hallelujah the devil comes i tell you what i'm going to do and you say no you're not going to do nothing the devil can make his threats come on but he doesn't have the ability to take it through unless you lay down like a jellyfish unless you're spineless and i'm spineless i've never been spineless [Applause] took the promise of god it's mine it's my inheritance hallelujah amen it happened it happened for me even when i was just a young boy and the doctor said i'll give you a 50 chance of keeping your foot you you know you're better off without without it than than to have it like it is this church prayed and we prayed together the doctor came back out with his hands up in the air tears coming down his face and he said praise god son don't you never thank me for this god brought you through this i'll tell you this if god brought me through that he'll bring me through again if i won one battle i'm out to win another it only gave me courage amen the little preacher came with george lickers drove 500 miles with the scripture to give to me just before i went into that surgery and that scripture was the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly hallelujah i've been bruising satan under my feet ever since then because i am a serpent bruiser a devil defeater i am an over color and satan will be crushed his hand will be crushed well i tell you what i'm going to do you ain't gonna do nothing that's the way to talk back to the devil say i know my position in christ and you might as well get away i ain't listening to you anymore i got an inheritance i wonder if there's some people here today that say i ain't listening to him anymore he listened to him and failed but i want you to know devil i got a title deed an abstract that goes all the way back to calvary amen the day of pentecost when he said this promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and even as many as the lord our god shall call an abstract deed clear all the way back to pentecost in case you think i'm making all that up this is what a prophet of god said amen he said how far does it go back how many is it as many as the lord our god shall call if the lord calls you he gives you an abstract title all the way back and the blood of jesus christ is just as good as it had been said 10 minutes ago hallelujah said every believer it's your profession you're just scared to use your rights for what if you go home this evening and you find there you're a respectable man respectable family respectable christian you go home and there's a bunch of big crowded drunks sitting in your house just help themselves to everything in your house lounging on your couch drinking their beers smoking their marijuana and their dope and everything else and you walk out and they've taken it on over your house you walk in there that's what he's done you say you get you go in there and you say what in the world are you doing here and he said well this is a house ain't it well yeah it's a house what's made for humans isn't it yeah well i'm a human being i got a right to be here but you don't have a right to be here i didn't invite you here we don't believe in that kind of carrying on so well i'm not going to get out well there's a law that says he'll get out as long as you can prove it's your house now satan comes along and he says i'm going to take you prematurely that's what he wants to do he's wanting to take brother ron prematurely one takes us to karen prematurely she's only 60 she's not even quite 62 years old yet you know the devil has no business turning her into an old woman like that hobbling around and befuddled and things like that the devil has no right to that i'm telling you he has no right to it we are the children of the most high god and say i'm going to take you prematurely i'm going to do this no you're not how many will say this morning no you're not i'm going to take your children no you're not i'm going to keep you out of the rapture no you're not you're i'm going to keep you from your healing no you're not not today satan there's a different set of ears hallelujah there's a different set of ears that have heard the word of promise and today is not your day it's a bad day for you goliath it's a bad day for you satan but today i'm gonna cut your head off and i'm going to reach and i'm going to grab that head and i'm going to shake it around and i'm going to say this is what we can do with the devil's old sword turn his own words against him we got an attorney sitting in glory he's called the intercessor the lamb not only that we got an fbi agent the holy ghost god's great detective amen just leave the blood there and serve the war on him and watch the holy ghost put him out amen there you are yours whosoever will let him come so well brother tim it ain't even happened yet you know my miracle hadn't even happened yet and then i'll tell you i've been believing god for it how much have you believed have you believed him enough to praise him for it have you believed it enough to go ahead and claim it have you already been believing come on somebody have you been shouting over your inheritance what are you down in the molly grubs about why are you down and depressed about amen you know mary she didn't wait until she felt life she started right then testifying she was gonna have a baby and as soon as god's word sinks in your heart you get up and give a testimony to it and when god takes this holy spirit brings that word to you and makes it alive to you a reality that you're afraid you stand up and you your claimant you don't have to feel nothing see nothing you have to believe hey man oh don't wait on some feeling well i'm waiting on a feeling brother tim i know my cigarette habit's gone don't wait on no feeling go to praising god right now it's gone he conquered it at calvary amen it's gone hallelujah i pronounce it gone in the name of jesus christ if you can take that i prophesy in his name [Applause] you don't have to feel nothing see nothing you have to believe something amen she said she said behold the hands may the lord be unto me according to that word she took his word and started rejoicing she had to testify about it and as soon as a genuine christian faith anchors in a person's heart let them be bound in a wheelchair blind whatever it is they'll tell it i'm healed how do you know you are because jesus said so and i believe it oh i like to throw that in the devil's face huh jesus said so and i believe it i'm turning your lie down come on i've given the word preeminence over this situation and i want to throw it in the devil's face brother brandon said the mayo's a group of doctors surround me said reverend branham you're finished and he said but jesus said i healed you hallelujah i took him at his word and listened to him he said he hates me i know he does oh hallelujah amen he hates me i know that he does how many can say that this morning he hates me i know that he does but christ loves me because he redeemed me and yes i like to push it back at him every time i get a chance he says that daniel daniel you are greatly beloved he says to you katie katie you are greatly beloved and many says to you and to you and to you god so loved you he gave this whole world for you his whole life for you puts it back in the devil's face i am loved of god i'm his child i'm his beloved this is my beloved son that's what he said when the holy ghost came this is a son i love and i'm pleased to dwell in him and there's nothing can separate me from that love preach it back in his face so well i don't feel any better than i ever felt when i come out of there i said oh boy he said if you want to hear me praise god stick around he's leaving the clinic they told him you're finished you'll never get well oh boy he said if you want to hear me praise god stick around you'll you'll hear me you're going to hear me i mean to praise him till death sets me free come on it didn't matter if he went down into death he's going to praise god for that healing anyhow amen i mean to praise him to death so set me free let it be a little big whatever it is he's worthy of all praise and glory i wonder what's happened to the church when they forgot how to praise when the praise of the lord has left the camp what the church is sitting dead is midnight and it's like a morgue everywhere and you can't even find a man out of the people anymore and there's no shouts or no hallelujahs well brother branham talked about that he said i always thought of an old nightingale he said i i would hear it sing oh i'd be coming home from a meeting up in up up in millstown and come home and i hear an old nightingale scene and he said well i began to study about the nightingale and he said i found out if the nightingale can just see a star shining if it gets his eye on the star it'll start singing and he said it might be all dark and gloomy but if just a little cloud moves back where he's not even seeing the whole picture of all the stars shining but just one little star he sat down he said he sees that star and he goes to singing and he said i like it in the church with an old saint will sit down in the service of god and the clouds will begin to move back by the preaching of the word and one little nightingale out there begins to get a glimpse of the promise of god and you hear a hearty amen and a hallelujah and a glory to god he said then i know the sound is still shining somewhere i asked for it last night it didn't come through clear enough jason jackson has in his office a picture brother branham brother branham is coming off the top of the pulpit he's got his leg all the way up top jumped up on the pulpit and been preaching people get an idea brother branham that he was just an old baptist he preached baptist sermons and had baptist experience and had a baptist attitude toward worship he wasn't he said i want to be pentecostal from the top of my head to the soul of my feet come on church amen he said it's a shame that even the pentecostals have got ashamed of the name pentecost we should never get ashamed of our inheritance amen paul was a pentecostal peter was a pentecostal james and john was a pentecostal jesus was the first pentecostal come on now amen and if you ever get the holy ghost you'll be a put pentecostal down in the south a jubilee that sets you free [Applause] [Music] where was i i was telling something amen but you know we got to start pushing the devil back god's been worthy of all the praise the shout of the king is to be in our midst it's got to be brother branham said in in there um in the in the in the message ashamed of him are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience most people in the message don't want one i say shame on you he said are you ashamed of it he said that's being ashamed of him amen it's time that people come back to reality to the power of the living god so we don't do that oh yeah now i know where i was and people get the idea of brother branham oh well you know he worshiped like that by the dem but he only did it in private you know out there in the woods you know he you hear him talk about you know the chatter of the squirrel and the old eagle up there and he was praising god in his universe and he went round and round and round the tree shouting god shouting and praising god he said well you know you could have heard me 40 miles away he said i just having a jubilee out there and he said this old chicken chipmunk got to chattering and he said i i thought what are you afraid of me about what are you chatting about and he got realizing he wasn't chattering him at all he was he was looking at his eye on an eagle sitting up there and he said well god what do you want me to see in that eagle i see you in your universe i see you in your power i've seen you in the storm i've seen you in the cattle and the call of the elk i've heard you in the call of the wolf i see you in creation he said you get enough god inside of you you see god everywhere [Applause] and he said so what do you want me to see about that old eagle and he said i you know he was watching him and the little squirrel was just you know like he said the blue police coach blew a policeman of the of the woods you know with his little captain head on screaming you know and yelling at the eagle and chattering away and he said you know i looked at him and he said i noticed he just kept flexing his wings he just kept flexing his wings kept moving them and he said i i saw that the eagle wasn't afraid you see the eagle's not a charac he's not a coward he's not afraid of anything he's got bravery and he said that's one thing god hates as a coward you remember in gideon's battle he said everybody that's fearful and afraid go home every man when he lined him up for war and the priest said come by he sent him out and he said now you're going to say anybody's afraid go home anybody just married a wife and you you're worried you know about fulfilling that go home if your mind isn't made up to win this battle go home we don't want you in our army god doesn't want cowards god wants men and women of faith [Applause] hallelujah are you with me now amen so in this in this as brother branham was was saying he watched him there and he began to move those wings there he said you see he had faith in the wings that god has given him you know jesus told us that that you worship god in spirit and in truth you know that amen two takes two wings to fly you don't fly nowhere with one wing [Applause] right you want to keep your chickens bound down in a cup you clip one wing you make them out of balance and they just flip around in a in a in a circle right because they can't get over the fence they can't escape into freedom because you clipped a wing amen we've got two wings that god gave us we worship him in spirit and in truth so brother tim we got the truth well where's your spirit so what we got the spirit well where's the word it's got to be balanced come on otherwise you just flop around and around around that's what some do you know they get all spirited they you know they have no life to go with it there's no word that goes with you got over here and you got all word no spirit it takes a balanced approach to worship god you worship him in spirit and in truth he began to see what's that eagle and he said after bid he got tired of the chatter chatter of the old pine squirrel and he said he made one leaf off of that branch and there he said he never dropped his wings anymore he just spread his wing and he caught the current of the moving of the wind and he began to ride upon there and ride upon there and rise upon there until he went way away where he no longer could even hear the chatter of the spine squirrel that would say days of miracles are passed it ain't right you shout like that you can't have that in the message church amen but an eagle of flowers with spirit and truth and elsa are in the heavens where all things are possible to them that believe [Music] and you think oh well that's the way brother branham worshiped you know in the woods but no not in church he practiced an order yet any order that orders the holy spirit out is not god's order in fact of the matter brother branham said you ought to get out of order long enough to get saved people take such a legalistic approach to things they think they're the frozen chosen yeah they're deader than a drier than last year's bird's nest it's been abandoned a long time there ain't been no children even born there shame on the church that there ain't people at an altar calling out to god same on the church that people ain't being baptized in the name of jesus christ shame on the church that there ain't something a witness in their heart that's going out to the highways and byways and compelling them come in shame on the church when the devil isn't cast out shame on the church that ain't seeing people filled with the holy ghost well brother tim we all got the holy ghost then refilled with the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] come on refill one more time let me catch the wind of the spirit move in the spirit where all things are possible you don't know brother branham i happen to be in his meetings too brother branham would stand there in front of a microphone because they had to catch the recording he learned to stand in one spot most of the time because of the recording because the microphone the audience the large audience couldn't hear him but when he was that little when he was that little bunny rooster in jeffersonville before all the recordings he preached from one end of the platform to the other running back and forth he would get so in the spirit that he would even start getting out in the aisles and rolling up his and come to himself rolling up his his trousers walking out there and he said first thing i know i spoke in other tongues and he said and as i did an interpretation came that he is a rock in a weary land and he is a fountain and a shelter in the time of storm hallelujah let me tell you friends that's the spirit of god that moves upon the people amen that's the prophet that i know about that's the holy ghost i'm talking about you see the devil has to recognize the supreme power and authority of jesus christ he said it's not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind the one i represent he has to mind the one who sent me it ain't me but i'll tell you what i've seen demons scream i've locked eyes face to face with them until men were changed freed from the bondage of sin i've stood there and called on the name of jesus christ and even when they resisted we didn't give up until they were delivered why because all authority lasts in the is in the name of jesus and if you have to resist him resist him if you've got to do it one minute do it one minute you have to do it 10 minutes do it 10 minutes but whatever you do you don't give up [Applause] come on amen why the bible said he will flee from you amen he's going to flee from you you're gonna make the devil run i'll tell you what the devil ought to be on the run this morning what church of jesus christ believing we ought to see his red lights go over the hill and say there he's gone he's left from here and one because he's gone people are delivered i'll tell you what why don't you stand up
