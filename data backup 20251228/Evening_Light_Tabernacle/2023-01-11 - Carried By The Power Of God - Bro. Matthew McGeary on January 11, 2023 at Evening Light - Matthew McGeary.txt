created the world faithful and how wonderful we serve a faithful Savior a faithful God who will never leave you he'll never forsake you he knew the need that you would have before you even had it he made a provision for you tonight oh my we're the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth why don't we just approach him Heavenly Father what a great privilege it is to be in your presence gather together with the elect with the redeemed to have our eyes open Lord to be able to see you in the power of your Resurrection Lord living amongst your brine Lord we're thankful that you've ordained this moment in time for us to come together now Lord we're not looking to what a man can do but we're looking to the author and the finisher of our faith Lord that you would just come and move in a supernatural way Lord your word is the same yesterday today and forever you are a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so Lord do what man cannot do and come father and break the bread of life as only you can we love you we submit ourselves to you now asking this in your most precious name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles we'll be reading out of First Peter chapter 1 verse 3. amen we just want to thank brother Tim for the invitation and being able to be in Fellowship and uh if you don't know you'll hold a very special place in my heart and our heart there back with our pastor Brother David McGarry at Christian Life Tabernacle we love each one of you so dearly and brother Tim has just been such a friend not just a friend but a mentor to me and over the years and he's just always made himself available and that means so much to me you're blessed to have such a man of God who stays with the word who believes in the power of the Holy Ghost and the move of the spirit and doesn't waver to the left or to the right I say stay with your pastor he's the order one ordained to take you through amen we're just thankful to be here reading out of First Peter chapter 1 verse 3 through 5. it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and unfiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time amen you may have your seats my I just like that in reading the Scripture it says that it's reserved in heaven for you God has made a reservation for you you have an inheritance that God has already given to you and the problem is a lot of us just don't know it we're just starting to find out about it but you have your name on a seat up there in heaven and there ain't no way for you to miss it I just want I just want to go ahead and say that at the very beginning that God has made a reservation for you in heaven you're going to be sitting at the banqueting table your name is already written down there and there is no way for you to miss it now I know the devil hates that he hates predestination he hates that God by foreknowledge was able to foresee you in this day sitting in that Pew knowing exactly what you were going to wear knowing that all the Wiles of the devil and all of hell would be thrown at you and no matter what the devil could try to do to take you out of the kingdom of God no matter what the devil could try to do to keep you from making it there there's nothing he can do because God has already made a provision for you nothing can stop you from getting there because he's already made reservations look this ain't like reservations you make to a wedding and you tell your friend hey we're going to be there you go ahead and sign up for it and you say hey I'm going to put my name down put down for five me and my family are going to be there and then some complications come up your car breaks down you miss your airplane or something happens and your phone up your friends say hey I'm so sorry I'm not able to make it well I'm so glad that it's not left up to your abilities but this ain't about man's abilities this is about what God has promised it's about what his abilities is and With God all things are possible you have an inheritance come on you have a reservation in heaven and I just want to preach to you a little bit tonight I'm being carried by the power of God all if there was ever a people that were being carried by the power of God it's the pride of Jesus Christ that's being carried by a power you're not being carried by the power of man you're not being carried by your abilities you're not being carried by what somebody said about you your complexes and your inabilities there is a word and there's a promise that has been spoken over your life and you are being carried by the very power of God oh nothing can stop your church I feel like preaching tonight because there is something that is over your life there's been a promise that's been made over your life there's been a power of God that's been looking out over you why do you think you're sitting here tonight come on there's a power of God there's a power of God you you think you think it's your ability you think it's why you made it to the house of God tonight no there is a power that has been keeping you all of your days and not just you what that what what it's one in a million Not only was he looking out over you but he was looking over your mommy and your daddy and your grandpa you he's been looking at it all down through time to make sure you would show up tonight oh my I think God's going to do something special for somebody tonight you are supposed to be here but God worked it all out why because there was a power over your life you didn't think God loved you you didn't think God was thinking about you but everything you've been going through with all of the Demons attacking your mind and they'll only hell try to stop you from getting to the house of God but there is a power Hallelujah that power that's been over your life is right here in the building to change you to make you a meal to fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm talking about being carried by the power of God come on Church there's a power over here tonight there's a promise over your life there's a reservation in heaven for you and there ain't nothing going to stop you there ain't nothing going to stop this Friday Jesus Christ go ahead what kind of promises has God given you there ain't no devil in hell that can stop you from coming to it oh my Hallelujah well we we we're gonna we're gonna preach before we get started the prophet of God would say this now I'm going to say something National Forest will put Israel in her Homeland this is out of recognizing your day and its message National Forest will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward well you want to know where you're going tonight Church you're going upward because there's a power that is forcing you upward you might be trying to turn to the left you might be turned trying to turn to right but there's a power of God over your life that no matter what you do God is going to get you back to where you're supposed to be or you can run for a while you can run for five years or ten years but there's a power of God that has been looking out over your life and is forcing you one way look the devil's wanting to force you down but the power of God is going to force you up the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it and some people are looking for some National Force you know people are looking for a squeeze to come that's Oliver going to send to make us like oh my goodness it's time to be the Bride of Jesus Christ no it ain't going to be National Force it's not going to be coveted it's not going to be some laws and some regulations where we finally realize you know what Aaron I think we should be a son and daughter of God no sir no this is something that this ain't about what the devil is doing this is about what God is doing this is all about what God is doing in the people that God wanted to have a bride he wanted to have Fellowship he wanted to be in a union he wanted to make her bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and life of my life and what power of his power this is about a people that God has elected in the end time to put death under its feet [Applause] the devil's forcing this way the world's forcing one way yeah National Forest forced Israel back in our home and but what did he say no National Force will do it the national forest did Drive Israel to her Homeland the National Force forces of the council the churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen so it's the power of God that's going to raise the bride into glory and out of it so it's the very power of God that's keeping you it's guarding you it's protecting you it's transforming you into the very image of Jesus Christ it's that power that's raising you into Glory you're being carried by the power of God so it's time to open up the Bible and look at your inheritance and feed on the message of the hour and realize that all of these things that have been spoken it's concerning your your inheritance this is for you quick quit putting it off on somebody else this is all about you and it's time to take ownership yes it's all about you God set this whole thing up and all by Design and and he allowed it to come all the way down to the church ages that you would catch the revelation of Who You Are and while you are here and where you are going there's been a word that has been spoken concerning you a promise a description of something that God had in his mind concerning you and he had that thought and God's thoughts are eternal and then he that thought that he had of you you know the word the word is a seed and he planted that seed and now here you are you you you're coming into hearing the word and you're starting to wrestle him well I think it's something inside of me wants it but I don't think I can have it I look at my passion I look at all these things well that that's because you're looking at all the baggage you're looking at your flesh you're looking at all your faults and your failures but God is looking at a promise he's looking at his word you know there was a perfect image a perfect picture before you before a man ever fell into sin you were with God you were in God you were part of God you were his thinking you are his word so I I just wanna this might seem like I'm grabbing a a portion of a quote out of nowhere but this is pertaining to you because the prophet of God would say in the church age book he's saying in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she mirrors him well I got news for you Church we're nearing him he's here the Capstone has come he's crying Grace Grace this is a message of Grace we have received Christ the word he's come to his bride we're nearing the Capstone we're nearing The Headstone so I don't care wherever you you want to put it we're nearing him so then he says as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation listen to this now they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can't produce this wrong seed but they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God now that sounds like a challenge that sounds like something that my goodness if I can get all of my ducks in a row that my I can be this super race and if I if I can just study out the message and and I can just kind of go through through Christ The Mystery of God revealed and in the rising of the Sun and if I can just line all of these things out doctrinally and if and if I can try to execute a good works and an ability to to recite that's not what this is all about this is not about what you can do and your ability to digest the message of the hour and give a book report to your pastor no this is god making a promise this is god making a declaration that I'm going to have a pride she's going to be a super race she's going to be just like me she's going to be in my very image this is about something that God has promised this isn't a challenge this isn't a request this is a prophet he's saying I'm going to have a bride and here she is get a good look at it here she sits right here tonight a super race a super people more than conquerors more than Overcomers in Jesus Christ because you've been United to the bridegroom it's time for us to quit uh uh uh wondering who we are wondering if it's for us wonder if if we can really even be all of that the prophet spoke yes you can because there's a power that will carry you into every promise that God has made if God said he would have a bride without spot and without wrinkle then there that that's not something that you are going to do but that's a power of God that he is sent out into the pride of Jesus Christ to produce what he said he said he'd have a bride and here she is get it out of your mind quick quick quit wondering if I am the bride if I can do it oh we have these mind battles over and over and I know you got prayed for and I know you've been overcoming and I know you fell again well just repent get back up keep going on with God because you ain't gonna stop the word of God the devil's not going to stop the word of God nothing's going to stop the word of God so your minds will just be what God made you you are an overcomer you are the Victorious bride of Jesus Christ you can do all things because God has given you a faith to believe all things glory to God I feel pretty good there's a people that are on the face of the Earth that has been given a faith a perfect Faith to believe a perfect word that all things are possible come on church all things are possible to them that believe [Applause] that's a promise oh Hallelujah and the Very one that made the promise denomination wants to put them off at the the pie in the sky put them in the future put him in the past but this very one who made the promise by the authority of scripture is right here right now right here right now do we believe it whether you believe it or not he's here and I want to say if he's here we might as well be like the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment say I might have been serving God a long time 10 15 years but no maybe the words coming to you in such Simplicity what would it take would it take for him to be wearing a robe and wearing sandals would it take a picture of two thousand years ago and you having to see the very physical image of Jesus Christ walking down the aisle is that what it's going to take to put you into action Church is it going to take some work up is it going to take the minister or is it going to be a revelation that breaks out in your heart and all of a sudden you realize you know what I believe the word that I'm hearing that Jesus Christ is right now he's in the building he's walking down the aisle and I say why don't you open up your heart and receive it why didn't you say Lord I believe your word and I believe that all things are possible I believe him for this need in my life Lord and I believe that you've come here on a Wednesday night to bring forth the manifestation of your promise because there's a power that's been over in my life something that's been keeping me something's been keeping my mind something that's been keeping me around and Lord now and I know that you showed up too and I know you've come to do business come on Church Jesus Christ is here to do business did you come to do business then I ask you what are you happy why don't you reach up and claim it why don't you reach out and touch the hymn of his garden why did you cry I said oh God why don't you be my blind by the man say oh God lord here I am here I am oh God come my way tonight speak to my heart speak to Marty I don't care how many camps how many Sundays how many meetings we need more of God we need more of God tonight than I say oh let this be the night let there be new Parish Let There Be healings let there be manifestations let there be great Powers sweep through the Church of the Living God not the spiritual gifts also overwhelm us that we might see the purifier oh we got by Divine promise the pillar of fire is here right now if Paul can't believe all things are possible Hallelujah what about a church this is where things happen Paul said in First Corinthians 2 4 maybe if you turn there First Corinthians 2 4 and 5. and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power well I'll tell you what we got a lot of speech and a lot of preaching that are enticing words of man's wisdoms quotes all weave together to support their ideas and their stand and their questions and they want to be the source of all a revelation and inspiration and be able to line out everybody and then come on man let's look at your church let's look at your life where's the power of God where's the new birth where's the signs where's the Miracles and you're you're going to be the Fountain of all knowledge well I'm sorry maybe that's a little hobby horse of mine but I want to see something real you know when it says demonstration that means manifestation then what you're talking about Paul's saying look I know what I'm talking about I didn't come just just to just to give you a fancy sermon but I come to preach a gospel and I know the reality of that gospel because that reality is now in operation in my life it's an operation that I'm preaching the gospel and those people that are hearing the word that's being preached these signs are following them that believe if you go into all the world and you preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe well if what you're preaching and they're believing it and nothing's following then I think we got a problem in the formula well I don't know why we're over here but we'll just keep preaching and my speech and my preacher was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration or manifestation of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and the prophet of God would say it like this in the fourth seal he would say the word itself is Spirit it is Spirit in word form and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts well if you if you need a further definition of that just go open and open up your Bible and read the book of Acts the word itself is Spirit it is Spirit in word form and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts I want to say if we preach the word because it's the spirit of the word if we preach the word we'll get word results if you want the power of God in operation preach the power of God don't just preach a portion of the word preach the fullness of the word we got a lot of people that are preaching a portion of the word that's why they get portion results oh but when you can get a church whose body in is sold out and it's caught the revelation of the message and that preaching an open book If You Preach an open book you get a result of the book you get Acts 2 38 you get signs and you get Miracles falling you get the power of God sweeping through the church why because the fullness of the word is being preached oh and that's the only thing the bride wants to feed on give me all of the word I don't want just a portion of the word I want all the words I want it all I want the tongues I want the dancing I want the preaching I want the prophesying I want the interpretation I Want It All give it all to me it's in there it's my an inheritance and if it's my inheritance there's a power come on there is a power to make you get your inheritance there's a power here tonight that will bring you into going home if you can just believe and say oh God here I am I want what you have for me Hallelujah you're kept by the power of God Jesus said the words that I speak they are Spirit and they are life prophet of God would say this he would say brother a real born-again man or woman can't stand still there is something in them they've got to testify they've got to do something they are bound to do something they can't hold their peace I could give personal testimony oh if you know what it's like to be under the burden of sin if you know what it's like to be under the Taskmaster of the devil don't let devil play tricks with your mind you can grow up on a message Pew and never gone out in the world and be in the same condition but when you meet him oh I'm telling you ain't nothing like it let's save yourself some heartache save yourself from trouble bypass all the drugs and alcohol and the running around and the money and the women just bypass it all because none of that can come even close to what God has for you because I've been out there I tried it I ran around I I said it'll take you further than you want to go and that void and that hunger that was inside of me no matter how much I tried and no matter how long I went and no longer how how much that little voice would tell me with just a little bit more just a little bit longer I realized that I was in bondage I wasn't happy there was no peace and I realized I was coming to a place my if I can't get away from this if I can't get out from underneath this it's going to take my very life and I remember being in a place and something inside of me cried out and said oh God whatever this is it's bigger than me and I need your help and oh Hallelujah there was a power of God that had been hanging over my life God was just waiting say the word son say the word son I have an inheritance for you say the word and when I looked up to heaven and I said oh God this is bigger than me I need your help and all of a sudden there's a power that jumped down from heaven and said you are my son I've been watching out over your life I've been keeping you you're oh my son I am here for you oh Hallelujah is there somebody here that wants to say oh God I Surrender tonight I realize that I want more of you and there is more of you for me May the power of God come down into your heart may have come down into your soul may have changed you may I make you a new creature you have been carried by the power of God [Applause] yeah when I was out in the world I thought I was somebody I thought I'd tricked the cops I thought I maneuvered out of this car wreck I thought I had I had done this guy over and I got away from all these things man and my goodness I just had it all figured out yeah and then my blind eyes got opened and I got delivered and I realized it's been the grace of God all my life it's been the grace of God there's been a power this car that car that drug this situation all the way down something was keeping me something was protecting me there was a power of God over my life because there was a word that had been spoken concerning me I had to manifest the spoken word of God and no matter how many Devils no matter how many cigarettes no matter how many times I fail no matter how many pornography demons no matter how much depression I know no matter how much suicide no matter how much the devil could throw your way there is nothing that could stop the spoken word of God coming to manifestation in you and your body and there's been a power over you that has been keeping you to the day of the manifestation of the spoken word of God oh praise the wonderful name there's a power here it's been keeping you it's been over your life it's been watching out for Jackson why are you here tonight the power of God sister Landon why are you here today the power of God Derek why are you here today it's the power of God young people in the most wicked age the world has ever seen why are you here tonight it is the power of almighty God that is keeping you it's carrying you it's going to take you into a body change oh watch out Debbie when Jesus Christ is around two Devils are on the Run they always are I'm talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm talking to the word made flesh I might as well be preaching to God oh that sounds like blasphemy brother Matthew well if you're his seed if you're his offspring you can't be any League unless but him it's worth coming to word this time we own it I think it's shocking how we can own up to everything when we're out in the world [Applause] we can own up to all these mistakes we can own up to all these failures but really you can't because the blood of Jesus Christ took it you can't even own up to that anymore bring that one before Lord forgive me for are you what are you talking about nailed to the cross Lord Jesus I failed again nope you pled the blood nailed to the cross have we gotten so message five that we don't even preach the cross anymore where do you think the power came from Hallelujah because Jesus Christ took your place [Applause] a kinsman redeemer took your place because that holy God hallelujah that holy God could not dwell in a mortal body so he took sin upon his own flesh this is the fullness of redemption he's redeeming us back and he said I'll pay the penalty of sin so there I was in that condition how we ever got over here praise His name I said oh God whatever this is it's bigger than me and I need your help power of God came started to transform me and by his grace for me I say by his grace and I believe it can be for every single one of them it wasn't some drawn-out process I repented of my sins I called on the name of the Lord and he come in just a matter of minutes and transformed me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey I I I'm thankful that I can stand in in front of a pastor who knows I know what I'm talking about he saw the old me he saw the old life he saw what I was capable out there in the flesh but Hallelujah he could also testify of what a God of Mercy a god of compassion a god of Grace or a god of Mercy come on there ain't nothing you can do to spurn the grace of God but reject it why don't you receive the grace of God tonight quit owning up to all those things and say oh God thanks for taking my sin thanks for nailing them to Calvary that power that I thought back through all my life I realized oh my goodness I wasn't some guy who maneuvering my way out of this deal and that deal and save myself from this wreck there was a power over in my life that had been keeping me because there was a word that had to come into manifestation in my life what did Paul say the words that I speak to you they're not enticing words of man's Wisdom but he came in power and demonstration to manifest the very word that he was preaching this ain't psychology this ain't a 12-step program is saying I I think I can work it out let me go sit down with the counselor I think some of our churches need to just need to get back to Jesus's first Doctrine you must be born again why don't we just start there why don't we have a 10-week course on just get born again can we do that just just get born again just get the Holy Ghost matter of fact I think we started off the new year you must be born again and if God tarries we're going to keep it all the way until the end of the year you must be born again it doesn't stop [Applause] you want to know how to how to live an overcoming life be born again you want to know how to overcome all the Lush devils and everything that's in the world that's that's going after you be born again Acts 2 38. praised a I wanna it works it works can you believe it brother it works the word of God works repent of your sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive power from on high it'll change your thinking it'll change the way you dress it'll change the way you act you'll become a new creature all things will pass away all things I said all things will become new what is it it's the power of the Holy Ghost in your life Hallelujah hey I love the word I'm a product of it I can't help it it's everything I am and everything I could hope to be perfect Faith the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we are told close to the end now and I believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things rub out some of this make-believe out yep there it is that's right prophet rub out all that make believe see and get into something real a lot of people don't like something real because you can't argue with it see it's got to be something that you know and if you say brother Branham that isn't light yet you know it's like how do you know it's like I'm looking at it well how do you know that you couldn't be wrong my sight has always declared to me that it was like see and it's the reason I believe those Vision because it's always been declared to me to be the truth because it comes from the word see then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be that's what Christ the word is wanting to tell the Bride of Jesus Christ there's no more guesswork there's no more guesswork you are my bride I have come for you I have sent a message to call you out from all of the nonsense and I am here right now with the transforming power to bring you into everything that I ever promised you and no fault and no failure and no complex and no disease and no sickness and no bad attitudes and nothing that you've ever done and no devil and no neighbor and no family no school nothing out there is ever going to stop you from becoming when I told you that you're going to be just keep walking just keep believing just keep trusting just keep going on and on and as you go on and on you can't ever beat your type Church you're just like Enoch just keep walking one foot in front of the other get back up and one day one step after another step you're going to be gone [Applause] it's gonna happen with everything that's in me church it's going to happen and I believe I'm looking at the group of people hallelujah that will be able to sit back and say oh death oh great where is your Victory oh death where is your sting and you'll look around and all of a sudden your your hands are going to change you'll see your loved one come through the door and all of a sudden you'll go and say brother Aaron it's hard brother Tim it's all just keep going church because there's a power that is carrying you right into the manifestation of that prophecy I believe it [Applause] then if he says it that settles it when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork now we're talking about revelation if you can pray for anything church pray for revelation because when it's revealed to you like that when it's revealed to you like that how many people in here can I talk out of that this is a piano can I talk you out of anybody is there a chance now maybe if I started to get some people maybe if I got some fine orator well actually this isn't a piano it was in the 1400s they actually changed my name from p a no to piano and it's really not a piano it's a piano oh so you've been calling it wrong all your life this really and all of a sudden some guy would give you some intellectual understanding and you're like oh man I've been wrong all my life I feel like that's how easy it is for the devil to talk you off of your promise he just mixes a little past remixes a little attitude mixes a little look from one of the young people and all of a sudden everything that's been swollen in your head yeah it all adds up I'm not supposed to be here I knew it I'm not bride but when it's revealed to you like that there's no more guesswork then it doesn't matter how many people how many churches how many people say this no matter even how many times you fail there's something in you that knows Beyond of a shadow of a doubt that I am the Bride of Jesus Christ and you come to a place like Peterson will you go also where else am I going to go Lord tell me you got something better for me you're going to walk away from this message and then what do you what are you going to give me in place I just want to ask you maybe I should maybe we'll do some math real quick or something but I was in sin I was in bondage I had no hope at all I was going to be in prison probably for a very long time I was in addictions and drugs the power of God by promise got a hold of my life because there was a power over me transformed and changed my life and as I listened to the message of the hour I started to realize who I really was in Christ started to reveal to me precious promises cleaned my life up gave me the Holy Ghost now I have the spirit of Christ and you talk about a liberty I don't need anything out there in the world I don't need no social media I didn't don't need no TVs I don't need no drugs I don't need no alcohol I don't need need anything that the world has to offer me to be happy I have joy unspeakable and full of Glory all the time God blessed me with a business he best blessed me with a Godly wife blessed me with a family with a good church with a good family with friends and family all over the world I mean a family that really loves you not use you and abuse you and just if you do something for me I'll do something for you but a true genuine love for you a family all around the world that has my best interest in mind and not only that I got a reservation in heaven for me with my name at the table you got something better tell me if anybody you gonna know there ain't nothing out there any better than what God has prophesied and spoken for the pride of Jesus Christ and it's only yours and oh Hallelujah there's been a power over your life to make sure you come to the Revelation that it's all yours I think it's time we just start thanking God and praising him for his blessings and for his grace and thank you o God for salvation Thank You For Joy thank you for my health thank you for my church thank you for my family thank you for the cross thank me for the message thank you for my friends thank you for this church thank you for my clothes thank you for my shoes thank you oh God for my house for my family thank you oh God for everything you do all things well oh praise His wonderful in the end give him glory give them praise thank you Jesus you're worthy you're worthy praise you're worthy of my Adoration of God you're worthy of Our Lives How We Worship You Lord we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise Hallelujah oh if you only knew where I was that really took me from didn't even understand why I'm crazy did you understand why I worship him like I do then you understand why I praise him because I know what I was but I know what he made me and I know where he's taken me Hallelujah praise the Lord why did she give them gold [Music] hallelujah hallelujah revelation is there some people in the house of God that got some revelation I know who I am the body Jesus Christ I know I got reservations in heaven oh Hallelujah now we're talking about power when you know who you are when you recognize what you're a part of you know there's power in that [Applause] you don't know who you are and what you're a part of can you imagine not knowing who your husband is you never asked for anything it reminds me of that story I don't know if I can tell it but there was a story about a a king that was all these people yeah I believe maybe we all heard it hey they're all coming through and asking for all these little things give me some chickens and give me some of this and give me some of that and make this or that right and finally this guy comes through and says hey well what would you like you know I would like a 5 000 acres of land I'd like a dowry for all of my kids pay for their education I like you to pay for off all of my debt I'd like a four horses and and 100 auctions and all these things and it gets done making all these requests you know and he says granted and and his right hand man was looking at him as he walked off said Lord King why in the world all these other people just came for and asked for you for reasonable things that that were not too hard for you to give and here this guy came and asked for all of these big things and you gave it to him why would you do that he looked over at him and said well because finally somebody asked me for something that only a king would give well I think I might just be dumb enough to know that I serve the god of Heaven who owes a cattle on a thousand hills I think I just start asking them I'll ask them for the Holy Ghost I'll ask them for prodigal son I'll ask him for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll ask him for signs and wonders I'll ask him for people to be filled with the Holy Ghost I'll ask him for a four-year-old and five-year-olds to get born again I'm gonna ask for it all why because only a king to give what I'm asking for and there is a power here to enforce the word of God why don't you start asking for your particle songs for your political daughters for all of those loved ones that you've got out there if you need healing in your body there's a power here to bring forth the word of God in an atmosphere like this with Jesus Christ walking up and down the aisle why don't you reach out and say oh God here I am I receive you o God hallelujah praise His wonderful man praise this wonderful name hoping to possible don't let this moment pass you by this is the supernatural this is the power this is what's carrying you to your bridegroom [Applause] why don't why he's near why don't you ask for that big thing you've been praying about matter of fact while the power's there why don't you speak it out and let them hear it all right the word is 90. even in the heart and where else in your mouth it's time to take what's in the heart if your heart has been restored take the restored word of God and put it on your lips and start speaking start speaking the word of God and watch that word materialize why because this is the hour of the manifestations of Sons and Daughters of God that can speak the word why because you've been restored back before the fall what are you saying by the way we've been restored back before sin [Applause] why because my God is a kinsman redeemer redeeming you back to where did he take you back to back to where it all started back before man ever messed anything up that's where he's taken us back to we're just waiting for this body to catch up but even now you are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus your soul always already been raptured in Christ Jesus I'm just waiting for this body to catch up hurry up your bag of bones why do you think it's such a struggle why do you think it's such a struggle to get to church why do you think it's such a struggle on a daily huh because this ain't Who You Are some of the most basic things we forget it won't take me long because I want to let you know this might surprise some people my worst enemy is here I'm sorry I hope that might be shocking I'm gonna make a little bit more shocking and he's he's not down there yes he's on the platform yeah yeah now some people are doing math it's not him so there's only two of them I'm confused I Am My Own Worst Enemy and when you've been born again and you've been filled with the Holy Ghost the old nature that old husband that's dead and that's died that's why why Paul said I Die daily because there's an old nature that's following you around and it's wanting to take back the place of influence in your life it's trying to point to your past or trying to point to things that remind you or when you drive down this block or you go down there all of a sudden that feeling and that emotion comes back over you and you feel like you'll never be able to escape it and you feel like it's following you all of your life that's an old nature that's trying to take you back into the life that you come out of that's not who you are that's not your identification your identification is the word of God so it's in those times and in those moments you got to do battle with the devil and with that old selfie you say no I ain't giving in this time you got me last time you got me ten times 20 times a million times in a row but you know what I'm finally sick and tired of it that is not who I am and I'm going to call on the god of Heaven the king of Heaven who I have an inheritance from and knowing that there's a power over my life and I'm going to defeat this devil once and for all it's time Church it's time we start being what God has made us to be he goes on to say then if he says it that settles it when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it thus saith the Lord because it's beyond human thinking it's up into the Realms of the Lord's thinking let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God yes let that mind let that mind be in you matter of fact once again that's not a that's not a request he's saying I am going to have a bride of Jesus Christ with the very mind that he had that thought about robbery to be equal with God because they are my very attributes that are being manifested by very seed word that's being manifested so we're up in the Lord's thinking we want to go beyond make-believing going Beyond impersonations go beyond secondhand Revelation moving past all of these things we want to be living where it's the spirit and the word and the power of God is moving in our lives and that's the very thing that's in our influence that's the very thing that's making us real sons and daughters of God we'll work towards a close quickly how many is happy to be in the house of God by his grace will just try to end along these lines something that was on my heart is speaking about the power of God we know that uh we'll just move through this quickly so we can get to a close but we know as the prophet of God would start to minister uh the Seven Seals and he would talk about the horse rider and he'd talk about powers that would go out and and he would he would identify the horse riders the White Horse Rider red black and pale horse rider and he would show how that a beast represents power and he'd start to talk about how in Daniel when he saw a vision or a dream and you see the bear and the goat and a lion with teeth you'd show that that all represents a power but he said whenever the Antichrist Spirit would ride out as a power God would send another power to combat that right so when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God would raise up a standard to combat that Antichrist spirit so you would see in the Bible these symbols or this power going forth but God always had a power to combat the Antichrist Spirits are just in the Realms of speaking of these symbols and Powers he's showing how that it would represent Nations and it would represent uh uh the powers of the Antichrist and he would say this in the fifth seal he'd say it also represents a holy power too Beast did you know that Rebecca uh when the servant of Abraham Elisha when he came to get Rebecca he mounted her upon a camel the very camel she watered as she rode this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing that she watered when the thing that took her to her future home and husband it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom the very power look at that church the very power that was carrying Rebecca look it came to a place where she had heard the the message she and Eliza came and said look this is the message I I want to go ahead and take you to meet your your bridegroom but then then Rebecca had to get up on a pond that Camel which the prophet of God saying which represented a power she had to get on that power and it was going to be that power that was going to carry her to her bridegroom and he says it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom oh I'm so thankful that there is a spirit of God there is a power that has been poured out upon the Bride of Jesus Christ that has combated that Antichrist spirit and it's exposed him for who he was and all of those things and now it's revealing to the Bride of Jesus Christ who she is in the word and the spirit is the very power that is now packing you into the presence of God I don't want to get off of that Camel I don't want to come out from underneath that power I want that power of God oh just wash over my life oh God just take me apprehend me Lord take me to my bridegroom take me to my body change there's a power that I know that is carrying me into another dimension for we know the scripture would say like this in Ephesians 6 12 it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers and rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so now we see the effects of the world I mean I don't know if you got to go too far if you need any help go to Walmart be a good start if you dare go to the mall fellowship with the brother is telling them about when I go to the mall how tired I am he's like yeah I wonder why that is I'm like well it's because the spiritual warfare he's like I never thought about that I'm like yeah you're doing battle up in that place man go go look go you go around you go to the ball you go to these places and you see everywhere there is a power so I just maybe for a quick moment we will just look at the negative real quick and by the help of God we'll turn it right back around and come to a close foreign but we know in Isaiah 60 he would talk about a gross Darkness upon the people and Jesus would say this in Mark 13 20 except except the Lord had shortened those days no flesh would be saved and I always wondered about that how would that come how could it get so bad that no flesh what would that look like we are seeing that and so I just want to read this quote the voice of the sign he says God will build his church upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and that's the Bible outside of that all other ground is sinking Sands God doesn't change his nature doesn't change he made women different from men and men different from women he dressed them different he wants them to stay that way see women wants to look like men and men wants to look like women oh my such perversion and the whole thing looked like it's got a grip on the people and you can't change it looks like a great monster a great blackness if you understand what I'm speaking of in the spirit a monster has grabbed them a monster has got them grabbed they just can't get away from it too much Hollywood too much television too much other nonsense everything we got is polluted no wonder if the work isn't cut short for the elected's sake there will be no flesh saved a monster has got them grabbed what are you talking about prophet what do you mean a monster has got the people grabbed and they can't get away from it well I think I'm starting to see what the prophet was talking about where I read in the news the other day a 10 year old shot his mom because she wouldn't buy him a video game what would make a 10 year old do that a monster a gross darkness that has pressed into the people and has grabbed them too much nonsense too much Hollywood too much television no it doesn't stop there I've noticed a pattern he used to be 14 12. 11. now 10. and now I look in the news and a six-year-old took a gun to school and shot their teacher and I started to say oh Lord now I see I I see the gross Darkness a monster has got them grabbed and if the days weren't shortened for the election no flesh would get saved but then I started to get encouraged I started to think if a monster of Darkness can grab a 10 year old [Music] [Applause] if a monster of Darkness couldn't grab a six-year-old I got to think and there's a power there's another Power outside of brightness there's the power of my dog and if the devil can grab a 10 year old if he can grab a six-year-old then my God can grab a four-year-old a five-year-old a six-year-old and fill him with the Holy Ghost come on young people where are you at I'm ready for the power of God to thank young children like this and fill it with the Holy ghosts all preachers that's too young duh I don't

youngest to the baby in your womb maybe it hasn't leaked yet many of us Hilton in the name of Jesus Christ for the power of all of us may our babies start kicking in the woods wow I serve a God that's

hills if thou cast believe all things are possible oh praise is wonderful I'm looking for I'm an expectation I'm looking for him now my eyes have been open four-year-old five-year-old if a monster is dropping the world then I serve a God that's so powerful so wonderful that is just like taking our young ones and filling them with the Holy Ghost believe it Church it's coming it's coming it's coming

have the Holy Ghost and don't know nothing about it you don't know nothing about it but something in your heart is telling you that you want it now listen to who the prophet of God you say oh it's never for me it's never going to be for me I can never do it I've done all these things Listen to Who the messenger of the age is speaking to somebody without the Holy Ghost and doesn't know anything about it well I was a good candidate one day I didn't know anything about it and I didn't have it so maybe God's talking to somebody right now don't escape this moment you don't have the Holy Ghost and you don't know nothing about it but something in your heart is telling you you want it that's eternal life that's your inheritance you mean I don't have the Holy Ghost and I don't know nothing about it but since there's something in my heart that wants it regardless of how bad I've been and how far that sin has taken me but just because something inside of me says I want it I I don't I look at my past I look at my life but hear the voice of God is saying you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't know anything about it but oh there's something inside of you what is it there's been a power of God that's been looking out over your life that has carried you to this service tonight and now he's telling you it doesn't matter if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't know nothing about it it doesn't matter how far sin is taking you but it's something in your heart is saying you want God God is here to open the floodgates of Heaven to you that is your inheritance that's eternal life calling to you oh praise this wonderful name he said Hallelujah he said that's eternal life that's your inheritance [Music] I got the quote right here praise the Lord he said stay right there and look

anything about it well why is that brother Tim because you're a son of God the new birth doesn't make you a son [Applause] you always were a son or a daughter therefore you can be reborn so even
