Also, brother Jason Tagger asked us to remember uh Alyssa, not [music] home or she's home, not feeling well today, needs a touch in her body as well. So, if you have a [music] need you want to lift to the Lord, we'll ask Brother Joe Adams if you'd open the service for us in prayer. Amen. Before he uh comes, just also wanted to remember brother Timothy [music] this morning. He's away preaching in Arkansas. Amen. Just ask [music] that the Lord would move on that service, but we also want him to move here, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. In a supernatural way. Let's go to him together in prayer. Brother Jim, &gt;&gt; Amen. Glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Just before we go to prayer, just kind of want to make mention uh you look around and you see each and everyone here. Don't take that opportunity for granted to come and worship together. Brother Aaron and I, Sister Lydia and Sister Jessica were [music] just at a church this past weekend that I've been going to the last couple years. It's a group of maybe 15 or 20 of their home church. And each of them would love to be seated where you're seated this morning. Great people, wonderful people. Love the message. uh just doesn't [music] quite have the facilities that we have and you know such wonderful people though but at this time [music] holiday season don't take for granted that you're you get to sit next to the person you're sitting with and each of you bring something special to even like tabernacle you bring you and you're unique you're different you're special you're important and we need you this morning in the service brother Tim asked some of you young people to come to the front you've you responded to the call many of you at the front this Morning. Let's have church. [music] Let's close this year out with a bang. &gt;&gt; Can we do that this this weekend, this morning, to say, "Lord, come. Whatever it is that I have need of, you know, my needs, you know the needs that were read. Let's ask God. Let's invite God to come." He said, "He've never seen the word of God taken on human lips ever fell in the mouth of believers." I believe that is true today as it was in the 60s, in the 50s. He's still God. He's still on on the throne. So, let's just go to him in prayer. present your needs [singing] and the needs. Brother Jonathan [music] Middleton, he needs a great touch in his body. He needs to be able to work in his lungs and his asthma, the things that he's dealing with. He's in a battle, but we know the one [music] who conquers, right? &gt;&gt; And he conquered for him. So, Father, we just bow our hearts and our heads to you this morning. God, thank you for the opportunity to come within the walls of this church. Lord, we know that Lord, even like tabernacle is just not [music] made up of the four walls of the the sanctuary and the outer structure, but it's the people, Lord. And your prophet would teach us that Lord, the beauty of the church is the character of its people. And what a wonderful church we have here. What a special group of people we get to rub shoulders with day in and day out, service after service. And Lord, we don't want to take that for granted this morning. Lord, we're very special people of of people that are are blessed to to come and hear the ministering of the word. But not only that, but to get to fellowship with one another with such wonderful and godly people, people that love you, people that reverence you, people that that just recognize that Lord, their walk in their life is not about them, [music] but it's about you and the change that you have made in their lives, in their homes, in their marriages, in their families, and their children. God, we give all the credit to you this morning. Lord, as Paul would say, I planted Apollos water, but God [music] giveth the increase. And Lord, we understand that you planted a great ministry here and you've added to it and Apollos and this one and that one. But God, all together is for the glorifying of you and the edification of your body. Lord, you get the increase. And we're here this morning to say, Lord, increase in our lives, increase in our young people, increase in our homes, increase in our marriages. Lord, increase in our families, increase in our church. God, it's not about man, but it's about you this morning. So, we give you all the honor, Lord. We give you all the glory this morning. And Lord, WE INVITE YOU TO COME AND speak to hearts and speak to lives, Lord. And we petition you to to move on the requests that were mentioned. Lord, Brother John, Brother Jonathan in need of a touch in his [music] body. Sister Alysa in need of a touch in her body. Lord, sister Linda in need of a touch in her body. God, MAY YOU JUST GO TO them this morning as the preaching of the word would go forth. May the healing angel visit them, Lord God, and touch them in THEIR NEEDS. FATHER, LORD, every hand that was lifted this morning, you know the heart that represents that need, God, may you just speak expressly, Lord. [music] May you just come by Eden Tabernacle for a special visitation. Lord, as you visited Abraham on the back side of a desert, Lord, to shows to Sarah that she was included in the promise, won't you come by Sarah again this morning, [music] Lord? Let her see she's included in that promise. Father, we thank you. We we don't take this opportunity for granted, Lord. We just want to worship you now, Father, in spirit and in truth.

We've had wonderful singing today and worship to the Lord and thank you Sister Jessica for another wonderful song today and we so appreciate what the Lord has given us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God bless each one of you as we worship together today. Romans chapter 7 verse one. Know ye not brethren? For I speak to them that know the law, how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. But if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if while her husband liveth, she be married to another, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is freed from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of the of sin, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead, wherein we were held, that we should serve in the newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. You know, we we know the seal of the Holy Ghost is considered as the new birth. And but we're looking here in the Bible where it's actually teaching us that it is also the marriage covenant. It is the invisible union between God and his bride. Now from Romans 7 we understand that Paul's teaching on marriage extends beyond natural relationships and he uses here a spiritual analogy. Uh yet the principle that he presents also upholds the natural law of marriage as he said in Romans 7:3 that if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress. Now, that is a very plain and direct statement and and it leaves very little room for reinterpretation or personal opinion. And and and really it's a serious matter to be found in the condition of adultery whether at the moment of death or at the rapture is eternally dangerous. And and so and that is because that the scripture is unchanging. You just can't change the word of God. As I say sometimes about and especially about marriage and divorce issues, I say, "Well, I I didn't write the rules &gt;&gt; and I can't change them. I have no power to do it." &gt;&gt; So because the scripture is unchanging and it says very clearly that no adulterer shall inherit the kingdom of God. And and I understand that this um may be sometimes um uncomfortable for some to hear, but as ministers, we're not called to preach what is popular. &gt;&gt; We are called to stand uncompromising on the word of God. And what we are going to share today is not directed at any individual, but we're once again seeking to bring balance to the truth that has been neglected. We're bringing down the mountains of traditions and raising the valleys of overlooked scripture. And this is the responsibility of the ministry in this last day as we forun his second coming. And we're part of that people that is called to be in his coming. Now this this subject of marriage and divorce is of course weighty and is sobering. And brother Bradom expressed how difficult it was to have to bring this revelation to the the the people. And when the Lord opened up the mystery to him after the breaking of the seals, it became clear to him that this was not just um doctrinal detail, but it was a really a heaven or hell issue on which nearly every denomination today differs in position. So, you know, you ask one church and you get this opinion and you get this asked another opinion and and and even brother Brandham when he got this revelation, he wrestled deeply with what to say. You know what? What do I do when I have some good men and some wonderful people, women, and in our congregation, some of them married two or three times, lives that are so tangled in relationships that were not joined according to the word of God. And these were sincere people. They were faithful churchgoers, but they were victims of false teaching and cultural influence or incomplete understanding of God's design for marriage. So today, as we continue to walk in the light that has been revealed, we're compelled to handle this truth with reverence and courage. You know, the subject may be um uncomfortable um but it's necessary. the stakes are eternal. &gt;&gt; And if we truly love people, we have to tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; You know, not just to condemn them, but to warn, to instruct, and to guide toward redemption. And and not only that, but we have young people that we must lead in the paths of righteousness and warn of the pitfalls along the way. But you know, this sermon today though is really not going to be about marriage and divorce. So we will cover a little aspects of that, but it's going to be about marriage responsibility and God's design. And and it's not just about human relationships that we're going to go in today, though we will we will use and and and speak about human relationship, but it's really a mirror of Christ and his bride. &gt;&gt; And as we if we get the natural pattern wrong, you know, it it means that we may be misunderstanding the spiritual union as well. So we want to approach this subject today very prayerfully and humbly with our ears tuned to the word of God. Not to tradition, not to culture or not to personal emotion, but to the word of the Lord for this age. &gt;&gt; AND YOU MIGHT ASK, YOU KNOW, what in the world has caused the confusion that we have today, you know, about even the issues of marriage and divorce and remarage and so on. And I'll tell you the reason is false teaching &gt;&gt; and that is the root of it. Many didn't wait on the Lord but followed man-made doctrines and traditions that contradicted the scripture. &gt;&gt; Jesus said what God have joined together let not man put us under. &gt;&gt; And now I know I want you to notice his wording. Not not what man has joined but what God has joined. And there is a difference because when you get a direct revelation that this is your wife or or for a woman that this is your husband that union is is sacred and it's binding for life and no man has a right to separate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO WHAT A MAN JOINS TOGETHER based on emotion, lust or convenience, it can easily fall apart. But it because it wasn't joined by God to begin with. &gt;&gt; And we see this too often in marriages today. Marriages that are officiated in courtrooms by half drunken magistrates or backsliden preachers who follow creeds instead of scripture and they perform they'll perform any kind of union while God's word lies open and it is ignored. So let's be clear. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD JOINS TOGETHER. Not human arrangements, not legal contracts. That's this is a standard that Jesus upheld. What God joins together. Now, THERE IS A CIVIL LAW THAT MUST BE adhered to in our land. And there is a moral law that God is going to hold us accountable to &gt;&gt; and they are different. I mean, civil laws will permit all kinds of marriages and remarages and divorces and so on and on and on and give you the legal right to do so. &gt;&gt; But God's law is a moral law and God will hold you accountable for what's written in his word. &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NATURAL TYPE AND THE spiritual reality. BECAUSE JUST AS A MAN CHOOSES A WIFE IN THE NATURAL, SO CHRIST CHOOSES HIS BRIDE IN THE SPIRITUAL. Marriage is a type of Christ and the church. And and it should be approached with discernment AND REVERENCE. MARRIAGE VOWS ARE ARE VERY SACRED. WE SAY until death do us part. AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE TO LIVE. KEEPING that vow as a lifelong covenant. THEREFORE, CHOOSING A SPOUSE IS one of the most serious decisions that a person can make. And hearing is the cause of broken home. I'll tell you what it is. It's a lack of prayer and discernment. And today we live in A NATION PERHAPS AMERICA may no doubt she has so many divorces. I WOULDN'T DOUBT that she leads the world in divorce. We claim TO BE A CHRISTIAN NATION. YET OUR COURTS are flooded with broken marriages, you know, and to TO THE POINT THEY DON'T EVEN GET MARRIED ANYMORE. They just cohabit together because it's too hard to separate and divorce and go through all the legal work. But even Christians, churches today have divorce and remarage. And I I just say what a reproach. And the reason is men and women have drifted away from God. PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING HUSBANDS AND WIVES BASED ON OUTWARD APPEAL, LOOKS, STRENGTH, charm rather than looking for God's will. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THE RESULTS SO MANY TIMES ARE TRAGIC. If men and women would pray earnestly before entering marriage and sincerely asking God, is this your will? NOT NOT MAKE this your will &gt;&gt; but Lord is this your will &gt;&gt; too many times Lord let this be her let this be him you know God make this happen &gt;&gt; you know you you you should not ever be praying like that &gt;&gt; and you should say God is THIS YOUR WILL IS YOUR will for my life &gt;&gt; AND IF THIS WOULD BE DONE MANY HEARTACHES WOULD BE AVOIDED &gt;&gt; A WRONG CHOICE in marriage can ruin your entire life &gt;&gt; on every single every person that is single there there there lies this weight of personal responsibility. If a man knowingly chooses a woman who is not sub suitable to be his wife and he does it anyway he bears a responsibility for that decision. And the same applies to a woman who knowingly accepts a man that is not fit to be her husband. Once the truth is known and once marriage and divorce has been revealed, uh we are we are held accountable for that which is revealed. That is why no one should rush into marriage. You shouldn't you shouldn't you SHOULD NOT MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT until you have thoroughly prayed through. And there have been many you know sincere couples though that were caught in this condition. You know remarrying WHILE THEIR FIRST SPOUSE WAS STILL LIVING and and they didn't do this maybe out of rebellion BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE TAUGHT A MISINTERPRETED THEOLOGY. uh they and then they COME INTO THIS GLORIOUS LIFE HAVING NOT KNOWN the truth and the full truth about marriage and divorce had not yet been revealed to them. And and when God unveiled the mystery of marriage and divorce through the opening of the seals, it became clear by the word that such individuals were living in adultery and AND THE RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT of the law. I want you to listen carefully and closely. THE RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT OF THE LAW WOULD HAVE DEMANDED separation in order to be saved or go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And and however, THIS IS WHERE GOD'S GRACE WAS MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; IN THAT VERY MOMENT OF JUDGMENT, a a provision was was revealed. Uh you you you CAN HEAR BROTHER BRANDHAM TELL ABOUT IT IN MARRIAGE and divorce. HE HE WENT THERE JUST OUTSIDE OF Tucson and up on Finger Rock there as he was praying about the you know the situation knowing what he was going to preach which would require men and women who had been married incorrectly and not ACCORDING TO WORD TO separate in order to be a part of the rapture. and knowing this day THAT IT WOULD DIVIDE FAMILIES AND AND children and and and and it would it would bring a lot of hurt and confusion. Then he as he went there and was praying there AT FINGER ROCK, THE PILLAR OF FIRE came down. And when it did, it revealed to him the grace portion of marriage and divorce AND SAID, "BECAUSE OF MISINTERPRETED THEOLOGY, BECAUSE OF THE WRONG THINGS THAT HAVE been taught, incorrect teaching, AND BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, there is a special grace given." AND THAT IS FOR THOSE OF YOU CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP UH that that WOULD HAVE TO SEPARATE BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADULTEROUS union according to the word of God. THEN GRACE ALLOWED IT WHERE THAT THEY COULD REMAIN AS THEY ARE but never do it again and teach their children never to do it. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother. We don't just have a message of love. No sir, we got a message THAT IS GRACE. IT'S A CAPSTONE COMING DOWN CRYING GRACE. [applause and cheering] GRACE, I'm so glad for that grace. &gt;&gt; Now, as we are looking at it, I want you to understand something. That act of grace did not remove the sinfulness of adultery, but it did make room for forgiveness when approached in humility and faith. Yet, YET WE MUST BE CLEAR WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. THIS GRACE IS NOT A LICENSE FOR FUTURE DISOBEDIENCE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE COMMANDED TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN and others, you know, not to repeat these mistakes. FOR THOSE WHO WILL MARRY CONTRARY TO THE WORD after the truth has been shown to them, I'll tell you the scripture, THERE REMAINTH NO sacrifice for sin. &gt;&gt; For that sin. The only biblical re resolution in such a case is repentance and separation. &gt;&gt; NOW THE APOSTLE PAUL WROTE in 1 Corinthians 6, he told us, HE SAID, "KNOW YE NOT THAT THE UNRIGHTEOUS SHALL NOT INHERIT the kingdom of God." And he said, "Be not deceived, neither fornicators or adulterers or or adulterers shall inherit the kingdom of God." But in VERSE 11, HE GIVES US SOME HOPE. AND HE SAYS, "OF SUCH &gt;&gt; WERE SOME OF YOU, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE WASHED AND YOU ARE SANCTIFIED, &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD Jesus Christ by the spirit of our Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, HOW THANKFUL WE ARE THAT THAT GOD had not only restored the truth of marriage AND DIVORCE, BUT HE ALSO MADE A PROVISION OF GRACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. for those WHO WERE ENTANGLED WITH IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW, even though you you were caught in an adulterous union by the GRACE THAT IS GIVEN, THERE HAS BEEN SUCH MERCY SHOWN THAT YOU CAN GO in a rapture. THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE GIVES you rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a revelation. AMEN. FROM GOD HIMSELF. AND SO I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THAT TODAY. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT GRACE? &gt;&gt; BUT WELL, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE and go back and he said or he can, she can't, this and that, the other. What I want to see IS THE REAL LESSON THAT PAUL is bringing in this analogy of um of a woman who is married to husband. In order to be married again, her first husband must be dead. AND PAUL IS USING THIS NATURAL LAW OF MARRIAGE TO REVEAL A PROPHETIC MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS. &gt;&gt; And he begins speaking to them to know to them that know the law, SHOWING THAT THE MOSAIC LAW held full dominion over a person as long as they were alive. &gt;&gt; And and HE GAVE THE EXAMPLE, A WOMAN IS LEGALLY bound to her husband as long as he lives. That's right. &gt;&gt; If she unites WITH ANOTHER MAN WHILE HER HUSBAND STILL LIVES, SHE SHALL be called an adulteress. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE HUSBAND DIES, SHE IS FREED FROM THAT LAW and can and can be joined to another rightfully. And and this is where the this revelation unfolds as he said in verse four of Romans 7. Wherefore, my brethren, you are become DEAD TO THE LAW BY THE BODY OF CHRIST, THAT YOU SHOULD BE MARRIED to another, even to him who has raised from the dead. SO HE SAID, "NOW YOU, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE HAD A DEATH TO your old husband, &gt;&gt; the law, AND NOW YOU CAN be married to him that was raised from the dead." AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL IS NOT MERELY TEACHING MARITAL REGULATIONS. He's declaring our spiritual marital status. WE WERE ONCE BOUND TO THE LAW. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS OUR FIRST HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; And even THE FOR THE JEWS THAT THAT HUSBAND, IT WAS A MOSAIC LAW. It was a covenant given specifically to Israel. THE GENTILES, HOWEVER, never were under that covenant. INSTEAD, ALL HUMANITY, JEW AND GENTILE ALIKE, WERE BORN UNDER the dominion of a greater principle, AND THAT IS THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH. SO NOW TO TO UNDERSTAND THIS, you know, every one of us was born with a husband that had rule over us. WE WERE SOLD BEFORE OUR birth into marriage &gt;&gt; AND OUR MARRIAGE WOULD BE TO THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH. &gt;&gt; NOW TO GRASP THE FULL WAY TO PAUL'S ANALOGY, WE SHOULD WE should uh you know we should understand the the the ancient concept of marriage and those customs in those days. THEY WERE USUALLY ARRANGED BY PARENTS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND IT WAS MOST OFTEN TO SERVE THEIR OWN interest &gt;&gt; and children had a little to say little to say or to you know in choosing their spouse and then A DOWY WAS PAID to the bride's FATHER AND IT TRANSFERRED the the DAUGHTER INTO THE POSSESSION of her husband and legally the woman became her husband's property &gt;&gt; and SHE HAD VERY FEW PERSONAL RIGHTS. AH, you know, I I can see, you know, your hackles already growing on your neck. Now, you know, this is un this is just the way it was. &gt;&gt; Now, spiritually, this mirrors our fallen condition. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; THROUGH ADAM'S DISOBEDIENCE, HUMANITY WAS SOLD INTO BONDAGE. &gt;&gt; It was m we WERE MARRIED FROM BIRTH TO AN UNCHOSEN HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; THE CARNAL NATURE. AND IN THIS UNION, WE BECAME THE PROPERTY of sin, &gt;&gt; RULED BY SATAN HIMSELF, &gt;&gt; AND THIS EVIL HUSBAND PRODUCED A TERRIBLE HARVEST OF SIN AND SICKNESS, SORROW, SUFFERING, DEATH. IT WAS THE FRUITS of a corrupted nature. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS A WOMAN IS BOUND BY THE LAW TO HER HUSBAND WHILE HE HE LIVES, WE TOO WERE BOUND TO THE RULE OF SIN. BUT ACCORDING TO PAUL'S TEACHING, IF THAT HUSBAND DIES, that woman is free to marry another. AND LIKEWISE, ONLY THROUGH THE DEATH OF her old man, the sin nature, can we be LOOSED TO BE JOINED to covenant with Christ, and only then can we bear the fruit under righteousness through our union with him. SO THE FIRST UNION COULD PRODUCE NOTHING BUT DEATH, WHICH IS SEPARATION FROM GOD. AND CONDEMNATION. BUT CHRIST DIED AND IN THAT DEATH WE ALSO DIED TO THE LAW &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE ARE RESURRECTED IN UNION WITH CHRIST AND WE ARE FREE TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER. WHEN THE OLD HUSBAND IS DEAD, THE CHURCH IS LOOSED FROM THAT FORMAL covenant and and she is SHE IS LAWFULLY THEN UNITED MARRIED TO THE RISEN CHRIST. And this new UNION PRODUCES GODLY FRUITS. &gt;&gt; And here's THE POINT THAT PAUL IS MAKING. WE CANNOT CLAIM UNION WITH CHRIST TO BE MARRIED to him and remain under the old dominion OF THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE LAW. &gt;&gt; ANY MORE THAN A WOMAN CAN live with a second husband while the first one's still alive, &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. AND PAUL IS ANNOUNCING THERE MUST BE A FULL SEPARATION FROM THE OLD LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BEFORE THE BRIDE CAN LAWFULLY UNITE WITH Christ &gt;&gt; in Romans 7, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT JUST given a lesson IN IN LEGAL PROCEDURE. He's considering the spiritual reality AND HE SAYS THE LAW HAD DOMINION OVER THE MAN. As long as she liveth, BUT IF HER HUSBAND BE DEAD, SHE IS LOOSED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can look back at your past life where you were married and united to sin. &gt;&gt; But you can look back and say that old man is dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] And I have a right to be married to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and because I'm married to him, I am a oh my. Instead of being a slave to this law, I am a love slave to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not because I have to, BUT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL TEACHES THE LAW HATH NO MORE DOMINION OVER THE CHURCH. THE OLD COVENANT, THOUGH ONCE BINDING, IS DEAD TO US. AND WE ARE DEAD TO IT THROUGH THE BODY OF CHRIST. AND AND AND THAT MEANS THAT THE CHURCH IS NO LONGER BOUND TO THAT FIRST HUSBAND. AND THOUGH WE AS GENTILES WERE NEVER UNDER THE MOSAIC LAW, THE PRINCIPLE STILL APPLIES. ALL OF US, ALL HUMANITY, JEW AND GENTILE, WE WERE ALL BORN UNDER BONDAGE, &gt;&gt; whether to the law or to the law of sin and death. BUT THROUGH OUR IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST AND IN HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION, WE ARE RAISED TO A NEW LIFE &gt;&gt; UNDER A NEW COVENANT. AND OUR NEW HUSBAND IS CHRIST THE WORD. And he's the one THAT GOVERNS US NOT BY EX EXTERNAL RULES BUT BY THE INDWELLING Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE BONDAGE of legal ordinances. I I want you just TO THINK ABOUT THE OLD HUSBAND, the law, and you know, he was he was pretty mean. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He had some strict rules &gt;&gt; and you better follow them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Under the heavy hand of that old husband, the law, the seventh day, which is Saturday, was was required to be kept as a Sabbath day. AND VIOLATORS WERE PUNISHED SEVERELY, EVEN TO DEATH. &gt;&gt; JUST BY PICKING UP A STICKMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IN CHRIST, WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER A DAYBASED REST. HE HIMSELF IS OUR SABBATH. THE HOLY GHOST GIVES US REST. NOT JUST ONE DAY A WEEK, BUT A CONTINUAL REST IN HIM. &gt;&gt; UNDER THE OLD LAW, THE HUSBAND REQUIRED CIRCUMCISION WAS REQUIRED FOR EVERY MALE. AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT UH WAS NOT CIRCUMCISED WAS CUT OFF FROM the covenant &gt;&gt; outside of the covenant of God. &gt;&gt; But now in our union with Christ, the true circumcision is one not made with hands. It's done by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that spiritual seal cuts off flesh and places us in Christ. &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT ELSE ARE WE NOT SUBJECT TO? I mean, there'd be a lot of things I could talk about, but let's just let's just go down for a minute. We're not subject to animal sacrifices &gt;&gt; and ceremonial rituals, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE WHY? CHRIST IS OUR PERFECT SACRIFICE. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD BECAUSE CHRIST IS OUR HIGH PRIEST FOREVER AND WE'RE NOW PRIEST UNTO GOD OURSELVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE DIETARY LAWS AND UNCLEAN FOOD RESTRICTION BECAUSE IN CHRIST NO FOOD CAN DEFILE a sanctifying heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO FEAST DAYS AND NEW MOONS AND HOLY CONVOCATIONS THESE WERE SHADOW AND THE SUBSTANCE THE REALITY IS CHRIST. RIGHTEOUSNESS BY WORKS. WE ARE NOW NO LONGER RIGHTEOUS BY OUR WORKS. WE ARE JUSTIFIED OR DECLARED RIGHTEOUS BY FAITH, &gt;&gt; not by our lawkeeping. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND CONDEMNATION WERE THE LAW CONDEMN. LET ME TELL YOU, THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS THIS HUSBAND CHRIST DON'T CONDEMN YOU. &gt;&gt; READ ROMANS CHAPTER 8. WILL CHRIST CONDEMN YOU? NO. HE DIED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; He'll freely give you all things. &gt;&gt; He's a loving husband. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He's not holding over you do this and you'll die. No, he's offering grace. Grace. Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; And you out of love respond to that grace. So, WE'RE NO LONGER MARRIED TO A HUSBAND WHO DEMANDED OBEDIENCE through fear and and um and ceremony, but we're now united to a husband who gives us love and life and power through the spirit. And the old husband that ruled the outer man with tablets and stones has been replaced. And we have a new husband. AND HE WRITES HIS LAWS IN OUR HEARTS. AND UNDER THIS COVENANT, WE'RE NOT LED BY REGULATIONS, BUT BY RELATIONSHIP. AND WE SERVE NOT IN THE OLDNESS OF THE LETTER, BUT IN THE NEWNESS of the spirit. &gt;&gt; SO JUST AS PAUL IN HIS DAY DECLARED that the law no longer held dominion over THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST, brother Brandham under the same prophetic anointing, he proclaimed to us in the sermon. He said, "THIS IS MY THANKSGIVING MESSAGE TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. You are invisibly united with Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; And he preaches the invisible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. That and AND IN THAT MESSAGE, HE'S TELLING US DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS WHICH WERE OUR HUSBAND &gt;&gt; NO LONGER HOLD LORDSHIP OVER THIS BRIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE EXPLAINED, "WE WERE ONCE MARRIED TO MAN-MADE RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS AND WE BORE ITS NAME AND WE CARRIED ITS DOCTRINE AND WE LIVED UNDER HIS AUTHORITY. BUT NOW THAT HUSBAND, THE OLD DENOMINATIONAL WORLDLY CHURCH HAS [screaming] DIED TO US AND WE'RE MARRIED TO ANOTHER." &gt;&gt; You may tell you who it is. Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. This don't marry you to a preacher. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not placing We're not replacing the pope with a new bishop. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, no, no. We are married to Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; AND IN THE VISION, BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS SHOWN A A woman representing the church, ATTEMPTING TO RISE INTO HER POSITION. BUT EVERY TIME SHE TRIED, SHE WAS BEATING BACK DOWN WITH A THREE- CORNERED CLUB symbolizing the false and oppressive doctrine of Trinity. A MAN-MADE INVENTION NEVER TAUGHT BY THE SCRIPTURE. IT WAS A WEAPON THAT WAS USED BY RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS to keep the church in submissions TO CREEDS INSTEAD OF THE WORD. And you can you can even TO THEM THAT ARE BOUND UNDER THAT LAW. YOU CAN SHOW THEM IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE BOUND TO [screaming] THAT LAW OF THAT HUSBAND, &gt;&gt; BUT NOT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU HAVE BEEN SET FREE TO SERVE THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE NOT BEAT DOWN BY SOME TRINITARIAN CLUB EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO RISE UP IN POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. By now, by the revelation of the seals and the calling out of the bride, we're no longer subject to that oppression. &gt;&gt; The system of man is dead &gt;&gt; to the true believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER the heavy hand of a pope &gt;&gt; or a priesthood. &gt;&gt; I mean, OR SOME DENOMINATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, &gt;&gt; NOR DO WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO COUNCILS AND CREEDS OR catechisms &gt;&gt; through THE UNION WITH CHRIST, OUR TRUE BRIDEGROOM. WE ARE FREE FROM the edicts of men. &gt;&gt; There's no more paying for forgiveness OF SINS. NO MORE INDULGENCES. NO MORE PAYING TO HAVE LOVED ONES PRAYED OUT OF PURGATORY &gt;&gt; BY ONE OFFERING. HE HAD PERFECTED &gt;&gt; FOREVER &gt;&gt; THEM THAT ARE SANCTIFIED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE NO LONGER HAVE TO GO TO PRIEST FOR confessional as a MEDIATOR BETWEEN US AND GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS ONE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MAN, AND THAT'S THE MAN Christ Jesus. And forgiveness NOW COMES DIRECTLY FROM OUR HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I want you TO KNOW IT'S FULL AND FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO OBLIGATIONS TO MAN-MADE RITUALS AND SACRAMENTS OF SALVATION. ALTHOUGH WE'LL OBSERVE WATER BAPTISM AND FOOT WASH AND COMMUNION and whatever. They they are scriptural ordinance, but they're not saving rituals. &gt;&gt; WE ARE SAVED BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH. NOT BY CEREMONY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE HIERARCHY OF OF SPIRITUAL CONTROL. THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY IS TO SERVE THE BODY, NOT DOMINATE IT. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE BELONGS TO THE BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS A HEAD OF THE CHURCH, NOT A BISHOP, NOT A BOARD, NOT ORGANIZATION, NOT A HEADQUARTERS, NO. NOT EVEN ONE AT JEFFERSONVILLE. creeds and confessions REPLACING THE WORD. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE IS NOT FORMED BY DENOMINATIONAL STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO say the apostles creed. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WE INSTEAD DON'T LIVE BY THAT CREED. WE LIVE BY EVERY WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE WE NO LONGER HAVE DENOMINATIONAL NAMES AND IDENTITIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER WEAR NAMES LIKE BAPTIST OR CATHOLIC OR PENTECOSTAL, BUT WE HAVE TAKEN ON THE NAME OF OUR HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I I'm ANNOUNCING TO YOU THE RULE OF THE FIRST HUSBAND IS OVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All these religious institutions, their traditions, teachings, they all acted as our first husband. They ruled our spiritual life. They shaped our beliefs. They demanded our loyalty. BUT NOW THAT SYSTEM IS DEAD TO US &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE DEAD TO IT. AND THE BONDAGE IS BROKEN. AND CHRIST, OUR HUSBAND, HAS PAID THE SIN DEBT ONCE AND FOR ALL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND FORGIVENESS DOES NOT COME FROM A MAN, BUT IS FREELY GIVEN TO US BY THE BRIDEGROOM. AND WE'RE FREE TO SERVE CHRIST AND THE LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT, NOT UNDER THE BONDAGE OF RELIGIOUS LAW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We no longer answer to headquarters, councils, popes, senods, seminaries. Oh, listen. I hope Jeffersonville hears this. &gt;&gt; We don't answer to them either. &gt;&gt; We answer to the voice of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And that's not brother Brandham either. &gt;&gt; That's the revealed word for our day. &gt;&gt; Sure, he delivered it. God used his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not the voice of God. He was a voice of a man God used. &gt;&gt; Now, AND SO AS BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACHED, THE BRIDE MUST COME TO HER INVISIBLE union with the word. AND WE'RE NOT JUST BELIEVE IN A DOCTRINE. IT'S AN INVISIBLE UNION BECAUSE IT ISN'T WITH A PHYSICAL MAN ON EARTH. IT'S NOT THROUGH A EARTHLY CEREMONY. IT'S A SPIRITUAL JOINING OF THE SOUL TO THE believer of the believer TO TO CHRIST. YOU KNOW, NO ONE CAN PHYSICALLY SEE IT, BUT ITS EFFECTS ARE EVIDENT. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU CAN'T SEE THE UNION OF CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE BECAUSE IT'S SPIRITUAL, IT'S INTERNAL, IS REVEALED ONLY BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND THE REAL UNION IS NOT EMOTION, IS NOT SENSATION, NOR IS IT INTELLECTUAL UM BELIEF, BUT IT'S AN EXPERIENCE. IT'S A LITERAL CHANGE OF NATURE WHERE THE OLD NATURE DIES AND CHRIST ENTERS. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE ENTERING A MARRIAGE COVENANT WITH THE RESURRECTED WORD. CHRIST HIMSELF IS NOT IS NOT A CEREMONY with rains and DRESSES AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS and visible celebration. IT'S WHEN CHRIST THE BRIDEGROOM TAKES YOU AS A PART OF his bride in covenant by giving you his holy spirit. &gt;&gt; And that UNITES YOU WITH HIM ETERNALLY. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NO UNION WITH THE SYSTEM of man. THERE'S NO CHURCH JOINING. THERE'S NO UNION UP WITH CREEDS OR MAN-MADE DOCTRINES OR ORGANIZATION OR OR MAN-MADE HEADQUARTERS. ONLY A PURE WORD BRIDE joined to the word group. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL USES THE LAW OF MARRIAGE to show this. He says THE CHURCH HAD TO DIE TO HER FIRST husband &gt;&gt; so she CAN BE LEGALLY JOINED to the resurrected Christ AND SO THAT SHE CAN BEAR THE FRUIT OF HIS LIFE, HIS word in this final hour. So only ONE HUSBAND NOW, CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE, UNITED BY the revealed word, invisible now but visible soon at the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the true church THAT IS TO BE MARRIED IS Miss Grace, &gt;&gt; the elect lady. &gt;&gt; SHE'S A VIRGIN LIKE MARY. SHE'S ELECTED TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN BORN BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SHE IS NOT A JUST SELECTED FOR A RAPTURE BUT SHE SELECTED CHOSEN PREDESTINATED TO BRING FORTH HIS SEED LIFE IN THE FORM of children who will reflect his the life and the nature of their father the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand this ain't all just about a rapture. It's about being married to Christ &gt;&gt; and bringing forth his children. Now, so she's the woman that John speaks of in second John to the elect lady. THE WORD ELECT MEANS CHOSEN OUT OF THE MANY. &gt;&gt; JUST AS LIKE THERE WERE MANY women in Israel, but one virgin Mary, &gt;&gt; ONE WOMAN ELECTED TO BRING FORTH THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST ON INTO the earth. EVEN SO, GOD HAS CHOSEN ONE WOMAN IN this age. Hear me now. This might sound ex exclusive and inclusive or whatever you want to call it, but there's there's only one ONE WOMAN IN THIS AGE. IT'S HIS BRIDE, THE ELECT LADY. &gt;&gt; And like Mary, SHE IS HIGHLY FAVORED OF THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT SHE WOULD cons conceive by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, she's not a denomination. She's not a system. She's not a mixed crowd. She's a called out woman. She's separated from all the rest. And through grace, she has been chosen, called, espoused, and prepared for Christ. AND JUST AS A MAN CHOOSES HIS WIFE TO BE THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN, THE BRIDE IS CHOSEN as his spouse, LISTEN TO BE THE BEDDING GROUND TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN in his image. Now listen, IT IT'S AN UNSPOKEN THING. Are you with me? IT MAY BE AN UNSPOKEN THING, BUT WHEN A MAN CHOOSES A WIFE, HE IS CHOOSING the mother, &gt;&gt; THE BEDDING GROUND &gt;&gt; FOR HIS CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD IS CHOOSING A BRIDE, &gt;&gt; HE IS CHOOSING A BEDDING GROUND. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; For his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; She has to be the environment, the atmosphere, the place, the bedding ground where the word can bring forth children. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now hold tight. Since he is the word, SHE MUST BE OF HIS OWN KIND. HE CANNOT MARRY something that's not of his kind. &gt;&gt; THE LAW OF GOD IS KIND AFTER KIND. SPECIES AFTER SPECIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE OFFSPRING OF THIS UNION MUST BE CHILDREN OF THE WORD. THEY MUST BEAR HIS LIKENESS. &gt;&gt; THESE CHILDREN WILL HAVE HIS ATTRIBUTES. THEY WILL HAVE HIS SAME CHARACTER CUZ THEY ARE HIS OF THE SAME LIFE. AND TO QUOTE THE PROPHET, HE SAID, "NOTICE WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN SHE'S BEARING. THAT TELLS WHAT her papa their papa is, whether it's the first Adam or the second Adam. IF THE CHURCH BRINGS FORTH THE CHILD OF THE SECOND ADAM, he acts like the the he acts the second way Adam's way of acting LIKE THEY DID ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT IS THE TRUE SECOND ADAM'S CHILDREN. THEIR NATURE IS LIKE his and hers. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you GET IT, SHE'S GOING TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL HAVE THE SECOND ADAM'S WAY OF ACTING &gt;&gt; LIKE THEY DID ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; Now if the children you that a church is producing is not matching Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They are illegitimate to this message. &gt;&gt; They are illegitimate to this Christ. That's &gt;&gt; their denominational offspring even though they may not be officially denomination. &gt;&gt; I'm going to drive this home. I'm going to show you first of all a contrast and we're going to look at the great because in contrast to the virgin bride that is chosen of God to bear his sheep, produces offspring is another woman in the Bible, &gt;&gt; the great and her daughters. &gt;&gt; They're just like her. They're harlots. &gt;&gt; NOW IN REVELATION 17, JOHN SEES A striking vision. He says, "THERE CAME ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS, saying unto me, come hither, and I'll SHOW YOU THE JUDGMENT of the great that siteth upon many water." And upon her forehead was the name written, Mystery Babylon, the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth. Now, this woman was not a literal prostitute. SHE WAS A SYMBOLIC FIGURE REPRESENTING AN UNFAITHFUL CHURCH. &gt;&gt; In the scripture, AS YOU KNOW, IT OFTEN uh it often represents the woman represents a church and and therefore the great represents a religious system that claims to be the bride OF CHRIST &gt;&gt; BUT HAS BETRAYED HIM. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COMMITTING SPIRITUAL ADULTERY BY UNITING WITH KINGS AND SYSTEMS OF THE of the earth. AND SO WHY IS HE CALLED A A is a WOMAN WHO GIVES HERSELF TO A man to men that is not her husband. &gt;&gt; She she'll DO IT FOR MONEY, POWER, OR GAINS. &gt;&gt; AND SPIRITUALLY, THIS WOMAN, THE CHURCH, HAS DONE THE SAME THING. SHE CLAIMS TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST BUT HAS RECEIVED THE SEEDS OF OTHERS, CREEDS, TRADITIONS, AND DOCTRINES OF MEN. &gt;&gt; I I I just don't get it. You know, when you are when you understand these things, how you could go out and join a denomination after hearing this truth. &gt;&gt; It's written plain in the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Instead of remaining a virgin to the word, SHE UNITED WITH POLITICAL POWER AND HUMAN REASONING. SHE NO LONGER PRODUCES CHILDREN OF THE WORD, BUT children of confusion, which is what Babylon means. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND COMPROMISE and carnality. AND THAT IS WHY SHE'S CALLED MYSTERY BABYLON, WHICH MEANS CONFUSION BY MIXTURE, MIXING TRUTH WITH ERA, SCRIPTURE WITH TRADITION, AND MAN'S IDEAS WITH WITH GOD'S COMMANDS. and and HER DAUGHTERS ARE CALLED IN THE BIBLE HARLOTS. &gt;&gt; SO SHE IS THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS. SHE'S NOT ALONE. Means she has offspring. She's a mother. SHE'S A BEDDING ground &gt;&gt; for these creeds and dogmas &gt;&gt; which produce harlots. &gt;&gt; Come on. WHO ARE JUST LIKE HER. AND THESE DENOMINATIONAL CHURCHES HAVE COME OUT OF HER AND YET THEY FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN. &gt;&gt; THEY CLAIM TO be Christian. They use the name of Jesus. BUT THEY REJECT HIS FULL WORD AND CHOOSE CREEDS AND THEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS INSTEAD. AND LIKE THEIR MOTHER, THEY TOO RECEIVE another seed. NOT THE PURE UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD, BUT the seed OF MAN AND INTERPRETATIONS AND IDEAS AND CHURCH THEOLOGIES. THIS MAKES THEM SPIRITUAL HARLOTS. &gt;&gt; For they are united with another THAN CHRIST, PRODUCING DENOMINATIONAL OFFSPRING INSTEAD OF WORDBORN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, brother Brandham told us the same. He said, um, and why I'm against organized religion, he said, remember mother Rome was found in her full of blasphemous names, a mother of harlots. Then if they are harlots, what is a harlot? What is a The same thing as uh same thing as a harlot. It's a woman that lives untrue to her marriage vow. AND ANY CHURCH THAT CLAIMS TO be the church of CHRIST AND DENIES GOD'S WORD, she is untrue to her marriage vow. THEN SHE COMMITS ADULTERY BY ADDING DOGMA, WHOREDOM WITH the world, HER WISDOM INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING CHRIST AND THE POWER of his resurrection power of the Holy Ghost. She is a mother of harlot that has done the same thing. Now, so Jesus, HE IS NOT COMING FOR A CHURCH BOUND BY MAN-MADE CREEDS, &gt;&gt; BY MAN-MADE TRADITIONS. &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING FOR A WORD BRIDE. HE IS THE WORD and no true union CAN HAPPEN UNLESS THE BRIDE RECEIVES HIS SEED ONLY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MARRIAGE COMMITMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, HE'S NOT GOING TO SHARE HIS SEED life &gt;&gt; with any other either. &gt;&gt; His seed is sacred. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NEITHER CAN THE BRIDE RECEIVE anything but his seed only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS EVE FELL AT THE BEGINNING BY RECEIVING A WRONG SEED IN THE GARDEN PRODUCING CAIN, SO MODERN CHURCHES FALL WHEN THEY RECEIVED the seed of man rather than Christ the word. And every church CLAIMING TO BE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. THEY MUST BE PREGNANTATED, IMPREGNATED with the seed of the word. IF SHE RECEIVES ANY OTHER SEED SHE'S A HARLOT IN GOD'S EYES. &gt;&gt; NOW, how are YOU GOING TO TELL BY HER OFFSPRING? &gt;&gt; IF HER OFFSPRING ISN'T LIKE PENTECOST, &gt;&gt; SHE'S A &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THEY GO BY MESSAGE TITLE. &gt;&gt; THIS THE CHILDREN OF THESE SPIRITUAL UNIONS ARE NOT BORN OF GOD'S SPIRIT. THEY'RE BORN AS HUMAN SYSTEMS, CREEDS OF MAN, ORGANIZATIONAL AGENDAS. THEY MAY BE RELIGIOUS. THEY BE MAY BE MORAL. THEY BE MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY STIRRED, BUT THEY'RE NOT BORN AGAIN BY THE INCORRUPTIBLE SEED OF THE WORD OF GOD. They're hybrids. &gt;&gt; They're like a mule. They're strong, hardworking, but sterile, unable to produce true life. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Plenty of good works. They'll outwork you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Activities, programs, tradition, &gt;&gt; but no lifegiving seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That brings forth Christ. &gt;&gt; I I'm trying to get something to you. As a church, WE MUST BE THE BEDDING ground &gt;&gt; of the seed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And produce children &gt;&gt; like him. &gt;&gt; NOW, SO THE BRIDE IN CONTRAST IS A VIRGIN. YES. &gt;&gt; NOT A &gt;&gt; SHE'S CALLED A VIRGIN. &gt;&gt; She is washed in the word. &gt;&gt; SHE'S IMPREGNATED WITH CHRIST'S SEED. &gt;&gt; SHE'S PRODUCING CHILDREN IN HIS IMAGE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF SOME DENOMINATION, BUT SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. SHE REFUSES TO be united with ANY MAN-MADE SYSTEM. SHE'S FAITHFUL TO ONE HUSBAND. THAT'S CHRIST TO THE THE WORD. And the and her daughters ARE JUDGED. AND WHAT IS THEIR SIN? SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. &gt;&gt; THEY RECEIVE AND DECEIVE THE DOCTRINE OF MAN RATHER THAN CHRIST the word. &gt;&gt; And what is the result in offspring? Illegitimate children. &gt;&gt; Hybrid Christians who bear the image of theology, not the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody with me now. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, we we believe we're part of that elected group here. And I'd say that's true of of those around the nations across the world that have heard his call. But but YOU REMEMBER HERE'S WHY THIS woman is used in in the illustration. A woman is used. Now God is typing SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE CHRIST IS A BRIDEGROOM. THE church is his bride and they're in covenant relationship and they are just a woman is a type of the church. Eve was a type taken from Adam's side. REBECCA WAS A TYPE CHOSEN FOR ISAAC. Ruth was A TYPE REDEEMED BY BOAZ. ESTHER WAS A TYPE ELECTED TO TAKE the queen's place. MARY WAS A TYPE CARRYING THE LITERAL WORD MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO GOD TYPED IT ALL THE WAY DOWN. AND ALL OF THEM IS POINTING TO ONE FINAL WOMAN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST misgraced &gt;&gt; the elect lady, &gt;&gt; ELECTED, CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh brother, YOU SEE ALL THE SCRIPTURES POINTING TO THIS ONE THING AND SHE CAN THAT'S WHY SHE MUST COME FORTH BECAUSE SHE IS THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE'S A PART OF HIM. SHE'S A MANIFESTATION OF EVERY TYPE AND REVELATION SPOKE CONCERNING THE BRIDE THROUGHOUT THE AGES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; She can only express the life of the groom &gt;&gt; because that is her real identity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if she produces something different from what he produced, if her life projects or reflects another nature, then she's not the bride. That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power, &gt;&gt; she is him &gt;&gt; expressed &gt;&gt; in bride form, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And just as the first woman was taken from Adam's side and flesh and spirit, you know, flesh and spirit taken from the man, SO WAS BRIDE. THE BRIDE is taken from Christ. The spirit that came from him. The feminine receptive nature of worship and submiss submission TO FLESH THAT WAS OPENED AT CALVARY from which the church receive water, blood and spirit. The cleansing and the life. AMEN. FROM THIS GOD FORMED THE MECHANICS, THE WORDS AND THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPIRIT THAT TOGETHER MAKES THE WIFE OF THE LAMB. AND SHE CARRIES HIS SPIRIT AND CARRIES HIS WORD, THE COMPLETE MECHANICS AND DYNAMICS AND THEREFORE CAN ONLY MANIFEST WHAT HE IS BECAUSE SHE IS HIM IN BRIDE FORM. &gt;&gt; If you IF I COULD GET IT TO YOU, WE LOOK FOR THE COMING OF CHRIST AND WE WILL MEET HIM IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER HE COME FIRST IN WORD FORM TO A PROPHET TO SHOUT. HE COMES SECOND AS VOICE &gt;&gt; OF THE ARCHANGEL in a bride, &gt;&gt; the word made flesh and he will finally come and manifest himself materially, literally &gt;&gt; in groom form in the meeting in the air. &gt;&gt; But he's got the word has to take on flesh. &gt;&gt; And this is invisible union not to church system but to the risen word Christ. Now, so, so the church as we, you know, just apply the type the CHURCH WHEN SHE TRIES TO UNITE CREED AND DOGMA with the pure word of God, she is AN ADULTERESS. SHE CANNOT be married to the law, whether it be THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW or law of sin and death or nor DENOMINATIONAL &gt;&gt; AND BE MARRIED TO CHRIST, THE WORD AT THE SAME TIME. YOU CAN'T HAVE two husbands. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PAUL WAS TEACHING TO CRY AT CHRIST. The church I mean cannot be married to the LAW AND MARRIED TO CHRIST at the same time. It is spiritual adultery. NOW THIS WAS HAPPENING in the early church. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY PAUL IS DEALING WITH THIS SUBJECT. HE SAID THERE IS ACTUALLY SPIRITS OF ADULTERY IS GOING on &gt;&gt; in the message community. &gt;&gt; AND IN ACTS 15 WE READ OF CERTAIN MEN WHO CLAIMED TO BE believers but was still Pharisee at heart. &gt;&gt; And though they HAD OUTWARDLY JOINED the early church and but inwardly they were still clinging to the law of Moses. AND THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO BRING THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH BORN BY THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST AT PENTECOST BACK UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF THE LAW. &gt;&gt; AND AND PAUL FILLED WITH REVELATION. HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I GAVE PLACE TO THEM NOT ONE NOT FOR ONE MINUTE." &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE HE HE STOOD THERE TO THE GALATIANS. And you READ IN GALATIANS, HE'S ALSO DEALING WITH THE SAME THING. HE IDENTIFIES IT AS A BEWITCHED spirit &gt;&gt; saying, "OH FOOLISH GALATIANS, WHO HATH BEWITCHED YOU?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He made no bones about it. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT MIX THE OLD system &gt;&gt; with the new. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE MADE IT CLEAR AND HE CONDEMNED THOSE PREACHERS AS FALSE BRETHREN. BROTHER PAUL DIDN'T PAY. &gt;&gt; He called them false brothers. He called it a bewitching spirit. &gt;&gt; You know that's an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he he flatly in the book of Romans, he flatly calls it adultery. &gt;&gt; SINCE IT'S ADULTERY TO STILL BE MARRIED TO that law &gt;&gt; and claiming this grace. AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THE NEW COVENANT, WE MUST BE DEAD TO THE LAW IN ORDER TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST. AND HE SAID, "LORD, KNOW YOU NOT, BRETHREN, THE LAW HAD DOMINION OF A MAN AS LONG AS HE LIVETH. WHEREFORE, my brethren, YOU BECOME DEAD TO THE LAW BY THE BODY OF CHRIST THAT YOU SHOULD BE MARRIED to another." And he made it personal, too. He said, "This ain't just for you. IT'S FOR ME. I COUNT IT ALL [screaming] AS DONE &gt;&gt; AND ALL IS LOSS &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT win Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; SO TO TRY TO EMBRACE MOSES LAW AND THE GRACE OF CHRIST IS SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. YOU CANNOT [screaming] BE MARRIED TO two husband. Neither can you serve two masters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TODAY. JUST AS THERE WERE CERTAIN MEN IN PAUL'S DAY TRYING TO MIX LAW WITH GRACE, WE HAVE CERTAIN MEN TODAY TRYING TO MIX DENOMINATIONAL DOCTRINE WITH the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; AND MANY ATTEMPT TO HOLD ON TO DENOMINATIONAL HEADSHIP, whether it's in creed or traditions OR THEOLOGICAL EMPHASIS, CLAIMING ALL THE WHILE TO BE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. And yet SUBMIT TO DENOMINATION WHILE CLAIMING CHRIST IS A BRIDEGROOM. It it's it's it's spiritual adultery. And just as the early church had to be delivered FROM THE LAW, THE BRIDE IN THIS HOUR must be delivered now listen from the spirit of denominationalism. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE WERE DELIVERED A LONG TIME AGO &gt;&gt; FROM denomination by name. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE delivered &gt;&gt; from the spirit of denominationalism. &gt;&gt; Now, LET ME JUST TAKE A FEW. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU YOU CANNOT FORCE PENTECOSTAL THEOLOGY UPON THE BRIDE BY INSISTING THAT SPEAKING IN TONGUES IS the evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT BELONGS TO THE CHURCH AGE THAT IS PASSED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S AN OLD HUSBAND. NOR CAN YOU IMPORT EVANGELICAL EASE, I call it easy belieism, BY CLAIMING THAT THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST is believing the message without having a personal experience with Christ. &gt;&gt; The new birth is more than a mental ascent. &gt;&gt; It is a supernatural birth. IT IS AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE BRIDE CANNOT BE A HYBRID AND NEITHER CAN HER CHILDREN. AND THE BRIDE MUST NOT BE A MIXTURE. SHE IS A WORD BRIDE UNITED WITH CHRIST THE WORD NOT A HYBRID BETWEEN denominations and the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE CANNOT BE BLENDED with Pentecostalism, EMOTIONALISM OR EVANGELICAL INTELLECTUALISM. &gt;&gt; IT MUST STAND ALONE. AND IT MUST BE PURE, UNPOLLUTED, spirit revealed. &gt;&gt; So let IT LET US DO LIKE PAUL SAID. I I COUNT IT ALL THAT LOSS. &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT win Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BE F BEING FOUND FAITHFUL TO ONE HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, now Jesus warned what happens when we have the wrong union. He said he would throw the church into the bed of fornication and kill her children with death. So her converts die spiritually. &gt;&gt; And if a believer claims to belong to Christ yet continues to flirt with the world, &gt;&gt; listen to me now. If sin and worldliness OR THE OLD NATURE STILL RULE OVER THEM, they're committing spiritual fornication. &gt;&gt; Christ simply will not share his bride with another lover. &gt;&gt; PAUL USES A NATURAL EXAMPLE TO EXPOSE the hypocrisy and and and I meant by that brother Brandham used that example. He said if if if young women were engaged and she saw her fi fiance fiance kissing other girls and then heard him say I love you honey she'd call him what he is a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE CONSIDER THIS. WE'RE NOT ONLY IN CASE WE ARE MARRIED TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HIS WIFE ORDAINED TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN OF HIS SPIRIT. SO I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE A HUSBAND coming home and finding his wife who claims devotion to him and him only has spent her her affection with another man. Now even THOUGH SHE MAY BE OUTWARDLY appear beautiful and her heart though is divided, her love IS NOT PURE, IT DOESN'T BELONG TO HIM ALONE AND NO MAN, NO REAL MAN WOULD TOLERATE THAT UNFAITHFULNESS. See you sisters likewise. Imagine your husband returning home not only unfaithful but carrying the diseases of immoral living. &gt;&gt; You'd recoil in heartbreak and disgust. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS GOD'S CONTROVERSY WITH THE MODERN CHURCH TODAY. THE MODERN CHURCH IS AFFLICTED WITH SPIRITUAL DISEASES. AMEN. FOLKS, DOCTRINES, WORLDLY ALLIANCES, DENOMINATIONAL CONTROL, LUKEWARMNESS, COMPROMISE. Are you hearing me? Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS IT? I I'M GOING TO USE BROTHER BRANDON'S TERM. IT IS SPIRITUAL VENERIAL DISEASE &gt;&gt; CORRUPTS THE BODY OF CHRIST WITH EVERY KIND OF ISM AND WORLDLY INFLUENCE. I say God be merciful. Jesus is coming &gt;&gt; and he's coming for a pure bride. &gt;&gt; One that's found faithful to him. &gt;&gt; And in order to be married to Christ, one union has to die. That's the law of God that says so. He will not live in adultery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And creeds are man-made. And the word is God breathed and they're contrary to one to the other. &gt;&gt; And the church SAYS, "WE BELIEVE THIS, BUT WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT." NO BRIDE OF CHRIST TALKS LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THE WHOLE WORD. TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST, SHE'S MARRIED TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. THE WORD WAS WITH GOD. THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH. AND CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE IS THE WORD. AND HE'LL FOREVER BE THE WORD. AND THE BRIDE IS MARRIED TO HIM. AND TO BE MARRIED TO HIM, SHE'S GOT TO BE A WORD BRIDE. &gt;&gt; SO SHE CANNOT BE BOUND TO A WORLDLY ORGANIZATION AND BE bound to Christ. Simultaneously. THE TWO HUSBANDS STAND OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER. ONE AS GOD SAID, the other's man-made. And God said, "Let every man's word be a lie. Let mine be true. So now notice here that she BY GOD has been given a verdict and the verdict says she is an adulteress. &gt;&gt; Now you know sometimes sometimes some of you recoil because I use the word and harlot. God used the word and harlot. Amen. &gt;&gt; She is an adulteress. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ADULTERESS WILL GOD TAKE AS HIS BRIDE? &gt;&gt; HE WILL NOT. &gt;&gt; He forbids it. AND THE CHILDREN BORN FROM SOME SUCH UNION OR WHAT? THEY'RE ILLEGITIMATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not illegitimate to the church system. No, they're they're his. but they're illegitimate to the word. And that is a picture of Leodysa in Revelation 3, a denominational hybrid, lukewarm, self-satisfied, claiming Christianity, denying the power, a form of godliness, but rejecting the life that makes the bride spotless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so let's reflect on this a minute. Marriage is the oldest institution ever given to mankind. And before a church, before government, before schools or nations, there was marriage in Eden. AND GOD HAD ENTRUSTED THE woman with a serious sacred virtue, &gt;&gt; a purity that she must guard. Now, this is going to get a little tight. It'll get, you know, it'll get a little bumpy. So, put your seat belts on. I pro promise to land you. Okay. Now as we look at this, God entrusted a woman with a sacred virtue of purity. She must guard it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND IF SHE DEFILES THAT VIRTUE THROUGH FORNICATION, YEAH, she may be forgiven, but she cannot be justified in this life. The scar remains as long as she lives. Now, I want to be clear. When we say that a woman who loses her virtue through fornication may be forgiven but not justified in this life, we don't mean by that that she's unredeemable &gt;&gt; or that she's unfit for marriage. We are simply acknowledging two biblical truths. One, God forgives sin when it's confessed. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as John first John or Mark 3 says, there is no sin except blasphemy against the Holy Ghost that God refuses to pardon. So fornication is not the unpardonable sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And but however, here's the other truth. Forgiveness does not erase earthly consequences. &gt;&gt; And this is what is meant. SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN THIS LIFE. It means that natural consequences remain even after God has forgiven her. &gt;&gt; Now let's just talk about that for a minute because a lot of people get confused. They think, "Oh, glory to God. I'm forgiven. All the consequences of sin is gone." Wrong. &gt;&gt; No. There's a law of sewing and reaping. Yes. &gt;&gt; Whatever you sow, &gt;&gt; you're going TO REAP. &gt;&gt; LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE. DAVID was forgiven for his sin. &gt;&gt; And when he was confronted by the prophet, he confessed and the Lord responded, "The Lord has put away thy sin. Thou shalt not die." &gt;&gt; However, WHILE FORGIVENESS REMOVED THE GUILT AND SPARED HIS LIFE, IT DID NOT REMOVE the consequences. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seeds he had SOWN THROUGH ADULTERY WITH BASHEBA and the murder OF URIAH BEGAN to produce a bitter harvest &gt;&gt; WITHIN HIS LIFE AND HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He would even, you know, it would it would even be death OF THE FIRST CHILD AND THEN FROM THERE a harvest over and over and over. I mean, THEY CONTINUE PAYING OVER AND OVER AND over &gt;&gt; from these seeds that was sowed. Nathan warned him. This is what he warned. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID, "THE LORD HAS FORGIVEN YOU. YOU WON'T DIE." HE SAID, "BUT the sword will never depart from your house. You did it secretly, but this thing I will do, I I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son." And the Bible tells you that it came to pass. Look what happened. His son Amnen raped his halfsister Tamar. &gt;&gt; Abselum Tamar's brother led a rebellion against David and a bold and shameful act. He took his concubines and his wives and violated them publicly on the rooftop &gt;&gt; which fulfilled Nathan's prophecy. And though David had repented and was restored spiritually, the natural consequences of his sins continued to unfold, affecting his children, even his kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE HAD SOWN TO THE WIND, BUT NOW HE WAS REAPING THE WHIRLWIND. &gt;&gt; And here's the lesson from this. DAVID'S STORY REMINDS US THAT SIN ALWAYS BRINGS A HARVEST. YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU SOW, &gt;&gt; you you know you sin pays wages. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SIN, YOU'RE GOING TO GET REWARDS FROM IT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOOD REWARDS. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN WHEN GOD FORGIVES, WHAT WE SOW CAN STILL AFFECT OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO US. And hidden sins MAY BE OUT OF VIEW FOR A TIME, BUT it's still a seed in the ground. &gt;&gt; You may can hide it good, but it's seed in the ground. &gt;&gt; And without true repentance and mercy of God, it's going to grow into sorrow. &gt;&gt; Forgiveness restores our STANDING WITH BEFORE GOD, but it does NOT REMOVE THE SCARS or the ripple effects left BEHIND IT. THAT'S WHY SCRIPTURE CALLS US NOT ONLY TO REPENT but to flee from sin altogether &gt;&gt; knowing ITS COST IS FAR GREATER THAN THE PLEASURE. &gt;&gt; AND THE POINT IS WHAT WE SOW WE SHALL REAP. &gt;&gt; FOR EXAMPLE, a man can BE FORGIVEN OF HIS DEATH BUT HE STILL MAY ALL RESTITUTION. A MAN PARDONED BY GOD FINDS HIS PLACE AT AN ALTAR, GETS A GENUINE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST may have to go to jail &gt;&gt; for his crimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a woman, are you with me? &gt;&gt; So a woman who has lost her virginity cannot return to the physical state &gt;&gt; of virginity. That's right. &gt;&gt; Though her heart can be made clean and pure before God &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with her standing as a Christian. &gt;&gt; And this is what is meant by the scar remains. It's not a moral stain before God because God removes that. But it's a natural reality. It just it's something you did that can't be undone. &gt;&gt; And I want to get this clear. She's not second class. &gt;&gt; She's not unworthy. She's not unfit FOR MARRIAGE. GOD FORGIVES. GOD RESTORES. God's make new. SHE'S PRECIOUS. SHE'S VALUABLE. SHE'S BELOVED BY GOD as any other daughter of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And no scripture teaches she's unworthy to be a wife or a mother. No sir. But I want you to get confession brings cleansing and freedom. And that's all that's meant here. She acknowledges the sin. God forgives the sin. She's restored in fellowship with God, but it must be confessed to her husband for for marriage. And and and I want to say something. Don't think you boys are getting off light &gt;&gt; because I got word for you too. &gt;&gt; Same is true for the man. He too must confess. &gt;&gt; Marriage should be entered into with full disclosure. &gt;&gt; Amen. But forgiveness does not literally restore the physical condition. It's only and that's the only sense in which justification is not possible in the body in this life. So as we look at this again, it's important to note and here's where I'm talking to you young men that purity IS NOT PLACED ONLY ON YOUNG WOMEN. GOD REQUIRES HOLINESS FROM BOTH SEXES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now Paul Paul said in in 1 Corinthians chapter 4:E3 and he said this IS THE WILL OF GOD. And then HE CONTINUES THAT EVERY ONE OF YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO POSSESS HIS VESSEL in sanctification and honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of you. THAT MEANS YOUNG MEN TOO. HE MUST HONOR HIS BODY, DISCIPLINE HIS PASSIONS. HE MUST WALK CLEAN BEFORE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; And God doesn't have two standards. One for his daughters and one for his sons, a lighter one for his sons. You know, he doesn't do that. HE SAYS CLEARLY, "FLEE FORNICATION." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THIS COMMAND IS IS TO ALL BELIEVERS. A YOUNG MAN WHO MISUSES HIS BODY, HIS EYES, HIS IMAGINATION IS JUST AS ACCOUNTABLE as any young woman who misuses hers. &gt;&gt; Now, let's understand why is this so important? Because purity protects the future. &gt;&gt; A young man who keeps himself pure, he honors the woman that he will marry one day. a young man that keeps himself pure, protects his future home. He guards his spiritual authority. This is real important. He enters marriage with a clean conscience. And and so he it's very very important. And this stands out to me that he must protect HIS SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY BECAUSE GOD DESIGNED THE MAN TO BE HEAD OF the home. &gt;&gt; BUT THE HEADSHIP IS NOT GRANTED AUTOMATICALLY. &gt;&gt; BUT HEADSHIP IS EARNED THROUGH INTEGRITY, PURITY, AND OBEDIENCE TO GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And a YOUNG MAN WHO COMPROMISES SEXUALLY WITH THE WOMAN HE HOPES TO MARRY DAMAGES THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THAT AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; AND HERE'S WHY. HE cannot lead her into sin and then lead her into spirituality. &gt;&gt; AND A MAN CANNOT GUIDE A WOMAN INTO DISOBEDIENCE AND THEN EXPECT HER TO FOLLOW HIM IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO IF HE PRESSES HER, IF HE PERSUADES HER, OR IF HE JUST SILENTLY ALLOWS HER TO CROSS MORAL BOUNDARIES, HE IS FAILING IN LEADERSHIP LONG BEFORE THE MARRIAGE EVER BEGINS. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN HE SAY LATER SAY, "FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW CHRIST." when he when she remembers a time he led her away from Christ. &gt;&gt; A WOMAN MAY FORGIVE AND GOD MAY FORGIVE. But here's the secret. Here's the glitch. Memories of failure weaken trust. &gt;&gt; Memories of failure weakens trust because why? He respects he wounds her respect for his leadership. A woman's deepest respect from her husband comes when she sees his restraint, &gt;&gt; his strength, his self-control, and his willingness, his willingness to protect her purity. And if he fails in that, then she realizes HE DID NOT PROTECT ME when it mattered most. And this MAY NOT EVEN BE SPOKEN ALOUD. SHE MAY NEVER SAY THAT TO HIM, BUT IT SETTLES into the emotional memory of the marriage. AND SHE MAY ACTUALLY LOVE HIM DEEPLY, BUT THE AUTOMATIC TRUST THAT HEADSHIP REQUIRES WILL BE HARDER FOR HER TO GIVE. AND HE WILL CARRY THIS GUILT into marriage. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF FORGIVEN, THE MEMORY REMAINS. &gt;&gt; And a MAN WHO KNOWS HE FAILED MORALLY, this is what he often experiences. He will experience insecurity about leading spiritually. He will he will have hesitation in correcting spiritual issues. He will have guilt but discussing purity with his children. You see that becomes A SHADOW OVER HIS CONFIDENCE. He senses WHETHER IT'S REAL OR IMAGINE THAT HE THAT HE FORFEITED PART OF HIS MORAL authority and the enemy then will come. Oh, don't you think you don't have an enemy? &gt;&gt; HE WILL USE THAT FAILURE AGAINST YOU. HE LOVES TO ATTACK LEADERSHIP. &gt;&gt; AND ANY MORAL FAILURE BECOMES SOMETHING THE ENEMY CAN WHISPER, "Who are you to lead this home?" &gt;&gt; SO GUESS WHAT? WITH THIS CONDEMNATION, THE MAN WILL FORFEIT SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP. AND YOU'LL FIND THAT MANY times he will feel unworthy and will fail TO LEAD HIS FAMILY in devotion and prayers. And the enemy whispers over again, you feel, you failed her once, you'll fail against &gt;&gt; and you're no spiritual example. And a compromised past becomes a spiritual foothold to the enemy that he exploits in moments of conflict or temptation. &gt;&gt; And this hurts his own ability to model Christ because THEY ARE BY THE WORD TO REFLECT CHRIST'S LOVE. &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST LOVE IS A LOVE THAT PROTECTS NOT EXPLOITS. CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF FOR THE CHURCH. HE NEVER TOOK FROM HER. HE NEVER PRESSURED HER, NEVER USES HER. WHEN A MAN KEEPS HIMSELF PURE, HE MODELS CHRIST. WHEN HE FAILS, HE MODELS ADAM. I MEAN FALLEN Adam &gt;&gt; who went with his wife into sin and failed to shield her from it. And when you remain faithful to the word though, it builds confidence and not shame. And a man who keeps his purity enters marriage with a clean conscience, a spiritual boldness, a moral confidence, a sense that of being a protector, not a transgressor. And and and AUTHORITY THEN WILL FLOW FROM THAT OBEDIENCE. &gt;&gt; And and therefore, he can pray boldly. He can speak boldly. HE CAN LEAD BOLDLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT PURITY SETS HIM UP for lifong respect. A woman who marries a man who PROTECTED HER PURITY WILL ALWAYS CARRY A DEEP enduring respect. He honored God. He He honored me. He proved he could lead before he ever became my husband. And that respect becomes the soil in which headship thrives. &gt;&gt; Of course, there's forgiveness. But you reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; It's a law of God. &gt;&gt; If you sow that which is wrong, you'll eat its fruits. I'm going to give you a scripture in Proverbs 1:29 that's very, very something you need to take close to your heart. For they that hated knowledge and did not choose to reverence the Lord, to give honor to his word, the fear of the Lord, they would have none of my counsel. They wouldn't listen. They despise all my reproof. Therefore, they shall eat the fruit of their own way. I want you to understand, IT AIN'T EVEN GOD PUNISHING YOU. YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN. IS THAT WHEN YOU HATE KNOWLEDGE, AND YOU DON'T RESPECT THE LORD, YOU REFUSE HIS COUNSEL, YOU DESPISE HIS REPROOF AND CORRECTION, THEN YOU WILL EAT THE BITTER fruits &gt;&gt; of your own way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus said, "Blessed are they that are pure in heart." And purity prepares a man to be a godly husband, a father. Purity builds character. It a man who controls his desire while young, he becomes strong in discipline, stable in judgment, faithful in marriage, trusted in leadership. The same Holy Spirit that keeps a young woman chased will keep a young man honorable in chase. Purity is an expression of love. A a young MAN'S PURITY IS A GIFT THAT HE GIVES FIRST TO GOD, THEN TO HIS FUTURE WIFE AND TO HIMSELF. YOU SEE, IT'S A SIGN OF MATURITY and reverence. PURITY FOR BEFORE MARRIAGE EQUALS FAITHFULNESS AFTER MARRIAGE. A MAN WHO RESTRAINS HIS SELF BEFORE MARRIAGE IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO STAY FAITHFUL AFTER MARRIAGE. THE HABITS HE FORMS NOW BECOMES THE CHARACTERS he lives with later. SO YOU KNOW BUT HOWEVER BOTH OF YOU STAND EQUAL under the Christ under the cross if if a young man has fallen the same grace that forgives a young woman forgives him also. HE MUST REPENT. HE MUST CONFESS. HE MUST WALK CLEAN FROM THAT MOMENT ON. BUT THE SERIOUSNESS REMAINS. GOD EXPECTS MEN TO HONOR THEIR BODIES &gt;&gt; JUST AS HE EXPECTS A WOMAN TO to honor theirs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's something commanded for both young men and women is fornication is sin for both sexes. Purity builds strength and character and future faithfulness in both of them. A godly man or woman honors God's honors God by how they treat their own body. But grace is available for anyone who's following. BUT LET'S GO BACK TO this just for a moment. WHAT ABOUT THIS WOMAN? WHY IS THIS SO SACRED? NOW, now listen, church. I know you're really listening, but I hope you're not walking out of here like a scalded dog. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to whip you. I'm trying to instruct you &gt;&gt; in righteousness &gt;&gt; so now let's go back TO THE WOMAN. WHY IS THIS SO SACRED? Because her body is the bedding ground &gt;&gt; for life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No woman or excuse me, no animal, NO DOG, BEAST, OR BIRD SHARES THIS TRUST. Only the woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WOMAN BEARS THE ABILITY TO BRING FORTH HUMAN LIFE TO THE EARTH. AND GOD GAVE HER THIS STEWARDSHIP. AND PAUL USES THIS TO TYPE THE CHURCH. AND THERE ARE THREE SACRED TRUSTS OF A woman that a mirror to the church that you and I want you to keep the church in mind when we do it. There is NUMBER ONE A SACRED VIRTUE, purity of life. Keep the church in mind. Sacred womanhood, her conduct and character before men. sacred motherhood to honor her husband and children. I'm not getting this out the air. I'm I'm preaching to you from invisible union. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE GIVEN BY GOD. She must not betray them. &gt;&gt; If a woman has fallen into sin before marriage, she's got to confess that to her husband for before the union. Just as the church who lived under the law MUST CONFESS HER PAST before she can enter her into her union with Christ Lord. That old husband has to BE DEAD. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU WONDER WHY AIN'T CHRIST MARRIED TO ME? HOW COME I SOUGHT FOR THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; IS THAT HUSBAND DEAD? IS A WORLDLY ATTRACTION TO HIM OVER. &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't just divorce him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's got to be dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, as we look at this, I want you to get THE CONCEPT. IF THE WOMAN HIDES it even for 10 years or Brother Brandon said or however long and the husband retains the God-given right to put her away for fornication is unclean living. &gt;&gt; And here's a Bible example. Let me show you one. Joseph in the Bible, a just man, sought to put away Mary privately &gt;&gt; until God revealed that the child was of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He had a right to put her away. Now, so there is sacred womanhood. Her conduct for men, you know, he will I I want you to understand, you want GOD TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU, HE WILL NOT UNVEIL OR REVEAL HIMSELF TO EVERYONE or anyone. JUST HIS BRIDE, NOT THESE FLIRTS. &gt;&gt; Now remember, YOU KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE IS? IS GOD WHISPERING HIS LOVE secrets to you? &gt;&gt; And and HE JUST LET HIS church know that, you know, to to them. Let them go marry who they want to. As many times they want to do what they want to live the way they WANT TO DRESS THE WAY THEY LET THEM DO WHATEVER THAT'S THEM. BUT NOT YOU. &gt;&gt; You're married to Christ. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S WHISPERED TO YOU THE LOVE SECRETS, &gt;&gt; WHICH SHOWS YOU YOU'RE HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT REVEALING THIS TO THE FLATTERERS, ONLY HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; You're the only one privileged. The rest of them, the book is closed to them. &gt;&gt; The seals are not open. &gt;&gt; Amen. And yet they all claim to be the bride. But one day their folly will be made manifest when Jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said, "This is her." And away he goes with her. &gt;&gt; So character matters. Appearance matters. Oh my. Oh, &gt;&gt; I made a promise to myself and I ain't going to keep it. I'm I'm going to clinch this. But Harold helps every devil in hell. &gt;&gt; Her character reveals her. A WOMAN IS NOT DEFILED NOT or she's defiled not ONLY BY THE ACT, BUT SHE'S DEFILED BY allowing herself TO BE USED AS AN OBJECT of lust. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, you can take the HEADSHIP OF DENOMINATION, WEAR YOUR SHORTS, YOUR TIGHT PANTS, AND YOUR TIGHT AND REVEALING CLOTHES AND YOUR MAKEUP AND LOOK LIKE A HARLOT AND DRESS LIKE a &gt;&gt; But you can't in this bride &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE, SHE IS NOT YOU'RE NOT JUST DEFILED BY THE ACT, BUT BUT BY ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE USED AS AN OBJECT of lust. That's &gt;&gt; right. AND THAT'S WHY A HOLY WOMAN WILL NOT PUT HERSELF OUT THERE AS AN OBJECT OF LUST. NOW, WHY IS WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE TODAY? THIS WASN'T an issue hundreds of YEARS AGO IS BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD has glamorized the lips and passion, sex glands in the lip, a kiss of of lustes, ADULTERY, AND SEED FORM. AND THAT'S WHY OUR MORALS ARE ROTTEN TODAY BECAUSE LITTLE CHILDREN HAVE been climatized &gt;&gt; AND RAISED BEFORE MOVIE SCREENS that are filled with fornication and uncleanness. AND IT HAS FULFILLED A PROPHECY IN THE LAST DAYS. &gt;&gt; Now keep the church in view. The church HAS BEEN DOING THE SAME THING, KISSING AND SLOPPING WITH EVERY SYSTEM BUT THE WORD. SHE EMBRACES SCIENCE FALSELY SO-CALLED WORLDLY EDUCATION, exalted reasoning over revelation, CIVILIZATION BUILT ON DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE. I'M I'M I am sharing with you from the message &gt;&gt; and THIS ENTIRE PRESENT ORDER IS ANTICHRIST. &gt;&gt; NO, not reading writing and arithmetic. No, not that. But but let me tell you the spirit that is behind modern civilization And God will bring a civilization one day where there there will be no death. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS PRESENT ONE HAS BEEN BIRTHED BY SATAN. This is Satan's Ed. &gt;&gt; And women have LOST THEIR SHAME BECAUSE THE CHURCH HAS LOST HER. AND MANY OF THEM REFLECT THE THE WOMAN LEODYY OF THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR, BLIND, AND NAKED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Yet they're saying they're rich increase with goods. &gt;&gt; And we love Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND WOMEN DRESSED TO ENTICE, TWISTING IN THE STREET, CLOTHED IN GARMENTS THAT GOD FORBADE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEY CLAIM VIRTUE TO THEIR HUSBAND. AND BUT JESUS SAID, "WHOSOEVER LOOKTH UPON A woman to lust after her, they committed adultery with her always already. Because if she presentth herself &gt;&gt; to be lusted after, she shares in that sin. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; TODAY, THE MODERN WOMAN IS STRIPPED DOWN TO HER UNDERWEAR. &gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S UNDERWEAR, THE UNDERGARMENTS, &gt;&gt; STRIPPED DOWN TO THAT, PARADES OUT ON THE STREET, GOES to church in them, &gt;&gt; sings in the choir, What is it? IF SHE PRESENTS HERSELF TO BE LUSTED AFTER, she shares in that sin. &gt;&gt; So the church presents to the WORLD AND SHE'S DRESSED IN CREEDS AND PROGRAMS AND POLITICS AND INSTITUTIONS INSTEAD OF THE WORD. AND WHAT HAS SHE DONE? SHE'S went out, you know, building hospitals, erecting colleges, join councils of men, and all them have their place. But Jesus never commanded that. HE SAID, "PREACH THE WORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. And she has left the word and eml EM EMBRACED A CONGLOMERATION OF SUBSTITUTES. BUT THE BRIDE IS CALLED TO PRESERVE THE WORD TO PRESERVE the spirit to remain A VIRGIN. BUT HOLLYWOOD HAS STRIPPED THE B THE THE VIRTUE OF THE WOMAN TODAY. AND THAT where now WHAT ONCE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO BE arrested for insanity. Right? &gt;&gt; AND IF IT WAS INSANE THEN, IT'S INSANE NOW. &gt;&gt; And the EVIDENCE OF ALL OF THIS IS MORAL INSANITY, MURDER, VIOLENCE. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S REVELATION, PREDICTION, RISING FROM THE DEPTHS UNTIL MEN WILL CRY FOR THE ROCKS TO FALL ON THEM. &gt;&gt; It's total insanity. and it's marching down the street right into the CHURCH PEWS. AND HOW did it happen? It happened through the same serpent that entered Eden. The church became the mouthpiece of deception. It's okay. Now, I I want you to understand the woman don't put on them kind of clothes today and say, you know, I'm going to go naked today. Eve wasn't rebellious. She was deceived. &gt;&gt; And we got a society that's been deceived by television, &gt;&gt; magazines, fashion, culture, social media. Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of you ladies see this filth on social media that some of these girls are wearing and Google over it &gt;&gt; and talk about how beautiful they look &gt;&gt; when they've dressed like and harlots. &gt;&gt; Shame on you. &gt;&gt; You embarrass me. But you know, they think they're right. &gt;&gt; You know, THEIR LOVER DON'T CARE. &gt;&gt; THEIR JESUS doesn't care. &gt;&gt; You see, they think they're right. Yet, they're dead and they DON'T KNOW IT. BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN SIN, the woman who lives in pleasure, YOU KNOW, IS DEAD WHILE SHE LIVES. AND THE CHURCH LIKEWISE IS DECEIVED AND SEDUCED AND BLINDED AND VEILED NOT BY GOD BUT BY SATAN HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; And you can see you don't and and &gt;&gt; let me read you a scripture. Let me read you a scripture because Jesus spoke about this condition himself. Luke chapter 23 27. There followed him a great company of people and of women that bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming." Watch now. THEY SHALL SAY, "BLESSED ARE THE BARREN AND THE wombs that never bear." Then they SHALL SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS FOLLOWING US TO THE hills cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall THEY DO IN THE DRY? So Jesus warned, listen me now. He warned of a time that bearing children would even be despised. &gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE ARRIVED AND IT'S BROUGHT INSANITY TOO. We live in a very strange hour. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to hurry. But we live IN A VERY STRANGE HOUR WHERE MANY PEOPLE DO over their pets &gt;&gt; with a the KIND OF AFFECTION AND CELEBRATION AND ATTENTION THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS gave their children and THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG with loving an animal and owning a pet. I've owned many of them and God gave them and and they they can be wonderful for companionship and care. But but something deeper's happening &gt;&gt; when we have A CULTURE THAT REPLACES CHILDREN with pets &gt;&gt; AND EVEN DESPISES THE IDEA OF BEARING AND RAISING CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY IT AIN'T HAPPENING. HOW MANY ABORTIONS ARE ACROSS THE NATION? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT [screaming] THE BIRTH CONTROL THAT'S GOING ON? &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about something to space children and in the marriage and what I'm talking about to forbid having children. &gt;&gt; Today we see couples choosing pets over children. &gt;&gt; WE SEE GRANDPARENTS GIVING THEIR CHILDREN. I you know actually they're grieving. grandparents, many of them grieving BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN REFUSED TO HAVE FAMILIES. &gt;&gt; I read a NEWS REPORT WHERE MANY OF PEOPLE WAS NOT GOING TO HOME FOR THANKSGIVING BECAUSE THEIR FAMILY WAS NOW THEIR PETS. IT'S A GENERATION THAT GUSHES OVER FUR BABIES, &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SEES REAL BABIES AS INCONVENIENCE, A BURDEN, OR EVEN A THREAT TO personal freedom. &gt;&gt; And at THE SAME TIME, MILLIONS OF UNBORN CHILDREN ARE ABORTED OR DISCARDED OR SPOKEN OF AS TISSUE, not persons. What has happened to society? They have drifted from a God centered to self-centered. &gt;&gt; The Bible said men would be lovers of their own selves without natural affection. &gt;&gt; And it means that the GOD-GIVEN INSTINCTS FOR FAMILY, for motherhood, for fatherhood, and sacrificial love has been gone. AND WHEN SELF BECOMES THE IDOL, ANYTHING THAT COSTS US TIME or energy or responsibility feels like bondage. And pets offer AFFECTION WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY. CHILDREN REQUIRE SACRIFICE AND DISCIPLINE AND MATURITY, VIRTUES THAT OUR CULTURE NO LONGER CELEBRATES. AND CONVENIENCE BECOMES MORE VALUABLE THAN LIFE. And the modern prize today is career over commitment, &gt;&gt; PLEASURE OVER PURPOSE, &gt;&gt; AUTONOMY over responsibility. &gt;&gt; But children interrupt self-made plans. Pets can be controlled, trained, put away, given away, or put down. But babies must be raised, &gt;&gt; loved, formed. And instead of receiving children as the scripture commands, children are a heritage of the Lord. And said, "Happy is a man whose quiver is full of them." &gt;&gt; And I and I want to speak directly since I'm here, directly to young couples. Don't delay having children. YOU HAVE SO MANY years of life of which you're fertile &gt;&gt; where you have opportunity. &gt;&gt; My wife was nearly 30 when she had Bethany and when she she ran out of energy with her and she said, "If she'd have been my first, she'd have been my last. It wasn't cuz she was a bad child. She was a wonderful child. &gt;&gt; It's cuz she had run out of energy. &gt;&gt; Raising a family, a godly family, is not only a natural joy. It's both a spiritual calling and a moral responsibility. But today, many couples hesitate. Some say we want to be more financially secure first. We need MORE TIME TO ENJOY LIFE BEFORE HAVING KIDS. WELL, I WOULD SAY IT'S WISE to be thoughtful and prayerful in YOUR DECISION. BUT I WANT you to remember this. You will never be wealthy enough, secure enough, or fully ready to have children. &gt;&gt; CHILDREN ALWAYS REQUIRE SACRIFICE, BUT IT IS A SACRIFICE WELL PLEASING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY'RE NOT A BURDEN, &gt;&gt; they're a blessing. &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD GAVE ME FOUR. WE had two THAT WE LOST AND MISCARRIAGE. I wish for and I hope one day I'll see them in heaven if God permits. &gt;&gt; Amen. But one day I I looked AROUND AS I SAW MINE ALL GROWING UP AND I SAID, "HONEY, I wish we'd have had more." Because why? Because why? They are they are a blessing and and and THEY ARE SACRIFICED WELL PLEASING to God. And and they shape your character. &gt;&gt; Yes, they do. THEY DEEPEN YOUR FAITH. THEY REFLECT THE IMAGE OF GOD IN YOUR HOME. YOU GET TO MODEL GOD IN PARENTHOOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. AMEN. DON'T DON'T FEAR OR LET CULTURE ROB YOU OF JOY OR OR THE REWARD OF FAMILY. IF GOD HAS JOINED YOU IN COVENANT MARRIAGE, THEN OH, BE OPEN TO RECEIVE THE FRUIT OF THAT union &gt;&gt; and raise CHILDREN WHO CAN CARRY THE LIFE OF CHRIST TO ANOTHER GENERATION. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE LIKE THE MODERN SOCIETY WHO TREATS WOMEN OR OR treats children as obstacles to happiness. &gt;&gt; We've redefined the family. We dismantled it &gt;&gt; because Satan targets the family. And when headship was rejected, disorder follows. And today, marriage is delayed or abandoned. Cohabitation replaces covenant. Career becomes identity. And pets become children. And this is the fruit of a deeper spiritual war. Destroy the home. Destroy the future. And right now, even in America, our future is in danger as a nation because of lack of families raising children. &gt;&gt; AND THEN WE HAVE THE THE RISE OF THIS THERAPEUTIC CULTURE. EVERYBODY IS a manic depression. EVERYBODY IS YOU POPPING PILLS one after another. AND OUR CULTURE BELIEVES EMOTIONAL COMFORT IS THE HIGHEST GOOD. AND THESE PETS, THEY PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL AFFECTION WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT CHILDREN EXPOSES OUR OWN WEAKNESSES. THEY STRETCH US. THEY MATURE US. THEY FORCE US TO GROW. &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT AVOIDS DISCOMFORT NATURALLY AVOIDS THE REFINING WORK OF PARENTHOOD. And a SOCIETY THAT REJECTS GOD REJECTS LIFE. AND WHEN GOD IS REMOVED FROM EDUCATION, FROM MARRIAGE, from sexuality, FROM MORALITY, THEN THE VALUE OF THE HUMAN LIFE collapses &gt;&gt; and THE SPIRIT OF ABORTION IS THE SPIRIT OF PHARAOH AND THE spirit of HEROD IS REVIVED AGAIN. IT IS A HATRED OF INNOCENT LIFE THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF PERSONAL POWER. And now YOU EVEN HEAR MESSAGE KIDS SAYING, MESSAGE GIRLS SAYING, "IT'S MY BODY." &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, it's not A BODY, IT'S A BABY. &gt;&gt; Not your body. &gt;&gt; It's a life. You were designed to be the bedding ground for that life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a holy thing that God has entrusted you with this virtue. Jesus said Satan was a murderer from the beginning and the culture of death is simply Satan's nature expressed through a godless society and you know this emotional vacuum then of not having children it creates surrogates they feel that need brother Brandham talked about it in an invisible union I I'm getting this from his message &gt;&gt; that people still feel that deep human longing for connection But without God, WITHOUT FAMILY, WITHOUT COMMITMENT, THEY SUBSTITUTE PETS for the children they refuse to have. Pets then will fill the void that they but they cannot create a legacy, a lineage or continuation of life. And what is it? IT IS NOTHING BUT A PROPHETIC SIGN OF THE END TIME. THIS IS THE SAME CULTURAL SHIFT THAT HAPPENED in the days of Rome. It happened to Greece as they began to TO NEAR COLLAPSE. AND NOW THE WESTERN CULTURE IS REPEATING THAT SAME PATTERN. AND THE RISE OF PET BABIES AND DECLINE OF HUMAN BABIES IS A RESULT OF SELF- WORSHIP REPLACING GOD WORSHIP. CONVENIENCE REPLACING COMMITMENT. EMOTIONAL COMFORT REPLACING RESPONSIBILITY. REDEFINITION OF FAMILY AND GENDER ROLES. A CULTURE DEATH REPLACING THE VALUE OF LIFE. THE SPIRITUAL BLINDNESS THAT REJECTS THE BLESSING of children. PROPHETIC CONDITIONS OF THE LAST DAYS BEING FULFILLED. THIS FUR BABY IDENTITY AND THE RISE OF H AND THE RISE OF HUMAN DEGRADATION IS WHEN A SOCIETY ELEVATES animals to the level of children and then the next step is predictable. people begin lowering themselves to the level of animals &gt;&gt; and that's why now we see this bizarre trend &gt;&gt; identifi you know individuals identifying as cats and dogs and fur babies demanding litter boxes in schools &gt;&gt; people wearing collars and tails and animal costumes as identity teachers being forced to play along with this delusion. And this is not simply confusion. This is spiritual insanity. &gt;&gt; IT'S A MANIFESTATION OF ROMANS 1:28. GOD HAS GIVEN THEM OVER TO A REPETATE MIND. NOW A REPETITIVE MIND IS one that has lost THE ABILITY TO DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE OF WHAT between what is human, what's animal, what's sacred, what's profane, what is created in God's image, what is not. And when you elevate humans, you inevitably devalue or when you elevate animals, I meant you inevitably devalue humans. God created man in his image. He gave animals for companionship, labor, enjoyment, but not for identity, lineage, or purpose. And when we have a society that exalts pets as children, that spends money on animal welfare more THAN CHILD WELFARE, CRIES HARDER OVER A DOG'S DEATH THAN the abortion of a child, &gt;&gt; then it's only a matter of time when people begin to forget what it meant to be human. &gt;&gt; And this is the root OF THIS FUR BABY IDENTITY. When you remove God, you remove GOD'S ORDER. AND GOD'S ORDER WAS GOD, MAN IN his image, dead animals. But today, culture has the the order inverted in itself. Pets and children are optional or inconvenient and God's totally out of the picture. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN DIVINE ORDER COLLAPSES, IDENTITY COLLAPSES with it. IF AN ANIMAL BECOMES A CHILD, THEN A CHILD CAN PRETEND TO BE AN ANIMAL. And this IS THE FRUIT OF REJECTING GOD'S CREATED ORDER. &gt;&gt; A generation is only they're only imitated what culture celebrates. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE GOT? ANIMATED MOVIES WHERE animals behave like humans. Social media glorifying pet centered lifestyles. ADULTS CALLING dogs my baby and cats my grandkids. Classrooms forbidding gender terms but valid but validating fantasy identities. &gt;&gt; And they indeed will finally ask, well, if a pet can be a person, why can't I be a pet? And the lines blur because the boundaries that God created have been erased. &gt;&gt; And this is this the sign and the symptoms of a deep spiritual crisis. &gt;&gt; And this trend is not just psychological, it's spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's demonic. And it's the same spirit that drove the demonic of Gatherra to dwell among the tombs naked, acting less like human. And Satan's aim has never changed. That's to destroy the image of of of God and man, and make humans to be behave like beasts, TO STRIP THEM OF IDENTITY AND DIGNITY AND PURPOSE and reason. AND DANIEL SAW THE SAME SPIRIT UH RISE in the empires, they're represented as beast. You see, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD LEAVES A CULTURE, the beast nature rises. &gt;&gt; And there is a judgment for rejecting the truth. BECAUSE WHEN TRUTH IS REJECTED, CONFUSION IS THE RESULT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THEY PROFESS THEMSELVES TO BE WISE AND THEY'RE FOOLS. So society declares it, oh, it's enlightened. Oh, it's enlightened. It's progressive. It's compassionate. Yet children are told they can be cats and wolves and animals and objects or the opposite sex and what they were born or any identity their imagination invents. And meanwhile, the same society denies there's only two biological sexes, that babies in the womb are children, that family is God's design. They're a generation headed for punishment. They're a sign of a culture &gt;&gt; that is under the wrath of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring this down to you. But in all of that, there is a bride on earth &gt;&gt; WHO IS THE BEDDING GROUND &gt;&gt; FOR THE SEED WORD OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS NOT ABORTING HER CHILDREN &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS NOT PRACTICING SPIRITUAL BIRTH CONTROL. &gt;&gt; SHE IS NOT CLOSING HER ALTARS. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. AMEN. SHE IS INVITING THE LUST TO COME AND FIND THEM AND BE MARRIED TO THE BRIDEGROOM &gt;&gt; FOR CHILDREN TO BE BORN. SHE IS CREATING A BEDDING GROUND WITH AN ATMOSPHERE THAT BIRTHS CAN HAPPEN IN. [applause and cheering] IS SOMEBODY WITH ME NOW? SHE IS BRINGING FORTH A TONGUE TALKING LIKE 238 [applause] PRIVATE SCREAMING CHILDREN THAT HAS INCONVENIENCE THE MODERN CHURCH TODAY. [applause] BUT BROTHER, SHE LOVES HER HUSBAND AND THEY ARE IN THE IMAGE OF CHRIST AND THEY ACT LIKE HIS CHILDREN DID ON THE DAY OF Pentecost because they are the same word and the same seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WHAT AN HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN highly favored of God AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY AN ANGEL, the seventh messenger, saying, "You have been chosen, you virgin woman. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE VIRGIN TO HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN AND BORN AGAIN. YOU WERE BIRTHED A NEW AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OLD HUSBAND ANYMORE BECAUSE IN THIS NEW LIFE, IT'S NOT A REMARAGE. IT'S THE FIRST time you were married. [applause] THEREFORE, YOU ARE THE PURE, UNADULTERATED BRIDE IN JESUS CHRIST, CHOSEN, ELECTED, CALLED, AND ORDAINED FOR THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; Bringing forth word children, &gt;&gt; born of his word. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Won't you stand with me? For those of you that was watching time, that was a solid two hours. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Why don't we sing that song? Can't you see why I'm happy?
