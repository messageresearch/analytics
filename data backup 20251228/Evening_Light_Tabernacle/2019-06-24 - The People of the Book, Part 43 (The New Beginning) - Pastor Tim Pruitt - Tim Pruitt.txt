God we serve what a savior what a king what a lord a man we love him today with all our hearts it got good to give us so many blessings a man we're so blessed today to be in the service of the Lord together and we want to welcome those of you from Tennessee that see the Benton's here and some of the Roncalli family and and also we have brothers and sister Beth Kemp who's come to sojourn with us for a while and they come home from Arkansas back to Louisiana where their home was to come back here so we want to just welcome them today and I hope you'll make them a part of the church here and invite them and fellowship with them and it's always important to do that isn't it amen my look at look at that bright spot right over there brother sister HotList here with us this morning god bless you amen and then we welcome you today and then I the Deacons already got a chair set up in the back back there sister Hollis you get a little war-weary or something but you're just welcome to go back there and they got a comfortable chair we want you to be as comfortable as you can and amen what a privilege it is to serve the Lord amen I just want you to take your seats just for a moment I've got a lot of things here today that we want to cover but I just I just thought um as we go I'm thinking today of as you as you see our minister brothers are missing but the michaelis of here with me this morning he said I'll stay up here with you today so amen and but they're out doing the Lord's work they're not out just just goofing off but they're doing the Lord's work but the aaron has been strean out in Virginia and will minister out in South Carolina this Wednesday at brother Jason Watkins brother Timothy's been in North Carolina because we got brother Craig over at brother Jason Jackson's and just a wonderful time already that they've had this been a real blessing and help to brother Jackson and and then of course brother Jo's up in Connecticut with that little group there so you know it's um all over the world the Spirit is moving a man I want to sing that course here in just a moment so you start thinking of that key for that but I just want to remind you that we're in a very very serious hour in a very serious time I don't believe that we have ever as a people ever come to such a poignant moment as what we're in right now it's very very important to realize the hour that we're in and the seriousness of this hour we are coming in one of the last sermons brother Branham preached it was in a public sermon that was the communion service after brother Branham had finished his ministry and the last thing that he done was communion we'll talk about that here in a moment again but in in that he said I believe the days of Ananias and Sapphira are going to return again and that is where sin will not be able allowed to be able to stay in the church and then see the risk lers here god bless you too and so you know it's where sin cannot you know stay in the in the church and and it will be called out well you know what we just had happened at youth camp were we had about in there after about 10 manifestation of demonic spirits very very serious things as we are dealing in a time word where the devil has taken people more in this hour than ever before and last night after brother Timothy ministered in north Linna they had a prayer line I got a text from brother Aaron who was also there to join in prayer as it was facing a very serious demonic manifestation and they've taken young lady back to the back room there and was praying with with her as it was manifesting their spirit growling and speaking out like that and of course when I got the text I dropped to my knees and about 45 minutes later I I got a report of victory that the young sister was debts and Miriam danced and delivered but the demon took her about she was reading books she shouldn't have been reading that's how it come out and you need to start looking at some things very differently I want you to think of this very differently as I told you if some weeks ago in brother branham's time where the little Norman girl Mary Norman took an evil spirit while watching a movie on the Holocaust at a church and and there that thing began to trouble her from then on and brother Branham down there after the meetings in 62 the Grass Valley meetings he prayed for her and he said I saw an evil spirit rise off of her said she'll be all right now and the nightmares and everything stopped after that but I want you to start looking at things very differently when you open yourself up by lust looking upon somebody or something to lust after in your heart in the spirit round now maybe not the physical realm but in the spirit realm it's the same as adultery because this this thing opened this girl up to an evil spirit and again I say this is this is the days of Ananias and Sapphira when you just can't play Church last Sunday I was telling you of a van vision of brother branham's were that he saw death coming and this was in the form of a Mamba snake and he said it was after his brother he was given the power to bind it yet he was told he was told that himself you're going to have to be more sincere in order to bind this spirit of death and I'm telling you we are coming into an hour where it requires a greater sincerity than ever before and as I was telling that I recounted where brother Branham took his Bible because he said the children were getting up and the vision had just come and he said I was praying I said lord I need I need a word from you what must I do you've told me to be more sincere what must I do and and he said you know he said he took the Bible in his hands and he said he said he and he other times he said I don't use this for like a Ouija board or something like that he said just just better aware occasions but he said I took my Bible and it fell open right now my Bible fellow to the Book of Daniel but there it fell over to the book of first Corinthians I believe his first Corinthians where he said that that you know that you've got to come to this feast of the Passover and he said you must come to the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and so he said a feast with the Lord is a fast and he said I must be more sincere he said so I'm going to go and fast and pray and ask God for that more sincerity and I'll tell you what is time more than ever before that we realize we're dealing with issues and times that we enter into a time of darkness like there's never been upon the face of the earth and we've got to be a people who are sincere because then then spirits will call you out for your in sincerity amen it'll call you out for it we've already seen that happen and I just I just want to say the very things sometimes we look at things very frivolous this is not an hour to play Church this is that a nice so far last Sunday when I when I told you that very thing you have a brother Brandon took and opened his Bible and it fell there I don't use this Bible it's one I keep on my desk I don't take it home and don't read from it I don't study from it it's a Bible brother George Hamilton gave me for that it's a actually a kind of a reminiscent of the Scofield Bible brother Branham carried in he had my name put on it and I only carry it to the pulpit I don't study over it's my family if I would die my family looked at it to find my favorite scripture something I underlined ain't a thing underlined and I don't read out of it it's just something I carried the pulpit so that I can have a reference or open it to to something I I don't think it would be much dignity just to walk out with notes or or a pad and not a Bible so you know I like to take my Bible along with me out to the pulpit for reference but when I had not opened it that morning but when I opened it that day now if I try to open it it opens up to the index if I go to where I think because there's a huge huge index here in the back of this Bible starting for about right there is mostly index from their own so as you see I if either tried I'd have missed the book of Corinthians because I'm not familiar with this big big index in it but when I opened it up it opened up to the exact same scripture the brother Branham was pointed to and I showed the three ministers that was on the on the platform that day is a witness that was last Sunday and I would just want to remind you the Holy Spirit is here and he's telling us something very direct and I want us to really I want us to really tune in to what God is speaking and I have something today and there may be a little bit lengthy but we're all mostly message believers here today and so I'm not worried about how long I preach I want to deliver my heart today I have wept moreover the sermon than any sermon I have in years as I just because of as a the Lord speaking to me and making some things that's really real that is pressed on my heart and so I want you to tune in today with all your heart with everything that's within you and the you know you it'll get lengthy and boys on the front seat here I know you're you get a little tired and and you're young and get filled up and you have to go to the restroom don't don't go down these single this sinner I'll ever go out to the side in a way because it disturbs right in the view of the cameras for those that are watching so you know I just just want to say you know we need to come into this service with a deeper sincerity and I want you this to pray as we pray this morning and ask God to speak to you in a very clear way and let this word find a resting place in your heart will you stand together with me now I want us to sing as I'm thinking of even in life being all over the United States today you know here there everywhere north south east west wherever they are ministering out I wants to sing all over the world the Spirit is moving all over the world like the Prophet said it would be a halt over the world is a mighty revelation it's the coming of the Lord as the waters cover the sea a man less worship got together [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I [Music] Oh [Music] Roz [Music] hallelujah Lord Jesus we believe your spirit is looping when we hear what was happening there last night in the Carolinas and the services there this week as we hear Lord reported last week brother my prices Church miraculous things happiness miracles there in the meetings and brother Jason's Lord the Holy Spirit moving right here in the church you're speaking in very supernatural Mass Lord may be in very simplicity but let us not miss your simplicity because God is hidden and revealed in simplicity and I pray God they will not miss today what you're doing that you'll speak your speak in a very direct way did you minister their hearts and lives Lord if you'll deliver the souls of men and women or no God I think I think of just a little request that have come in a little brother from Rhode Island calling him I'm sick I'm meeting I need to need a touch from God Lord may know today that all of the world got Spiritist movement in a move right down in Rhode Island and ministered to his heart made it touch his life today and be healed I send healing today on the wings of this prayer Lord hear of a no friend of mine that just crossed away yesterday 68 our day before yesterday 68 years old Rob Carroll gone in just a moment his little wife frantic needing to touch from you today I pray God that you'll bring a healing to her we don't know when we'll be called out of this round from Marble back to immortality but I pray that you'll make our hearts ready for your coming ever need Lord I pray that you'll supply and bring healing and deliverance today and help us Lord as a prophet said make me more sincere I'm saying the same thing we're facing the enemy we must be more sincere we must be a dedicated consecrated so that people bless us I pray in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you as we here today let's turn to the book of Exodus chapter 12 for our scripture reading this morning looking to the Lord and asking him to speak to us now as we approach this very soberly and sincerely Exodus chapter 12 and verse 1 and the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking to all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house god bless you is you're seated I'm going to be speaking to you from this scripture maybe you didn't see a whole lot in it as we read it there's a little phrase there that just struck my heart the other day that I want to speak to you about and as we Menace this morning and I want to speak on the new beginning and of course we're the people of the book that have returned to the land of the book and for Israel as they retirement was returning to the land it was as it was going back to their origin going back to the beginning we believe as Israel received a messenger from God who brought them the message of the Exodus it was vindicated with signs and wonders even so God has sent a message in this last day and you know so as we come in our thoughts today to the last message I want to just key in on a couple of things um as we believe that we have received the seventh angels message as you know the Bible said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so he declared that would come an hour a day a time where the mystery of God would be finished and and I believe that God's used and vindicated a messenger in this day and set him apart from all the other itinerate evangelist that struck the countries like all Roberts and Billy Graham and the different other greats that are out there as they would call him in today's language God's generals but there was not a man that equalled William Branham because we saw in his ministry the very Ministry of Jesus Christ repeat itself what I mean is that it was not it was of course he was not Jesus Christ he as far from me was a man just like we're men but he was a man to bring forth the message that Jesus Christ has to this endtime people and it's not a new message it's a message that we heard from the beginning that has been distorted by the denominational ages but that I I think some time ago you know I read on a book about killing Lincoln it was by men Nimmo o'reilly and he wrote a book it was a very wonderful book took about the last two weeks of Lincoln's life and day by day and what happened every day and that maybe the the thoughts that was running through his mind or the preparations that he was making the man who had lit only a few this many hours left to live the man who only had a day to live or whatever you know that and he would carry it along his life story and and you know I I'm I thought of course came to this message and brother branham here would would come to time that he only had just a few more sermons to preach and when it did the message to Laodicea would be finished it would be not another sermon that would come out from that servant of God and he would speak his very last sermon public sermon which would be on leadership and then leadership um which is his last complete message and this would be taken and I think this is very significant taken just before he would serve communion there into song at brother greens Tabernacle he wouldn't preach but he would just have some comments and speak for a little bit after the sermon had been given by brother Perry and he would do the communion and he would serve communion and then was gone and the last words that he would speak publicly he would say these hideous sites that's coming up on the earth you can see how the people moving right into it it's an insanity but when that things trikes the church will be gone God let us be there that's my prayer to the great supernatural being that's in this building tonight the Great Christ that has eternal life I pray the crisis I'm here with my eyes open looking at the church you've redeemed but with your blood God don't letter one of us be lost we want to be right with you so cleanse us O Lord from all our iniquities take away our sins and things we've seen you heal our sick and even raise our dead come back to life through prayer and we've seen all these things happen father now bring us back to life spiritually and bring us back to the realization of eternal life through Christ Jesus grant this father I committed unto you in Jesus Christ's name til we meet and he sings till we meet til we meet at Jesus feet God be with us till we meet again and he tells us all goodbye and leaves and goes out and has Passover the communion with his disciples in brother Greene's church and just a few days later he's gone I think it was very fitting when we saw the Ministry of Christ repeat then it happens the same way and we cannot deny that the death angel is in the land you cannot pretend that everything is just going to go on as it always has brother Branham would have his own self he said I can't see it no past in 1977 it got so dark he couldn't see past there and we have now advanced now many years into the hours of darkness and is getting worse and worse and there's a dying of Christian churches in America as I as I told you a month or so ago and brother Donnie sent us to some of us here this week and reminded me of it but I shared it with you a couple of months ago of an article that was was reporting that that every year in our nation that there's between six and ten thousand churches each year that are closing and that number is growing and and that it has been now falling for decades and now the number of unaffiliated in unchurched americans are nicknamed the nuns you know none religious and and that's that population is growing from 1991 to 25% today and this makes them the largest single religious group in America and today less than 20% of all Americans attend church on a regular basis I think you think oh yeah we're all immune to that hate that affects many people as as lukewarmness enters right in among our ranks I hear the cries of pastors what can I do to get people out on Wednesday night what can I do they won't come back on Sunday night there are only Sunday morning goers and and most of time not there then according to them that would be between nearly 200 churches will close just this week and you can see them vacant churches all over everywhere or hardly hardly enough money to coming in to keep and maintain the buildings and and so they're dying we got to get ready to leave here because the death angel is coming it's here in the land we can already hear the cries that are going up from families from homes from divorces from the drama every kind of evil thing that you can imagine that has already taken place and I'm not trying to hurry but don't press me I've got something very heavy on my heart today and the unveiling of God brother madam said the last plague in Egypt was death before the Exodus the last plague on earth his spirits of death before the Exodus and then they'll be cremated and turned back to dust and the righteous will walk out upon their house that's Malik at four but at the latter but the last thing is spiritual death rejecting the word so I think it's fitting as we just kind of sum up these early comments of my message preface and some of the things that has said that that our Lord Jesus last act before his return to God was the Passover and I think as he told his disciple I will be the fulfillment of the Passover Tinky this is my body take this cup it represents the blood of the New Testament you'll receive a life but receiving my my life the Holy Spirit in our gave with our messenger we saw the Ministry of Jesus Christ repeat again and I think again is fitting that the last act he did before departing was communion Passover and that's us here and all that's from under the blood will perish as he left us with this warning these hideous sites that's coming on the earth you can see how people's moving right into it it's an insanity but when that thing strikes the church will be gone how many wants to leave a man I don't want to stay here so it says this month that's he said to Israel this month so be unto you the beginning of months so he said I'm gonna give you a new beginning I'm going to actually in this exodus take you back to your origin now this was a new beginning for Israel it was we're beginning from slavery to freedom it was the birth of a nation were that they would become the bride of Jehovah the freedom would begin with the death of the Lamb an innocent one for the guilty and this blood who else their freedom the whole time and the whole theme I mean of their Exodus is Redemption and this Passover was redemption redeeming them from the evils of the Death Angel and their deliverance from slavery and as I said the Death Angel today is in the lam and with the passing over in the salvation from that from death Israel was having a new beginning and this and this also is a time where we must apply the blood the evening time messages the blood must be applied and that too must enter into that communion and that Passover with the Lord and eat the lamb and the unleavened bread and freak of his life are you with me now so he said this to me a beginning a month so I want you to see with it with the token being applied the blood being applied the blood was the token it represents the Holy Ghost with the blood being applied and them taking the Passover and all of this was a new beginning they were they were getting ready to go back to their origin because they had come from the promised land of Canaan and now we're after 400 years were having an exodus going back into the promised land as I think of this new beginning my mind goes to the earth because the earth itself was so well one day have a new beginning a man it'll go back to its origin before sin ever entered into the picture there are trillions of stars in the universe but there's one that is very special to God and the earth in its name is in the book of life and it's in the Bible now I want you to think you know because Saturn and Jupiter Mars none of their names are in the Bible but the earth his name is in the book of life out of the millions it is named and so it's very special to God yet the earth has its deep scars and ravines and chasms and fossils of millions of animals the earth within herself deep scars of her chaotic past as even as some of you who carried deep scars today in your heart from your past he called his place earth put his name in the book of life this is why he must redeem the earth he cannot I want you to get it he cannot annihilate it it's name is in his book and he cannot annihilate it the Bible said the heavens and earth shall pass away but that word means to change from one form to another form now it in second Peter 3 antena I'm going to deal with this because we're going to deal with the earth for a little bit because in it lays the very mystery of our new beginning and the new beginning that we're here at this time 2nd Peter chapter 3 verse 10 but the day of the Lord's have come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away now that word is the Greek word para , he which means it means to pass for one form to another and it will pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up it would be said in Matthew chapter 24 in verse 35 it uses the same word heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now the the theologians today debate on whether the earth will be renovated or whether it'll be annihilated but I want to just point out David said in the Psalms 37 11 but the meek shall inherit the earth and sound-alike himself in the abundance of peace Jesus agreed with this from Matthew 5 and violent bless meek for they shall inherit the earth I want to turn to Colossians 1 and 19 for it is here that it says it pleased the father that in him said all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and himself by him whether they be things on earth or things in heaven this Greek word reconcile comes from apocalypse Oh which means to change something backward and upward to its original condition so again he is going to reconcile it or change it back the earth back to its original condition before sin ever entered the picture now what exactly is being changed as we look at the scripture what exactly is being changed to its original condition through the blood of the cross of Christ Paul gives the answer all things he says a census for emphasis whether it be things on earth or things in heaven in other words nothing will be left out everything will be changed backwards and upward into its original condition hallelujah amen now in the days of Noah we know what God did to the earth as he started his process of redemption God would baptize the earth with water he would immerse it a man hidden to sprinkle upon it he immersed it in water the framework no was not destroyed just the same and the evil upon it but there that were walked out on a new earth are you with me after he had been destroyed with water now notice I'm gonna share this from future home there's a wonderful message that I've been coming over this week so he says the old world framework was not destroyed by the water the world was only washed off that got its baptism it was baptized so the framework so will the framework main though it'd be burnt by fire it don't destroy the earth it just destroyed the sin that's on it if you get the picture Malachi 4:1 says that that will walk out on the ashes of the wicked is that right so let's so again the evil there is a day coming the earth will burn with fire but we'll walk out on the actions of the wicked so the framework will be will remain and it don't destroy the earth as God the random would say notice in Peter the third chapter he uses the word world as Greek cosmos which means the world order the earth the earth shall pass away melt with elements with fervent heat so he doesn't mean the earth the planet is going to pass away but the world the cosmos the politics the sinners the system disease germs everything that's wrong will pass away he said God won't shook the earth rather and then business time he'll shake the heavens but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's an eternal Kingdom what's how he goes to it notice Peter said and will melt with fervent heat and the works there I'll burn up not at the plant not the planet the works there in the works a man all their politicians their skis all their denominations man-made schemes will all go when it burns a man heavens and earth will pass away with a great noise did you get it heavens and earth will pass away with a great noise Ihnen listen the whole earth will be on fire it will ignite the gases it's in the earth and exploded that's exactly right the Bible said here Peter said heavens and earth will pass away with a great noise such an explosion will rocket or mob because it's got to kill every disease every thistle every thorn and everything there is to be done the fire bring it up and remember it's not all together just a literal fire it's also a holy fire that will take Satan and all of his Devils amen both heavens and earth will pass away killing all the germs all the insects all natural life own it and around it even the h2o the water will explode thinking that talk about a noise he said you think that little noise out here - Sun was something when he opened the seals that shook the country around the mountain calls to talk wait until this earth receives her baptism you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's the same to hear people scream and shout like that but just wait into this world gets her baptism yeah it's flowed on h2o the water the Bible said in Revelation 21 and there was no more sea exploded this will change the whole servants of the entire earth she'll burst and blow to pieces all the outside the crust for hundreds of feet below it will just be completely demolished the atmospheres the gases it's in the earth where they're finding these missiles it can't get through it a a great sphere up their way up somewhere in some kind of sphere that there's all kinds of gases they say that a burst the holy wrath of God will come upon it and will cleanse it and change the entire surface now many of you won't want to put this down the Greek word pass away comes from the word pal Kamiya come and eat which means the heavens and earth will pass away this word means passing from one form to another doesn't mean annihilation but the English word would mean pass away is annihilated but the Hebrew word or Greek does not mean pass away it means from passing from one thing to another now notice Paul used said if you want to read it but it down later for the Titans three and five he used the same word means for your regeneration a man is passed from a sinner to saint completely annihilated but when a man has changed he is an annihilated he's a changed person he's been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated a Magna note is now just a sin in the Devils and wickedness is annihilated hey man Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19:28 he said you'll sit with me and my father's kingdom regenerated you seek change when your change he used the same word he used the same word when he said to the cult loose the coat let him go said the same thing at the resurrection of Lazarus loosed him change him he's been tied let him go what does it mean the earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loosed well from its politics it'll be loosed from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God to establish it here upon the earth but as long as it's in the hands of Satan Satan is the ruler of the earth he owns it it belong to him but now Christ has redeemed it one time I was his property but not now what I'm the little little woman at the well what's his property but not now he came to loosen the grip on it he loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon your life and now we're not here how often have you heard me saying prayer take your hands off a God's property a man see you you you have faith to claim your home that's your right take your hands off of her take your hands out for him see faithful do it oh my not annihilate it see but but just take your hands off of it loose it let it go past so it pass it away it changes the earth will change politics will change religions will change denominations will pass away politics will pass away that glad to be establish so now we see there have been works of redemption upon the earth this is cuttin through its baptism of water in the days of Noah and the blood of Christ was shed upon it in the days of Jesus but finally there will come a baptism of fire and when it does it up cleanse the heavens and the earth and that holy city New Jerusalem that John said myself a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven and there will come down and God dwell here upon the earth with his people oh brother this is why day that we look forward to when this earth is cleanse from sin and wickedness and ever devil ever demon every evil spirit ever spear of lust ever spear of adultery will all burn in the lake of fire am I never to come and remembers anymore when the earth gets it's great baptism of fire every devil will be cast into the lake of fire now right now the earth it's here in its sixth day or it's six thousand year if you're controlling the air give me a little more of here the six that it's in its sixth day or it's six thousand year and soon we'll go into the Millennium it's you know it's just its seventh day you see it'll go into a rest period a man in we're right now we are in the sixth day of man or the six thousand years since time began now you know I want you to get that talk because the earth the earth has been part of God's great eternal plan and just like you yearn if you're timeless being but you're here for a type of wild in the space called time you'd slip down from eternity into a place of time but you came from God and you're going back to God and man your names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world ever began oh my god knew you were coming put their name in there so you have eternal qualities because he wasn't God's eternal thoughts if I could say it to you little children this morning you are not temporary beings you are eternal beings and then you just didn't come and existed some 30 40 50 years ago on your birthday but it came your existence started waiting long before that because when the stars of God sing together and the sons of God shouted for joy you were there in his great chicken as he saw you in the praise God being victorious over sin give me a little more sound up here - now when brother Branham was teaching this and in the future home he explained about this seventh feast and we're about to go into that seventh day which would be the millennial reign now it's not eternity yet because it lasts for a thousand years is still in time a man but he explains how the seventh feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles where Israel would make booths and live in these temporary shelters or Tabernacles as a remembrance of their journey through the wilderness brother madam types the seven feasts with the seventh day of the earth which is the Millennium we have come from creation through time - now the six thousand years it was about two thousand years God washed it with water four thousand years later he shed the blood of Christ upon it a man where we're about to come to again another two thousand year period our calendar says it's all ready to sow 19 but it says the timed air or about is not an exact hour time then those those if you go back then you study the dates and the time some would be early some late but there but nevertheless you know we're right here in a junction we're over time a ma'am because the seven angel is already sounded his message and the last message of warning has been given to the church then the message to prepare to meet the bridegroom has come you believe that now the Millennium is not the Eternity but it's still time thousand years of on the earth we find this seventh feast being referred to in Leviticus 23 39 and we we won't read the whole chapter of 23 because it covers all the different Feast of the Lord and these of course were rich in symbology of what God's great endtime plan would be and even the Passover would be a part of his entire plan aware that he would show you know the lamb and the depth of the lamb it was only reflecting a greater Passover to come amen and we're here again we're weary in another Passover hour with the death angel is passing over are you with me hey man now notice in Leviticus 23 39 also on the 15th day of the seventh month when you shall be gathered have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days and on the first day shall be a Sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a Sabbath and ye shall taken to you on the first day the bowels of goodly trees the branches of palm trees and bowels of of thick trees and willows of the brook used to rejoice before the Lord your God seven days now the Feast of the tabernacle which is a feasts are that the seventh and last feast it represents and type the millennium ahead alright so where that we like Israel remember our journey ins they would remember through the wilderness but we will remember our journey ins through the earth and we will dwell in temporary houses or a booths or Tabernacles now if mortals don't need shelters I'm and don't need shelters or houses these houses will be beatle it will last 1,000 years or throughout the millennium but they're temporary booths and this is what God without Israel to do when you come into the land I want you to remember your journey ins through the wilderness where you dwelt in the wilderness and tents want you to set up these temporary booths for seven days and you will have this feasts commemorating how I brought you through the wilderness how I fed you bread and manna how provided meat for you how I brought you to the Red Sea I want you to remember what I did and what you know what I've done and you see the Millennium my hand will be like that it'll be a time of remembrance a time where we're not in slavery but at home in peace in the great millennial reign ahead I see a 65 19 tells about these temporary dwellings that will last for a thousand years and he says and I will rejoice in Jerusalem had joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be heard no more in her nor the voice of crying and there was a beam no more than an infant of days nor an old man that has not filled his days for the child shall die at a hundred years old but the center being a cursed being a hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses what's this now what what I say now it mortals now of course we won't be sinners we won't be given birth to children but there's other people that are be there as the heathen will be raised during that time that never had the opportunity to hear what you have heard and come to Christ they'll be given an opportunity will rule and reign over them the Bible said a thousand years hey man this is all Bible it's not makeup this is a promise of layin in the Word of God they shall build houses and inhabit them they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build in another inhabit in other words if brother Branham would explain it this way you know you build it and somebody else gets your dwelling right now my mother and dad and past own their grandson told owns their place you see my father build it another's inhabited but it won't be there hey man that's because they're not so many died our death will live out the whole thousand years that Adam failed to live in a man because of sin entered him he died no man ever lived out the thousand years but we will that's coming a man a restoration hallelujah a man that's comin Redemption we will live out that thousand year period is somebody with me a mile all it'll be a wonderful time but it's not the new earth it's still in time and there be still people in time but of course we will be in immortal bodies because we will have already received our change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but there was to be people that are there in the end there that that as it describes they will build houses inhabited their plant vineyards and eat the fruit them on they shall not build in another inhabit theirs so my plan and another heat for the dancer days of the trees are the days of my people and my elects a long enjoy don't work of their hands how many wants to be one of those elect they some on labor in vain never bring forth for trouble for they are the seed Oh hallelujah they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord and there are Springs with them you ought to started shouting right then hey you're gonna be there because you're the scene of the blast of the Lord did you say and their offspring I wouldn't give up on one of my lost children my lost brother my lost sister my lost daddy my lost mother I wouldn't give up on nobody I'll be there [Applause] Halloween Lord to God don't matter if you have 12 sister rissalah he can make it provision they can all be there and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they're yet speaking I will hear and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock then the dust shall be the Serpent's meat and they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the Lord hallelujah can you take that promise today so the seventh day is a Sabbath rest for the earth after that the earth will have a new beginning they will revert back to its original condition before sand the innard and God will dwell on the earth with his people and their new Jerusalem will come down from heaven upon the earth brother branham would describe it he said eternity is like a perfect circle it begins and has no endings and that's eternity but he said when when sin entered he said a little piece of eternity dropped down out of that perfect circle called time he said Satan did not create this but he said there was a little gap of time and he says you know this is where we're at because of sin and during this time God gets that brings all his children forth and gets to manifest itself as Redeemer as Savior as healer all during this time but this time won't last forever a man to describe it his brother Brandon said one day he will hook to it the realm of salvation and eternity again eternal day the earth will have a new beginning it will actually go back to its origin so it's really not new after all it goes back to his formal state it's a restoration not really something new and you're with me now but it's new to those who've been in time because they've never seen the earth and in the eternal condition everything on earth is temporary the trees might outlive you five hundred years long you plant today but it's only temporary comes to an end life always comes to an end here it's time it's time bound your time bound creatures now you must leave time you might do it as a ten year old a 13 year old 20 year old 25 28 30 you might be like the rod Carol 68 years old and gone but you're only here for a time in this form but I'm trying to get to you you who are children of God you are a man eternal quality you may pass away but they're only changing four words this brother branham finishes this with the seven feast he said it looks like I'm out of types it looks like I'm out of dispensations because he come to the last feasts and it isn't it doesn't look like there's anything in it about a new heaven new earth he comes to the Millennium and stopped Sarah with the seventh feast and he begins to talk about this in the future home he said you might say to me I just might feel like somebody might say this me not brother branham what are you gonna do now you've run out of complete sevenths where are you going to now your dispensationalist which I am I believe God is to notice you've run out of dispensational types but if you're going to put it before it if you're going to put it it is something beyond that set of day how you gonna get it he says look all these seven days of the earth these six thousand years they've all been typed out in the feast but don't look like there's anything past that don't even look like there's anything left and he said but I want to call your attention to something no I ain't I ain't out of dispensations and I got another scripture here remember all things Hudson all of it has to be fulfilled every bit of it you say brother branham you're trying to put something beyond that seventh day that seventh day Sabbath as the earth God made the earth labored six-day and rested Sabbath this is only a type and is said here we become eternal so where is your type now you said your type ologists so you've run out of types is it no Hatun let's just find out if we have remember there were seven feast days Feast of the trumpets pieces of Tabernacle pieces she flavin all these great seven feast days there was only a type of the seven ages you remember how many Sabbath's was between one and the other seven Sabbath weaned Pentecost and the trumpets which are the seven churches which there's not seven Sabbath between Pentecost and the trumpets day he means Sabbath's between Passover and Pentecost there was seven weeks which Pentecost means seven weeks for fifty days and there was seven feast days that represent the seven Church ages so now brother Branham you doesn't run out you got your seven alright let's take the last piece which is visa Tabernacle notice the 36 verse this is same they sing chapter there we just looked at but he says in the 36 verse seven days shall you offer your offerings made of fire into the Lord and on the eighth day what has changed terminology you know there's seven days in a week but there's not eight days there's thirty days in a month Lord is his eighth come in on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation I want you to get this word convocation don't let it somebody who just means I a gathering so it was a time that is was to gather to the Lord for celebration for remembering for worshiping so he said on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall make an offering made by iron to the Lord and it is a solemn assembly means it and you shall do no servile servile work there Ian so he says now we got an eighth day now there is only eight there are seven days but here we speak of this eighth day holy convocation this holy gathering notice we don't work here today they are what it's back to the first why it speaks of eternity as she rolls around without a stopping place so really there isn't there's not eight days in a week make day is just going back into eternity as eternity rolls on without a stopping place hallelujah now the eighth day is when the earth leaves time and goes back to its beginnings back to eternity where the New Jerusalem heaven comes down upon the earth and the earth is going back to its beginning the number eight is a sacred number to God like three is perfection five is grace seven is completion eight means new beginning a man and in the Old Testament feast days that lays a type of the plan of God from time back to eternity again and we get the term eight-day from the day after the Feast of the Tabernacles and the day day is separate and distinct from this Feast of the Tabernacles God has placed symbolic meaning in counting up to the number eight the seven-day feast of tabernacles can be tight as a journey of the earth through time back to its beginning into eternity it'll finish its seventh day in the Millennium somebody with me now and then go back into eternity it's symbolically reminded Israel he's seven this feast day of the Feast of Tabernacles as we told you symbolically reminded Israel of their journey through the wilderness Leviticus 23 36 let's look at it one more time seven days this whole offer an offering made by fire unto unto the Lord and on this eighth day shall be a holy gathering man holy gatherings somebody with me now a man on the eighth day in eternity we're gonna have a great gathering there as the New Jerusalem comes down from God out of heaven and man now so we might ask why don't we just go back to number one after counting the seven you know you count seven days while I just go back to one again how come the Bible said the eighth day because zet and you see this is not what God's portrayer he's not portray in a weekly cycle of time or with the vision of the Tabernacles in fact instead he means it's gonna is showing what its gonna mean to finally arrive at the eighth day and what does that mean what does that number mean let's just look through the Bible now for some examples as we look through the rest of the Bible we can find various illustrations that will help open us up to us the meaning of that great day that number eight in the Old Testament shadows the Israelites entered into covenant with God as infants difference what we do of course you really do too when you're born again you're an infant in God that's when you enter into covenant with God by the Holy Ghost that's when you get your circumcision and so the Israel did the same thing they entered in the covenant with God as a baby on the eighth day is that right the male children were circumcised and entered into that covenant also the firstborn among animals were redeemed on the eighth day he would say likewise he should do with your oxen in your seat it shall be with its mother seven days and on the eighth day you shall give it to me so there there again is it written in the symbols of the Old Testament as Paul said there types and shadows of things to come and then there is where Moses first prepared Aaron then his sons for their services preached to God will be turned into Leviticus 833 and and this is at the Tabernacle after being lost and clothed in priestly garments and sprinkled with blood they stayed in the tabernacle for seven days and it says and you shall not go out of the door the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days this is a day of days of preparation voici cleansing of the priesthood getting ready for their service are you with me a man so he said until the day of your days of your consecration are ended so you see the seven days or time a preparation for the eighth that's coming amen the earth´s is going through stages of preparation for they day that's coming is everybody with me now now watch and he said for seven days he shall consecrate you now after this the priest came out on the eighth day made a sin-offering for the people the seven days were times of preparation so that only eighth day they could begin to fulfill what they had been prepared to do are you with me now the Nazarite vow also included instructions what you do if you grow that Nazarite vow someone had taken that vowel and was some defiled by accident-- it gives descriptions of how and maybe accidentally touching the dead that's being defiled and unclean you know because they were not to drink wine or nor to touch their unclean things and so on like that there was an odds right into the Lord and it was shown by the hair this is why God gives the woman today and Nazarite vow because it shows a holiness unto the Lord with uncut hair are you with me now so the Nazarite vow included instructions what to do is someone who had taken that vow became defiled by accident or because of circumstances beyond our control and it included seven days of purification with an offered made on the eighth day and on the eighth day it would it would reconfirm their nazarite condition of being holy again I hope you're reading between the lines a little bit and following with me because this is what God does to every one of you when he brings you to your eighth day he takes the defilement of the way and brings you back to holiness again the steps for cleansing of lepers our other unclean people was also seven days of sanctification and offering was to be given on the eighth day and on the eighth day the process would be complete and so the eighth day represents eternity when the sin of the lepers cleanse when a person enters into covenant with God and when we finally get home when we're totally cleanse and the earth has cleanse from sin they're coming eighth day the true eighth day is when the earth goes back to its beginning it is the fulfillment of everything the eighth day pictures which is eternal reign of Jesus Christ the new heavens and new earth with all mankind having the opportunity to have been purified and set us apart to live for internally now so as I as I said this urges our eternity is like a perfect circle in the earth has dropped down into this little gap of time Satan didn't create it but it happened because of sin you see it still we're still eternal it didn't change our eternal qualities come on with Jesus came from from the Eternals and came as a man it didn't change his eternal qualities to be here in the time body and neither does it change your internal qualities jesus said I came from being God and I'm going back to being God and I tell you we're only here in the house as men for a little short time but we're going back to our godhood because we came from him and we're going back to him and we are use offspring when the earth hazards a day here a new dispensation of heavens and earth a new earth and God will pull that roof of salvation we talked about ratios right back amount of time into eternity now this has typed out in the feast the feast of tabernacles worth seven day feast represents eternity of Israel from Egypt to the promised land the Israelites was set up the booths the branches temporary dwellings lived through them in them to commemorate their journey through the wilderness but on the eighth day there was a sacred gallery and the future home brother Branham explains it this way and bear with me just for a little bit as I read what he had to say cuz we got a lot to preach about now once we lay this down notice it was also up on the safe day last day Feast of the natal face day of the tabernacle notice after that that the last day at the last after last complete seven days upon the earth after the Millennium that this holy convocation comes remember this is the Feast of Tabernacles Tabernacles Catherine places where in the Millennium the Bible said there build houses they shall inhabit but a new earth he's already went and prepared the place it is built we have nothing to do with the building of it a man eternal oh I just love that word my a holy convocation the eighth day which is only seven days but then on the eighth day when which comes back to the first day again comes right back to the first Jay the eighth day is a holy convocation notice seven days only has to do with the old creation world time on seven days that's the Millennium that's the read the rest day God labored six days rest in the seventh church labor seventh-day rest of seven but you're still in the time with element 9 speaking of the eternal but you see there's no such thing as eight days when you go back to the first day again see the first day the Sabbath that's the seventh day speaks of the old law which wants to pass away and they keeping him a Sabbath which passed away or changed as I've said change to one another it didn't pass away you just changed from the old law of keeping a certain day of the week we know it changed the grace I'd say it would say it this way of your personal conversion receiving the Holy Ghost he said I say it all of nineteen chapter our 28:19 precept must be upon precept line upon line you know here little dare little but then add to our hold faster that which is good for with stammering lips however that our tongues I speak to this people a man for this is the rest we're not called the weary to rest and that is a very type of you're very experienced with God when God calls you out of the labor of sins and I've come to the law of sin and death and the law becomes passed and you enter into the law of the spirit of life and you're filled with the Holy Ghost then you enter into that rest into eternity with God are you with me coming back into that eternal condition notice you've passed from death into eternal life not days and times have passed an eternity that's the place women gathered to that's the holy convocation seven days watch he says who meaning which pass away or have said change to another day deals with new creation not all creation eight days is a new creation is anybody with me now so see their day deals with the new creation and when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it isn't the law anymore of something you've got a key for that salad that's out not you know that's the problem with a lot of Christians today there's still Old Testament Christians we've got to do this so we got to do this not shouting thou shalt not their living by law and they don't have the power to do it but when you enter into the Holy Ghost it is an inward law that leaves within your heart the law of the Spirit of God and its nature lives on the inside of you just like right now within you the law of the human is in you and you live and do and act like a human according to that love of mankind life are you with me but when the Spirit of God comes into you it's a new law the old law passes away religious forms pass away ship passes away everything else passes away and you become a new creature in Christ and old things pass away man and said dad samsara if the soul is annihilated hallelujah no creature in Christ man that takes you once did you do that no more the life you once lived is not dead and you're alive in Christ Jesus I tell your friends what is it you have entered into laughs hey that eternal quality of eternal life notice it's that when you leave the law and it's Sabbath keeper become a new creation being filled with the Holy Spirit you enter into eternity notice into eternal life get the distinction into eternal life because you can look I can look at you and you can look at me and you know that this is not eternal this is still temporal hey man but eternal life you have entered into it something happened into you that is a representation of who you were for you go back to your beginning are you with me now amen so by being filled with spirit you enter into eternal life into your eighth day back to your beginning this is not the eighth day now it's like in a day it's just like when the earth will be renovated by fire and this eighth day and we'll go back into eternity and the same thing happened when you are born again amen amen you changed from death into life I mean no life passes away like the earth will pass away and change from one form to another one moment you're a singer and the other you're set to five Holy Ghost filled child of God saying to sin no more somebody with me now now there's your holy convocation brother Branham said not having anything to do with literal things is beyond that listen to the kingdom of God with eternal life with the three destinated that never did start it never started on any day he wasn't saved on any day he was always saved a man Jesus came to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with a man and that's what happens to your soul when you're born again it has it's a day experience it's a new beginning not not your body and man your body is not born again when your soul is but your soul has a new beginning it goes leaders barn best if - it's our judgment where it came from are you with me at the fire God comes down and eradicate sin nature that old separate us in nature where were you were born under the Serpent's curse and either Raticate the depth and sand from your life hallelujah amen takes it out of your heart and your soul changes back to highlight should have been in the beginning and you become a new creation a mouth that see a day undo creation are you with me now 2nd Corinthians 5 and verse 17 therefore if a man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away that's parikamma he it changes from one form to another all that things are passed away see you're not Annihilator it's sin that's annihilated and behold all things become new see you don't pass through time and dropped into eternity again not the wall keeping days and and New Moon's and church membership and all of that you know and I've got to do this so I got it it's not a law like that you pass from loss until I pass him from death unto life his brother man said Oh what the bible does teach us passed from one to another now do you know Jesus had his eighth day hey ma'am do you know any raised anybody know he raised on Sunday and that Sunday was the first day of the week that right a man he raised on Sunday not Saturday Sabbath that's the seventh day the Sabbath but Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week on the eighth day hallelujah amen the Creator became his own new creation and changed from human life into back into a finalized change to immortality when of the eighth day hallelujah hey ma'am now you talk about a new beginning and brother madam says it this way case you wondered in the future homeboy was on the eighth day that our Lord raised from the dead Jesus raised from the dead for our justification on the eighth day after the Sabbath for the seventh days Jesus raised from the dead eighth day which is a holy convocation which is which is the first day see he rose on the first day of the week which is the eighth day and Mancos he he didn't start time over again hello now he was leaving time and going back and eternity listen when Jesus rose from the dead he went back to his original art and he went back to his beginning somebody with me now that's where he stripped his final moment on the cross amen when he will end and drop back into eternity remember he ends his final moment with Passover and then he goes right into the cross and there on that cross he he enters into the egg drops back into eternity again and he arose of that first day of the week on the eighth day a man in his eighth day his new beginning oh brother it was like the earth is going to have on the beginning he'll explode and when it doesn't burn up there there the h2o and all the all the other things that had changing and transforming make a new heavens and a new earth and that day when Jesus there when he rose from the dead on the eighth day there was an explosion the rocks ripped the graves open hope hallelujah the tomb but so far and Eversole of his body was changed out of the tomb he came Oh hallelujah I can't I can't wait until our body has its eighth day a man when we have our eighth day experience and change in a moment and a twinkle in I you think that was without sensation all know when your eyes behold your love and you feel oh here's a sensation you feel that sweep come over you God will rip through every cell of your body and change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and then we'll start gathered with the Saints and after a while we'll be travelling like a thought hallelujah speaking dogs right now but you wouldn't understand what I said that strikes my soul the glory now in this form of his resurrection Jesus no longer needed a boat to go cross the sea hey man here he just would appear on the bank hey man he and I could catch fish they were just there and he cooked them on a fire man he appeared he disappeared he didn't need a door to enter in there in a locked room up there in the upper room the sight was locked up and he just appears a man the moment after after speaking for him a little bit he just goes right back through the walls gone again he has passed from time element times to restraints amen men because of road closures and things bridges that are out in my area took me 45 minutes to get to church but Jesus would appear at one place and that place because he wasn't in time element no more are you with me he would he would he would start right there whether disciples are locked up and even he fish and honeycomb and then walked through the walls he would stand what 7 miles with Cleophus and his friends at the end and break bread like he did before wonder how he did him before he would pull a piece of it off and multiply it hey man there's plenty of food for us all others multiplied t and when they saw him do what he did before is somebody with me a man a man that saw what he did before that recognized him and he vanished from their sight a man he was back in his origin and he can never die again he had left from time and went back into eternity and time and distance and miles and nothing had any restraints on him whatsoever because he was back into eternity again now in Romans 6 and 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dad no more death hath no more dominion over him so you see that couldn't be one cell corrupt there could be one one thing I mean could die no more he passed back into eternity again in a mortal condition are you with me when on the first day of the week which is your ain't dead Oh back again hallelujah oh man oh did you know that they Opena class it came seven Sabbath's after the Passover somebody with me now a man and then on Sunday after the seven Sabbath's were over the seven weeks of Pentecost were over there's somebody with me Amen on the first day of the week on the morrow after the Sabbath the seventh day and then the church is somebody still with me the church had its eighth day experience of eternal life coming down hallelujah the original church had its beginning of the day of Pentecost and the law passed away and the church had its beginning it had its birth and by the power of the Holy Spirit the churches get up and eternal life but the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me tell you what Pentecost was it was a day of freedom it was a jubilee hallelujah was a day of freedom it was a day when the Death Angel had passed over them and that's what had said but no longer have dominion over them anymore somebody with me now hey man man was freed from sins bondage he was accidents of Sedna into eternal life witness happen on the eighth day to the Sabbath they had their eighth day experience they had the truck had its beginning they were powered like they should've is born to begin with because when you're born again you're not born of the will of man or the will of the flesh or my sex desire but you're born the way you should have been at the beginning which gives you an eternal quality with eternal life I don't know if I can restrain myself to preach this I'm trying to let ever work seek him to you I want you to get us I want you to understand us now this was not the eighth day no but it was like an eighth day that the earth will have where the church was lifted up above sin into the power of God might take this coat off after all a man might as well get ready to stay here I had a minister here saw me take my coat off he said I knew he was serious then he's gonna be here for a while I hope you're not in a hurry hope you'll realize the hour we're in right here blending from time into eternity again we're bout this bride is about to have an eight day experience and change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and that's what happens when the seventh church age closes when the seven days are over we've changed listen the eighth day like the Earth Day Day that the earth had the church was lifted up above sin into the power of God let me describe it again just like the holy fire God will strike the earth the same thing happened to those in the upper room here came the pillar fire like a rushing mighty wind come on and filled the house where they were sitting brother Branham talks about this holy fire he says just not a little fire it's a holy fire that will strike the earth it will take Satan and all its devils both heavens old earth a man will pass away killing all the germs all the insects and all the natural life will hold it around it and even the water this h2o will explode think of it talk about a noise you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think it's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that but let's wait until this earth gets her baptism when they got their baptism in the upper room man it was an explosion it was a change from loud to grace and the Turks would have a new beginning and they would come out drunk a new wine would fill with the light for the lamb and my walking out under the influence of that hallelujah are you with me and there was a lot of noise there man there was screaming and shouting and glorifying God Amen because God had come down and build his church of the day of Pentecost and Pentecost is our agenda it is the beginning that we have to return back to before the rapture it's an eighth day experience it's not the eighth day now the eighth day is the new heavens and the earth but it's the eighth day experience it's like what the earth will go through now Acts chapter 2 and verse 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared upon them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance they man who son spoke in one language some spoke in another some spoke in another but let me just tell you you know we don't have any document that these unknown tongues at Pentecost is booked in known tongues because how here we ever man in our own language then glorifying God really I don't care what time you speak in as well as your life glorifies God but that's what's gonna happen when you have your they experience your life will glorify God hallelujah therapy an explosion that was the modest sin no I'm getting ahead of myself just a moment but let's just read it they were filled with the Holy Ghost begin to speak with other tongues it caused them to glorify God I don't care what it is I don't care how it comes I don't care if it feels like I spelts on your back I don't care if it comes like chills I don't care about your sensation what I want to see is your life got changed and the fire of God burns seeing out of your life that makes you a new creature in Christ and you're not the same person you ask hey mom now the eighth day is eternity the New Jerusalem but that's truly no such thing as an actual eighth day just starting a week over again but but I want to give something to this eighth day won't start a new week of time it will be an eternal day that never ends racing against his clock from Eden so far the earth has had six days go into the seventh day the Millennium would start over again back to the place before same energy the same can be tight of the seven ages before the ages began we started out with Pentecost eternal life came down in the form of the Holy Ghost and filled all the house where they were sitting but about twenty or thirty years later they lost their first loud just as he did and Satan's knowledge and receive Satan's knowledge over the Word of God that evil level can catch the key works Levin was accepted into the church and brought for the high Church but in the seventh angel's message here in the last Laodicean age it is brought us back to eternal life again to the to baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the beginning before the crease and the unbelief of men got in the church the seventh angel message with me to the last sir Jesus brought us back to place not another eighth day but like an eighth day back to the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost back to the original experience again a man LS it not truly an eighth day but in tight here in the last age at the end of seven ages we have received a message that return us back to the beginning back to the place before unbelief entered into the church before the Trinity doctors and the wisdom of Satan came here back to the original Pentecost hallelujah where they come here at the end of the ages hey man right here at the last day in the seventh age not an 80s now but right in the same seven days it didn't start a new age come on somebody maa just gave us it just gave us an eighth day experience again it brought us back to the same experience that they had on the day of Pentecost before seven ever entered the picture it brought us back to Paul's gospel once again hallelujah now so yeah again again it happens how does it happen now we want to bring this and that it just says that holy fire now wait a minute I want you to get a picture now listen something very supernatural took place in our day listen in the days of Jesus angels would break forth from that dimension and announce something that was happening or end of the wall world didn't see it the Shepherd saw it wise men saw the stuff have you seen the star have you seen the seven star to the seven churches man that shows you wise men and men what was it to do to bring you not to the star the star leads you to Christ is that right and then that's the whole purpose in the star Turman that guide you to Christ it don't point you to the star a lot of people have made a star out of brother Branham and make him have an object of worship God didn't want you to worship the star God would your worship the Christ amount but now here we come you know right here again angelic happenings breaking from eternity right into this dimension of time brother Branham I'm going to quote him back again because if they open early seven seals the reveal of the mystery the revelation they come in this last day it was nothing short as supernatural the seven thunders of Revelation 10 the voices of God that had been sealed up to the end time would be revealed and there would be things written in the word just hid because of denominational ages sealed away are you with me notice as I'm quoting this again from future home just as odd you know and let me perfect just just as the holy fire will strike the earth that will take away Satan and all of his all the devils both heaven and earth a man will pass away killing all germs all in insects all not to live on it and around it even the h2o the will explode think of it talk about a noise you think that little noise out here into something with something when he opened those seals that shook the country around about and calls the talk wait until this earth receives her baptism so he takes any points over at that beginning with the new beginning right here were the chunks by the opening of the seven seals come on somebody hey man that's what it is back into life again goes back to its original condition go back to his eighth day again goes back to everything experience happened it's right here in the seventh today's not a New Age doorman it's the same age but changing from death to life from Pentecostal traditions to the word again passing Oh My heavens and earth will pass away pet parrot on keho Mia yeah again it's a passing away it's the change in the thought and we've changed from Azusa Pentecost into the last day in time message mana when it did seven angels came from heaven and there was a sucker's who ruled out come on shook the heavens and the earth around somebody with me right out there in Tucson it was a little noise and compared to what the great explosions going to be when the earth is renewed way over on the other side the Millennial but nevertheless it was an explosion and from that explosion of seven seals the time for the efendim the time without the time and breaking us back into eternity again getting us ready for our translation by sleep watering our what a time what a message what a day they experience that the Turkish had in this last day tradition back to the word again we talked about noise seven angels came screaming out a message man that's a lord descended from heaven with a shout you say that wasn't the Lord descending it certainly was his coming is in three shout voice in trumpet the trumpet our bodies are changed but before that he comes the Lord sends down if he comes down an anointing comes down in Malachi for the Elijah prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to its beginning back to its beginning back to an eighth day experiences ever cell up and brings it back to the original message that Paul preached hallelujah what a day what an hour what a message we got you can't make this stuff up it's in the Bible rip those seals or traditions man-made duck turns off the Bible and brother Brayden said this way he said it made the Bible a new book to me ma listen he didn't change what was written it just changes how we knew what was written oh man the revelation of Godhead doesn't change what's written it just changes how you view what is written instead of having polar bees in our room or whatever it means in that is hey wait will you see a double vision or triple visa where you seeing three God just they all come into one when you get focused it ripped the seals and traditions took us back to our original origin now we have the Word of God back just like Paul preached it and anybody who preaches something different than Bob preaches under a curse that's why these systems a manner crushed and God couldn't curse it until he brings Paul's gospel back again and he vindicates and he shows it he proves it with signs and wonders to show what is the truth who is a messenger sets him apart this month so begin be a beginning a month this month is a new beginning right now while the Death Angel passes over we are not in deed either we are going back to our beginning so he says he would say to Israel you know Israel this is not your end this is the marching of your new beginnings you're being brought back to the beginning again I mean you're leaving slavery and going up like you weren't it to begin pre-bim you're leaving Egypt and you're going back to your homeland free men oh you're going you're having a new beginning Oh hallelujah you remember when you had that beginning hey man when you left sin oh you talk about shouting when you realize your enemies was dead that the death angel didn't get you that you got sealed to the day redemption behind the blood hallelujah and you had a new beginning and all things passed away behold all things become new whatever their beginning you were born like you should have been now remember the early church lost something the origin of the church was Pentecost so if we're going to go back to our beginning we'll have to come back to Pentecost said well now brother Tim I'll tell you you know we're they you know that this is not the day of Pentecost of a repeat or the return we're beyond that we got something different yes we do we have more than just the Holy Ghost coming down the Pentecostals you know represented having spirit baptism they represented that again we have more than that because this has truly taken us back to our beginning Pentecost didn't do it Azusa Street didn't do it it only took you back in fact when it began it even started with the Trinity doctrine there's only a few new years later they come out with the oneness and they still didn't have it right but there again we come down to this in time and God is putting everything back in order again bringing it back to its beginning back to to Paul's gospel were that we again understand serpent seed predestination eternal security all of the different truths that Paul spoke about in the Bible hey man the Bible is Paul taught it we have been brought back through the opening of the seals back to not do something different but not to a new gospel this same gospel hey man are you getting tired all right well then I'm not tired either in fact I'm pretty energized right now hey man listen Church you remember they they did in the early first Age they were already forgetting them and they lost their first love and God says remem but where you falling from and they we're already a fallen Church in the first age what didn't take long for that for men to come in corrupt the truth folks and folks disciples come into the church we've been that way in just like they'll do in the last days Matt but the message has turned us back to our point of origin to our beginning that to Pentecost even now not like Azusa Street just representing the spirit moving in satin in motion but more than that back to the word now the resume of the ages he said what about the true seed it will happen just as we said the people of God are being made ready for by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost say fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord amen the Spirit will bring us right back to where we were at the beginning that's dust saith the Lord not to something different but back to our beginning see they getting a new message it's the message we heard from the beginning now again service we would see Jesus and I love this quote he said then if the word promises that this has to happen in the last days the spirit of Elijah's to even return in the last day that's right upon these people and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers children back to the father's of doctrine the principles of the Bible and they got away in denomination organization and the great power God is to come upon the people oh and the great power of God is to come upon the people with a masterpiece that'ss in their hearts back to remember a thing still remains God and that he has God jesus promised the things he did his believers would do it the work said I do show you do also but now some of these selya's these self-styled eighth Agers are wanting to take you away from the seventh church aids and the seventh angel is a message and that leads to death because it's like Eve was offered a new message but I just want to say to you don't leave the seventh angels message we don't leave this church agent of the rapture this is not another age the bride age is just a time within the seventh age under the seventh angels message where the bride has experienced the explosion like the earth will have it is a day which ripped the seals of the book and Paul the people out of the Asuza movement hit through the ride it's the death angel who wants to come around today and add wild gorge to the pot coax and you like the serpent or use quotes to lead the purity of the prophets message and turn the church into making it vulnerable to the death angel and I'll tell you what it is it is a man I just got a notice moderate rain is going to fall in 25 minutes I say Lord send arraigned my radar in the spirit realm said it's about to rain this morning it's raining down word the word that doctrine shall fall is arraigned and I believe that God is receives bringing us back to true doctrine because I'll tell you folks doctrine will not bring for the pure spotless Church it brings us to a higher church by mixing the leaven of reasoning and adding knowledge hey man now that's what the serpent did he mixed his knowledge with God's Word and it brought forth death in a hybrid seed and that's why we're here in sin and we drop down from eternity into time but then God separate Eve's evil came from Adams righteous Seth but then later the two lines would cross in the hybrid again the mixing of the sons and the daughters of men and it brought forth an age of great knowledge were the hearts of men were only evil continually what was it it was it was a hybrid Bunch Jesus would bring the pure gospel and that's what Paul preached but afterwards there were men who began to read between the lines and mixed their wisdom puffing up the word to make it more palatable easier to eat you know a little leaven leavens the whole lump but it makes them read and a little more delightful but listen brother Branham in their vision age he said what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure Word of God she had the power of the Spirit manifests in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost so the message of the bride age is not a new message the bride age is not an age it is not even the Naif day but as are like the day of the earth will turn back to the beginning even so in this seventh age under the seventh messenger will return back to the beginning and I beginning was that Pentecost a man and so in fact of the matter is I'm going to share you with you the first time brother Branham talks about bride AIDS he says hallelujah I'm sure you'd know what I'm talking about see what I'm talking about it was waved all the people in the first time there will come first for the bride age for resurrection out of dock denominationalism will be a message that the pure pure but the full maturity of the word has turned back again Oh listeners turn back again turn back again the maturity of the word full maturity has turned back again in its full power that's the message that's about death that we went back to our beginning not a new message not something different but the same message a man turned back to his full power so the maturity of the word is turned back again this is a resurrection it is not a replacement with another message this is like an eighth day where all the unbelief of the ages are dead and left behind it is not a Reformation it is a resurrection are you with me there will come forth for the bride aids will be a message a man now if the bride aged has a message how could it be something different from the seventh angels message it had to be the Laodicean message the message of the bride age came through the seventh angel in the seventh church age so if you claim that a message and it's different from the seventh angels message if it's different from the message to Laodicea that promises white Raymond and I Savin a gold like character of deity there is a message of death and not of life it addresses you with arrogance and pride instead of humbleness and sweetness and humility of the Holy Ghost idiot see it as a message of death not the message of life it's the same arrogance of Cain who refused to repent a math the masterpiece brother branham would be similar he would tell about the bees and the bride he said I saw it come and he said after a while here come that same lady and he says it see now the true bride has come again the see the original word again can we get this again not a new message not something different than palm trees the the original word again the awful kind of Meegan's were saying I'm Alpha and Omega he never said in between uh-huh I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last so he says the last in the first will all be the same in between we got Luther and Wesley and all these other churches down to the ages but the first church in the last church is gonna be the same the brighter the beginning it's gonna be the same brighter they in are you with me and then he says the first ministry and the last ministry is the same the first message and the last message is the same I am I I'm the Alpha and Omega so you see the first message and last message is the same and what I'm trying to say is it is changing back like the earth will change back to its condition before sin entered in when you were when you were born again your soul was changed back to the way you said it man at the beginning come on I'm here the church was born on the day of Pentecost and this last James sex will be changed back to what she was on the camp any cost making the Alpha the Omega church the same are you with me now Paul had the full revelation of the word nothing of the word was a mystery to him every truth was revealed that needed to make him at her grave now Paul didn't need the seals to be open to bring the bride's mess we needed those those message those mysteries because those were truths lost to the church Pollard dives in chopping block certainly after the first days began and so the green would be planted and for by the time the first age would close off much of what palmtop would have been changed or altered as the folks vine begin to flourish the sea ages would roll on and the original understanding of the scripture would not be almost entirely lost that's the way we came down to this last stage but now in their 70s when the ages over and the fullness of the Gentiles has come God moves to fulfill Malakoff oh and by his ministry Homa he does what he turns a heart back doctor something different back to the faith of the fathers by this ministry we understand the word it's aptly has pulled product to bring its church back to its beginning like an eighth day so now I've just got a couple of more points on this hang on yeah I know you're worried I'll go pass to it's okay it'll be okay every once in a while brother Donny preaches about those preachers preach a long time I'm one of them any man I'm one of them so brother Donny hold your horses hey ma'am the messenger anxious to the Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul listen this that he was the messenger to the first age of the Gentile era cannot be denied dr. Peter was given granted the authority to open the doors to the Gentiles it was given to Paul to be their apostle and prophet he was the Prophet masa to the Gentiles say that with me Paul was the prophet messenger to the Gentiles his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the Gentiles vindicated him as their apostolic messenger now Paul would set the pattern for all the other ages and the messengers were chose says how close they were to Paul's teaching which many of them had most of them had buried beds it the closest one to be the messengers like Luther Wesley whatever there was that they were the closest in their time to Paul with the most truth but now I want to ask he received a full revelation the word for the Gentiles are we Gentiles somebody help me are we Jews now are we Gentiles that what we are then Paul is still our prophet messenger he is a messenger to all of us Gentiles yeah brother Branham was a messenger to the Gentiles of Laodicea but Paul was a messenger to the Gentiles from Pentecost to the rapture and Paul's message is just as revelant today as it was 2,000 years ago because it was on a temporary word until more can be understood it was eternal Word of God hey man then the last H would have a prophet messenger also and he would preach the same word that Paul preached this is something Luthor couldn't say Luther couldn't say I preached what Paul preached hey kids I preached some of what Paul preached Wesley could not say that don't make anybody mad but as Susan Street can't say that it might but when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time which happened to be Curtin the time is when he went into from Taemin to him mortality a man that would happen to be his death this is when you'll be gathered with your promise a man he stood there and they said you're going to be judged for what you preached and we're going to be judged with you and he said what will Paul have to be judged she said yeah Paula have to be judged he said well praise God ah preach just what Paul preached I wish a half of the preachers around the message today knew that that he preached what Paul preached man he didn't have anything to it it isn't something taken away it is the reason of gospel promise back what the Bible was unsealed the missus was thinking of the book that was ready for the GAR but God ordained it to be planted but he's ordained listen to be raptured not go down on the ground again because the cycle of time is up we're going back into eternity or the we keel over not only sound down in our hearts the game where we stand with a problem once more God will reveal he said there's a prophet in the land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the Laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul Paul would say I want to present you as an untouched virgin but I fear just like the serpent beguiled Eve and beguiled her and took her from her virginity so you will lose yours you won't be a virgin bride but you'll be carrying the seeds of man and that's why there's a in the Book of Revelations because they're carrying the seeds of another man other than the husband Christ she's supposed to be married to she's called a her daughters have been trained just like her started out as a Catholic Church a who polluted the word took in seized a man and hybrid a child and brought forth Catholic children and Methodist children Baptists children blasphemous names we're not to be called by names of blasphemy it's blasphemous to be called by any other name than the name of Jesus and they don't even want to take on his name because they're not married to him they're modern woman oh I'll kill I'm a Methodist Christian I'm a Baptistery they're - ate their name they don't want to lose their identity they're modern woman nor did by the evil spirit blasphemous names I'm not trying to be ugly but I want to just bring it back to you again I want to tell you about a bride that he talks about how tragic is this first age did not listen to the spirit but listen to man but thank God in the last age that's a simpleton there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day that's the seventh one and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ just as the heavens and the earth one day will be burned off in an explosion taking place are you with me it will welcome the New Jerusalem to come down and even so here in this very time are you with me now in this state in this eighth day time this eighth day experience what does it does is prepare two people who will welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ not build another denomination but welcome back Jesus to the earth returned to the power of Pentecost hmm brother Brandon would say the opening of those seals us to bring back the scattered word been scattered each denomination had a part of it it would bring it back he said that was only made possible when God sent to seven seals and gave us a sign by since seven angels down out of heaven to come and bring back the scattered word and then denominations and tie it right back into his of God again to bring down his holy spirit if you abide in me in the words my word abide in you then you will ask what you will it shall be done uniting the word back look at these words back with the word which is God the church and the word not to church and the Creed the church and the word the bride and the word United together and what restore back what the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers see that had been scattered by Luther's group not Luther himself not Luthor not Wesley not those great founders but after they're going away a church raised up and that's what happens even now we got men rising up and we got a new age we got a bright age out here that's something different from the seventh angel in the seventh age and they're leading people out this is what Joe Coleman did he pointed we went around higher we took it higher we went beyond this Laodicean message and the messenger and the seventh angel we're we're up here we got something different we got something more and it's death there's carnage of churches and people with messed up lives deine filthy and sin because there's no power of the blood to cleanse them from sin because the Holy Ghost is not death what did we say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back to the original Pentecostal faith as a united time ensign 63 August 18th back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teach insane exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus among us today during the same thing now quickly Lutzer tried to bring the pure word but men afterward mix their wisdom and hybrid his church and Luther's bred soon became leaven Wesley tried to bring the pure word and men afterwards mixed their wisdom and hybrid his church and they had leaven Azusa started out designing the pure word and he even named themselves Pentecostal after the original but men soon mixed their wisdom and they've hybrid the church same serpent surely you won't die well Healing has died a true new birth has all but died and I'm not just talking about Pentecostal and Baptists and methods I'm talking about even message churches that true atonement of the blood and the bleed and sacrifice and the truth of that is all but died how about reading between the lines and making something different than what God originally spoke don't do it don't do it brother Branham said in God of this evil age he is she has caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program he said I'm pitching you the godless world would see as he had the very feeling of God's Word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do instead of teryan for the baptism of the Holy Ghost she left science proved to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples and instead of keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she has left Satan under his leadership of religious men take the Word of God and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it turn around but only brother Branham can see it be said no I don't hear some Superman give some testimony we got a supercharged it's got to be in super Church but Satan has tried to twist through wisdom today we don't need the Holy Spirit so hello we got a seat Jean of God by the Tim we don't need the Holy Spirit you see we don't need that baptism it won't save you it will if you're got a seed in you if you're a predestinated seed of God it takes the germination of the Holy Spirit or it'll never come to life and then just cause your predestinated seed don't mean you don't need a Holy Ghost experience you've got to be born again that see there's got to be brought to life sleep dormant in you since the day you were born it's a you always worry was in you there by predestination you didn't know it was there I didn't know it was there the devil didn't even know he was it was there but God did and man and he sends a baptism of the Holy Ghost to come and quicken not seed to life you say well everybody the Holy Ghost comes on ain't seed that's right the rain falls on the just and the unjust and sometimes the seed will fall and I'll not see there's nothing to quicken but you that's got a seed in you but they are penticoff and it ain't without sensation either it's an explosion hello do you send tassel the way that must passes away oh I know you got a quote on that and I don't have time to bring it out this morning but let me tell you friends let me take you only reading half the quotes when you say oh well there you know it's without sensation it is not a sensation but sensation comes with it they just an explosion but brother is the fire God coming down and cleansing alive it ages the noise and somebody running up and down down screaming and shouting and impersonating a real a real gift no it's it's more than that it's the Holy Ghost coming and you pass from death and the line Oh things pass away behold all things become new just recently in South Africa they're having a conference for the youth we just had something more than a conference we had a we we had a youth camp for the kids seeing the Holy Spirit come down baptize people demons cast out sick heal but in this one this is a message message group we called a youth conference because it's not a meeting with some service items that's what they call special songs and preaching there will be no preaching going on can you imagine we're gonna call a conference with God and there's no preaching how well can you have a conference with God and there'd be no preaching preaching casts out Devils when the word is preached demons are cast out people get saved well if you ain't gonna having a preaching you ain't gonna have no salvation so you're just gonna come together and talk about your sins so we're gonna spend four to five hours and you think I've been long this morning these are with the youth we're gonna spend four to five hours discussing the following points the role is sexual development in the youth the role of sexuality what message youth are so vulnerable sexual addictions the addictions and Benari discussing the possible solutions for their problems there's not a Baptist Church this ain't this ain't The Promise Keepers this is a message so-called message preacher that's why I call him so called the ain't born again there he is and then they not there is a major epidemic with regards to fornication pornography and risin of homosexuality in our churches and I wonder why because there's no signature preached because it's gonna have an a a meeting and talk about our problems talk about our sexualities you know what the organizer of this event further said causes have a ministry I do not support the statement they must get the Holy Ghost and then it goes away you don't think the death angels come here he is a man they would rather have an ill arts or talk then to have the power of the Holy Ghost in the message third Exodus brother Brennan said that Church fields that don't need the Holy Spirit the churches will tell you that that's what he just said and men can stand up and give you such an intellectual talking almost make you believe it now let's stop just a minute Jim did Jesus say the two would be so close together it would to see the very elected if it was possible the intellectual tops would be so smooth that it would to see the people its gospel it's men who can handle that word in such a way they can almost make any intellectual person if you're just trusting in their intellectual they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man and I'll tell you why sin issues aren't going away when you are saying you got the Holy Ghost by believing the message because what you're calling the Holy Ghost is an intellectual conception nothing more than a cheap Baptist profession of faith that you accepted Christ or accepted the message so you saved 1964 God's provided way that's what's the matter today with the people a new birth they'll all dodge it they don't like it they have substituted something for the new birth come up and believe that's all you have to do the devil believes himself and you know he's not born again there's a new birth there's something goes with it hello it ain't a motion but there is something that goes with it it's a kind of unfitting on tasting to the world any birth is a mass I don't care worthy it's in a pigpen a hospital birth is a mess if so it's a new birth it'll make you didn't do things you didn't think you would it'll make you get down at the altar and try and scream and watch the pain of your face and raise your hands and praise God speak in tongues and all kinds we'll think the new birth will do that because it's God's provided way to be born again but you gotta die you gotta die before you can be born and that's the problem people don't want to die and to sand unto their own wade but that fire of God has got to come and burn send desire out of you and it's an expression his new life comes into you hey man let me tell you if you get the holy girl sin goes away you don't blame me Paul talked s Romans 6:6 come back to Paul's gospel knowing this our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth are from now on we should not search said he that is dead it's freed from sin [Applause] so they're not getting them dead enough so new life can come what they need is an eighth day experience come on I'm talking about a Pentecostal experience a man I'm talking about word where all the germs all the sin all the unbelief of the ziggurats it but not the V it all burns up and you're born to do a new creature are you with me amen and when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shock like that well I don't think it's a shame Amen I think it's a part of the process when a baby is born maybe it don't scream and holler it's a dead baby come on somebody that when you're born again by the Holy Spirit if you don't rejoice a mountain glorify God and it don't change your life and give you a new beginning you're a dead baby that's what's the matter with these message churches around here today they're bringing more dead children their dead to God not dead to send the Holy Spirit home brother Tim today come so quietly you you don't even know when the king oh you just want what God just kind of evolved into the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is a definite experience you show me one time in the Bible just told me one time one place where they got the Holy Ghost and it was this quite easy believe ISM just read it I'm not all the way every occasion the Holy Ghost came it wasn't that way and then every time it happened the Bible said it was a noise and explosion the burning out of sins desire question answers number two who is asked brother Branham about the Holy Ghost and I'm paraphrasing here what manifestation is known he said what could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it she that could become unconscious not to know it neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it there's something take place in you there's something that changes you your whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again and you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible said puts it a new creature creation in Christ a man see something takes place in here oh I can I can go on but anyway brother Branham said you say you cannot this is his word 64 you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens now you say I believe I respected the word you say you say you believe I respect but the words laying there waiting for the Holy Spirit to put it to work it takes the lighting of the candle here's a candle with the wick but the tiler everything's in a table that have it in that candle but until that fire comes on it'll not shine any light no matter how perfect the candle is how perfect little burn and everything that's got to be lit and it burns and when you believe and you're made up for the instructions of what the Holy Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness fruits of the spirits of bears it out until the Holy Spirit where the fiery experience comes down and lights that candles then you haven't received the Holy Ghost so you have to have the experience to have the Holy Ghost oh no it's not a sensation this is not back to the Pentecostal sensation again but back to the original a man notices brother Branham said he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the father's bringing a restoration again of the Pentecostal genuine not sensations but and will manifest the evening light the same Sun that showed in the morning light as promised for the day so the new birth Burt's you into eternal life now I'm skipping I'm going down I'm going to leave out some things amen but I I want you just to get it listen let's get it clear when brother Branham said the Holy Ghost came up on people as he preached they walked out women that were buck naked there in the in his meetings Ernst in Africa covered ourselves under the presence of the Holy Spirit and walked out hey man brother Branham tells us about the token when the token comes it'll make a man a man and a woman a woman make a man masculine and a woman feminine it'll take that perverted spirit away from you we've got the cure for a homosexual we got the cure for sex scenes and photography oh man listen he says you you take a person says I'm a believer let the gospel light struck them brother they'll take it right now and they'll show results you'll not see that man anymore in the tool rooms you not seem up there in the cigarette in his hand you won't seem drinking let me do that you won't see him in movie houses gonna set down with all this filthiness of the world taking an ever devil come on you won't see them do that you won't seem flirting with other women no no I don't care how much they throw their female flesh before he'll turn this head toward the skies and look toward Christ it shows the remedy took effect even brother Branham didn't know what to tell him he said young man came to me I got a boy 16 another young boy said both their little males what can I tell him he says sirs I don't know he didn't have nothing to tell him what can what somebody else what did one of these smart egghead preachers and the mess he's going to tell him then ain't gonna preach ain't gonna have a song ain't gonna have an altar call ain't gonna have the Holy Ghost there what's he going to tell him it might tell him something might it my promise to live true and not do this no more and not do that and I'll be true in the last month or two but this are changing I'm just about through I'm just about through if you know what goal I'm reaching far more reaching for 230 so hang on I'm gonna try to be nothing buddy yeah I'm a little over time that's okay this is burning on my heart this is really important a man he said sir I don't know take him to Christ let him get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and they'll turn their heads to the modern trip strip tease a man he said and thinking man's filtering he said when you get that thinking man's filter which is the Holy Ghost it'll filter out sin he said God's filter when his mind is filtered through the Word of God God's filter he won't look up on her he won't think she's pretty he'll think she's a Jezebel he'll think behind those red lips his poisoned bangs that would spin and the Bible says her gates as a gates of hell and a man walks in there then like an ox going to slaughter there's a thinking man's filter what do you decide when the woman comes down the street just like that you men turn your head and gaze around like that you're not using to thinking man's filter because when you do that you're committing adultery who seven look at the little woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already turn your head thinking man get away from her she's not pretty seize a second that's right she twists like one she acts like one she stings like one keep away from her hey man yes the Word of God is a thinking man's filter and that's what your soul is still it filtered to is the Word of God so it's the whole land it's the whole lamb the bread unleavened bread and it brings you to a holy life it's the Passover let's go back to the beginning this is a Passover Church we're in a Passover the Death Angel is passing by there's a REAL Death Angel the token must be applied you must be eating the lamb go back Passover go back to the beginning and I heard that sweet music come again she's to be the same bride the same kind out of the same material she was in the first place read Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message and it turned the hearts of the children back to the father's back to the original Pentecostal message word by word brothers we are here hallelujah we're in a time like the eighth day a new beginning here the 11th hour workers as brother Brennan said they've seen the same page that the first our workers dan7 angel message opens the mysteries of this seventh seal calling the eleventh hour' Works's to receive the same pay that the first our workers got so perfectly we'll have the first our messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth that came in at the day of Pentecost and the evening message is to restore back again back to the same thing again it brings us back to the beginning I'm bringing it down stay with me in these next few minutes it brings us back to our beginning the eighth day is when the earth

believes that and now we're at the end of it let me believes that and the messenger has now come in close and has deposited the message and we have come through seven days or seven Church ages and we're back to leave from time into eternity nothing to another age but into eternity not into an age called the Fridays but into eternity we're about to enter in to eternity now the rapture it's the seventh church age brother Branham said in the rapture messages is one of his last sermons now it's a seventh Church age that takes the rapture so you got to be in the seventh age to take the rapture all the other six dieting it was translated because he was not found God took him but Aynak raptured and was a type of them of the rest of them dying of the type of all the rest of them dying but the endtime bride will be called out direction without death will be called out of the seventh church age which we are now bearing record of that age so we're bearing record of this last age we're not

a great magnet and he'll pick up that little church that's been persecuted and the hangar yonder in the Hall of Fame and she'll go to the sky shouting this realm of flesh I'll drop and rise and seize everlasting prize and shot well passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer [Applause] oh he said that dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen the holy spirit that we've worked in a mouth small measure while the headstone coming down to unite to the body well while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head of the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up again just a sec we like that and even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the sky that dynamics is this holy spirit hey man I'll have you all to stand now brother darling can't reach 15 30 more minutes after you have some stand hallelujah I'm just gonna

death angel but Matthew 26 29 but I say to you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until the day I drink it new new beginning with you in my father's Kingdom we're gonna have a communion a Passover a supper we'll remember we will remember back when that awful night of this life was over and we're sitting there at the table it stretches a thousand miles long we remember and commemorate the last night of the last age when death got swallowed up in victory we'll remember Calvary when he became the lamb and will remember his eighth day when he rose from the grave his eighth day experience and he exploded from the tomb we'll remember when the church we remember back when the church had to say they experienced on the day of Pentecost and that explosion from the upper room we remember when we had our own personal Pentecost our own eighth day experience and sin and darkness passed away with a great noise we remember that in the darkest of hours in Laodicea that the church had her eighth day experience and there the seven seals was open and we returned to be in the bride we were a Pentecost we remember some of us feeble old some crippled some blind but they felt that change sweep over them and were changed back to the beginning and they experienced her eighth day of a new beginning and a new body on that home that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection oh and it shows one shall get to that home when the rose Oh [Music] when [Music] well he's the homecoming we've only been there I want to read this
