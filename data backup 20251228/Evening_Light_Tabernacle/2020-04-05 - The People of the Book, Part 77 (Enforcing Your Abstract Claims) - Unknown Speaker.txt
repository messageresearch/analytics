your discretion in Jesus name Amen amen well god bless you man it's good to be with you today as we come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus and we gathered together in our homes today and we worship the Lord and we look to him and we thank God for His goodness and His mercies His grace who want to thank you the team that has come out today to make this service possible and although you don't see the audience here I want you to know that's sitting on every one of these pubes or the angels of God that have gathered and he kept about us so we thank God for his presence today that he said I'll never leave you or forsake you amen I'd like to read from Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 and just reading in the Word of God today we're going to be speaking on the people of the book are as we are here in the land of the promise and here we are to enforce our abstract claims and that's what we're going to be speaking on this morning enforcing your abstract claims a man and here in the book of Ephesians it tells of this battle that we have vision six verse Tim finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand what's this word stand against the wiles of the devil but we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places instantly interestly enough this word high places is the same word used earlier in the scripture in the visions one where he speaks of heavenly places so this is a battle of the heavenly realms and he says wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand don't give up keep on standing stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith where would you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints may God bless you you can be seated and god bless you as you gathered today in and to honor the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and to to announce to the world that He is risen that he's not dead but he's a living God I want you to bear in mind a couple of scriptures that we have been using as a theme I won't read them this morning but as you know from Daniel chapter 12 were in that day so Michael stand up in a very troublesome time and deliver those whose names are written in the book and then also in Revelation chapter 12 and there's seven we won't read it but the war in heaven where Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his and the dragon fought in his angels but they prevailed not and neither was their place what's these words again neither were there their place found any more in heaven so again the battle is a battle within the heavenly realm but ever since the fall of man heavenly battles became earthly battles and men and women such as yourself are our part of the soldiers in this battle if we were not going to fight then why was it that we were told for this fight to put on the whole armor of God to prepare yourself for battle now this seems kind of strange because we say well God has given us this land God has given us this promise of his word and he has restored it back to us and it is our inheritance so we would think automatically that it would be given to us on a silver platter that you know it just handed right over to it God gave it to us but that's not the way that it is you have to fight for every inch of it God give you a healing God gave you salvation God gives you deliverance but you have to fight to possess that to claim it for yourself if you find this with Israel God gave Israel a title to the land of Canaan but they would have to clear it of its inhabitants numbers 33 52 says then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite plucked down all their high places and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the lamb to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your family and to the more you shall give it the more inheritance and to the viewer you shall give it the less inheritance and every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your father's ye shall inherit now canaan was a land that was that rightfully belong to Israel God had given it to Abraham and to his seed and yet there were squatters that were there illegally living there they were enjoying the benefits while of that land while Israel was down in Egypt in bondage living as slaves the milk and the honey the oil and the wine of the land was being enjoyed by those to whom it did not belong and fiercely today spirits of unbelief possess and insist on holding back God's promises from us as believers it isn't that God's promises isn't true it isn't that the land does not exist it is not that it doesn't have its milk and honey and it doesn't have its wonderful fruits and and grapes a cluster that is so big that two men in it it takes two men to pack it out and to show it to Israel of the of the fertility of that land and what it provides if you notice it would album it would have the figs and the pomegranate and the grapes it would have three fruits or the three pulls or the that would would be shown to us you know what it can do well wonder what is the power that lays in this land what what life given resources lay within it but of course it is possessed and this is what discouraged the children of Israel when they went over to take that land of promise that were discouraged by the report of the spies but you know we went there and they're stronger than us and and we're not able to take it and that brought back an evil report of we just can't do this and maybe the circumstances that you're looking at today and the problems that you're facing maybe puts a fear in your heart we just can't go through this we can't make it through it we can't possess this but I want you to day to be a Joshua and the Caleb and look at the promise of God and say we're more than able to take it it is our land and in our possession and and you know that we are able to take this possession that belongs to us but fiercely today spirits of unbelief possess and insist on holding back God's promise and maybe you're looking at a promise for healing and it seems like every demon of hell wants to camp on every scriptural promise their ears and laugh at you and mock you for your tenacity of trying to hold on to that word but I wanted to say to you hold on my child joy comes in the morning the battle is the Lord's man you may have run out of strength but God hasn't run out of strength and God is still God regardless of the circumstances that you are facing and today we battle against this unbelief even until now unbelief in doubts and fear all resist our possession of the land as we go out to fight I want you to never forget the awful price that Jesus paid so that we can have possession of every promise of this land I want you to remember that Calvary is not in vain where he was wounded for your transgressions and he was bruised for your iniquities and the chastisement of your peace fell upon him and with His stripes you were healed it was it was not for nothing that Jesus died paid the price of redemption but it was for you so that you could possess every promise of the atonement everything that Jesus paid for belongs to you and yet the battle rages now revelation 9 shows 200 million supernatural demons released and allowed to come to this battle as hell opens wide his mouth and I want to say don't be discouraged at this because when all of Pharaoh and his armies came against Israel it was for their hurt and for their destruction and not for the children of God just enough this distant not escaped gods and notice and neither was it something that wasn't in God's plan but way before the world began when he shaped the earth and he put the mountains and he put the sea he knew exactly he would bring his children right down here and it would be here he would trap Pharaoh and all his armies and bring deliverance to his children never forget never forget this God has got it whatever your problem is the battle rages but our God it's his battle and not yours so you see there is 200 million supernatural demons that God has released and allowed to come to this battle because this is a day where hell will meet his defeat this is a day of a rapture where people are under an eagle anointing a man as we are under that anointing where miracles happen where you're snatched out of a situation in a moment one moment SiC another moment well at one moment in distress and problem and another woman snatched out of it one moment about to go down into the door of death and the next moment it snaps out of it just in the nick of time this is the way that to say eagle anointing works and I want you to remember you're under that anointing even your strength that feels so weak this morning they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they will run and not be weary they shall walk and they shall not face wait on the Lord this morning expect him to come on your own to you for your need sir revelation 9 shows 200 million supernatural demons I wonder what God looks at it if he doesn't just say that the devil is that all you got you know the Satan's Eden and now I've even a special permission for you to bring in a reserve to call up your reserve that have been waited for this time and now you've got not just the demons you've been fighting with and well and had in your army for all this but now you have reinforcements of 200 million more but you don't got enough because I want you to know we are not the only ones in this battle the word preached and his fullness has liberated the Holy Spirit that was not allowed to work down to the ages because of man-made denominational spirits you see denominational Church world with its Creed's and man-made dogmas has bound and sequestered the Holy Ghost down through the dark ages and even through bitter persecution where they killed out believers trying to stop out the true faith and to keep the Holy Spirit from working in the church because of man systems during these past two thousand years and they continue fighting against the holy spirit unto this day but I want you to know the time is up because now the Holy Spirit has found somebody a people of God in this last day who he can work through a man Michael whose name means who is like Jehovah the angel of his presence it should stand up to deliver God's people those whose names are written in this book and then again in Revelation 12 fighting against Lucifer and his army I want you to know war has been declared a man in the heavens war has been declared this war is to the bitter end and in this war there will be a bride go up and Satan will be cast down there will be a people moved back into the position where Adam fell from a trade that's kings and priests a man and rule and reign over every disease and every affliction you think cancer is something you say this disease that is coming there is something let me tell you we're not just looking for just for divine healing we're looking for it total from the top of your head to the sole of your feet changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it's the eagle and nineteen teased now as I said war has been declared I want you as I preach Sunday about the unseen realms and the angels I want you to realize Michael has called all his hosts together a man just as Satan has gathered all of his and we're right here at the final battle war has been declared and it's time for Adams race to return to their position that was once held in God's presence brother branham would tell us this in the Feast of the trumpets he says that church and let me decide with its creeds and dogmas of man and unbelief has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly two thousand years and it did it by martyrdom back there under the church ages he's been bound not as a river Euphrates but at the door of creeds and dogmas and he said that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of manmade systems but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said so brother Branham is telling us that even as there has been a liberation of spirits that God has held back until this time and would not let move and operate until until it would bring on a tribulation time here they are now come and streaming right into this dimension and here as the battle begins to raise he said so as the Holy Spirit been held back at the doors of creeds and dogmas unbelief has held it back remember Sunday sermon unbelief was holding it back unbelief held Jesus back from doing many mighty work miracles but with Jesus found faith when Jesus found somebody that would believe when Jesus found that there was a group of people who who started believing him it was there Jesus can unleash the power of God and I want you to know as his bride has begun to believe a man the power is being released so don't look for less power look for more power and man because for you the doors of creeds and dogmas have been moved down obliterated man the Holy Spirit is free to do what the Bible said to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out in his name it is liberated for the purpose of meeting those 200 million demons that has been released so God in the in time sends a message that will remove the shackles of she creeds and dogmas and unbelief a man so people can start believing again now so it's liberated to meet the spirits and he says and those to meet one another on the battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for two thousand years almost almost two thousand years of Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for near almost two thousand years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it and he promised it hallelujah hey man so therefore the Holy Spirit is back in the church again the evening time message brings the Holy Spirit back in the church the life not just the tongue not just an emotion but the life with the faith back in the church again indeed the Holy Spirit is released to do battle against these millions of demons and then we hear them going through the country right now we see a manifested in an insidious disease that is going on to the land as a striking fear chaos in our world today but I want you to notice here this the Holy Spirit is also released to do battle against these millions of demons a man for you said the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of manmade systems you see man-made systems formulas policies to do away with the baptism of the holy ghost with the real precious in filling of the Spirit worried has been substitute with either easy believe ism or emotionalism man but now and now again we have access to the real true genuine Holy Ghost that literally for Jesus Christ back in the believer again a man soon so again it formulas and policies to do away with prayer lines and altar calls and divine healings and speaking in tongues and gifts of the Spirit and the supernatural workings of cloth but we have been done liberated from them we have thrown off their yoke hallelujah yeah I know down to the ages they bound the church the this kind of unbelieving theology this faithless preaching made Goliath really brave and made the church really weak brother branham found this to me true when he began to preach Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it is true when the church has forgot how to cast out Devils that this is their Commission everywhere they go they are to cast out Devils Amanda castle out devil brings salvation in the Flex room and in the sphere around and man casting out Devils they you know again the church has forgotten about how to cast out Devils instead they're telling you how to live with Devils you have to live with your problems you have to live with your habits you have to learn to live with with your temper and and learn live with your gambling problem or your sins or you have to learn to live with them I'm telling you friend let me tell you the church has forgot that they are to cast those Devils out we're not to live with them and man we are to walk three of them the same is true for divine healing we we're told well you know if it be the will of God if it be the will nothing here is the will of God a man here is the will of God he's already told in his will he told the church what to do when somebody comes to the altar and seeking salvation do we say if it be God's will you'll be saying no we say it is God's will for you to be saved and man you can receive the Holy Ghost all you need to do is repent and accept that is your own man when it comes to divine healing we have to do the same thing instead of say if it be thy will god what a dishonoured thing after Jesus showed his will I will shoot up prosper in health I want you to be healed I got Laurie to take on human battles to pay for your for your sins and your sickness if it be thy will my goodness how many how many different ways does he have to show us his will his whole ministry was showing his attitude toward the sick and the lost ministry Jesus ministry of William Branham which displayed again the ministry of Jesus Christ shoot his attitude about sickness and sin right a man but again the church has forgot its commission that you are commissioned to cast Satan out until they know nothing about being a spiritual church they called himself a word Church and that becomes a phrase oh we're where where the word where the word you don't call himself a word Church but they're just a theological Church for that know nothing about using a two-edged sword a word Church let me tell you about a word Church a to church here your prophet says and if the church is the true church it will have the same spirit the very same spirit and the word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tons and interpretation and prophecy and healers and God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah now that's a word church but they see in even when brother Branham went out commissioned by an angel even in the early days before the angelic visit when he went when he went to pray for his little sister Georgia Carter looking for that lamb that was in the caught up in the brambles of unbelief down in the wilderness and he you know he would have to deal with church theology the persecution was not coming from the government per se and the World Council of Churches but was that it communica thinking that we're all the same and and you know we just have a philosophy today and and anyway we're doing and don't did disturb our people by by telling them they need a real experience with God and the divine healing is real and for today you know there's let us set where we're at no don't don't make us move out of our comfort zone I wonder how the church got comfort or becoming comfortable anyway they're sitting in a place where miracles were passed where there was no healing where there was no deliverance they said there the whole church the standing defeated because some demons some Goliath was crying out the days that miracles are past but it didn't work when David a man of gods come up that little stooped stooped shoulder ruddy lookin boy but God was with him he had an experienced man his brethren the clergy you know said get back to your seat dates of miracles of past your naughty boy you know where wonder where did you get your education if you delay if you listen to us you know we can't defeat this Goliath we got to find some way to reason with him and you know get him to go back and maybe we'll be slaves or what have you you know the boy but you know David could stand here and I'm talking about the messenger and this day the prophet of God he could say but I've met an angel and the glides he said you meet with a sword in the shield and with science and education with your theology and but I meet you with a commission given by an angel hey man you don't Saul Saul tried to give him an honorary degree of some armor and and things like that but he said they don't fit me I don't know anything about your theology and besides that your theology is never defeat a glide yet whether you're wearing it are wearing it what it won't defeat Goliath there's only one thing that will defeat him I'm coming in the name of the Lord I'm coming because I am a circumcised child of God that is under a covenant of God that covenant i can stand there with an axe axe in my feet is cleared and my sins are cold my sacrifice has been offered and accepted and I am God's I am the seed of Abraham and today Wow let's Giants head off I am anointed for this job how many of you out there were just saying that that's the the Prophet would say the bride is in doing it one of this day how many would declare I am anointed I am The Anointed of the Lord a man and I'm going to slay this giant that says the days of miracles are past there's got his mouth on the churches everywhere now like David of old he couldn't slay all the Philistines but he can kill that boaster out there man Goliath and when Goliath was slain while all of Israel took courage and away they went and and they beat the Philistines plumb back to their gates and he says what we need today is somebody with an experience like David who will stand up and say you mean to tell me that you let men and people rise up and tell you the days of miracles has passed and that Jesus blood dried up 1,900 years ago and you and all we need to do is join the church well why in the world would we change the gospel of power into a powerless religion the church world has done that bivalent god from the people by covering its crease with wood trees are its trees truth with reeds of men they've tried to put God behind a veil of trees and hide him and say we got all of God here Matthew 28:13 2313 says but what would you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you set up the Kingdom of Heaven against men but you neither go in yourselves and neither suffer ye them that are going that are Internet to go in so he said this is what religious systems are doing they're setting up the kingdom of heaven and they will go in themselves and neither will they allow anybody else to go in but I want you to understand friend the job of the message was to restore the power of the Holy Ghost back to the church again to bring back a God of miracles a God of healing the god of delivers a God of true salvation that's what this message is about the job of the seven messenger is to unveil that God hey man the mighty God unveiled before us the unveiling of God we've heard of those sermons we ought to look at him in a new light and the veil was turned off or torn off and the mighty God was unveiled before us but unfortunately what's happened is like what happened with there with the Jews after the temple veil was ripped away when Jesus was crucified they they just put up another you know again this is this is the problem you know as soon as God moves a veil here the the people want to put up another and it's the same old devil just just new excuses you know we can't do that that was brother branham's job we can't do that we can't all angels can't be present today and pillar of fire is not for us and and the Holy Ghost doesn't move like he used to oh you know we got the word now or Oh friends if it's the word work where's the power that goes with the word hey mom there has to be a vindication to that word so well it's already been vindicated yeah it was in Jesus time and it was again in our time but again it's gotta be manifested in your own mouth in the unveiling of God brother Branham says the word has had a veil over at all these years to the people it can't be done and this is where we come again because no sooner than God will pulled the veil down men just put up another and it's amazing it's amazing how many criticized william branham for seeing an angel oh yeah and he would have to defend that because they said all that was only for the Old Testament in the New Testament we got the Holy Ghost and so we don't have Angelica visitations well Jesus was strengthened by Angelus Peter was delivered by one a man a real angel that stepped out of a light and took the bands off of him and opened up the doors and then we think we're living in a great time where we just you know our sins to be in there by a sinner and it opens the doors for us Peter had one of them one day invisible hands opened the doors and he walks right out of jail hey man you know he you know he was straightened he was treated and then delivered Paul had visitations by an angel judge on the leper Revelator talked to one can you imagine having to defend angelic visitations and man but it comes around today we can fit two years now away or so well angels are present anymore and God doesn't speak and year you can hear the good voice of God oh that was only for the prophet or some other things days of miracles are passed and oh we got the word today same old Church of Christ and the Christ spirit that moves again that says oh that was just the framework now we got what's real we've you got what's real then friends we ought to have everything in it brother Branham would say he's in Velen of God you remember the sermon I preached the morning when I left the first time about David and Goliath and David I said look out there to challenger say in the days of miracles is past what some tapes as it come down and watch each one how its come in more planar and planar if you have ears to hear and I see eyes to see what their stands that great I said that their stands at great ecclesiastical world out there that's InDesign to be gauged that it cannot be done but I said but God in that life boy was ever taken but once never been was taken then it was on the Ohio River there her down on the river there where they never took the picture of it he said they II told me it would be done he would make a call and it would sweep the nation no to reminds you what it said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of Christ man and that that was again spoke at the Ohio River it would be spoken of again and again and the Pentecostal circles as men and women would stand up and prophesy speak in other tongues not knowing it was said and say it again God has sent us Elijah the Prophet God has sent us a message in this last day God has sent us a restoration and what that restoration was to do was to turn our hearts back to the faith turn us back to believe it again then he said and even the dr. Davis that was as Baptist pastor said you were the grammar school education passin to the seventh grade we'll be praying for kings and monarchs and we'll start a revival then to sweep the nation's and he said I said that's what he said and it's been done see it's been done that's the thing he don't need no interpretation he's done it he's already done it that interprets ourself see calling his elected see from all walks of life and now it's made manifest so so again you know as he starts out you think he starts out and body receives him he starts on there's opposition among do you think we're standing in this last day without opposition there's even more opposition 200 more million supernatural demons coming against us trying to battle war against us in our minds coming with every kind of news and education and scientific knowledge and ideas a man against the Word of God and yet when God would unveil it and rip the veil at Calvary Israel just put up another one and when God would unveil himself in this day and show he still has the same attitude and does the same thing what does men dude just put up another veil now the old say in the days of miracles has passed the walls have turned torn down Jehovah still stands at full view manifesting his word unveiled one that's right notice the Gentile Church has been blinded from the from the veil after it's been torn off and shown God the ecclesiastical veil how by veiling the word in a human being again so again it was it was an ecclesiastical pressure and in ecclesiastical veil and we're looking we're looking at and many people are saying well you see it is a persecution against the church now because it won't let us meet together well that's funny when you read in the West plain news and there missourian in the in the flu epidemic or pandemic back in the 1800 or 1918 rather and then a terrible Spanish flu come through the country to kill millions and the mayor puts that in the paper no assembly and anywhere churches are to be closed schools that are closed that businesses are closed everything is closed and we as we try to to quell this virus that is going through but did the same thing newspaper clips under seen from from from British Columbia saying the same thing we were shutting down everything trying to quell this virus that is going to the land what the religious persecution now is not what now I'm but where it is is it's still against this bride in an ecclesiastical manner of the days of miracles are past we don't need to move of God we don't need the Holy Ghost hey man oh my brother Brennan said what we need today is a good old-fashioned st. Paul's revival and the baptism of the Holy Ghost like it found on the day of Pentecost to bring the people back to a living faith in God again that's exactly said I believe in confessions to raise up and accept Jesus Christ that's good see Billy Graham was doing that I believe in all of that but friends we need something more than that and I'll tell you you've got to realize today we need something more than I just be the message I believe God sent a prophet we need an experience to go along with that not just a head knowledge a sympathetic agreement that it's true you know well we know that God did it but the days of miracles is past not for David he was anointed he knew where he was at positionally The Devil's doesn't said the days of miracles have passed and gotten to the preachers and preached that all through the country notice known as we said the devil moved and he moved into the preachers I wonder if we can't see his movement he moves into the preachers and holiness isn't preached anymore he moves into the preacher and we just self-serve the gospel you just a pleasant way of everything's gonna be alright you know again again where where is the cry going out right now repent flee to God and then went to the horns of the altar I'm gonna pray that it ain't too late where is the cry that is going out across America come back get your priorities right what are the real essentials what do you really need [Applause] the devil's done said the days of miracles is past got into all the preachers and preached that through the country but arrows have been David not long ago a man got his head chopped off I'm telling you what the Israelites armies of beating it now from not to west east to south and I'm just saying friends if you're a follower of this message you got a sword you're beaten not into me any man who's saying the days of miracles is past right now we need miracles right now we need divine healing right now we need some real altar calls right now we need some people filled with the Holy Ghost the power of God moving the church right now we need it more than ever so what is the intellectualism going to do for you now what good is had knowledge going to do for you now I'll guarantee you now there are many ways the altar had never been put in the basement and the people knew how to pray I guarantee you now you wish that faith had been preached and not so much intellectualism and had knowledge I've guarantee you right now in a moment like this when we're facing this demon that is threaten humanity divine healing all of a sudden isn't a minor anymore I'm out and let me just say this divine healing never was a minor now III know I know right now yeah just to your your typing on your quote deals and you're gonna prove me wrong on that it was only minor when it was compared to the need of salvation of the soul but it isn't truly a minor this is a dual atonement and divine healing is equally important I remember he was wounded for our transgressions and by His stripes we were healed a man so and if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection I'm out so you see it's not that much of a minor is it but even if it is considered minor how can you say you've got the word and you don't have it included how can you have a perfect word I mean know nothing about divine even in the message fellowship brother Brennan said notice if we have that and that was included a Redemption we've got to have divine healing for the earnest of our complete deliverance if there is no divine healing there's no resurrection of the Dead how about that teacher if there's no divine healing there's no resurrection divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection if the Holy Spirit is here that's the earnest of our eternal life you know the Bible said the Holy Ghost is your down payment your deposit a man it's the earnest of your inheritance it ain't all of it is the support taste right well you know that that again is is the Holy Ghost is is the foretaste of our complete redemption but again it's a deposit but if the Holy Spirit is the earnest there what about the change of our body then divine healing is the earnest of our change if we brother madam would say often if I can't get you to believe even then divine healing how am I gonna believe get you to believe for a rapture now if that doesn't mean well if you're sick new you die well you just didn't have the faith for a rapture that's not what that means that what he means is if I can't even get the church to just simply believe for the healing of their body how am I going to get them to believe for a complete transformation from from ashes and a spoonful of dirt to becoming a man back again how I'm not gonna get you to believe in a resurrection I'm not gonna get you to believe in and the body cheat how am I gonna get you to believe in the translation if I can't get you to even believe it divine healer listen the reason God included divine healing how could you take it out of the gospel when he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes were healed the same birth from the same man on the same day one for salvation one for healing to deny one is to deny the other and they've just turned it around today in the days of Jesus healing here in the physical bodies that we know he can heal but he makes herself God by forgiving sins and but now today the same he's all right he can forgive sin but he can't heal but he says praise be to God he can do both I'm a witness and so are there many millions around the world to a man but now he would tell us just before he left our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us and I wonder when it's time for us to stop just hearing it intellectually and get in the presence of God to our faith is this is an hour to use that faith I'm an amateur faith a faith that is ripe then that is ready to meet the challenge of the hour we're facing a crisis in the world and people who know their God will do X voice a man o brother Adam would tell us about his leaving from the home church going out on the mission field he says I'm thinking about another Sunday morning when I was leaving the tabernacle and you people were weeping and asking me not to go but when I preached on David and Goliath and how are you going to face that cold indifferent world that says the days of miracles are past I said if there's one big time there's one big giant and as soon as we can slay him the recive will take courage I'm still drawing courage from that a mountain I can look back here at lately I've been going through some of the prayer lines that is sermon just hearing some of the things that have been said and I have been going through the supernatural books and looking at these things over again you know why because we need a supernatural God I know some of you are searching for plagues and searching for our God for depression and searching for financial troubles and all of this you know what's happening is their play we're not in the tribulation but we are in a day of trouble and what I'm searching the message for is can I be found with that faith somebody gotta believe this word in this crisis each day I pray for you God put a wall about your people protect them yet we hear beloved brothers and sisters who are sick with this virus I still believe there's a wall of fire I still believe there's a god of deliverance God deliver your people hey man he says there's one big giant and as soon as we can slay him one glass disco eyes the same days of miracles his past he said the rest will take courage and the Lord granted that there was no Robert so Jagger's so forth pulled his sword and we fought the enemy on the land shut their mouths they can't say that miracles don't happen because they sure that here they are sure God's Word is eternally flashed on the Urim flashed on the word that's his here I'm Thurman and when he flashed on that it was positive hey ma'am and so without a doubt I want to say without a doubt William Branham through that giant and proved that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but Goliath has some brothers who have defined the word of God and once again declare that Christ is not the same but I wanted to say it sometimes Remender eyes david's mighty men a man is described in and second Samuel 23 men who have been inspired but David's courage a man men like ELISA who slew through Philistines until his hand stuck to his sword and I say God let that be me may I be an ally either in this day take my sword against the enemy and strike and strike and strike him until you have to pry my hands off of the sword men such as a dino who slew 800 Philistines at a time others who killed lion like men others who went down in the pit and killed a lion others who who fought men men who'd hurt David who they believed would be king saud for drinkable water out of the well of Bethlehem now let me just say again you know we we have we've seen the Goliath same yeah we can point to a figure who God used but I want you to remember remember friends not making the man God at all let's forget about that but but realizing the real David is Christ he's the one that's coming King hey mom he's the one that really slayed the Goliath even the angel of God tell brother better never forget it's not you doing it it's me doing it I think this is what we got to take courage in this hour never forget this isn't done by human strength this isn't a a weak and frail man this is God I'm a brother branham but say over and over you didn't touch me you touch the high priest he was say over and over I would heal you I could but Jesus Christ has already done it a man over and over and over again he would declare I can't do this but he came if I can bring his presence and you know that he's real by suing you signs and you know that he's alive in the same yesterday today and forever you know he's here to kill your Goliath but then he said he he counted his self as one of those mighty men who was tannin with David who is to be king and will crown him in the Millennium to come and he said they're the real David Christ is a fugitive outside his church if you look at him in Revelation chapter 3 he is on the outside of the church and he's knocking warning in oh they're still singing about him they're still talking about him they're still preaching sermons about him but he's not there he's not welcomed his presence and welcome his worship isn't welcome his word isn't welcome not the fullness of it oh yeah anyway David sighed and said I want a drink you know again brother branham would reflect on this he said what a time we're living what is the sign that God said he would show last before it was to come to pass what was the thing he said Israel in her place over yonder the victory restore and her set back again looking at everything's just exactly sitting in line and the church in the Laodicean condition with Jesus on the outside a fugitive to his own church just as David was up above juror Bethlehem a fugitive from his own people a fugitive and Christ the Bible said in the last day was a fugitive his own people and their revelation the third chapter of the Laodicean age that we're living Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in a fugitive from his own people or to his own people they didn't want him but now people are crying god save us an angel of death is coming to the land it's kind of like 9-1-1 you know when that happened even the beer joints put out saying god save america or god bless america yeah you know again the people all of sudden got religious people begin to call on God oh I hope it ain't too late hey man I hope right now that wallets wallets yet day that you yourself would make you called in an election sure a man they didn't want him but now people are wanting him now people are crying even church services well I can take it or leave it and I don't want to be us folder here this morning I want to be an encourage or but I don't want to say there have been many of times people have set out of Church when they could have been present but many times they've used have a little excuse of why not to be here a man that found some reason no I'd not to come and encourage the brothers and sisters and now now well now all of a sudden there's that want to be in church now all of a sudden a mystic you know this old adage is you've never missed the water to the well runs dry you never realized what you had remember this is a time God gives you an opportunity to reflect on what you have and it might be speaking to some people in your little churches ten twenty five people oh don't feel alone and by yourself I preach some many a sermon when I started out to 12 people killer 12 or less I've reached a million hour to where there wasn't 20 people man we've been bust we have been blessed abundantly and I don't know and I can't even make a promise to you will ever ever be able to come together again who knows only God it's in his hands some say whoa but what would be the use of this fine building what would be unused to this place that God did so many miracles I'll tell you what well that miracle is still going on right now as we're speaking across the foreign lands because if we didn't have where we're at right now we wouldn't have the internet capabilities to reach you this morning but God made a provision but there was David he the Bible said David long now we're making this David Christ then you will know that that I Christ is longing he'll know that that one could give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate second Samuel 23 16 and three mighty men break through the host to the Philistine that means the army other Philistines and through what around the well the Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David you see they heard just the side just an ill-wish from their king now they knew their king had been anointed they knew that Samuel the Prophet had poured the oil upon him they knew he was going to come into power let me just say we know our Lord Jesus is an onion we know these will be king of kings and Lord of lords we know that don't Satan may be king or Prince of this world right now that this king is coming to take it over a man and we hear we hear as they did they did you a sigh oh that I wasn't kidding get a drink if I could be refreshed now you're sitting in your room this morning in your house or in your little church somewhere maybe you're a little group of people somewhere whether it's here overseas and hanger you're looking today for some refreshments but I'm telling you in this moment he's looking for refreshment he's looking for somebody as relic Branham would say that what warrior could see the great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the little body of Christ had taken over again he says 10 with me and let's offer him a drink of fresh Pentecostal waters he said that some stagnated system but all fresh Pentecostal water a threat poor not the Holy Ghost and refresh your king with your praises this morning [Applause] hallelujah instead of yours woman refresh and you increase why don't you oh the other God Lord I love you and I worship you and I praise you and I thank you you are lord over all and today I give you an offering if I fight through the host of the Philistine I'm gonna bring it back to you I'm gonna bring you back an old ship Holy Ghost great tub water again where the power of the Holy Spirit can pour down upon the believers hallelujah and he said I mean not just a bunch of screaming and hollering and cara nonne but I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces a life of Jesus Christ back into the person that life Oh men of God in Christ where is that sword a man our Lord desires a fresh drink and I don't care if it's life or death let's cut through this thing it's so hard standing by yourself and I'm calling for men to stand by me and stand with the word what the word say just do the way the word said it I don't care what anybody else or anything else says stay stay it that way for there's only one thing that will cut let's go get back to Bethlehem the true water of God in his prayer he would pray like this Oh God I've noticed with that word and bring thy word promise to this last day to pass and may we leave this building this morning as shining instruments of God may we go with the sword its glittering in the air and cuddly ever weighed and everything else until we get back to the to get back to people to Christ and bring a cool fresh drink our Lord instead of all these fad may decrease let the people drink from that fountain a real cool refreshing Pentecostal blessing that it might bless his heart and bring him back among us again that ought to be our prayer warriors he said a fresh drink for him a real true worship a genuine heart where he can pour down as make his word to live in this day and he'll have it he said he restored the faith of the people back to the father's the faith of the children Malachi Ford tells us that will come and it'll be there don't you worry it'll be there Gustin said so and if you wonder will the faith be there I want to say that's what this message produces it produces that faith ok ma'am oh my not just an excitement not just an emotion that comes with it but create that undying faith that won't give an inch to the enemy now we have the word the Bible is our abstract and I'm going to try to bring it down in these next 30 minutes as we try to try to get to cover some territory this morning because I will told you I wanted to preach on enforcing our abstract of title we have the Word of God the Bible is our title man and the Holy Ghost is our abstract in other words it has cleared the deed and given you the right and it is time to throw out the squatter the invader that's on the island now you know many many years before David probably five seven eight hundred years before I don't know as far as chronologically what it was but you know Joshua had given the people the land but now the invaders had come in the land was theirs they had been possessing it but now invaders had come in that's what water filicide means an invader and so he is an invader and then when Satan like a Goliath invades your land and begins to claim your property and threaten use with this Angel of Death what are you to do now I meet Saul and his army was around trying to figure out what to do there was only one man with a solution and that was David and David said well here's the solution don't kill Goliath hey man the solution is easy I can I can solve the problem it ain't that hard we don't need 40 more days of looking around and wondered at making plans we just need to kill that glass today is heads coming off man and I just want to say when glass invades your land and claims your property claims your health claims your victory claims your joy and threatened you with an angel of death I'm gonna tell you so I'm out he's an invader he has no right to be there it is not his land it is your land I want to say to you this Bible is your Bible this word is your word this promise is your promise you don't belong to the devil he has no right to squat on it and say you can't have it and then you are the children of the Most High God and you've got to realize what you gotta do you gotta throw it off cast him out you're waiting for some miracle worker to come work your miracle you're the miracle worker a man you're the child of God so I'm out when Satan like the Goliath invades your land and claims your property and threatens you that's what you do throw him out don't negotiate no reason with him man turn out the Holy Ghost is your token it's your sign that the lamb has taken your place so it's your abstract that everything against you is struck off and it gives you a free pass so death angel you got a pass over me that's what you gotta announce who the devil today death angel you got a pass over this house we're under a token man say that remember brother branham would Satan say that be careful there's a people rising in the last day I see them coming amen show me the fire boys to the final age show him your token it's your abstract it shows that your deed is clear you have ever right to God's promises yeah that right took healing deliverance salvation come on every provision and the Bible ever need my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory amen remember when you truly repent and you have fully surrendered and you have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you are entitled to the token it's yours God can't hold it back the devil can keep you from it it's you just take in an exception it is for your own man there's something for something some of you need to do right now and say I accept that promise of the Holy Ghost from my life I've repented I've been baptized but right now I'm accepting it now that that's that's divine healing on the soul ram divine healer on the visible realm is the same day you say jesus paid for it and I am a repented child of God I have received the Holy Ghost and right now I accept all the promises that are his I accept that healing right now from my body in the name of Jesus Christ it's just a simple right there is that I accept it you did it you paid for it I'm taking it and then you take it and you hold on to it you don't let no devil talk you out of it full obedience to the Word of God the whole Word of God entitles us to the token o brother to him I did I do this right that I did you repent happy fully repented have you been baptized in his name then it entitles you to the Holy Ghost when you believe on the Lord and you confess him as your Savior you're you're an owner of the promise it's a deed but when you receive the Holy Ghost the token it is the abstract that your deed in other words it's the proof your deed is cleared and you are sealed with the Holy Ghost come on and then you saw I believed on the Lord I've accepted a message but this is a moment to get desperate and be filled with the spirit there's an angel of death in the land you must have the token our parish the older ghosts is a confirmation it's abstract that ever claim the devil has against you is tricky enough a man now and when you scan show the token of the Holy Ghost that you've got a right you've got a right to every any purchase thing that Jesus Christ died for it's a token you hold the token wove your unwavering faith in his promised word so I believe that Jesus said ask anything in my name and I'll do it and you hold that token that's the Holy Ghost over that promise word and walk round tonight I write to it I'm the Lodi heals all our diseases walk right into that I mean he was wounded for my transgression and with his fracture me healed I'm walking right into that take my token the Holy Spirit that is in me and hold it over my prayers a Lord God you promised it when I see that took an hour rewards I promise to do it he can't do nothing else he looks right to the blood of his own son there is the token apply he's got to do it because he promised it I meant so God expects you in this hour display the token it's our duty to express God to this world to your neighborhood and brother branham would over and over it must have been in his notes because every time he preached the token he would tell you these words he expects us now to display the token over our faith displayed the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost must be on display in the church he said that he expects us now to display the token over our faith to Satan's group and the unbelievers and the cults and so forth that don't believe in it that we believe in what he said others promise and that Jesus Christ has raised up from the dead showing himself alive and that's the badge the token of identification because it is Christ's own life and you didn't identify in the word it doesn't need ever anything else hallelujah and he expects us to also display is token over our fake to Satan and his unbelieving coats and denomination that we believe that his promise is true and he will do what he promised so this is the hour of best friend the Holy Ghost this is what brother Branham would say he says you can't leave the blood in the bucket it's got to be displayed on the doorpost and the same thing we've got to be identified with the Holy Ghost from this hour now there's a lot of people are professing faith but you must present your faith with your token that you've got a free pass that the Death Angel has to pass over now when you pray and I want to deal this with you you must position yourself you know it working yourself up okay let me try this now amen amen hallelujah go to God thank you Jesus thank you oh yeah yes oh yeah okay now now I feel it I feel it I feel it isn't that it's you taking your position in the world I am it blackboard son or daughter of the Living God that's who I am man I have the Holy Ghost I am adopted that's his son and I have a right to this man and I'm never slave nor servant but a son and that means I have his name and because I have his name I can operate in his name now Satan you get back I am I am a circumcised seed of Abraham I've been filled with the Holy Ghost the world has been cut off I am a child of God I know who I am in Christ I profess myself as a believer now devil you're an uncircumcised philistine and you have no right and you are an invader and I'm coming today to take your head off and you begin to use your own mouth to prophesy the death of that devil has begin to bother you hey man I've got a right to divine healing Jesus died that I could have divine healing I have a right to claim every promise in the book hey man why because I have the token it is a clear deed everything against me if struck off all the devil whispers in your ear this isn't quit listening to his whisper he's saying now you know but this isn't if there's something repent of it I mean how many times you got to do it I mean come on so I've been a slothful believer will repent of it and then start from this moment being sincere well I've failed the Lord I said repair my that make it right right now don't mortar don't don't don't spin another night with the frogs here and them group and call and scream gripe and scream and yell all night and keep you awake in the night repent of the thing move on amen some of you need to move on you're worried you're you're looking you're seated way is there this is or that well sometimes sometimes maybe we don't even know what it was we don't even realize what we're where it was maybe maybe you've been walking and permissive wheel right now to return back to the perfect wheel that's just that simple maybe some maybe you've done things that you said and have done and said things you shouldn't have said maybe maybe maybe there's some condemnation we'll get rid of get that first deal with that first the Bible said that we know that he hears us if our heart doesn't condemn us so start right there start right there where that the deed is clear I have a right to this promise I am a child of God hey man I know some of your thinking thinking you know what I got a dude that beat on the altar day and night fast three days too well what am i what am i doing to what I need to do you know I can just give you an example of examples of brother Branham even the prayer line you bringing people out telling them something in their life whispering something to them some sin in their life and then say okay you've repented is forgiven now you can be healed well how long did that take a man how long did that take one sister would sister Jeannie Kempster the prayer line and they're in Shreveport Louisiana little girl that was a teenager Methodist girl didn't know any better sleeping around smoking and their hair brother Brandon call out a woman tell her her exposure sin that she was smoking and so on it just took a minute just a few more people in the prayer and she repented that God forgive me I'm sorry I didn't know that was so wrong don't let him tell that to my mother or a prophet didn't even discern it and call it out why from there three people later it was forgiven a man your pardon is not a pardon unless you accept it as a pardon so if you think there's something accept the pardon but believers take the token now what Jesus began to do in Galilee he continues to do now through his display of the token of the Holy Ghost back upon the church but is not was not the Acts of the Apostle it was acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles and that was a token now so the huh the real token is the accent of Holy Ghost in the church now so again he's the same yesterday today and forever so he expects us now to display his token to all of Satan's unbelieving cults and denominations of this world that we believe that what he has promised so notice what he sees telling us over and over each time he preaches that token he expects us now to display his token hey man it's just like he said the rainbow sang when the Sun comes up of the rainbow we remember God has remembered his promise he's not going to store the world with water right and he said you it's been thousands of years but that token is still the truth and he said it Jesus don't come for ten thousand years you know no my a still gotta honor that token hey man no matter how many things changes and he's gotta honor that token he said he would and the expenses now to display his token over our god-given faith to ever unbelieving cult in the nation and the world that believes that signs and wonders don't follow the believer God expects us to display it that science will follow them that believe this is like the Jewish resistance this is our homeland and he sends it to pinnacle some people just realize we're not the scum of the earth hey man we're sending daughters of God we're heirs of all things to Christ but as long as the devil can keep you afraid to claim your inheritance city's got you but don't be afraid of me any word that God wrote

we got fresh bud fresh Holy Ghost fresh life of the blood the Holy Spirit and Satan you're nothing but a trespasser Goliath was a trespasser the devil is a trespasser to go into to own another

that want to say he's no longer interceding those are just sons of Lucifer with ecclesiastical demons that have come against the bride with an ecclesiastical persecution that says Christ isn't the same but let me to declare it we've got an attorney hallelujah Satan and glory he's called a high priest I confess anything we confess he goes to work to make it happen you gotta press charges today you need to make a formal act of pressing charges on the devil hallelujah the life of Christ has returned in the form of the Holy Ghost he's not here in a nail scar the corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God listen this sons of Lucifer he's not left the throne the corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession but the Holy Ghost has come to carry on his work hey man John 14:12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also John 15 I am the vine you are the branches and how can the branches bear any other kind of life or fruit than that in the vine brother Brennan said and not only that we got an FBI agent the Holy Spirit greats to God's great detective just lead the blood dairy several one on him what's the Holy Ghost put him out and I know we're looking at I'm not able brother Tim to do it but you are able to call heaven jesus said if I make a call don't you know twelve legions of angels 72,000 angels will show up here and one can destroy billions [Applause] we ain't just got power is overpowered you know these sorry little Punk's around the country that feels so sorry for the al-qadir Palestinians who have invaded Israel and trying to hold on to their promised land and poor little singer up against the giant Israel shut your mouth we don't have no pity on the enemy don't you have to pity on your enemy go back it wasn't given to you go back to Syria go back to the Jordan go back to wherever you come from get back out get on there God's brought his soul back to this way and I want you to say if you don't want to believe this get on out you know what I stand for truth kiddo now that what brother Branham said forget brother Branham and won't come out and do your own thing and you don't need brother Branham to do your own thing but if you're gonna plead this word you'll stand on what brother Branham priests a man you'll stand there on that word you know you won't need a major crutch and say oh brother Branham said forget brother gold do your own worldly thing live your own kind of life your own that you don't need the message but I do hallelujah I do I need this message it's my abstract to a title that's what I want to tell some of these guys sometimes they gets lifted up so much in their own selves and got their own thing well you know why do you need brother Branham if you're so great why do you need the message if you're so wonderful just go on and do your stuff alienate yourself away from your bigger than it anyway just do your stuff but to me the promise has been given and it's my land and I'm going to take this laughs and in this land we have a right to enforce the law hey man and the law giver the Holy Spirit is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way and let me just tell you what a prophet told me you don't have to nut down to the devil we don't have to bow down to him the days of slavery is over we don't belong to the devil in my way we're don't have to have this sickness we don't have to have his faults doctors we don't have to be slave to him you don't have to obey his sins anymore somebody help me preach you don't have to knock down the devil we got a law and that's the law of the Holy Spirit now the thing you have to do is to know how to let go and let God do it sometimes we are trying so hard within ourselves to make something happen just take God at His Word and say Lord you made this promise and it's mine and I accept it now in your name and I'm going forward in your name a man and I'm claiming it for myself because I have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gave us my brother Brandon gave an example of this he said one of the brothers they're driving up miles miles from down in Georgia had come up parked his car you know where went into a place and somebody come to stole it with all of his longings old family was it lost with their clothes everything it was gone and he's they came to brother Branson what are we going to do so they've stolen our car so there was a theft ring going on in Louisville and they was stealing cars right and left and he said so what we did he said if we got down on our knees wonder wasn't the last time you've done that I gotta we got down on our knees and he said we begin to pray and he said after a while evasions and he said I saw the man he had once been a Christian and said the Holy Spirit got to dealing with this man and said you know you could get caught at this you ought to return that and he said in a few minutes he turned around and it brought it right back and he left it over and on a certain Street and brother Brendan said and a little bit go by a certain Street and you said you'll find your car with the keys in it he said a half of a tank of gas and be gone because he went all the way down to certain town and came back and he's there he said what did the Holy Spirit was sin out by a word come on that was being prayed a word was prayed and it went out and got him and brought him back a man with the stolen possession now I want you to know friend maybe maybe you're in a situation like that but we've got a right to enforce a claim and it doesn't take a physical present to make it happen right now right there in your room with the poor the pastor can't get to you I can't believe hands on you where it can't be a physical thing right now the word going forth can't bring deliverance to your life and you say this think give it back and it's got to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Ghost go down on my knees and say thus sayeth the Lord where are we getting the say Thor we may not have a vision but we got the word that's the vision and he's got to give it up so the law the law of the Spirit of God is to force Satan to give up what he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from God souls of men he took from God souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon the people where God made them in his image to be like him in the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the holy spirit and enforce this upon him so you see he has made you a deputy in other words he has given you the authority to tell Satan to get out hey Matt now you got a house you got to be ordained to do it you got to have the bags of believer which is the Holy Ghost you say you got the powers no I don't have the power but I got the authority hey man I've got the authority to use his name hey man now again he says when Satan put something up on you in a way of sickness whatever it is every born-again person has an abstract warrant a warrant from God now a warrant is a document from the government of authorizing the deputy to make an arrest and the Holy Spirit is here to put the devil out no matter if it's cancer tumor cataract brother Jerry I treble whatever he is the Holy Spirit will put him out if you'll serve notice on him in the name of Jesus Christ because he has no legal right I am the lord that healeth all of that diseases that right he was wounded for our transgressions with his tracks we were healed but you have to go over and take it I'm at Florida God a man when a man or a woman brother Brennan said his trust in the full armor of God and a power its authority from on high and Devils will scream and brakes will screech and even deaths itself must shatter and even Ghia graves will open at the authority that Jesus Christ gave his church what a promised Elias a man has no legal rights to rule over so whack him like him again take your sword don't put it back in the sheath it's time we stood on our promise this is the day of enforcing your rights abstract right now I want you to think of this as we bring it down you can no longer be a slave again never never he has no claim on you not only is there no shame on you there's no claim on you he has no more right to you your son who your daughter of God you belong to him now take your inheritance even souls as sons are men and women that's your children that the devil has took he has no right to them you gave them to God as a child I thought about it yesterday his brother Philip sent me a picture of him and Mandy standing there little William was there and little Sadie was put in my arms I think it was Sadie this little girl that now sings these glorious songs going to be married in a little bit to Jeremy I was holding my arms during y2k when they said everything was gonna collapse and fall apart and I told you then as we approach the year 2000 I said don't worry it's not gonna fall apart like you think and I'm standing here today now where you got another crisis and I'm telling you don't worry God's got this in control not only that you're his child you belong to him now put your faith in him I want you to
