moment if you want to this whole week has been supernatural you know got a Monday and me and my wife's anniversary was Monday 24 years unbelievable we're here at these moments just didn't know if he was gonna go somewhere do something just at the last minute was able to get some things together and jump in the truck and was headed to Branson kind of had in mind to go see the sight and sound and that was where we was headed and got up to where we could get a good signal to impress Cotter and Prescott Arkansas him and just just looking you know to see what was available and everything was booked so far as the Internet we didn't call but she's looking at the Internet anything that we want to do with either still closed or booked so it's like well what are we gonna do now and about that time brother Joshua Martin Texas both and said happy bum happy anniversary I just struck something with me and I called him and I said dumb what do you what are you doing this were you busy this week of y'all busy is anything going on he said no we're we're here as well just feel to come your way and that's to be alright he said well absolutely I'd be wonderful so before we know it we was in pawnee oklahoma and of course as we was getting close for the window texted me and said i'd love for you to speak on wednesday night looking for a looked at my wife and said this is what he's asking i said i sent by the window back of text it's a real window i said i didn't come prepared to speak is my anniversary and I'm just relaxing him and but I said IIIi don't have clothes for preaching I don't have notes for preach and I don't even have a Bible and he said what I don't matter we'd like to hear you preach anyway that's so welcome is that you preaching blue jeans.you preaching a t-shirt we don't care we just we just believe that we would love that we'd love to have you and so I said well we will see about it as we drove I just felt the Lord speak to me directly about a thought so we've stopped it so stores and picked up some clothes just bought my wife a new iPad her system had been broken so we found ones they would have get her one and so I was able through technology to bring my notes from my iPad over to hers and [Music] next thing I know I was standing in the middle of a sermon and I'm preaching and God is speaking directly to situations and God is doing everything but calling out names and he could have done that because as your Minister and sometimes you can see where things are going and how and you see in the other round sort of speaking and you can see who's receiving who's not and God dealt with situations so directly and so it was just a supernatural thing I wasn't supposed to be there as far as I was concerned but God knew different we got today brother John Andy's just this Monday dude called and said look as I was actually traveling up there Monday to there he was texting me said look I'm looking it may be coming with are you home this weekend is your dad home and and here we are he's here this weekend God's working straighten things we're in a supernatural moment let's don't miss it and then Thursday night as we was coming home we stopped there's me and my wife stopped just south of Little Rock there and got us a hotel late and was just about to turn the lights off and got the text of my mom in the situation from my dad and we horse hit our knees and begin to call out on the Lord and got up and I said let's throw her stuff in the truck let's go we gotta gotta get and cuz it was a you know this weekend my sisters or their husbands and Families we're all going to Branson as well and we're up there and dad was home by itself and so he took and left but each step of the way we have seen God moving miracles taking place God is doing some supernatural things and it ain't just because we see what we see and it's because we can see what can't be seen God has moved in even this week just getting the news of brother Vernon passing away but Vernon winters went to be with the Lord just last Sunday brother Tim telling of his testimony of how he came to the Lord and he drifted away but as his wife text dad today and just said I'm just so thankful that God gave him these three years to get back right with him said he had such a love for the Lord and I just don't want to be with him you know God no God will not lose one of his God doing some supernatural things and so as we think on these things and we see what we're what's happening around us let's just take a moment stand together take a moment of reflecting or silence for brother Vernon and the need there and his family wife without a husband children without a father just take a moment to remember this life understand that they're gonna just have a small memorial service for him at the close family and the things so assess the Lord to surround them this morning with his comfort in these coming weeks and times [Music] father Lord we rejoice in this morning thinking of all the great things you're doing among us Lord I I just believe this is just the start of some things Lord that's even moving God that we can't even speak about it right now this morning but god you're you're moving in impossible situations Lord we just want to take a moment to remember Lord a family and it's lost their loved one of families lost their father their husband Lord God we just ask that you would comfort them we're so thankful Lord that there's a promise all that the father has given me will come and Lord you you know how to work each and every life to bring them to a certain place to where Lord they can be ready to meet you Lord we just ask that you would come in this moments I know sister Tina's is grieving and suffering maybe don't feel like she can go on without him but Lord may you just comfort her I pray wrap your ever loving arms around her Lord God comfort her Lord is only you can do Lord the family father sister Michelle that it's here brother Joseph Florida or the other sons and the daughters got many our way word from you many don't know your Lord but God may in these moments may you bring life for that pray Lord I've never seen death that life didn't come from it and I'm asking Lord at the resurrection and life will fall in their mid slaughter Lord wherever they were to have this memorial may your presence be so real God did it convicts hearts and it softens and Lord to come to you to know you father to know you in a personal real way we pray Lord we just ask these things for this family blessing we Lord we

to the Lord in prayer this morning have sister Carol Vannoy her son Matthew that were in a bad car wreck yesterday head-on collision she's been in surgery Matthew is fine but I want to pray for her she has lacerations on her liver and broken ankle requires surgery and some other injuries also we know that also got this update this morning from sister Karen it's been moved to another room still

believers so we want to remember them this morning maybe you have family members it has it as well we lift them up in prayer - brother Joe if you just come and open our services and prayer her service today I just think it was all so supernatural that me and brother Joe would minister what he ministered on Wednesday night just to show God's already in control of the situation he's already there tomorrow he's already there what every day he's already there we're thankful we serve that kind of God so let's just bond together today maybe you as families can grab my hand Hanne arm-in-arm as we're sectioned off as families but we're not separated you know the devil wants to try to tell us we're separated we're buyers said we're not separated we're one heart one mind one body one spirit in the mind of Christ is in us and therefore we can believe things it's impossible we can speak things it's unimaginative the human mind because it's not our mind that speaks is his mind so I want you this morning to begin to open your mouth for your situation and begin to speak the Word of God and ask God that here the same yesterday today and forever you're my god and you don't change and I'm believing today that God is going to move in miraculous ways in every heart and every life I was just telling the brothers Airlines this this in the back I said I was listening to a tape last night brother Branham was talking about he said last night there was a lady sitting way in the back said many were sitting in the back and I couldn't get them to understand that God was speaking he said then God would call their name he said and there's this woman she was suffering with something and and she wouldn't understanding and I told her what was going on I told her what was happening she would not respond he said she was a Finnish woman she couldn't speak English he said then I heard my voice speak to her in her language and tell her what her problem was and what her name was he said why did God do that because God didn't want her left out [Music] god don't want you left out this morning and if he can speak every language he knows ever disease he knows every problem he knows every situation he coming to Europe you this morning very direct get ready for God to speak to you [Music] amen you believe this morning someone share this quote before we turn to prayer this isn't the message Jehovah Jireh 1957 well Bram says every time that anyone takes God at His Word it's considered a fanatic in God asks notice God is asking you to believe the impossible because he's able to do that which is impossible abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise unto God and God wants you to do the miraculous he wants you to believe the miraculous and by accepting it by faith you prove what you believe believe he is you see it God wants you to take him at his word he speaks it and if God has said it then all heavens and earth will pass away but his word can't pass away and I ask you this morning we got great knees just to care and that's a great need we've already seen God do the miraculous brother Ron there's a great need many of you have great needs in your family but God isn't asking you this morning will you believe for the impossible will you believe this morning if you'll believe for the impossible do you just throw your hand up and say I'm gonna believe I'm gonna bind together this morning I'm gonna believe for the supernatural father you see every hand that's lifted this morning you see the heart behind that hand nor not only that but you see the faith that's wailing up Lord and we people this morning we believe for the supernatural we believe for the impossible we know Lord that your work cannot fail it cannot fall on deaf ears there's gonna be a people here this morning God it's gonna take you at your word we're that people God but you said the signs that you do shall we do also I mean father we're here to take out your word this morning now maybe the supernatural be performed in armies may the Holy Ghost be loosed upon the needs of your people this morning but I'm asking today father Lord you see brother Tim at the bedside of sister care what you told Peter he said Peter I've given you the keys this morning and once everything's you bond owners we're gonna bind it in heaven and once everything's you loose on earth we're gonna loosen in heaven Satan cancer whatever it is this morning we bind you in the name of Jesus and we loose the healing power of the Holy Ghost this morning may you come to that hospital room and may you bind a brain bleed may your binder swelling Lord gotta make you loose the power of the Holy Spirit into that room and restore a sound mind father and we also by cancer the brother on and we find cancer of different ones Lord God and we loose to power the Holy Spirit this morning and we're expecting the impossible God but doctors is going as far as they can go Lord and you're promised him one thing you've gone as far as you can on the tree of knowledge step over to the tree of life Lord we're stepping over this morning God here and we're believing love for things we can't see God we're gonna stake you at your word this morning and we're staggering down at the promises of God but we're hoping through the word Lord you know what I'm just praying this morning I'm praying for a supernatural move of the Holy Spirit God look the world wants to say the miracles are past God don't move God don't respond God don't answer but Lord God he's come too late to tell us that we seen the supernatural we witnessed the power of God we've been recipients and we're here today Lord we're their hands lifted let us receive again other supernatural elements of God Lord touch sister Vannoy in that hospital room God made the holy spirit be loose to her again this morning father Lord you're probably preach a message Jehovah Jireh God will provide a sacrifice Lord you're here this morning you said brother John and ease our way because you said I'm gonna provide for you like Tabernacle now God provide a word for us this morning provide a word of assurance holding comfort and meet us in our time of need father speak Oh God but we don't want to hear from man we want to hear from God this morning speak to us God let our hearts be open this morning may our minds shut everything else aside Lord God every hindering spirit this morning we bind in Lord God so that we can receive of your word this morning now loose your Holy Spirit God upon this congregation Lord God and may our minds be in tune with the supernatural God as you can take a prophet of God and allow him to go into another language to speak to a child of God but surely you're the same God this morning surely you can catch us up this morning or maybe not miss to move another spirit God but may we be in tune this morning we ask it Lord that your Holy Spirit a blessed service those on the stream those here in the mist God may we take every opportunity that we be given today Lord to touch the hem of your garment granite we ask Lord in Jesus name Amen [Music] halleluyah halleluyah

do you see this water sister Michelle my Sam [Music] he was gone a moment [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey let's have your seats for a moment you can play that thank you well what do you do now what do we do now anybody else feel like running around the aisles a little bit well probably not but I haven't been in a Sunday morning service since for three and a half months hey man this is our time to come and visit you and we've had a lot of services on zoom' and teams and all that but we this is our first week to be in services like this so we we was with brother Nathan Brian on Wednesday Church in Louisville on Thursday and and we're with you on Sunday and none of this was even known or planned about last Sunday didn't even know we would come and be here we didn't get our ticket till Tuesday and so if anybody's been going through anything before Tuesday well that you musta knocked on the heart of God and then we didn't know this weekend was going to be a another time we'd go through with the Pruett family but the Lord must have known he did know he knows everything have you ever felt like you're walking in the vision but you don't really realize till God makes it no one to you well maybe come down today and make it knowing to somebody that you're in the vision you're in the vision hallelujah we're closer home greetings in the name of the Lord from our church in Cloverdale and I'm there's probably one streaming now and to many of you we don't want to start naming names but we're close to you over the years and we love your church and we love your pastor we've been able to be with him in the last few days and we just pray God's blessing upon the pastor and the first lady of this church here sister Karen amen hallelujah they've given their lives for you so surely we can say Lord be with them at this time and we're binding our hearts together well how's married life whether on Colley's you're doing alright Sadie sorry sister brother Jimmy how's married life can we give him a hand this morning they're here yeah brother Michael Dexter reminded me to just stop saying names don't say anybody's names and I get it wrong get it twisted but you know what I mean it's good to be in the house of the Lord and that we can let off the pressure and know that the Lord is here to speak to us we're gonna just in a moment have your stand and you know I'm a visiting minister here we stray most or services if not all of them and so we probably know you better than you know us but you know we could come and try to impress the pastor or these other fine brothers here but we've learned over the years that it's best just to mind the Lord and speak what he lays on your heart can we do that today so we're we gone beyond making everybody happy and trying to impress people we've got to come into a channel we don't know from one service to the next what's going to happen is that true and we're living in a very unbalanced age when nothing is balanced anymore we live in a wicked day we live in wicked states and countries in a world and we don't want the spirit of the world to influence our response to the Lord Jesus I mean we're one week closer to the rapture the bride ought to just be on the cutting edge of what the Spirit of God is saying and doing and what he would already say today he's already been working in your heart even if you're away from his presence he's already been working in your heart to come closer to him and so this morning we're gonna speak on rising from brokenness the essential generation and rising from brokenness I'm going to speak on that a little bit about brokenness and to be crushed to be bruised and to go through the grinder to be pained in your life to be broken but I'm speaking this morning on rising from that is that okay because we don't want to describe all the hurt and the pain and the misunderstanding we're here to rise up out of that so rising from brokenness and then to speak on the essential generation have you all heard the phrase in the last three months essential services who's heard that essential workers essential people who's heard that you know you know nurses doctors of the people that business they're essential they're essential and if you're not essential then you stay home stay at home orders you know and you're not essential well the world's telling us we're not essential and God is telling us we are essential this morning you are essential that means the essence essential comes from the essence or the essence or the center the reason of the heart of God brother Branham talked about if you want to do something good for me do it for my family do it for my children I'm preaching today for the children of God God likes that I'm sure to minister to the Pruett family brother Tim loves that he's streaming from the hospital right now he loves that but I'm here to minister to your children too and we're gonna read that in the Bible and it talks about we are commanded to teach our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren how great is our God [Music] you're an essential generation but brother John they've closed the border from between Washington State and Canada we can't attend our church they've shut down the border our families from the Waldner family we have to meet them at the park or across the ditch somewhere my newest granddaughter grandson I should say we have to meet across the ditch you know because these borders and we tried to cross the border as a minister as clergy and they said you're not essential Church isn't essential you're not essential do you know what it's like to being rejected refused no entry you're not essential then there comes that inspiration and that's something coming around God's made you essential so you're an essential generation I just want you to sense that this this morning as we go into the afternoon that God is ministering to our brokenness but he wants us to rise out of that don't state you're not a victim you're not a victim you're not a victim lean on the Word of God and just let the Word of God minister to you and as we stand to our feet our Lord Jesus it's been prayed today and sang songs and we unite our hearts with all of the prayers all of the faith around the world as this assembly has been held up before you and the names have been spoken and now we are here today to again bring before you our offerings and I pray the Holy Spirit now would just take every individual ourselves included and take us up into another round let us worship you with renewal let us respond to the word we understand your word Lord as it comes to our hearts as some may weep today I know we may get into some sensitive areas but I pray that in the time of our trouble that our eyes would look unto the heals and look into your word looking to the Kinects quo looking to the next scripture look to the Holy Spirit not the minister but to the Holy Spirit that would break it down into our individual situation Lord Jesus visit assembly today and those that are connected out across the miles or will stream this service this assembly has been a lighthouse over the years where many weary Souls and hungry hearts can feed from your presence so gather around the word again may you just come and minister and may the Holy Spirit brings healing bring deliverance bring the supernatural element in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's turn to the scripture together Deuteronomy chapter 4 Deuteronomy chapter 4 and then Joel chapter 1 that's both in the Old Testament so if we act a little bit inappropriate or out of order it's because we're trying to learn how to get back into church order hey man y'all help us a little bit and brother John gets a little fanatical raises my voice or start squeaking or something you'll know it's because he's uh he just needs to get in the spirit and hey man and a man and y'all love us don't you and we love you so you're able to look beyond all of this sin things alright brokenness rising from brokenness Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 7 for what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for my couldn't you just stop right there brother Johnny and just that verse is wonderful what nation is there so great oh this bride nation verse eight and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I have set before you this day only take heed to thyself and keep my soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from my heart all days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons or your children and your grandchildren especially the day that thou stood us before the LORD thy God in Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their children God help us today we're here to speak to one another that we would learn of the Lord and teach thy sons and my son sons verse 10 talks about the day of Horeb that's when the word came to them and to some of you that are spiritual you might already be thinking of Malachi 4 chapter where it speaks about we know Malachi four five and six about God sending a prophet and turning our hearts but the verse before that talks about the word that came on Horeb to Moses so what I'm actually speaking this morning is an inspiration from the message and through the word that it would anoint the hearts of the generation that is living were to tell our children and our grandchildren how great is our God Joel chapter one Joel chapter one verse two hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation or tell your children and your grandchildren and your great grandchildren it's to be perpetual that this message this truth that's coming to you is alive there's healing there's power there's deliverance don't let it die and here we are in Laodicea we've gone generation after generation since the message came throughout the years there we are an essential generation I wonder if we recognize that today catching the essence of the message then as God brought his prophet and as God has brought all believers through a time of brokenness and crush eNOS it's time to rise it's time to rise up through all that brokenness and through all that hurt and stand up as a generation that experiences God they know God individually may the Lord help us today god bless you you can have your seats this morning I see something just spread out before us of a man running with great strides running upstairs he's running up stairs that are leading up where there's great big palaces and the glory of God is coming up around these places where there's angelic choir singing my home sweet home and that's the backdrop of this morning and I see a man that has been broken he has been crushed but because he's in the middle of an experience that God is giving to him not to deliver him from the experience but for him to be able to come back to life and rise up out of that hurt and rise up out of the brokenness now we are in the middle of this and in in the vision today we seek Him taking great leaps of the stairs and running up the hill and he comes to a door of a house and there's a lady standing there a young lady she had on a white garment and she's standing by the door with black hair and coming down her back and she raises out her arms as she always did when this man which was her husband had did while they were alive on earth when he'd come home tired and things and they caught each other by the hands and this man that had been running can you imagine as he wanted to see what was there and it's just the atmosphere it's everything around the Son of God that he's now experiencing this is his wife that had passed away and and he begins to speak and he talks about seeing his daughter that it also just passed away and he had just saw her though she was just a little baby when she had died now she's a beautiful young lady and she had just met her and now he's coming into the arms of his wife that had passed away and caught her by the hands and said honey I seen Sharon down there said she made a pretty girl didn't she said yes bill she said bill and put her arms around me around my shoulders and started patting me and said don't worry about me and Sharon now here's a wife that had gone on to the other side won't even encourage her husband that Sharon and I are okay don't worry about us and I said I said honey I can't help it and she said Sharon and I are better off than you are don't worry about us no more where you promise me he said hope he said I I've been so lonesome for you and Sharon and Billy talking about Billy Paul cries all the time for you I said I don't know what to do with him so now he had become a single parent not out of his own choice not out of his own will but now because of life because of the crushing because of the brokenness now he immediately becomes a single parent he loses his wife loses a baby becomes a single parent and he's alone some and she said it'll be all right bill said just promise me you won't worry no more she said will you sit down and I looked around and there was a great big chair and how many remember the chair that brother branham talked about down on earth they had put a few dollars down and maybe three dollars down and a dollar a week and and they couldn't afford that he would preach he said all my he would work all day and preach till midnight and things and he got behind on payments I want you to think that today because I'm really bringing this to your heart how many people would struggle even financially and I'm I'm gonna be speaking about some certain things today to give you encouragement that God has allowed men and women before us to be broken to be crushed and it affects our families it affects the finances it affects the church it affects globally things in the message and though you may have been broken and though you might have gone through times of hurt and crushing it's time to rise that brokenness and we see now he got behind on a payment and he couldn't even afford a dollar a week it's amazing a young couple won and they came and they took away his chair and his young beautiful wife tried to distract him by getting the the friends to get some you know worms and things and then he realized they had taken his chair and they begin to cry and now he said now they're in the other dimension whether Aaron in and she said there you remember the chair bill said yes I remember said that's what you was thinking about yeah said they won't take this one this one's paid for you know friends I'm praying for you today I'm a visiting minister but I pray the Lord would give each one of you an experience today that would give you strength something that God would allow to happen to you personally that would help you rise out of the brokenness or rise out of the crushing rise out of the period of creep of character building or or the pain of a health issue or something in your mind and rise out of that and let the Lord Jesus and the inspiration of his word bring a healing for you so that when you come back to your life and even this afternoon and tomorrow then it would have the same effect on you that it did on our prophet when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I will never be the same William Branham again how many remember him saying that it was so perfect and so sublime but he didn't stay there he had to come back to life he had to come back to the tabernacle he had to come back to prayer requests he had to come back to bills had to come back to issues and family and children and all of these things and we have to come back to our lives and as a minister that's what I've seen has been a great disconnection over the years spiritually we can have great meetings we can have great services we can have conventions or camps or experiences but we need that something to carry us through God gave his prophet experiences that would help carry them through does everyone understand today this one's paid for this house is paid for well branham's don't have houses they're vagabonds no you have a house here she said sit down a minute I want to talk to you said honey I don't understand this she said promise me bill that she won't worry anymore we're going back now and said promise me you won't worry I said I can't do that hope and just then I come to he's talking about he was in that other place and then he come back to his room it was dark in the room and I looked around and I felt her arm around me and she was patting brother branham on the arm brought hope he said are you in the room and she started patting me she said you you gonna make me that promise bill promise me you won't worry no more I said I promise you I want you to notice in that other dimension he would not promise but now brought back into this dimension something took over and he said I promise you and just learn that she patted me two or three more times and then she was gone and I jumped up and I turned on all the lights and looked everywhere she was gone she was just going out of the room he said she isn't gone she's still living she was a Christian god help us as believers here in June 2020 not to fear death the death for a believer is just an open door into another dimension and we're all a week closer to that door and if time would tarry there will be elders and people among us and even young ones as we heard of an accident yesterday and we've heard of other things even in the last two weeks I've heard of another 17 year old young man in the mess passed away driving there in eastern United States this car with his friend brother Aaron and he was driving he's a believer I could say his last name and a lot of you would know him and I'm so happy that some of the family sent me his last Instagram post and it was one of a scripture one of them a young man that knew the Lord but just driving his car and having an accident and going into that other dimension friends the only real piece we have for one another is that we know the Lord it's just a step into another place it's us that are in this dimension that that need the comfort we need the help and now his wife is gone and God gave him this experience and he just kept pressing on he knew hope would be there and Sharon because she was a Christian are you a Christian today about half of you hey man how many are Christians here today are you fighting a good fight Satan thought he would come in March and throw us all into despair and ruin and here we've been two and three months social distancing and respecting and all of that but there comes a time when we just gotta blow it out the flue and say I'm still a believer Satan you thought you would break us you thought we would walk away and get disappointed and nobody called me nobody texted me well here we are today well sicknesses came and some of lost money and some of lost health some are just hanging some there's issues in their marriage I mean whether it's in the world or whether it's in the message it puts a strain on marriages Satan's wanting to keep us distance and isn't it amazing we used to all say if you're sick come to the house of God and God will make you well and you can be better now people are saying I've heard announcements if you're sick don't come to church if you got a fever don't come to church well if you got a fever now you should probably stay home and he's your healer at home or whether you're a church I mean I'm not speaking against anything I'm just I'm just acknowledging we're in another season I still believe in they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but I also believe a man or a woman can believe by His stripes I am healed and I might be streaming today I might be on the other end somewhere but God is my healer do we believe that it it's not the preacher it's not the pastor we've been trained to look to others for our strength and kind of lean on them maybe that's why God's knocking that out from us it's not the preacher or the deacon or the special singer that are so anointed it's you and I that me to rise rise up out of our brokenness maybe in your heart today you could say Lord I want to rise now this thought of rising from brokenness because broken means to be broke and to break to pieces it's that a person has become shattered they become crushed we would say their heart has been broken they have been broken they've lost strength they've lost courage they're disputed they are they become incapacitated that they try to endure the trial and Satan has broken them and you might feel that way today or maybe there's others that this is for them maybe maybe you're fine maybe you've gone through well you're just a strong believer strong experience and gods may be speaking to somebody else maybe there's been a lamb fell over the cliff maybe there's a mother maybe there's a young person maybe there's an elder that says you know what you know and we get dispirited they lose courage the Holy Spirit is here to minister you today but there'll be a resurrection let there be a coming out of that I'm gonna show you some slides in a few moments but in all the years of our lives and all of our journey there's things that we go through but we don't want to get stuck in a certain scenes stuck looking at a certain trial or a certain adversity where we become experts at describing the issue we need to let the word rise within us and go beyond our intellect in our minds is everyone receiving today because it can be a shock that can be a blow it can be something that happens just very quickly and everything seems to be going good and then all of a season you're on alert and everyone's crying or everyone's weeping or your prayers become kind of like striking another chord if you understand you just go along and then all of a sudden something happens and you get into a state of a blow a strain if you're speaking about broken bones it would mean someone that sustained an injury where there's a fracture or a part of the body today I'm also speaking about our spirit realm that can get broken or crushed and you become inoperative something is broken your life as a real believer has been really interrupted and it's been put on pause it's like the Proceedings of a wife to the lord has been put on pause you say how could this be for the good God is doing something greater than what you and I can see I wonder if we can all just accept that today but what we see and we feel God's doing something greater we're believers today when the when the believer hears the word just let the word take you to where he's taking you to how could this be good when the Bible says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God we love the Lord to them who are the called how could this be a good thing brother John when you say all is well or you know it's all good you say what brother John it's my good you can tell by their Constitution you can tell by their nature there's a disconnection it's not pleasant the way it used to be it's not agreeable everything's gone sideways and now it's skeptical and bitterness instead of joyful and happy and it being excellent and distinguished and upright you say how can all things work together for the good well all things work together for the good just let the word rise up within you today and take you in spite of your brokenness a Thursday night I spoke in Louisville on brokenness will not break you and it sounds like a paradox but all believers go through brokenness but Satan's intent is to break you I think we need some sons and daughters of an essential generation that will say I may be broken but I will not break you say brother John you're confused no that's inspiration of the Holy Ghost I may be broken but I will not break I'm speaking to every son and daughter of God every individual today as we rise up brother John could take the time to speak about Christ and how he was broken but he fulfilled his part when I keep messing with this thing lord help us how many know that Christ was broken he was bruised but did he fulfill his part come on friends say I want to be more like Christ I want to be like Jesus then this sermon is for you Christ was broken but he didn't let that hinder his expression his joy kept rising Jim I'm gonna take up my cross because there's a joy ahead then why can't you and I get under that inspiration of the word and say there's a joy there's a reason there's a revelation dry move me into that revelation would we all agree that there's Old Testament Saints that was broken they were broken but they fulfilled their part New Testament Saints and believers they were broken many of them you can look through the New Testament they were crushed they were hidden and persecuted but they fulfilled their part believers in the seven ages was persecuted they went through their battles they were personal battles family battles Church issues but they fulfilled their promise and I'm jumping right up till today where is the generation that will say here we are Lord the essential generation oh maybe they're up in the balcony somewhere maybe they're way in the corner maybe they're over here maybe they're streaming today and you're in a situation and you can say yes they fulfilled their part they fulfilled their part their battles and God is trying to say and you're in your battle you're in you're in your issue and you're in a generation to rise how many realized that we're fulfilling the vision hello you're fulfilling a vision wake up everyone we're just about to cross over you you've made it all the way till this time don't fall off now this is graduation time this is crossing over time sickness will come pain will come miss Andy misunderstandings will come things in the church will come issues and friendships will happen they will happen and it's your time to rise up out of that come on friend it's your time to go let's go let's go and maybe some don't have that strength today and you've lost the vision and the Holy Spirit's just coming around you and saying yes let's go what about brother Branham we could take two services and I have enough notes here but I need to cut it off because last time I was too long wasn't I remember that brother Timothy I was too long and that was over a year ago so he was broken he was crushed I opened up the service because that's what the Holy Spirit dropped in our heart actually the beginning of this week of a man running up full strength up a staircase of stairs it was like I saw it in my heart brother Branham running up those stairs after he had just left an old western country wagon that had a broken wheel that spoke of his broken family his family was broken but he didn't become bitter he didn't leave the ministry he was being broken and Satan wanted to break him tried to commit suicide once tried to commit suicide again it just seemed like Satan was wanting to break him I'm gonna take you out I'm gonna destroy your life but God had a ministry for him God had to work for him to do there's a work for you to do God inspire this new generation you didn't have youth camp this year but throughout the weeks God's been giving you ministers bringing ministers you say well we have to stream from home we have to social distance we can't shake hands we have to leave right away friends that that mean that our walk what the Lord has to get cold we need to get out of that emotional realm and all of this emotion emotion we are sons and daughters we love emotion but friends you take that all away we're still going to serve the Lord I'm just gonna speak what's on my heart today what I what I opened with this morning of the celestial City that there would be a home there and this beautiful black haired lady a real Christian in life but she had passed away early in marriage twenty-one years old I have personally seen where that has destroyed men I personally even within the message being raised in the message our selves have seen where things happen in families and it literally destroys a person we all know of Margaret there was a twin sister of another young lady that the people at school were mocking them and talking about how they were dressed in things and to Margaret she had a complex and it threw her into two years of a mental issue whereas the other young lady was able to override it she never was affected like that but it took a prophet to go after her spirit and bring it back and she went home the next day I wonder if there's enough power in the this generation brother Timothy I wonder if there's enough revelation for us to have those among us now and to be able to speak to Margaret and bring her spirit back again you know now I could go a little bit deeper about the spoken word and the third pole that's all it could be stories or it could be quotes or it could be a reality where is the generation that's gonna rise up that knows they're essential that knows it's not a big head it's not pride it doesn't have anything to do with ourselves it's not we're being puffed up it's not a personal bigness it has nothing to do with what we've done but it's the Lord announcing to you you are essential you are necessary you are needful you are of great value you are absolutely necessary you as a person are absolutely necessary essential thank you brother Johnny it is fundamentally and vital that you make it in the rapture the testimony of God is at stake with your lives don't throw it away don't let lay on to see a rob you of that spiritual element when we live in a very political environment that wants to get your attention on your skin color or on how you're seeing things or where you live it has nothing to do with that we are sons and daughters of God [Applause] listen I just went through Louisville Kentucky this weekend the downtown part of the city beautiful hotels and wonderful shops and restaurants it's like block after block of just plywood and graffiti it's because men and women have come under an anointing of rage and hate and destroy and kill and social medias blasting that in your face to deform your mind to get one side of the other friends that has nothing to do with us we love the word we love this message that is their kingdom that's just a little taste of what's going to happen when we leave this earth in a tribulation you talk about all kinds of riots and rage it's just a little taste and what we saw yesterday and the day before in Louisiana of all the dust storms and and the plagues that are striking this earth is just a little taste and I have personally been around people that are just at the breaking point it has pushed them to the edge and I believe it's time as sons and daughters after now we've gone this time to be able to say Satan we might be broken but I will not break [Music] [Applause] I'm not talking about a virus I've heard enough preaching about the virus we've heard enough of conspiracy theories and all the nonsense the bride's already in a channel already moving we ought to be moving down a channel of the word and I just say God forgive any of us if we get so stuck into the news feeds and that's just nonsense you know who's gonna be President and what's gonna happen we are going into rapture all this about the celestial city and the music and all the housing and things and this young lady had passed away at 21 years old was a young family now brother branham was experiencing we're right in the middle of an experience that would help him carry on but God was breaking a son of God to give children this is Malachi 4:2 give the hearts of the children the kind of faith they would need for their generation can we look further than just a story about a man being broken and say god help me in my life now the Prophet or the word was experiencing a wounding or a brokenness so that a message that was being spoken would literally change the hearts of last day children it would bring them back to Christ bring them back to the faith God anoint our hearts that now we this morning of this afternoon we can either focus on the hurt and the brokenness in the pain we can focus on the suffering and the abuse we can focus on the wrongdoing and the misunderstanding and the division we could focus on the strife we could take services the trouble and on the cracking or we could stop being a victim and we could say I am a son and a daughter of God it's got to start there you know we could talk about it even in the natural there's people that even in the natural have more of a drive than a lot of people in the message that claim to have the message faith I'm thinking of the man that came from Africa and was a slave down south and he was walking gallantly and he was just walking with his head up and you all know the story and that's where that's why in the message we've come so far you already know what brother John's thinking about you already know her brother Aaron oh he starts reading the quote you can already finish it and brother Joe oh there goes brother Jose oh and we need to stop that we need to lean forward and say God what are you saying to us this man walks so gallant and so upright and his conduct was so extraordinary and they said oh you must feed him better you must treat him better did you make him boss over the rest of them no sir I didn't know until recently but he over there where he came from the tribe he's from he's the son of the king and she realizes that though he's an alien he conducts himself before his brethren as a young coming king [Music] hello Bride of Christ hello essential generation you've got the letter you are essential so you get pulled over by the law where are you going what do you think you're doing you got staying home orders I'm essential I'm going to work I'm on a mission go on I think it's time we passed by the law and show them the word and say I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God go on little bride stop being a victim and describing all of that yeah I think I'd better move along it gets quiet right there you know here's an example and we're not talking about out of the message we're just talking about a man that realized where he came from where he came from I'm the son of a king so I'm over here in a nation that hates me mistreating me but he's just walking talent he's just walking head-up he knows who he is is that the problem if she could just recognize who she is is that the issue are we still struggling with recognizing who we are then God dropped that revelation down he's walking around and conducting himself like he's a young coming King him brother branham said god help us let us be bold and let's not be ignorant about things let's conduct ourselves as sons of God daughter of God conduct yourself as daughters of God as a daughter to the king sons of king of the King don't go out and and he starts talking about these things were pilgrims and strangers and aliens but were sons and daughters of the king break up your shoulders and live like men and women are to live like real Christians I'm just trying to be sensitive a lot of those people had more faith than some of us do they they didn't even have shoes on their feet and they're out in the field all with the choir out there singing you got shoes I got shoes all God's children got shoes and they're barefoot they're not talking about down here some of those pinko were doing things and they were looking in the mud and they were singing about shoes and we've heard the message for years it's been quoted to us it's been preached to us it's been sang to us and we still don't know what it is and the preachers are trying to tell us you got shoes you got a new body you got a future home all God's children got shoes and their barefoot so you're not talking about down here and what the media is saying and what the bank accounts saying and what your marriage status is saying and what their no it's not that it's all up in heaven I got shoes they were living in another place but yet they're living down here but they're living over there it's inspiration it's the Holy Spirit it's God today at 12:30 that's announcing the evening light tabernacle you are an essential generation it's time to rise up out of your brokenness can you imagine the youngest disciple of Jesus just let me go for the Knicks about five minutes and speak about John the youngest disciple of Jesus sometimes we need to see what someone else is going through to realize I don't got a problem you know let's just sit down for a few hours and I'll tell you about my troubles and then you you talked to somebody else and you say I don't have no job oh come on could you imagine John the apostle of love that laid over on the bosom of Jesus one of those three apostles Peter James and John he was young he was vibrant he was youthful I'm going back to our opening scripture of Deuteronomy that we are commanded to tell our children and our grandchildren John was the youngest he was young he was vibrant he was the one that outran Peter to the empty tomb but did not go in right away I'm looking at my notes because these are handwritten notes that I have for another day in another sermon and I just happened to be here today so maybe it's for someone but I want to speak on wounded children wounded children from wounded ones and that is now a generation that has come up in the message that our wounded themselves because their parents were wounded or they came out of Church situations they saw enough splits and division and abuse in churches they become wounded or they even had a mother and father that was converted and came to the message but they didn't know how to raise their family in the message we have wounded children and we're not here to describe all of that and have a bunch of classes on how to survive we're here to bring the Holy Ghost to them bring the word to them so they can arise out of that that's what was in our heart I'm just touching some of the surface remember John ran out ran Peter to the tune but he didn't go in right away because Peter was older and more burly and he went right in but John was a type of the Eagle anointing that was called to be the apostle of love he was not the apostle of bitterness what have you become what is the last few months done for you in your life have you become bitter what has your trial done for you do I have some of your attention what has your trial done for you he wasn't called the apostle of getting back at of their people he could have got back at of a look look at this Thomas asked him to put your hand into the side where's your faith I mean Peter you're cursing the Lord you're swearing the Lord I don't even know the man cursing swearing Peter Thomas look at all you disciples running in the garden where's your tenacity where's your stick-to-itiveness John saw all of it but he had enough vision he saw Jesus killed catch this a javelin was thrown into the side of Jesus and he saw that he saw the crown of thorns I was just with brother Brian Garrett and sister Elizabeth Garrett on Tuesday night and I was walking in their property and growing on one of their trees was a huge thorns and it was going up the tree huge long thorns and he broke one off and he just stuck and it was like sharpest needles that was like the crown of and john saw them do that to jesus the pastor of the church the leader of the church i beloved jesus and he saw them kiss him and beaten on his back they said john saw them get nails into his master's feet and he heard him he was a fellow disciple with judas I mean Judas handled the money of the church and at the camp meetings he was counting the money of the young people he done miracles Judas did and he fought and now look at him he could have become better John saw all of this nonsense he could have got bitter and skeptical of every trustee now every deacon every preacher look at all you disciples of Jesus Peter denied curse the Lord they tried to boil john and oil his all his fellow disciples were martyred all of them somebody say Amen all of them except for John and now he's boiling in Y and oil boiling in oil and he had so much Holy Ghost so much God inside of him have you ever felt like that you're boiling just did you see what they posted just you're just boiling John had enough love and Holy Ghost about him he says God's gonna take care of that Lord take bit on the side of my heart kind you've got a rise up out of bitterness brother sister you got a rise up out of that you got to commit that to the Lord and say Lord if that doesn't happen in my whole lifetime of good I'm still gonna serve you now friends you got to give enough Liberty to a minister to go down a channel it might be somebody's going through something today and you might get a little nervous or maybe a little bit this for this ain't for me it might be for somebody that's hanging on every word John saw all of this yet in all of these things God revealed many mysteries to John in the book of Revelation and I'll say this to you tonight just give Peter and Thomas and those other disciples a few more chapters just give him a few more chapters and all of those men were filled with the Holy Ghost and another chapter and another year and another time I'm giving some of you a lot of allowance I'll give you another chapter I'll give you another ring just give us some more time forgive us for our neglect Lord just give me some more time brother Baxter maybe you feel really ashamed of the last month or two I could have prayed more I could have gotten to the message more I'd be a better minister I've been we're sharper but and now just God forgive me okay and God gives you another chapter it gives you another opportunity where is the generation as we prepare our slides where are the people that are going to be rugged this is your time to say it's me Lord where are you that have some flexibility in your life that are moved by the power of God moved by the word where the where love controls you look at this on the screen just a few weeks ago I went to the dentist you know the very next day I was scheduled in March for a teeth cleaning and they called me the day before and said we're canceling everything y'all remember March John remember March is like dominos everything's going down we had Church on a Wednesday night my father can and II spoke and I leaned over to a minister next to me and I said he's ministering like it was the last time he ever spoke and that's the last service our Church had all together it's amazing God prepares us I went to the dentist they finally started going back going I said I got to get in there I had a wedding on a Saturday and I I said I'm essential they texted me and cancel the appointment I said I'm essential I got to get in there they we're sorry you can come right in you know I like maybe some of you need to put try that this week I'm essential who told you that God did oh come on Angela and I went into the restroom washroom toilet Lou whatever you call it and this was what was on the wall and the inspiration come into my heart it's time to go to the next ring how many know that this is a tree that's been cut and it shows the reins of the tree is the years of its life how many know that and when they're skinny together that means there hasn't been a lot of water there hasn't been a lot of nutrients but when they're lighter apart that means they've had a lot of water and they've had a lot of goodness that year and the inspiration came into my heart it's time to go to the next ring and it comes out of Philippians where Paul said brother and I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press let's say press come on this is our Sunday morning service we press what are you all doing down there we are pressing the whole balcony the whole stands are full of believers saying you can make this all the martyrs are screaming you can do this all the Old Testament all the New Testament all the young people that gave their lives are saying stop being a bunch of babies down there I'm telling you if I could give them a microphone today they'd be pretty inspirational this two minutes for this one two minutes they'd be straightening at us I mean after an hour we'd be so filled we just walk out of here and say Lord forgive us Lord I mean all the martyrs are going to speak hallelujah I'll tell you a lot of our looking at one another and our sandals and our dress and our glasses and our all of our accents or the color wouldn't mean nothing sometimes we're just ashamed when we hear about what others are going through it's time for you to break out of your brokenness brother sister it's time for you to get over these things say I can't forget about those things that are behind only God has a sea of forgetfulness that's why we need to be more like God pressing toward the mark let us therefore as many as be perfect or mature be thus minded and in anything you be otherwise minded or focused on your career your job your education your certain situations that you wait I mean isn't God looking at be on your situation can I ask everybody personally is God looking beyond your situation and your issue Oh God friend and yet we we don't want to do that for others I just say God help all of us I'm not preaching at anybody today we all brother Timothy we all have issues and we all have things brother Branham left that other celestial City and came back after meeting hope and she's patting him on the arm promise me promise me I promise and she was gone he had to go back and live his life God didn't take him out of the trial he gave him something that would help him go through the trial that's what God is doing today it's like he's opening the door in somebody's room that you were in and you thought you were trapped and God is opening the door and saying come on into this room let's look at things different let's look at this room brother Joe let's look at this picture let's look at this what so look at this vase and brother Aaron speaks and brother Joe brother Timothy brother Tim brother Dwayne others that ministered they they're showing you another room walk in through the room rise up out of your the way you're looking at it because brother Branham said maybe you've been a failure I'm in this afternoon maybe ministers you've been total failures as a housewife as a student in school as a child to your parents whatever you have been let that be has-been and start from today no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you failed to go on with God if it has been take note to what I'm gonna say just in a few moments about this he starts talking about Moses and all these things look at this rings of tree of the tree show the years of life and also the events within those years over here yeah it's just you can see in the middle there when it starts and then there's a rainy season and it's wider than the dry season it's tighter but how many can see the scar from the forest fire how many can see that something happened in that person's life in that trees life and it caused a scar it's not that the tree was welcoming the fire welcoming the tornado welcoming it was it's something that happened and it caused the scar from that moment on it caused that tree to be affected here it is again you can see this tree that's 24 years old but you see the little knot in the tree on the bottom there for five years how many rings is in that it caused an issue it caused whenever it came around to this thing and brother branham talked about this in on the wings of a snow-white dove he talked about his own sir and his nervousness and a stomach and talked about the seven year cycle and for you and I it's may be when you come around a certain situation you start getting where it's not normal it's not it's not and you just wonder why is it always broken why is it always naughty what can I just seem to be normal what Lord why and the natural trees have it and we have it we have issues and things here it is for the first 20 years of this person's life it was very very skinny but then something happened maybe was a meeting maybe it was an encounter maybe the Holy Ghost came on a person and for the next years 9 years 10 years they've just growing growing growing something was added something happened may that happen for us Lord it's time for us to move to the next ring maybe as a church we need to move to the next ring maybe as a generation in the message we need to move to the next ring is everybody awake I don't know how personal I can be here but within the last year I was just watching I was on the platform and I was just watching one of our senior ministers in the message Minister hundreds of people and just something came into my heart I've never said this publicly I said I wonder what's going to happen when men like that are off the scene I wonder what's going to happen in the message when you see individuals gravitating toward certain gifts and only responding when a certain thing is done I wonder in a few years what's going to happen I think it's a valid inspiration what's going to happen if we're just leaning on the man or when that gift or when that person is speaking that we respond or I just feel we're gonna we're headed for trouble because seasons and years go by and God's will takes men of God takes women of God and as families and as believers and in our church we cannot rely on the flesh of one another and God allows ministers or even sisters to be singers or leaders and but they will be taken where is that generation that will be able to recognize it's part of life it's part of life and we must go on we must sail on the church must go on the family must go on your friendships got to go on you say well this person's going through this they're going through a knot in their tree they're going through look at this fire scar do you see that and every time you're around that person brother or sister they always are talking about it and this issue in this thing and whenever you're around their atmosphere there it's always like it's scarred it's marred it always turns out into a negative twist you got to be careful you got to be careful that'll twist you and it never happened to you but because you opened up your spirit to something else it'll wounds you there's a forest fire and for how many years brother Aaron did that affect that tree look years years years years dry years wet years meetings conventions Christmas Easter will fulfill in the vision we're teaching our children and our grandchildren and brother John now has three grandchildren we're fulfilling Joel and Deuteronomy what are you some of y'all laughing about sister Ruth come on I mean you're gonna have grandchildren one day help us Lord amen but it's just part of life we're commanded to teach them how great is our God now some of you are getting weary you know so I need to wind it up here I can see that the time that a person stands out on the beach of time and looks out over toward the moon and you begin to wonder you're praying what is God's will for my life where do I go from here where do we go from here that there's inspiration we draw from the message great joys lay ahead many saddened hearts will be made great mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into joy and if we're not careful we can get around inspiration like that and still keep our arms folded and still keep our spirits and we can go right back out there and be the same we can carry that into our homes we can carry that into our private lives and if we're not careful you're just the same old same oh and by the word of the Lord today this is the message it's time for you to rise out of that it's time for you to break out of that year don't get stuck in summer oh it's so hot oh so hot in humid and you get stuck there don't get stuck and follow well all the leaves are falling it's so depressive and dark and I get this every year brother Johnny I get this spirit comes around me and it just begins to affect my my mood and then you get stuck in winter no life no joy no flowers you saw but oh here we go again and you get stuck there then that that defines you the Scarb defines you the hurt the Wildfire but where is the generation that's going to rise up through that I think I'm looking at that generation we're not going to get stuck in a season and just let it be progressive and going on and on and on stop being a victim somebody's gonna rise up out of this we didn't have youth camp this year like like we have in the other years but praise God we're serving God anyway oh well next year well next year may not come there might be some of us not be sure next year Oh what's gonna happen to the church is just gonna go on with God I mean come on friends don't get stuck in some bad attitude you're looking out over and you're just wandering and that you can get lost in all of these things in the dry season where it's time to move to the next ring how many would say God inspire us today I don't care if it's in the dentist office or in church or driving down the road I can tell you where God gave me the title for this service today but I'm not going to we may be wounded but we will not be moved now I'm going to look at some of you we may not be wounded we may be wounded but we will not be moved broken yes maybe but you can't break me Satan I'm broken but you will not break me say brother John you're talking like in riddles no that's a paradox that's the bride that's like somebody that's looking at a lion that's a murderer that's about ready to have their head cut off saying I'm about ready to give my life someone would say oh death is calling to you and another says but life is calling to you stop getting hung up in a certain ring a certainty issue a certain year at a certain season rise up out of this where the Jeremy's not single no more he's got marriage issues I was going to ask for the phone number of sister Sadie for many many months I never have so I'll tell her publicly she's a blessing to me almost every single day I wake up and I turned to your podcast and I hear her last song that was posted and I don't even know the title of it but it goes I'm just a girl and it goes on like that she's not just a girl she's an inspiration she's a gift from God and little did Sadie know that every day or most of my life as a minister I woke up and that inspiration was flooded does anybody know the title of that song it's one of the latest posting be born in me and that was the drive that was the jolt and you don't know that you know throughout that can I just get personal the last few months while some have been isolated in a way and they've gotten cold and indifferent do you know that some have given their hearts to the Lord the Holy Spirit has fell into rooms now I'm going to give a testimony and the family may be streaming or with who their service later from South Africa there was a family that they were isolated to their home the Wilson family and they have children Beulah Naomi Angela and David brother Eric and sister Grace they because of this quarantine and getting isolated at home they started streaming streaming services and so they streamed all of your meetings they said tell brother Tim brother Timothy brother job or their errand and they stream your services just a few weeks ago in May May the 6th they were streaming a service from 4 years before they all got in their house they sat down in the evening and they were streaming a certain service from 4 years ago it was during the lockdown and the stay at home orders in Africa and they were forced to be at home they started streaming camps and meetings and services and while their whole family was in the room streaming the service the brother was preaching a service why not me why not now why not me why not now and a 17 year old teenager just broke she began to weep and cry cry out to God and the Holy Ghost came into that room and that whole family has never been the same praise God she rose out of brokenness as a teenager in rebellion and struggle and issues and problems and God dealing with this person and her sister Beulah was recognizing she's 19 years old and she's God's dealing with my sister and God's dealing why I want the Lord to deal with my heart and little did they know I heard this testimony on a Monday as I was walking down by the ocean and that evening I was getting with a couple that was in our church that was going to get married they had to change their plans and a relative of sister Kathy's they were going to get married in Canada but now it had to happen in the United States and in a backyard so we were with them at their new little home this is they're just getting a new little suite and I came to their home with my wife and they began to speak about their marriage and their testimonies and how they gave their heart to the Lord and the young man the brother that was going to get married begin to give his testimony and it went back to the very same camp meetings but this young lady had given her heart to the Lord it was the night before and and the church is having a camp service and young people and there was a prayer line and the ministers were lined up on the platform I think about four or five and the young people would come up and individually we would pray for the different ones and this young man wasn't in the service he was away from the service and then came into the service so he's way in the back and the prayer lines going on and it goes on and on and he's not where he should be with the Lord and his brother is working in the sound booth and this young man is standing in the very back and he's saying Lord if my brother will come to me and go with me to the front I will go and the voice of God spoke to his brother in the sound booth and said go to your brother not even knowing his brother was in the meeting and he turn back and there was his brother in the back and he goes to his brother and says do you want to go I'll go with you and they go to the front he's one of the last ones in the prayer line and that's the night he gave his heart to the Lord [Music] and now four years later I didn't even tell them but that very morning I'd heard of someone that had given their heart to the Lord from the service that was the next night I just want to say how great is our God or you say you have to be there you have to touch the person yeah no friends whether it's virtual whether friends we just read out of a Bible that was written for many years ago our prophet spoke years ago but it's like it's being spoken today let your has been been has been let your will be be will be let's rise for my brokenness it's time to move to the next ring it's time to throw away your popcorn and your gaming or your you you know your Netflix or whatever you've been doing or whatever and let's go to the next ring praise the Lord what Satan wanted to stop all of us God has brought to the surface from the ashes of despair and from the ashes of hurt now from the ashes of trauma and all the negative and life experiences from the ashes of all of that comes the beauty comes victory comes a character of Christ in the bride and I know I'm leaving tomorrow so we're just going to speak now as we come now into the afternoon from all of this comes the beauty of character and there's a bride that is receiving the word that will be the generation that is the essence essential you hold my every moment sometimes we're on the housetops sometimes we're down in the valley blushing profit I'm quoting sometimes we're on the mountain sometimes on the housetops and it makes us appreciate the good times that's what they call contrast he's talking about people that are from Africa they didn't know that they had that certain type of skin to David Livingstone this is our prophet talking like this they saw David Livingstone and realized it was a contrast and he said you will never appreciate a day if you don't have a night you will never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you would never know how to appreciate righteousness unless you add some unrighteousness you never know how to appreciate good health unless Oh is everyone listening we don't appreciate good health unless we've had foul health bad health it's true brother Middleton you see someone down you see someone they can't run they can't diss Everett let's run through that door and their whole team their whole team their whole team they want to go they want to go it's their desire but there there's been an injury there's been a broken death see let's all go yeah we all want to go and then some are holding some are holding at least they're going I'm so glad God's not looking under the table he's looking above the table and he sees us all as Prince and princesses some of you know what I'm talking about Prince Mephibosheth in the Old Testament he was laying because a nurse dropped him Saul has died Jonathan has died and now here's Prince Mephibosheth four years old in the nurse picks him up to run and she falls and he becomes lame for sixteen years he's way over and lo debar at another place with no connection till God lays it on the heart of David there's got to be somebody of Jonathan's household and there was a prince way far away and they brought him in before but how many knows that account he's a prince but he's living way out of connection way out of pasture and David brought him in and made him part of the household come into my banquet room some of you know what I'm talking about today about brokenness and I know some of our children and young people they're looking at us like you know they have a good life they have good health they have all kinds of good things and they think they got it bad and some of us older ones we you know we think we got it bad till we find out there's other believers like brother caleb is in in china today in prison hello and his wife and children and church no he's not he's in prison and we talk about our houses our apartments or condos or RV or whatever and while he's in prison and we talk about our food or we talk about this we talk about our clothes he's in prison Satan wants to hold us prison prisoners and be captive god help us we never know how to appreciate the mountain less we've been in the valley and you can study this in brother branham's ministries we come to a close he he became a single parent he's warming his son's bottle under his arm and then at night he's warming the body becomes an instant single parent God gave him grace for that he was being broken and crushed tried to commit suicide he took off his glove he was going to touch that electrical line he had full intentions sherry honey I'm gonna see you and mommy and just I can't take this no more I got beside myself and he pulled off his gloves I was reaching out and he woke up on the bottom of that pole God rich in mercy he said if it wasn't for the grace of God friends can't you just thank God for His grace today thank God for His grace for you and he didn't climb up the pole and take off his glove and touch it again he didn't tempt God he said Lord there must be a work for me to do then and then he goes on and yes he can't work and then he goes out and gets the mail out of the post-office box and it says Miss Sharon Rose Branham he said there it is again he had thrown his gun upon his bed he pulls it out and pulls back the hammer he said brother John I think it's rap music I think it's wrong music I think it's well he wasn't playing that he started singing songs started saying the Lord's Prayer our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name it goes to show how as believers we can be living so close in that realm and yet be so broken you can be broken and not break I wonder who believes that for someone else let's forget about ourselves and say for that other sister for that other brother I pray God give them a revelation I just I had an email from a young lady and from Africa and she just said one day I was little and I just didn't have and then I just woke up and it was like everything was different had a desire for the word I had a desire for the message I thank God for that let there be another spring it's another cycle another season is here God's announcing another season brother Timothy he's turning the calendar and you've been looking to this it's time to turn the calendar stop going like this and Oh Lord you know no he's turning the calendar the Lord laid the son brother John's hearts days ago wounded children from wounded children say what are you gonna do stay there and wallow in it are you gonna rise up it's time to rise up we're gonna turn this corner brother John where we see brothers throughout this whole pandemic it's been a strain on the ministry because we're hearing from one side in the church we need to shut down everything just stop till it's all over not Church no nothing we gotta just be all let's just and on the other side looks like let's have Church let's go and we're just what should we do Lord what is wisdom what's the mind of the Lord and one pastor I just heard the testimony this week he had a visiting Minister come through his church this is in the last few weeks and the brother said I'm just gonna come by and speak something that would encourage you and he said that publicly he came by and preached and the pastor got up at the end of the service and said he doesn't know this but he spoke he spoke to his wife and said I was going to resign after this weekend because of all the pressure and all these things and you could read into that and say this or that I'm here to tell you God knows who to send God knows what to do in your life you say I'm broken I'm just fed up with all this this side and that side and what are you thinking you know you can have five brothers and they're all saying this and I think we should do that and and the mind of the Lord he's just watching our character what are y'all gonna do him this time and sometimes it's not easy to know what to do should I go here should I take that job for the job this has happened in my life what should I do you can get so caught up and what to do and where to go you just get confused you get upset and right in the middle of that and brother branham standing there with the bottle his little two-year-old son and Billy Pulse ISM the mom I see mommy up there and brother bottom just he said I almost fainted I had the little to my bosom and just kept my head down what is it it's a profit being crushed it's a man of God going through things in his life of losing his wife because they listen to the mother-in-law and she's a twenty-one year old lady passing away and she says to her husband you know where we went wrong we listen to mama we need to be careful about those around us that what we say is the thoughts of God and the word and we're not just venting and expressing our how many know what I'm talking about we listen to mama a mother-in-law God give us the right attitude today God give us the right spirit brother Timothy Pruett traveled through another church this week wasn't planning to go there didn't know and then he said yes and he spoke a message it was exactly what that church needed I praise the Lord for that this week we desired to come and visit you as a friendship and to visit your church not knowing that your pastor would be in the hospital today with sister Karen the Lord knew all that there might be something next week there might be another family there might be another issue there might be something happen to further break and try this bride but Lord let our hearts be right in the season of all of this that's going on even other believers are being broken at this time other churches are being crushed as it was but what about you what about I it's easy to talk about so-and-so it what would we do if it's that but what about us what about you what about me when it really comes down to it I want to rise let's bow our heads this afternoon maybe brother Timothy can prepare a little song and the musicians can play thank you Lord for these things that we're hearing even over the last week's what's the Lord's been speaking to you say God is alive God's been speaking now let us take it to heart and be personal bring it down home bring it down to you and I where we can say Lord I needed that can you take this encouragement today and take these words that's been spoken Lord forgive us if we settle down and become selfish forgive us Lord if we've just got into our own way of thinking our own family strain and we've missed you somewhere in that lor let our church services affect us more than just a temporary thing is more than a building and more than getting together but it's where the Word of God can speak into us o Jesus make us more sensitive is that what's in your heart today Lord help me to be more sensitive so sensitive Lord she's coming down to the end of her life and this mother sister hope was so wanting to confess to her husband it was just something that happened years ago and it's rayon chiffon rayon chiffon it was some stockings and you bought me those stockings and I gave them to your mother because they were for older women and I just wanted you to know that how far have we drifted how seared and hardened can we get when we can say things and do things so deeply and not even have a twinge of remorse Lord step inside of us Lord step inside of us as individuals in our families and in our church let us rise from brokenness and recognize the generation that we're living in maybe the hardest times of our lives maybe the most treacherous trying to figure that out or understand and we realize we can't do it in ourselves and the Holy Spirit's trying to just stop us for a little bit and give us a little window into that next room I thank God for the baptisms here in this local church I saw the ones from last Sunday in the weeks before and lord help us to be sensitive let us rise from the ashes of despair [Music] some of you serve the Lord for years and it can get kind of wearisome sometimes you can be doing things for the Lord and people take you wrong that's okay they did that to Jesus too there's been other brothers and sisters rise up with even greater battles than yours or mine and they just continued to walk forward what about you and I this afternoon I want to be Jesus to those around me who would like to join me and say that's been my desire for a long time I just want to be more of Jesus in my situation in my life Lord and I want all the things we've heard and all the things we've read and no one has just become practical working in our lives Lord but bypassed my mind today and my even my spirit and come deeper through my soul and then it rise up through all of these realms Lord Jesus let the healing balm to spread throughout the service and spread throughout this building I know we felt like rejoicing I know we felt like just running the aisles I know I did this is a this is the first Sunday morning service we've had since March if you would ask me what I felt it would just been like blowing out the steam but I just felt to speak on this brokenness speak in a certain channel that we rise up out of that and go on I pray the Holy Spirit would just rest upon every person whether they're young or whether they're old and give you and a freshness and a newness again as we stand to our feet right now let us just begin to worship the Lord and begin to thank him let's go to the next ring let's move to the next battle let's just let's just say God put blinders on my heart of all those things and I press toward the mark I'm moving forward I'm going on I will serve the Lord I will follow I will go just fill us Lord before we leave this building right now give us that spirit of freedom and liberty Lord give us the healing Lord maybe someone can be healed before we leave this place maybe the angel of the Lord will leave and go there in the Shreveport into room 14 she's moved from number 4 to 14 but now may the Spirit of God go to that room and raise up sister Karen for a testimony how they've poured out for others how they prayed for you but now we pray that direction we send the angel of the Lord we send the spirit of healing hallelujah maybe it's someone in this building needs to pray pray for someone else and then you find your own self being healed you find the Spirit of God falling on you you you feel that Liberty in the weeping in the crying before his presence it's so positive for the Timothy let's just sing something now [Music] let's worship full of uncertainty yes go instead
