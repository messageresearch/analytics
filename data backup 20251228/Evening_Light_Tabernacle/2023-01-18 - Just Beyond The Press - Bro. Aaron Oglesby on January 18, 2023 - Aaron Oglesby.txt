atmosphere Lord that we feel here in this place and Lord we know Lord that you're in our midst tonight Lord because you promised to be you promised you would be here you promised to never leave us or forsake us Lord and we know tonight that there's nothing I can say that would help a single person in this building Lord but if you'll come and be the speaker tonight you'll take over in this situation Lord take these notes and things Lord you laid this thought on my heart last night and it just was rolling through me and I just Lord I just pray that I'll be able to deliver it the way that you intended it to be delivered Lord that you just take complete control now and open up every heart to receive and help me to deliver Lord by getting out the way completely we love you we thank you Lord God that you are an awesome God we thank you that you are so good to us Lord and so merciful and so loving Lord and we're just here to praise your name because you deserve it father we ask you now lord to bless this service in Jesus name amen amen man isn't it wonderful to be in the house of God tonight amen if you'll open your Bibles with me to the Book of Luke we'll get directly into the word Luke the 19th Chapter and the first verse we're going to read down through the 10th verse last night I was just uh the way the Lord works just just drawn to this to the scripture reading and as I began to read it just some things began to come out of it that I really enjoyed and spoke to my heart and I was telling the guys in the back I said you probably hadn't heard about Zacchaeus since Sunday school so let's review Luke 19 and 1. it says in Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him and he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and I have taken and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so for so much as he is also a son of Abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost amen you may have your seats tonight I'm so grateful that he came to seek and to save that which was lost because I was right there in that number and then I'm grateful tonight that he came to seek and and to save and what a wonderful statement he makes there in verse 9. this day is salvation come to this house I'm thankful that he's still seeking and he's still searching and he's still bringing salvation to the house of those that will welcome him and there's so many wonderful things here in this scripture reading and so many lessons actually that we can learn from Zacchaeus and this may be a little bit like a lesson there was just some things in there that I really enjoyed and what we find is that like with all men and all women Zacchaeus faces obstacles and hindrances in his quest to see Jesus and we're going to speak about those obstacles and things tonight and if I was to give this a title I would call it just beyond the Press just beyond the press and life is a constant struggle and in life we have constant battles and it seems like battle one battle they lead you directly into your next battle and then that battle leads you directly into your next battle and it seems like just when things are beginning to settle down and you feel like you've got to hold on things and and you've got a time to breathe for just a minute you better look out because it's in that moment when the next battle is coming and the next wave is coming and the next blow is coming and and I'm sure that's how the disciples must have felt that night as they rode up one wave and down the next wave just sure that this would be the last one and this one's going to tip the boat but we made it over that wave and you think you have a minute to breathe and here comes the next wave and it's just it's just one thing after another and they'd make it through one just for the next wave to slam and swamp their boat but see in that situation that night they had a they had a captain with them that was in the boat and this Captain was more than a normal man but this Captain knew the sea because he had created the sea he was the creator and he was the master of the sea and therefore he was the master of the situation that they currently was facing and because of that they had nothing to fear and today unlike those on the sea of life with no Captain and unlike those that think their ship is Unsinkable or unlike those that have believed what they have built is is good enough to see them through unlike those that have no hope tonight on the sea of life we have a captain and this Captain is the creator he is the almighty he is the master of the wind and therefore he is the master of your situation and because of that no matter the battle it may be one battle after another after another but because of who our captain is it will be one Victory after another Victory after another Victory after another Victory wave after wave and war after War there will be Victory upon Victory Time After Time After Time because our captain is in the vote tonight I'd like to remind you that Jesus is in the boat with us no matter what we're facing and no matter where we're standing I would like to remind you tonight we win I would like to remind you again that regardless of where you're at and what situation you're facing tonight you are a winner I think we should take a moment tonight and remind the devil who the winners are that's us tonight and I would also like to remind him who the loser is and that's him tonight I think it's important that we all find our place so tonight winners take your place and loser take your place and we are here to stand and remind you that we serve a mighty Captain he is the master of the sea he is the master of circumstance and tonight he's in this boat so we have nothing to fear Hallelujah there are strong winds blowing No Doubt every negative thing is coming against us storms are rising and this bride is being attacked on every hand but I'd once again like to declare it's going to take a stronger wind than this it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises because tonight I am determined that no matter who and no matter what and no matter what comes between me and the Lord I'm gonna get to Jesus I'm going to get to him I'm going to pass through push through pull through I'm gonna fight I'm gonna get through the Press because just on the other side of the press is my Lord Jesus just on the other side of the obstacle is my Lord Jesus healing is there South nation is there Deliverance is there victory is there and it's just on the other side of the press I am determined tonight nothing's going to stop me from getting there nothing's going to stop me short but I'm gonna push through tonight this account that we're reading here in Luke what we read is the final trip of Jesus's life this is the same trip through Jericho where blind Bartimaeus is healed this is leading up to the final week of his life it's in this very chapter in chapter 19 if we go just a little further that we read of his entry into Jerusalem where they would shout and praise him with loud voices as he rides in on the cult spreading their garments out in front of him and and here he is only a few days before this in his entire mind brother Brandon would tell us has already said on Calvary the weight of your sins and my sins is already upon his shoulders and yet what I love about this is you know many times we look around and we think this is the end and so much is going on and so much is happening and he's preparing to come back he must not have time to think about you and me now here's an example right here right here at the end time he hasn't forgot you he hasn't forgot your lost loved ones he hasn't forgot your situation right here with his mindset on Calvary he comes to Zacchaeus and he says come on down because I hadn't forgot about you come on down because you was willing to do whatever it took come on down because today I'm going to your house I'm telling you tonight on a Wednesday night if you're willing to do whatever it takes in this darkness in this time if you'll pushed through he'll come to your house tonight he'll come to Europe you tonight he'll deal with your situation tonight if you're willing to do whatever it takes and it's right here at the end of his life his mind is set on Calvary and this man named Zacchaeus begins to desire to see this Jesus for himself now these things don't happen by accident it isn't happenstance when when someone begins to desire God always because this person said this and this person that I don't know what's going on let me tell you what's going on when something starts changing in a person's heart our God is on the Move God is moving in that situation and and brother Branham would say that that his wife had been praying for him he says she'd been a Believer on the Lord Jesus she'd been praying for her husband a businessman in the city to become a follower of the Lord Jesus and you know conviction can make you very restless it does that and so a good Praying Wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees at home than the preacher can do on the platform listen don't ever let him convince you to stop praying don't ever let him convince you to give up because it don't seem like nothing's happening and I've been praying and I've been praying there's a reason he tries to get you to stop it's because he recognizes how powerful that prayer really is he recognizes the damage you can do with that more than the preacher can do on the platform if you'll stay on your knees for Mama stay on your knees for Daddy stay on your knees for that lost loved one don't give up right now but you keep praying you keep believing you keep standing in this time oh I'm not seeing anything happening right now well nothing has changed nothing has changed they're still doing this my situation just like that don't let that be your testimony but you testify of the finished work oh yes he's coming home oh yes daddy saved oh yes I'm Healed you say I don't want to lie I don't want to tell a lie how can the word of God Be Alive the word of God says you're healed the word of God says the promise is theirs the word of God says the prodigals are coming home it can't be a lie if it's in the word just testify of the word things are changing things are happening people are coming home the prodigals are returning Deliverance is mine salvation is mine [Applause] just Testify the word it can't be a lie [Applause] we got to get our eyes off the press get your eyes off of the situation get your eyes off of the current condition because these are the things that are put there to hinder you these are the things that are put there to stop you the Press is the hindrances and the hardships and the battles that try to keep you from coming to your full inheritance they try to keep you from your encounter they try to keep you from your moment in the presence of God but it's just beyond the Press it's just beyond the Press just beyond those lies just beyond those fears that's where Jesus is that's where he's standing there with his hands held out saying come on push through push through you can do it there's your deliverance there's your salvation there's the answer to your prayers but you have to be willing to go beyond the Press verse 1 says and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and almost always publicans and sinners are put together in the same sentence so he was the chiefess of sinners anybody can be saved the God I serve is so full of mercy and Grace you say well how do you know anybody can be saved who you going to point to right here right here I was the chiefess of sinners and it says that he was a Publican or a tax collector and not just any old tax collector but he was Chief in other words he was the boss of the tax collectors and Jericho was known for the trade and the selling selling of Balsam even the word bomb when it speaks about the bomb of Gilead it would be come back to this plant and it was known throughout the ancient world for its medicinal use and its rare perfumes and it was the most economic economically significant plant of all ancient times so what are you trying to tell me he was rich rich Empire and and he would take a prophet take money off the top already above and beyond the taxes in order to gain wealth from the hardship of his own people Luke 19 and 3 says and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press in other words there was hindrances there there was something keeping him from seeing Jesus and it says because he was of little stature now I'm not going to go so far as to say he was a that's not politically correct I don't think I don't know what the proper word is but my point is this if it was significant enough to be recorded in Scripture this wasn't just a short person you understand what I'm saying there was a lot of people in the Bible that was five six that was just regular that was regular very normal this was small he had a lot he had for real little man syndrome for real for real but it was enough that it was recorded in the scripture and he had lots of things that tried to hinder him that day his stature being one of them but his position being another who he was in the community and and he was so proud of what he had done overcoming all this and and fighting through the fact that he was different from whereabouts to accomplish all that he had accomplished and now am I going to be willing to give those things up to be Associated as a Holy Roller to be associated with one that believed in the moving of the spirit or associated with this miracle worker associated with these things am I willing to do that there were so many things hindering him in his life things that he had battled against and Ward against complexes that he had built up over time you know sometimes we throw off on the word complex it's like oh well they just have complexes because that may not be your battle that may not be a real thing in your heart mind battles may not be the issue you deal with that may not be what hinders you but to those in the battle it is extremely real to those that is their battle it is just as big a deal and as difficult to trial as whatever your battle is that you're facing in life and he's having to fight these things and he's having to fight these struggles and he can't see because of the press and and like I said what his battle was may not have been your battle in other words I wouldn't have had a problem seeing that day I would have been okay the tall guy standing there didn't have a problem seeing Jesus the the tall guy the Press didn't hinder him that wasn't an issue to him it wasn't an issue at all for him to see Jesus it wasn't his battle but to Zacchaeus because of the press he couldn't see Jesus but I'd like to point out that's not the whole thing that's not the issue we go home to verse four and I'd like to show you that the Press didn't stop him from seeing Jesus the hindrances didn't stop him the battles didn't stop him the complexes didn't stop him all those things around him didn't stop it says he ran before apparently it's okay to run if you're trying to get to Jesus he ran before and he climbed up a tree oh that's a little bit fanatical it's not fanatical when you're just trying to see Jesus he just wanted to get to Jesus I gotta knowing for myself it's the closing of time it's the closing of the Jewish dispensation he's on his way to Calvary I must see Jesus and he runs before and he climbs into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way I'm so thankful tonight that there's something on the inside of us that don't allow circumstances to make us quit when others would quit when others would fall away when symptoms are out of control and people are saying it's no use it's no hope but on the inside of a Believer something Rises up and says I'm Gonna See Jesus I'm gonna find a way to him I'm going to make it there no matter what I have to do I'm not going to quit I'm not going to back up oh what a blessed desire that is to see Jesus what a blessed enjoy it is no matter what it is no matter where you're at tonight don't ever let that desire to seek Jesus and to be in his presence don't ever let that desire be quenched don't ever let that desire to be put out for more of him for a refilling of the Holy Ghost for an outpouring of his spirit I say tonight I need to see Jesus tonight I need more of God whatever it takes I must see Jesus Hallelujah oh there was others there that was tall and could seem just fine and yet didn't have a desire to all right oh and sometimes the complexes get to us well I don't measure up I'm just not enough what do I have to offer I fall short I don't have gifts oh people might say something about me that's all just part of the press that's all just part of the press listen there's many many saws out there that are Head and Shoulders above the wrist there's many Souls out there that looked apart and they act apart but they won't go down in the valley oh they looked apart and they're tall and they can and they can see everything but they can't push past the Press they're not willing to stand before a giant they're so they're tall they got it all together they they seem to have everything they seem to have a happy home and they seem to have a good job and and everything in their family seems to be working out and you say well what do I have you have a hunger you have a desire I won't be stopped I won't let a giant stay in my Valley I'm going to get to Jesus that's my promise that's my kids whose soul may look the part but who's in the valley fighting the giant tonight who's standing up against their complexes who's overcoming fear who's pushing past doubt who's pushing past unbelief you are tonight it's within you it rises up I must get to Jesus I can't be stuck I won't be stopped Hallelujah I'm gonna get there I'm gonna get what I have need of it doesn't matter if I got to get a ladder and get way up high or I got to get down on my knees and get way down low it don't matter if I gotta run if I gotta jump if I gotta shout if I got a snot on the altar or I gotta climb a sycamore tree tonight I'm gonna get to Jesus I'm gonna get what I have need of because he's life to me he's everything to me Hallelujah he's right there just beyond the Press foreign I believe that a sincere heart will not be stopped and they'll get to Jesus brother Brown says that the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among Us then press till you get to him like the little woman with the blood issue and all the different things that take in place and all the adversaries in her way she just pressed right on through till she touched him if this church tonight would do the same thing would press through every scale of unbelief would lock swords with the devil and his unbelief and press through to know that you're a child of God and an heir to these things in Jesus Christ standing present to show you that he's with you to keep his word oh be perseverant don't you let nothing stand in your way he says I'm just wondering if Faith really anchors could anything stand in your way oh come on let Faith anchor tonight I know I'm Healed I know I'm saved I know I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I know the Rapture is for me the body changes mine my children are mine let those things anchor and then do whatever it takes to get to them push through run over run through but whatever you do don't let yourself be stopped he says oh it's true she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrance you might have some he says I have plenty of them a lot of hindrances but about your faith that's the thing if you can't be persistent he says if you can't be persistent if you're going to let everything hinder you he says now physically you might feel bad physically you might not feel well and otherwise you might not feel like going to church you might not feel like doing anything but your faith don't have no hindrance it moves right on anyhow I believe I'm speaking to a group of people who's willing and ready to move right on anyhow that you're willing to lay your pride aside that church that you're willing to lay your fear aside that you're willing to fight through the Press tonight and when you do that I'll make you a promise he will meet your need when you're willing to fight through and press through but listen tonight he wants the people willing to fight not a people that are turned back because oh there's a press oh there's something in the way oh this isn't going exactly how I thought it would go now that's the time that a Believer shows its true colors that's the time that a Believer buckles down and puts on the armor and presses in harder than ever before and says I'm going to get to Jesus tonight I'm a believer I'm a Son of God I have benefits and I'm going to go take hold of those tonight many times we've prayed and we've prayed and prayed and nothing's happened you've called for your family and it seems Jesus just went further fear Whispers just give up doubt says I told you it wouldn't work but something deep down on the inside says even now Lord even now Lord Jesus I'll tell you tonight just stay with that right there even now stay right with that even now your flesh says stop your symptoms says stop but your faith says even now your faith says forward your faith says onward your faith says upward even now Lord I'm going to keep going forward even now I'm going to keep climbing because I'm going to get to Jesus I got to get to Jesus he's the resource he's the one I have need of I will have life brother Branham says but this one thing remember this morning seek life he says pursue after it thirst for it just keep reaching for it this doesn't sound like something you just try and give up on he says pursue for it thirst for it reach for it just keep reaching for it don't let nothing stand in your way seek for it what's he saying seek for life seek for a living God not some dead Creed not some formal church not just some teachings but he's saying seek life with all of your heart we talk about different presses and hindrances a lot of them come against us as individuals a lot of them come against the bride collectively there's a real press right now trying to squeeze the life out of the bride of Christ trying to formalize churches and and trying to just squeeze the life down trying to keep life from springing forth brother Brown said seek life pursue life reach for life keep reaching for life but it's trying to keep people from from from life coming forth trying to keep them from getting to Jesus trying to keep them from trying to keep Jesus from being born trying to keep him from being born in the heart of those that are seeking him so what they're trying to do is they're trying to stop birth brother Brown says what are they afraid of he says the new birth that's the reason we got grandchildren in the church they're afraid of New Birth afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of the power of God so what you run into and this may sound harsh but what they're doing is they're running spiritual abortion clinics trying to keep life from coming forth spiritual abortion clinic they set up a press where they take the altar calls out of the church they twist quotes around they remove worship and spirit and Truth they kill the atmosphere that allows the birth to take place so I ask you this what life is it that we're supposed to bring forth what life is it that we're supposed to manifest who is it it's the Life of Christ and they're aborting the very Life of Christ before it can come forth in people's life Christ is attacked in the womb the anointing is attacked it kills it before it can be manifested it kills it before that life can come out of you that's dark brother and it is dark but let me shine a little light here that life will never never be stopped they can't stop it but it's still shining forth I'll stand here and scream it and once again Square my shoulders back and say Fight For Life Fight For Life fight for the Holy Ghost fight for the movement of the spirit fight for the new birth we gotta get to Jesus we gotta fight for it tonight or you can't keep an eagle caged up forever you can't keep them there you keep putting out life and killing life and finally there's a thirst on the inside of them that see Gene you can't keep it Dead Forever oh but they're going to come out of that they're going to push through they're going to get to the other side of the press where life is they can't help but look to the supernatural brother Brown says if a man is born of the spirit of God he believes in the Supernatural he can't help it because he's a Son of God and that's the reason tonight we got so many cold old cold formal indifferent God forsaken backslidden churches because men and women are not born of the spirit of God they have no taste of God they don't know nothing about God and all they know is theology and that's the reason you can't get them to believe a thing that's exactly right many of you here tonight wanting more freedom Desiring another outpouring believing for for more and wanting a greater experience or wanting a refilling of the Holy Spirit and I'm telling you that it's here for you I'm telling you that that is Flowing that there's a Wellspring of and you can have whatever you desire to have and it's just beyond the Press there's a part in this you have to play Zacchaeus could have stood there behind that the whole time and his desire could have been to see Jesus an honest desire and stand there going I want to see him I want to see him I want to see him but if he stood right there saying I want to see him he would have never seen him there was something he had to do there was a step he had to take he had to step out of his Pew he had to step out of his comfort zone he had to step on pass I just want to see him and he had to get to the place of I'm gonna do whatever I have to do I'm gonna go wherever I have to go but whatever it takes I will see Jesus I'm gonna get to him I'm gonna do my part to see Jesus tonight [Applause] you have to be willing to push through your nature foreign sometimes I do I honestly get to get tickled at people that say well you know that's just not my nature to do those things and then sister Alana is not here tonight she's sick so I can use her it won't embarrass her and I'm thinking do you even know Sister Atlanta if you're thinking that the people that do the things they do is because that's how their nature is because she just loves to be in front of everybody really loud do you even know the people you go to church with I'm just saying I mean I know some of us are more comfortable in front of people than others but sometimes the spirit make you do things I don't care how comfortable you are around people it ain't your nature to do it they pushed past their nature they said Lord I'm willing to worship you however you're asking me to worship you no matter how foolish I look to other people how silly they think if it pleases you Lord if it's what it takes to get to you Lord that's what I'm gonna do that's how I'm Gonna Worship that's how I'm gonna act you know I've never one time interpreted tongues but every time tones come forth I bow my head and I say Lord I'm willing I'll do it if you choose are you patting yourself on the back nope I'm just telling you in those moments that would be very difficult to do but are we willing to do whatever it takes for the spirit to have his way are we willing to do whatever it takes because Zacchaeus Was and because of that he said I'm coming to your house today and I think that's what we all do as I know there's a visitation from the Lord so we have to push through our nature push past our pride push past our fears and just let God move because you're amongst believers people who love to see God manifested people who love to see his presence poured out just push that thought aside of what will people think the people will rejoice with you the people will Shout with you the people will be set free just like all the Israelites on the hill when David killed the Giant and he did something that they all wanted to do themselves and you know what it allowed them to do it allowed them to come into the valley it allowed them to get some Freedom it allowed them to have some courage you say people are going to talk about me that's right we sure are you see him kill that giant you see him take down that Philistine it gave me courage it allowed me to do it it gave me strength oh we're going to talk about it we're gonna celebrate it we're gonna say how wonderful how Mighty Is Our God how great are his ex boys how might he is his name oh yes okay willing to push past Mark two and one a few examples in the scriptures that you're all familiar with and again he entered into Capernaum and after some days and it was noise that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they came unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was born of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay and when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee there was so much in their way that they could have easily said this isn't your day buddy hey I promise there'll be another service he ain't going nowhere Sunday's coming then after that Wednesday's coming there'll be another opportunity for us to get you into his presence but today you had a bad day today a lot of things at work didn't go the way you wanted them to so you can just skip out on your blessing tonight today you got a report you didn't like to hear so you can just skip out on your blessing tonight there was so much in their way that could have turned them around and let them go home going that was just a pretty good service but they came determined that they were going to get to Jesus no matter what it took no matter how they went through no matter what door window or roof they had to go through they were going to get their friend to Jesus there was so much in their way and it seems like there's so much in our way sometimes as the Church of the Living God the bride of Christ so many things rising up so many hindrances so many things trying to stop us from taking a Rapture stopping us from coming to our full potential as the Bride of Jesus Christ but sometimes I think we ought to just tear the roof off the place sometimes I think we ought to get a little bit unconventional sometimes and say I don't matter what takes place tonight I'm getting to Jesus if we got to tear the roof off the place whatever it takes I'm gonna get in the presence of almighty God tonight and I'd like to warn people out there that are trying to keep people outside they're trying to keep them from getting in the presence of God they're trying to keep them from getting through the door trying to keep them from getting to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you better be careful because one of these days they're gonna tear the roof off the place and you're going to be left with it and they're gonna leave shouting and singing and dancing and healed and delivered and free and you're gonna be left with a hole in the roof I say just let them in let them get to Jesus let them get to their savior to the live spring they just want to get to Jesus I just want to get to Jesus tonight Hallelujah there was a great press but just beyond the Press was the healing just beyond the Press was there Deliverance because just beyond your press is Jesus prophet of God says if the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among Us then press till you get to him foreign 21. that's a story you're all so familiar with people willing to fight willing to press it says that when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nine to the Sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lies at the point of death I pray that he come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him now from this point on we're going to be talking about the certain woman in this story but let it not be forgotten that Jairus himself had gone beyond the Press he was a ruler of the synagogue he had everything to lose but because he was willing to do so his daughter lived sometimes we gotta be willing to make a move that our kids will live we got to be willing to do things that our children will survive they're laying at the point of death he's a deacon in a church he's the ruler of a synagogue he's a preacher somewhere he said I don't care I give all that up I got to get to Jesus Jesus I'm willing to go beyond I'm willing to do whatever I just want my kid to live I say tonight let our children live let our children live Lord Jesus come to my house my children are going to live and because he made the sacrifice his daughter lived and it says in verse 25 and a certain woman which had a blood issue 12 years and had suffered many things and many Physicians had spent all that she had it was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may but touch his clothes I shall be whole and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes it's another example of one who who had plenty of excuses and reasons why this ain't my time reasons why and fears and worries that could have stopped her and hindered her everyone that she had ever known had failed her or abandoned her everyone had turned their backs on her everyone told her to wait everyone said this is for another day everyone says she don't have to be so fanatical to get this touch but she was so desperate it reminds me so much of that little woman brother Tim there in Mexico with the dead baby she didn't care what they said about church order I want my kid to live she said she was going through their legs climbing over their shoulders basically walking on people's shoulders said there was no stopping her so they had dozens of Busters down there and they couldn't stop her I'm telling you when you get desperate enough there ain't no amount of church order or Baptist theology gonna stop you from getting to Jesus when you realize I gotta have it this is life and death I got to get to Jesus tonight oh I know I believe don't he but I need a touch I need to be at the Wellspring I need to be in his presence you will do whatever it takes to get there just trying to get to Jesus oh she got the attitude you just try and stop me from getting to that altar let me tell you what if we could get to the place if you just try to stop me one time you just try to stop my dance you just try to stop my shout you just try to stop me from getting the Holy Ghost you just try to shut down my worship and shut down my kids you'll have a war on your hands like this never had before because we ain't backing up backing down going back we're here we're right here at the feet of Jesus and here I plan to stay I will stay in his presence I will have his presence my children will have it this church will have it just try and stop us one time and that was her attitude you just try to stop me but I'm going to press through tonight I'm going to Touch the Hem of His Garment a determination to get what you need we'll always bring the results you need he says in Christ is our Variety Store by one Spirit we are all baptized into one big Variety Store I love it he says amen anything you have need of he will supply if I need healing I'll take it if I need Joy I'll take it if I need Victory I'll take it it's all hanging around and God's big Variety Store and I am possessing and you have possession of everything in that Variety Store when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost Amen brother you talk about Elbow Room let's take over he says we need healing there it is sitting there for you just reach over and get it you might have to kick over a few things here to get it push through a few things to get it but go ahead and take it you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it but God's got a ladder there if you're interested in getting it I'm telling you tonight if you're interested in getting it it's here in the store tonight if you're interested it's here you may have to kick over a few things that's the word of the Prophet you may have to climb a ladder you may have to go up a sycamore tree to get it but it's in the building if you desire it you can have it if you're willing to do whatever it takes to go beyond the Press it's waiting there for you tonight and that brings me to this question how desperate are you to see Jesus how desperate are we the problem with humanity is we usually only get desperate in Desperate Times instead of living a life of desperation desperate for more desperate for a touch desperate for our children even when it seems like they're doing good foreign we got to stay desperate stay on his hands I find this very interesting I'll throw this out there this is my take by the team if this is just stupid you can stand up and correct it when I'm done I don't mind I I Lay My Pride down I promise but look in Luke the eighth chapter this is just interesting as we're talking about being desperate and willing to go through the Press Luke 8 19. you know sometimes we think we can get to Jesus Because of Who We Are or who our daddy is or mama is or what church we go to you'll get to him the same way everybody else got to him since then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the Press it's interesting we've seen that a bunch of times already and every time when people were desperate enough they got to him next verse says and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy Brethren stand without Desiring to see thee listen to his response and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God and do it unwilling to Humble themselves down to press through he had no time for them in the same ways Zacchaeus could have stood there wanting to see him and never would if he wasn't willing to do whatever it took but his mother and brother stand there going hey you go tell Jesus you know it's kind of crowded and I'd rather speak to him out here and he says these are my mother these are these are my brothers because they were willing to get in the building I'd like to ask him why they wouldn't have to service 30 minutes early instead of showing up so late they had to press through the crowd anyway I'm just saying foreign like that get him I don't care who you are you shouldn't be so late you got to have somebody find Jesse moving on what's wrong Zacchaeus was willing to climb a tree some was willing to tear a roof off the place she was willing to push through the crowd even though she was considered an unclean woman every one of them got their need met Luke 19 and 5. where I kind of come back to this story there's other a few more things in here I really like about this story it says and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus that Messianic sign right there on display he knows who you are and let me tell you something he already knew where his lived he could have told him his address Zacchaeus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and we might get into this a minute later but I love how verse 6 says and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully your response to Jesus has as much to do with the outcome of the story as Jesus coming by you in the first place I love here that says Jesus called him by name he said Zacchaeus you know this would be the last named individual before Jesus goes to Jerusalem it's the last one that's recorded no no surely there's a lot of people that accepted Jesus that aren't recorded I get that but this is the last one recorded before he goes to Jerusalem and he calls him by name and it Thrills my heart when I look at this that he knows his chosen by name because he's already written it down in his book a long time ago he ain't meeting Zacchaeus for the first time he ain't saying zacchaeus's name for the first time this ain't a chance encounter this name had been written in the Lamb's Book of Life and in that moment Zacchaeus may have asked like Nathaniel did and said once knoweth thou me and he could have said before you climb the sycamore tree I knew you I knew you before you climbed the sycamore tree before you ever climbed up there I knew you I'm the one that placed the desire in your heart to come and see me this way I don't get it twisted old Zacchaeus Was really seeking God no that's not how this worked how come he woke up that morning with the desire how come he woke up that day and said I gotta get to Jesus that was Jesus calling him before he ever stepped in his presence that was me that put that desire in your heart as I kiss before you climb the sycamore tree I knew you oh come on church tonight quit worrying am I going to make it is my name there the desire in your heart you didn't put it there yourself he put the desire there he's calling you you're not here tonight looking for him he drew you here he called you to this truth he called you to this message it's him drawing you and he knows your name he knew you and he claimed you I love this but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by name Thou Art mine somebody needs to hear this tonight somebody needs to hear this tonight but before you ever sinned before you ever walked out on God before you ever did the first thing wrong before you ever told your first lie I said your first curse word smote your first cigarette looked at pornography for the first time whatever you want to add to the list of sins they can be many before any of that happened you were his he said I formed Thee I name thee I've called thee by name you are mine and I tell you tonight Satan has no legal right to claim you because his claim predates Satan's claim he claimed you before the foundation of the world so his claim legally stands up in the court of law he said I have called thee by name Hallelujah you know Satan tries to put a claim on you he tries to and that's what's so wonderful about realizing that you're a sea Gene of God that's what's so wonderful about realizing that you are God's thoughts expressed that you are an attribute of God because when you realize that oh hang with me for a second then you realize that your name was written before the foundation of the world brother Derek and what that means is it's got a Time step on it there's a time stamp and that time stamp does away with the claim of the enemy a timestamp can actually be used in court as evidence and it proves when transactions took place now the enemy comes and says well I see here in Oglesby he gave his heart fully to you in the year 2013. he says but I can look here in my book and I know that in 1990 1991 when he was just a kid I had him all wrapped up tied up doing sinful things so so God you got him in 2013 but I had him as far back as 1990. so my claim predates your claim by 23 years and he's mine because I claimed him first I say let's go to the records and we look over in the records and it says according to the time stamp there was a transaction made there was a lamb slang but for the foundation of the world I never sinned in the first place the transaction took place back then my name was written back then I am his I belong to him and he is mine oh when did you know me Lord before the foundation of the world I knew you I formed you I've called you by name Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh thank God for the time stamp Hallelujah the enemy's claim is fraudulent I love how all these things are happening in Jericho yeah I'm a big bring this down to a close foreign because you have the healing of Bartimaeus you have the saving of Zacchaeus and all these things and if you'll recall and we could go into a lot of detail about this but we won't we dealt with it in a service before Jericho was a cursed City it was a cursed place Joshua 6 26 a portion of that says in Joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the Lord that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho it's interesting to look at it that way that Jesus is in Jericho redeeming and Jericho being under a curse all the flesh there under a curse and yet you can take that right back to All Flesh being under a curse the curse of sin The Curse Of Death because of the Fall we know that humanity is under a curse families have Cycles or people will call them family curses but when Jesus came to a cursed City those that lived under the curse were set free they might have been living under a curse but you don't understand my family history and you don't understand this curse that's following my family you don't understand this curse when Jesus comes those that live under a curse are set free well you don't understand my mama did this this and this and I'm afraid that's going to follow me when Jesus comes those that have lived under a curse are set free so what I'm saying is he walked through a curse how about you let him walk through your family history one time let him walk through your cursed flesh one time let him come down there and see what he'll redeem in your life and in your family in your home because when Jesus walks through the cursed place those that live under the curse are redeemed and they're set free and and here he is Jesus is doing the impossible and we're going to go into that in just a second in an impossible place but he was doing it for people who were willing to go beyond the Press willing to press through willing to fight willing to cry out willing to lay it all down and as we said earlier your response to Jesus has as much to do with the outcome of the story as him coming by your way look he the Rich Young Ruler had an encounter with Jesus just as intimate if not more so than Zacchaeus what good did it do him I'll get personal and this isn't towards anyone but think within yourself you've had opportunity after opportunity at encounters with Jesus in this place much less in your personal private time I'm talking about just in here and I asked you to ask yourself what good did it do did I take advantage of the encounter that I respond the way I was supposed to respond to get all I needed out of that encounter your response to Jesus determines the outcome of your story it says and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully notice the joy that he's expressing with this opportunity to be with Jesus versus the sadness which the Rich Young Ruler had just one chapter before and that's what's incredible about these two stories and we're fixing to bring a little parallels we bring these down the Rich Young Ruler is in Luke 18. and he left with sadness because of his opportunity whereas this man who I done told y'all is rich rich leaves with joy and I want you to watch as we go through the rest of this Jesus never has to tell him what to do with his Goods what to do with his what he needs to give up what he needs to do and it takes us back to this the Rich Young Ruler already knew what he was supposed to do he was hoping to get a different answer but Jesus didn't even have to tell this man because any man wanting to get right with God knew exactly what he needed to do the same way within your heart and in your situations you know what you need to do to get where you need to be with God foreign seven and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guessed with the man that is a sinner I don't have time to spend anything here but if we get to the place that we have issue with Christ coming and touching a sinner we need to shut the doors down and go home something ain't right when we lose our mission for the lost and for calling out for lost souls and wanting to see people weep their way to Calvary if it's been that long that we forgot what we're here to do you know the the following scripture tells us that he came to seek and say that which was lost that was the whole reason he was there and if we're him and him expressed again hello seek and save that which was lost moving on to verse 8. it says and Zacchaeus stood notice now unprompted and said unto the Lord now what he's telling is from this point forward this is going to be my behavior behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor now you might think well now that's not fair he told the Rich Young Ruler he had to sell everything how's he getting away with only selling half of it because he's rich rich remember so now he's just going to be rich how's that fair there's more to this story I'm going to give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation his entire Fortune falls under this sentence right here he kept back half from the poor to pay his debts he said I will restore that person for fold every person that I took one dollar from I'm gonna give them four dollars and you could actually find him he's going back to the Book of Exodus I believe 22 where where the law stated that if you robbed a man of a sheep or killed a man of a sheep or something like that you had to repay that man for sheep and so he's saying I'm going to repay four or four I love his repentance Jesus doesn't have to it doesn't even say sell what you got restore your debts your money's the problem Zacchaeus says I'm going to take care of this right now he says I'm gonna pay all these people but look that's a lot of people because everything he had he'd robbed from people he says I'm gonna restore fourfold that's why he didn't give it all to the poor verse 9 says after this statement and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so for so much as he is a son of Abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost it's so powerful to me that in the closing moments of time the closing moments here of the Jewish dispensation because that's when this has taken place in the final days and moments of his life he's saving he's reaching out one more opportunity great don't tell me Mercy's over don't tell me Grace is over this example right here tells me that it's not over don't give up on your sons and daughters here right here right here the chiefest of Sinners and he's reaching out at the last moment not only saving but he's saving those and listen to me that were impossible to save why are you say why are you saying that so strongly because some of you believe your child is impossible to save you may not admit that but you look at their situation sometimes you don't even pray for them because you feel like what's going on and you speak negativity and in your heart you feel like it's impossible I tell you that it was impossible for Zacchaeus let's find out how Luke 18 18. going back to the Rich Young Ruler and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall I do to inherit internal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good none is good to save one that is God I'm going to skip down to verse 23. it says and when he heard this he was very sorrowful because Jesus told him to sell everything for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God now we can get into what this means what that means but I'll tell you that whatever you think it means it meant impossible because here's what the disciples said and they that heard it said who then can be saved they said then no one can be saved so we can take whatever we think it means but to me it's I'm just going to take it for what it says a rich man going into heaven harder to enter into than a camel through the eye of a needle so Zacchaeus who was rich rich was impossible impossible but the next verse says and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God he speaks impossibility and then he says but look what happens brother Joe when you take an impossible equation and add Jesus into that equation impossible suddenly equals possible he says hey this is impossible now next chapter watch me do it oh it's impossible to be healed watch me do it it's impossible for my son watch me do it it's impossible for my daughter watch me do it it's just beyond the Press it's just beyond the Press if you're willing to keep pushing keep going Jesus is there salvation is there oh it's impossible what's me do the impossible Hallelujah he's an impossible God do an impossible things Hallelujah you can stay on your feet with me musicians you can come oh you think it's too late for your child impossible in a cursed City he says watch me save Zacchaeus this day I'm coming to your house oh is there somebody says Lord I need to see you tonight come to my house I'll do whatever it takes I'll push through and do whatever whatever I have to do Church there's always going to be hindrances and there's always going to be those that turn around because of it but there's always going to be those willing to say I'm going to see Jesus I'm going to get to Jesus no matter what it takes I'm pushing past every hindrance spirit I'm not going to be hindered in my walk I'm not going to have hindrance Spirits in my home I'm not going to be hindered in My Worship he can come home with you tonight he's here tonight if you're willing to do whatever it takes if you're willing to push through and say I'm not going to be stopped brother Brown says you pick up the sword see now of course you've got a hindrance you've got something that's going to duel against you that devil that disease that affliction but when you strike the tip of sword with that devil Yonder and say it's thus saith the Lord he revealed it to me I'm Healed oh my your faith don't have any hindrances then I believe I'm looking at a people that faith has been restored Faith turn back to where all things are possible they turn back to where we say Lord have your way have your way in my life have your way in my home have your way in this church and Lord if there's any part of me not surrendered Lord Lord I want to give it to you tonight Lord I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your presence I'm willing to do whatever it takes Lord no matter what people say no matter what people think oh I've done this I've done this I've done that are you willing to do a little more are you willing to go a little further are you a little delay a little bit more of yourself down tonight listen you may have to push through things I'd never understand you may have to push through more than anyone else somebody's going to carry that burden somebody's going to push through more than anybody else Jesus is just beyond the Press I don't doubt that your road is hard I don't doubt you've got a lot of hindrances but let me reiterate a promise that I said to you earlier if you'll push through if you'll go beyond the Press he will meet your need he will meet you every time he never failed the only ones that I saw him turn away tonight were those that wasn't willing to push through those that said Jesus come meet me on my terms come meet me over here I don't know maybe you got the Holy Ghost and you just need more it's just beyond the Press tonight maybe you need to touch in your home by touching your marriage or touching your spirit depression it's just beyond the Press maybe you've been backslidden maybe you hadn't been where you need to be y'all got time for a little story it's only takes a second backsliders we need you we need you we need you to come back and take your place and hold the line with us we got a big battles coming ahead the last final battles we need every man we can get on the line sword in hand musket in 1863 right before the Battle of Gettysburg there was a man by the name of Joshua Chamberlain who was in charge of the 20th Maine and he didn't know Gettysburg was fixing to happen it was a couple days before the battle and he was delivered 120 deserters I actually wrote it down one time as I was just writing some things about him and I wrote down 120. that saved the nation they were deserters they had quit on the army they had walked away they had turned their backs they were no longer fighting they were good men but they felt like we fought long enough we've been wounded enough we've lost enough comrades what's this war all about is it ever going to end and they just said we're not fighting no more we're not fighting no more and now I agreed not to fight anymore and so they were taken as mutineers traitors and their because the armies were amassed and they didn't have time to prosecute on those kind of things and they brought them to Joshua Chamberlain they said we need you to guard these men because they're main men and we give you full Authority if they try to leave to shoot them dead on the spot so he comes and he talks to him and he says I've been given authority to shoot you that y'all are main man you know I'd never do that message Believers can we have that attitude tonight sometimes the mutineers we want to throw stuff and shoot those are believers I ain't gonna shoot at them I need them back he talks to him he says I tell you what he says you're more than welcome not to fight and you'll have a fair trial when this is all over I don't wanna there's a trial when this is all over like that he says if I tell you what if you're willing

man like that and then three days later at the Battle a little round top the other six redeemed themselves too and that was the turning point of the whole War as the the union line began to break and they began to break and they would have in the entire War have been lost if it wouldn't have been for the extra strength of 120 backsliders that came back and picked up arms again because somebody
