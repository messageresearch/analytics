midst lord we know you're in our midst father you're moving among us you're touching hearts you're changing lives lord you're lifting us up out of our our dead doldrum condition father our our depression fathers sicknesses on every ham god you're moving in our midst and we're thankful for that lord lord we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever lord you're just looking for a people lord that'll step out in faith lord upon the promises of god lord that you can move in the supernatural realms lord that you can move in a supernatural way father we just commit this service to your hands lord you know our hearts lord you know pressures of the today lord you know lord the moments that you come and spoke to us and lord we just ask father that you'll just help us to step out of the way we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to joshua 3 joshua 3 and verse 9. amen it's good to be back in the house of the lord amen song says the devil don't like no singing around here but we don't care what the devil don't like amen he don't like no preaching he don't like no church but we don't care what the devil don't like amen we only care what he he won't say man joshua 3 and verse 9 it says and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby you shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites the perizzites the girgishites the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passed over before you unto jordan now therefore take ye twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of the jordan that the waters of the jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan that the priests bear in the ark of the covenant before the people and and as they were that bear the ark were coming to jordan the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city adam that is beside zerotan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed right against jericho and this priest that bear the ark of the covenant lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the jordan and all the israelites passed over dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan amen we let you be seated this evening i just want to speak to you for a moment on step into the water step into the water it was very interesting that once again god would do something that he had done before but maybe in a different way but he would open up the sea of or the river of jordan as he did the sea of of the red sea and we know we could go back in the book of joshua as he would begin to deal with joshua in the joshua commission he would he would say there in chapter one in verse two moses my servant is dead now therefore rise and go over this jordan thou and all this people into the land which i do give unto them even to this children of israel and every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that i have given to you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and to the lebanon even of the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide an inheritance of land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous you know i think it's amazing that he would tell joshua this as i was with moses so i shall be with thee he's showing joshua that he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen just because the prophet of god has left the scene does not mean god has left the scene that god is still on the throne god is still moving among his people it does not matter what the circumstance may say or how how much evil is around us or what's all happening around us it does not mean that god is not around us or god is not looking or god is not aware but god is very aware of our situation that we're facing this time that we're living in and he was telling joshua i am aware of what you're where you're at i know exactly on the map where you're standing and i have i know about the jordan river i know about the flood i know about all that's going on but this is the time to go step into the water this is a time to make a move amen why did god ask for them to step in the water you know he could have dried it up he could have he could have stopped it on his own he could have done it before they ever made the first move but why did god ask them to do that he wanted them to exhibit faith that what he said that what he said they believed amen that it was they didn't just believe in a god of history but they believed in a god that was present they didn't believe in a god who could but they believed in a god who would they didn't believe in just a god who maybe could do something in a time far away beyond in history as they were told no doubt by their fathers and their mothers that they could cut that they were told about the red sea crossing and how god came in a mighty way and it was a mighty amen revival that took place and they could tell about it all and they could tell about how they came down to that red sea and it seemed impossible there's mountains on one side and egyptians on another side and it seemed like they were going to die there in the wilderness but god began to move amen upon the people and upon the prophet moses and he would tell moses speak and go forward and you know and you can read about some of the history they would talk about as they heard the word of god speak and go forward there was a certain this was written down in some of their history there was certain tribe certain family of a tribe that would hear that word and they would go into the water and they they would press out into there even until it got up to almost their nostrils but they believed the same god that did all those things to the egyptians was still god right there and they were willing to prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever by taking that step of faith and here we are now in joshua's day now god is amazing the humor or or the maybe the wisdom of god however you would like to look at it that god would wait to seemingly the worst time and he would wait to simulate the most impossible circumstances that it would be impossible to cross the jordan river but god works in impossibilities amen as we heard many sermons brother joe's been preaching on god does impossible math that god an impossible situation will move it right out of your way amen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye if you're willing to take that step of faith amen here they are and you know why would he ask him to do this he wanted to see their faith it was at flood stage the water was at its highest and you know it seems today that that sin is at its peak it seems today that sickness is everywhere it seems today that the world is at its worst it's ever been it seemed like sickness is is like a flood that's coming in on every side but he's looking for a people a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that's willing to take a step of faith that's willing to stay step right in the middle of all that flood right in the middle of all that situation and say though god slay me yet i'll trust him i know he's got the answer for every sickness i know he's got the answer for every disease i know he's got the answer for every sin i know he's got the answer for every devil i know he's got the answer for everything the devil can try to bring into this realm there's demons on top of demons being poured into here but there is a standard that's being raised up there is a word that has been spoken amen go into the promised land because the devil tries to wall up amen something is very good brother branham would talk about scarecrows we spoke on that how he put scarecrows around something you'd put something around maybe you know as we're getting ready for spring thank god for spring is coming on and and you're looking at planting corn or plant tomatoes you might put something out there to keep the birds away but why are you doing that because there's something there amen that's very precious and the devil you know wants to put scarecrows or to bring the river at a flood stage and corona had us worse and sickness had his word and demonic pressure is at its worst and every kind of spirit at its worst but it's only showing you right behind that it's something very precious right behind all of that is the word of god the promises of god that we are more than able to take [Applause] amen i believe that there's a people on the earth today that's like joshua and caleb that'll look towards them giants and say giants you're coming down walls you're coming down doubt you're coming down unbelief you're coming down fear you're coming down every spirit that's tried to hold the bride of jesus christ you're coming down why because there's a people of faith to step into the water amen to step into the water i believe he's calling the people out of their out of their uh places where they feel amen very comfortable ain't it amazing he's made it you know we we keep getting the questions i our the statement i like to just feel normal again do you think it felt normal for them to walk into the water at flood stage do you think that was a normal feeling amen to walk out in the middle of that flood what it seemed to be it would surely drown them and would kill them that that wasn't very normal that wasn't normal thinking to do something like that it was but it was god's thinking amen god had put the word there and god said i'm going to show you amen that there is a living god among you hallelujah why has he allowed it to be thus why is he allowed it to break us out of our comfort zones and out of our normality of life he's wanting to show you it's not you that's doing the work but there's a living god among you hallelujah there is a god here that can heal coronavirus i know i know the devil wants to make you think that everybody's dying from it and it's so bad and so weak and then it is but there is a god there is a blood there is a healer that'll destroy that thing and send it back to hell where it came from there's a blood there's a power amen he's looking for a people that's willing to move into higher heights and deeper depths amen to believe for the impossibilities amen it's not hard to believe for a loaf of bread when there's 25 or 100 loaves of bread on on a on a shelf somewhere it ain't hard to believe for milk or or whatever substantial things for life and when it's all laying there before you amen it ain't hard to believe for for amen for healing when you're well amen it ain't any hard to believe for amen for some things when you've got them right among you but when they all all seem to be away from you and it seems like a flood all around you and the enemies come on every side then that's when you've got to believe that he's still the same today hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood amen he's flooding into every fabric of society he's flooding in with every doubt and every unbelief every critic is flooding him seem like they're everywhere hell's been opened up every spirit is coming to this realm demons upon demons are being released but he said when that happens i'll raise up a standard when sickness floods in i'll raise up the blood of jesus not me he has when the enemy comes in it's flooding every kind of direction amen there's a but there's a people that are bound for a promised land they're bound for heavenly realms amen amen i know one day we're going to take a rapture i'm talking about even right now in satan's eden there's a people bound for heavenly realms amen that they can have a heavenly atmosphere around them in the middle of satan's eden in the middle of all of his flooding and all of his spirits that's coming on every hand there's a people that can live in a heavenly realm but it took faith it took to believe that god the same god that opened the red sea is still god and he don't change we can look at the red sea what did he do the song says he made a sea into a highway man we're living in time in our in our little little state louisiana get a little 11 inch 12 inch whatever kind of snow you can't move for several days you know i don't have the equipment to deal with understand all of that but it don't take much to make man men immobile all their plans and all their wants and all the how to how to and it just immobilizes them i mean a little snow mess them right up amen i you know they think well i'm gonna go do this today nope got snow today i'm gonna do that that's how little man is that a little flake of snow can fall on the ground they can't go nowhere that's how little man and i know they whether we can have machines we can do this and they get it but it's the point is it don't take much to make man where they can't do anything even though men thinks they got it all figured out and we're all smart and we got this but that we and we're nothing we're we're nothing compared to his intelligence and you know it was maybe people trying to figure out why is he sending us out in the middle of a flood why is he sending us in the in the time it seems to be the worst timing it wasn't but just a few months ago it wasn't hardly a trickle but now look at it he was wanting to show them a living god is still among you hallelujah why is god allowed all kind of sickness to be poured out in every demonic spirit amen it seemed like it had been a lot easier to take a rapture maybe a hundred years ago but he's allowed it to come into this wow he's wanting to show the whole world there is a people with a living god among them i don't know it's more than a song but it's the truth he walks among us performing his word doing exactly what he said hallelujah crossing right over on dry land right over on tri-land and here the egyptians think they're going to follow them and they go right into the red sea right after them listen when god prepares you away he's preparing the devil a trap hallelujah amen and this we know what happened the sea fell in on them and he who did it before we'll do it again it looks like a flood all around us brother timothy but don't forget the standard it looks like a lot of enemy around us but don't forget the living god among us well brother timothy you've seen the canaanites and the hittites and the cancer and and the sugar diabetes and the high blood pressure and the demons of complexes and doubts and fear have you seen all of them i ain't looking at none of them i'm looking at a living card and a living god who has a living word with living signs and wonders that'll take a man who says he's only got four months to live and now he's still living today define a man's decree because man does not have the last save god has the last said wow hallelujah let me give you some courage tonight the devil don't have the last saying he don't have the last say about your life god has the last saying hallelujah he's already tried to have the last say he tried to say he was a druggie and an alcohol and no good for nothing but god said that's not who he is that's not who she is that's my son and my daughter i have a last city oh come on let's have church tonight because we're not serving under the devil's decree the devil's decree has been broken off of our lives and we are under the decree of a living god who says go into the water hallelujah what happens joshua lifts up the word he he says so you'll know there's a living god look to the word that's what the ark of the covenant of the lord was look to the word it'll pass right before you amen that's what we got to do in this age and i look to the hittites the canaanites the perizzites the coronavirus everything that's been pushed out there with the devil's society we're not looking at that we're looking at the word where the word goes i go amen because it's leaving here and i'm leaving here hallelujah hereby you'll know the living god is among you and he with will will without fail oh my without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hivites the hittites the perizzites the gergescites the amorites the jebusites or in other words he will drive out every type of sin he will drive out every sickness he'll drive out every complex he'll drive out every devil every spirit that tries to come over here and horn at you there's a word against that spirit floods of sicknesses floods of devils and floods are spirits of every kind but there is a people who's called to step out into the water amen you say well that's for the preachers we have been called a royal priesthood sure we need ministers that's willing to step in faith under that flood and say hey the days of miracles ain't passed but he's still the same god amen we need preachers that'll step into the flood and say there is still a god of holiness and righteousness amen i know the enemy's flooding on every hand hey man you know i'm kind of like brother brandon tonight you're going to go go ahead and call me a whole roller just go ahead and do it because i'm happy the lord just met me back there about five ten minutes before we started service and said tell my people stepping through the water i had a whole nother sermon planned but god when he speaks i like to follow him amen he's saying it's time we step out in faith it's time we start operating in faith it's time we start believing in faith listen we can believe in everything a man can tell us sometimes we'll garm it all down but we're not made to be all calmed down or operated by man's creeds and man's idea that's not why i was put here upon this earth i was put here upon a god decision god made a decision that i would be here and if he made the decree that i would be here he'll protect me he'll take care of me he'll take me safely through whether it be floods and deserts and every kind of spirit of hell i'm going through jesus i'm going through hallelujah i know it takes us out of our comfort zone maybe that's what god's been doing you think the devil's got this you think the devil's bigger than god god's allowed it to be this way to get you out of your comfort zone we're not staying here okay i'll put it this way maybe so i'm not staying here [Music] amen y'all gotta make your own decision but i am not staying here [Music] it'll take you out of your comfort zone it'll get you the way you have to let go stepping out in faith stepping out of faith means trusting god for whatever comes next did you hear me he didn't tell them to step into the water and when you do then i'm going to push the waters back and you're going to go across he didn't tell him all that he just said step into the water i know we like a drawed out plan you know we got to have a retirement plan we got to have this plan we got to have plans we had to have plans god don't always operate like that but god has a plan just like the children of israel he as i've said many times he told him i'll take you out and i'll take you in did you hear him in that mention the red sea no water no no no food did you hear him mention any of that about you know these sicknesses and different did you hear him mention any of that because he's not worried about that his word said i'm taking you out and i'm taking you in god's not concerned about all the mess in the middle like we are we get concerned about what's in the middle what we need to focus on he took me out and the same god that took me out of sin the same god that lifted me up out of complexes and unbelief and every kind of thing that tried to hold itself on me amen every spirit of hell he took me out of it he if he was big enough to do that and he was then he's big enough to do what else he said he said i'm going gonna take you in i'll not leave you or forsake you but i'll be with you to the end of the world this god is big enough don't get your eyes off of your big god but i don't like being out of my comfort zone we might ought to get used to different preach i don't i don't know i don't know what comfort anymore people are saying well i can't you know they always i can't wait till 2020 gets over with well 2021 ain't started off too good we don't know what it's going to be i feel like it's going to continue to get worse because it's heading towards destruction amen but it takes a stepping out in faith it means trust that step but step out means trust god for whatever comes next you know as peter as he would come to that moment in that boat and he would see jesus walking on the water and and he he came up and he walked on the water he said well you see jesus what he says they like is that a spirit what is that out there and this peter looked at him and said lord if that be you bid me come you know what jesus said did he say come and peter you can walk right to me you won't have a lick of problems it's going to it's already done just come on peter you just walk on no he just said come and peter had the faith to step out and he stepped out on the water and he began to walk towards jesus but we know the story what happened all of a sudden he got to look he wait a minute i don't lift the boat i lost my mind well and the very thing that i was dependent upon for safety is now no longer i can't grab it no more and it's gone and i can't hold it it's not normal anymore listen god knows how to kick the training wheels out from under you amen god knows how to make it very uncomfortable sometimes and you get in some uncomfortable places but don't forget in those places he's still there he's still watching over you and he's still taking care of you he hasn't left us yes hallelujah i know right now some are wondering what in the world you know you know we now have several people that apparently i'm just going to say tested positive for kobe twice i don't know if they did but they didn't i don't know what to believe anymore as far as men things go but i know peter walked on water two times and if he'd have went down he'd walked on three times because jesus was with him and he was a son of god and there wasn't no going down in defeat hallelujah the same god that made you walk one time will make you walk again and again and again the same god that healed you one time will heal you again and again and again and again he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah he is the god and he changes not [Applause] it takes faith daniel had to step out into a lion's den he had to make steps amen they said you pray to god you pray to another you won't get thrown in the lion's den he just went ahead and bowed us and he bowed down and prayed right just knew he knew what was going to come but he wasn't that well he wasn't under a man's decree he was under the decree of god but in that moment god came down as they throwed him into the lion's den and it seemed like it got worse i don't think that would be normal place to spend the night in the lion's den it didn't feel normal it seemed like death on every corner hanging around every every little place was death daniel gets thrown in there and he's dusting himself off and them lines are looking like they're coming up for amen to get them a good old midday snack or midnight snack whatever time it was but all of a sudden presence of god the angels of god fell in that place but what took that to get to that place was a step of faith a step of faith believing that the god who called me to this place is going to take care of me no matter what situation i go through three hebrew children it took a step bow they said nope here's their step nope will not bow that step took them closer and closer amen down to a fire and looked like destruction to men's eyes they thought they was going to die maybe in their own eyes they thought well if we die so be it but live forever o king we're not going to bow and they get thrown into a fiery furnace what happens the fourth man came down god is orchestrating this whole situation we're in tonight and today and for whatever times left on this earth to show you there's still a fourth man to show you as we've heard they're still angels all around us ministering spirits moving on our hearts moving on our knees healing our lives they're still here among us but it takes floods of waters and it takes somebody willing to step in brother branham would say this and talking about ellie's are going after rebecca and i believe that's that's who he was eliezer ordained of god to go get a bride for isaac yes eliezer when he had the assurance that the angel was with him and that he could go and it would go before him he decided to go because he had something to back him up he said i think that ought to be the assurance of every man of god that preaches the gospel that got something positive from god that'll back up what he preaches if you haven't got it brother it's for you god still sends men with an angel hello somebody god still sends men with an angel before him when he goes to take a message to the church not only that but when eliezer left the father of isaac which represented the father of christ he loaded the whole train of camels with good gifts for the bride oh he said i feel religious right now oh i love jesus he loaded the camels full of good gifts to give the bride and he never told her that they were for another generation or for another day but they were for the bride hallelujah and every true servant of god that sent out has got a whole book full of divine promises he can offer to the bride i'm so glad about that now there might be floods in front of you there might be obstacles in front of you but there's still a book here full of promises [Music] and there's still a god who'll back up every one of him hallelujah he's got gifts in here for you did you hear me church of the living car he's got gifts in here for you and he will not hold any of them back god is just getting the whole thing ready to show forth of his power and his love and his mercy and his grace and his loving kindness and his healing virtues he will give every one of them freely a true servant a model servant a servant of god can put trust in that he won't try to hide it from her because she know he knows she is the oncoming queen no good thing from there will be withheld from them that walk up right before him whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you and the book is full of it let me tell you we have we're not running out of promises we are not running out of healing virtue we're not running out of salvation we're not running out of mercy it's still full of it hallelujah it's represented in the barrel of mill and the crews of oil it'll never run out the book's full of it and it came to the well in the evening time one place he said i believe the angel of the lord beat him there by about 30 minutes i believe the angel of the lord's been in this building i felt him back there in my office moving very strongly almost couldn't even hold myself together he came to the well in the evening time notice the time evening time it came a time that when eliezer had to make another decision whether he would trust his own opinion or would trust god's opinion he said that's how true servants get so mixed up they'll look around some fine painted jezebel and say oh there's the lord you're calling me he said but that's just intellectual speaking to you he said let god speak he said it was the evening time when he come to the well actually right here where he said it it was about the time that rebecca had to make a decision and he said i believe the angel of the lord beat him there about a half hour for he will send his angels before you that makes the way clear now it may not look clear it didn't look clear to eliezer but it was clear it didn't look clear to those that stepped into the jordan river but it was clear it may not look clear tonight but it's clear hallelujah amen it must have been the angel of law god that spoke that had been there spoke to rebecca's heart and said go get the water go get the water rebecca came to the water of life at the evening time he said you get the picture it's the church in the last days the evening light is here it's time that the angel of the lord in a supernatural revealing himself to rebecca rebecca is now to reveal himself to the bride and she's moving to the waters of life i say the move is on just saith the lord the move is on for the bride of jesus christ you said well i see a bunch of stalled out people i see people's marching on with

angel speak to her because she was blood relations oh my god yes why can the supernatural speak to you because you're blood related yes god in christ has been reconciled man and god has been
