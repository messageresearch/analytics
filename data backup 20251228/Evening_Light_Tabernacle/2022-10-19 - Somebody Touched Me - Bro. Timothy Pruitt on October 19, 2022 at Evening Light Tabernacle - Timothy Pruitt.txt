just be with us as this service you speak to our hearts as touch us in our bodies Lord have need of thee tonight Lord I no doubt if I would ask for uplifted hands that have been all over the building Lord of needs and situations Lord needing you to come by their way and for their their their need Lord and their body or what are their big Financial physical spiritual but Lord no matter what that need may be Lord you're more than enough and we just asked God that you would just come and Minister tonight reach out to you father by your grace as given in Jesus name [Music] amen let's turn to Luke chapter 8. Amen in Hebrews chapter 4. you man's good to be back in the house of the Lord and amen's gone this past weekend up into Arkansas brother Matt morse's assembly had put on an old-fashioned Tent Revival and and I heard a lot of good word and a lot of good worship and and really thankful for all the things God has done Amen Brother David Siler and brother uh Wayne Lawson went from our from here to there and with Andrew Glover myself and hey man just want to thank brother Matt for that opportunity and for what he's doing there amen uh it's good to see uh people come into the Lord and a lot a lot of ones coming off the street and things and and so uh it's good to see those things amen it was just a wonderful time in his presence I know some from uh especially some of the young people went from here brother Andy Wiggins and his mother as well and and some young people from there and and we're blessed and on the way home the other day three of our young men was just pulling out and headed home and uh and somebody pulled out in front of them and and they could it could have been really bad but we thank the Lord for watching over them and and bringing them safely home amen Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 I'm just going to speak on something that I ministered there Sunday morning part of it and then a little some some other things as well Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which has spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood stanced and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude throng thee and press thee sayest thou who touched me and Jesus says somebody has touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and fallen down before him and she declared unto him before all the people for what caused she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made thee whole go in peace also Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. it says for the word of God is quicker and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints and the morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him which whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed unto Heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace in The Help and to help in time of need amen God bless you like to look at that scripture there in Luke chapter 8 again verse 46 and just speak for a moment tonight on somebody touched me somebody touched me you know I we're humans I believe every one of us tonight are humans in this building Lisa's what I'm trusting tonight and we all have issues in our lives now my issues may be different than your issues no doubt or yours than mine but we all have them because we are human and we have this flesh that we deal with and you know there's nothing that is hid before the sight of almighty God but God knows our issues and he knows amen the things that we deal with on a daily basis many times and things that come up in our lives whether it be things are passed down through generations through our families or or whatever we all have those things that we face and many times you know we try to hide those things and we try to keep them covered and covered up and act like they're not there but as we read in Hebrews chapter 4 the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and as the scripture said there's nothing that is hid that all things are naked so when you stand before him he knows all of your faults he knows all your failures he knows all the things that you've done even the thoughts that have you your thought in your mind he knows all about it so there's nothing that can be hid from him but in spite of all of that amen you can still he can still be touched by your infirmity these he can still be touched by the things that you go through and the situations your life and we can read it there as we read and he said we have not a high priest which cannot be touched or in other words we have a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities amen and I'm thankful to have that high priest tonight that even while I've got things going on my in my life he is there interceding on my behalf amen the blood is still there the blood is still atoning and the blood is still moving and I'm very thankful for that amen but you know I know that when you want to receive something for the Lord amen one thing that is very important is how you approach him and how you come to him we don't come to him in arrogance that I don't have any need or or I know it all nor that'll never get anything from God but if you come to him in humility and and in faith amen it is faith that touches God you do not touch God by your feelings you did not touch God by what you think or how you think amen you only can touch the approach to God Is by faith amen and so brother Brandon would talk about that and he said that's the reason why we tell testimonies that's the way that's the reason why we tell the things that God has done because we're trying to get people in an attitude Amen to that will bring results Amen to an atmosphere or an attitude amen that brings results he said it is the attitude that always brings the results it's the attitude that you take towards God he said well here's a woman that touched His Garment and she was healed why because of her attitude of approach she humbled herself and came by faith and she said if I could only Touch the Hem of His Garment then I would be healed now there would be down the road somebody a soldier that would hit him in the face and he would never receive nothing from God because of his attitude amen but if you come with the attitude or the approach him in the right place God will meet you according to your need amen it's attitude that's what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes attitude we are and we believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it is your attitude that brings the results the mechanics are here and the Dynamics are here but if our attitude to receive is not there God cannot do anything for us but if we can get ourselves in the right place God will always answer our need God will reach down and touch our hearts amen amen we see this woman had an issue for some years and and it seemed like she had spent all that she had and she had given all she had and it wasn't a doctor that could do anything for her amen but she had heard how Jesus had healed and how Jesus had delivered now if you read this whole context of this story Jesus is actually and just got off a boat and he's on his way to jairus's house but in the middle of her him being on the way to another house amen she said this is my opportunity amen that's where you got to come in a service that you have to take the services this is my service this is my time he may be going at another Direction but do you know that you can pull God right to where you are amen by the attitude that you have tonight you can push him away or you can pull him to you amen he may be going down a certain direction and he may have anointed a man to speak a certain thing but all of a sudden because of the attitude that you come in to receive amen the notes begin to change things begin to pull a certain direction why because you're actually pulling what you have need of out of the gift of God Amen and we see here now now naturally you know it can be in in blood you know we know blood is the life of the body and if you get a bad wound today you can bleed out or if you get a stoppage inside your body in one of your veins amen that can cause death As We Know by a heart attack or or stroke or different things I mean amen see spiritually Satan is trying to stop the blood of the flow of blood he's trying to stop the blood from flowing Amen to come and atone for your need and for your situation so therefore if he can stop it by changing your thoughts to where you think you know this service may not be for me I I shouldn't have come he's stopping the blood flow but if you can change that and come again with the attitude amen the blood will begin to flow and God can touch your heart and touch your need amen so spiritually Satan is always trying to stop the flow of the blood now we know as we said it would take three elements to make a body it takes blood water blood and spirit and so Satan can come and pervert any one of these or stop any one of these amen the body will die so Satan will try to do all he can to cause an issue with one or more of these elements and so he'll try to stop the blood or he'll try to stop the water or he'll he'll he'll try to wound the spirit whatever he can to keep you from receiving something from God Amen so so as we said we all tonight have issues in our lives every one of us it doesn't matter how far along you are in this journey but remember you will never touch God by your issue you will never touch him by fear you will never touch him by worry or you'll never Church touch God out of a hurt you will only be able to touch God by faith amen you know there's another writing of this story in The Book of Mark and it's pretty amazing that account as well there's there's five actually action words that they put in here that this woman did it says the woman heard she said she came she touched she felt all right that's in the order she heard about Jesus she said if I could only touch His Garment she came to where he was at she touched him and then she felt the blood issue stop now many times we want the feeling first before we get to all the other ones but that's not the way it goes amen you have to hear hearing comes by the faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God Amen and you she heard that Jesus had done many great things and therefore from that hearing she began to speak amen Faith began to flow out of her life amen Faith begin to go and and and we know you know when you begin to speak what you've heard amen Faith begins to be ignited that's why it's so powerful to tell testimonies because you hear God is a God not just of yesterday but he's a god of today and Faith begins to work in your life and then you can begin to respond not out of fear or out of failures or out of hurts or past mistakes but you can begin to respond out of faith and faith will always speak the word of God amen amen faith will not speak your hurt it will not speak your past it will not speak your failures faith will only speak the word of God Amen once you have faith your mouth will begin to speak amen out of the abundance of your heart therefore you begin to say this situation will not destroy me this situation will not determine my destination this situation will not Define me amen but I will overcome I will rise above it because why that's what the word said and therefore your faith begins to speak what the word says though therefore Faith actually changes your vocabulary amen where one time used to speak failures Faith begins to speak amen the word of God that's why it's very important never you will never touch God by fear of failure you will never touch God by saying well I'm just going to be what my parents were or I you know if I get married I'm going to end up just like they were and well you know that's that's not speaking out of Faith but faith will come always back to the word of God Amen that's where that's where we're based on so if you stop speaking in Doom and Agony and you begin to agree with what God Said Amen he said if you speak to this mountain it shall be moved but this mountain is not going to be moved by fear it's not going to be moved by past hurts it's not going to be moved by agonies and and all those things fat this mountain will only be moved by faith amen Cycles will not be broken by fear Cycles will be broken by faith disciples will not be broken by the past or what's what's happened over here or this over there or this fear this word no it'll never break a cycle but what will break a cycle is Faith because faith will look at that cycle and say that's not me I am standing on the word of God amen so Proverbs 23 says as you think that's what you become if you think you're defeated If You Think You're Lonely if you think everyone's against you that's what will become of your life amen so you got to change all of that and quit thinking about what how the devil thinks of you and start thinking how God thought of you amen because he said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways so God is not thinking of you defeated God is thinking of you of being overcoming God is not thinking of you sick he is thinking of you healed God is not thinking of you bound he is thinking of you delivered amen so you're with your faith amen must come out of your mouth and you begin to speak words of Faith amen if you keep speaking Doom that's exactly what's going to happen to you we need to begin with faith even if we're not feeling it she wasn't feeling it when she said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment she was feeling still the blood flow she was feeling the weakness of her body maybe she barely could drag herself up there and that's all she could find you know there was something there amen but she spoke out in faith she said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole now Hendrick says she had all kinds of hindrances there was all kinds of distractions in that service come on somebody it was all kind of other noises and things that was taken that could take her attention off but she began to get zoned in on one thing I got to get to Jesus Hallelujah I believe that ought to be our call every time we come to the church that'll be wild our hearts cry if I don't get nothing else out of this service I want one thing I want to get to Jesus if I can just get to him he'll rewrite my life if I can just get to him I'll be healed if I can just get to him my past will be forgiven if I can just get to Jesus that's all that matters and let me say this he's worth getting to Hallelujah he's worth letting all the distractions leave you and you get zoned in and say hey I'm here for one reason I ain't here to look at what this one's doing or what that one's doing or how many times this one gets up to go to the bathroom I'm not even worried about that I'm looking for one thing I'm looking for Jesus to come by and when he does I'm going to touch him Hallelujah but it begins with faith it doesn't begin with your feeling because if if the if what you got out of a service always depending on if you felt good you were 90 percent of the time probably never get anything out of a service matter of fact they said that today I've been battling sickness in my body do I feel like being up here no that's not but I'm not here by my feelings I'm here by the faith of almighty God amen so we don't come by our feelings we come by faith amen Hallelujah so we see here even though you know think about the shunabite woman when she came and her child had died and she goes out to find the prophet and she's a long ways off and he sees her coming and he tells the servant go ask her if her house is well if she is well in her house as well and he comes and asks her that and what's her response all is well because why I've got to where I need to be hello somebody that's when you know a service as well because you got to where you need to be amen you got more than just to appeal or or to a place but you got to the feet of Jesus Amen who can answer the questions in your life who can help you who can raise the Dead who can do all things if we can just get to Jesus that's all that matters so Elijah's would take until geez I go take my staff and go lay it upon the child because he knew whatever he touched when he had been had the anointing the spirit of God on him that was blessed he said I think that's exactly what Paul did he took pieces off of his off of him from office from the hankers and uh handkerchiefs and aprons and things off his body and went lady they went and laid it on people and they were healed of diseases and things he said some people touch the Garment of Jesus and was made well others smacked him in the face and hit him on the head with sticks and spit in his face and they never felt one virtue at all but it was their attitude approach it depends on what attitude you come in is what you're going to receive if you can't believe and that you're coming to get help you're confident you're coming to the right place Jesus Christ your coming his provided way of approach you're going to receive something if you come that way reverently if you come and say well if I go touch and see if it helps me it won't do you a bit of good at all it's your approach to God's Divine article that's what doesn't just like the brass serpent the breast serpent didn't have no virtue in it it was just a piece of brass neither the pole but by obeying what God said that's what brought the answer that's what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God and that is the same thing tonight if we can bring our issues and lay it out his feet and say God I just want to touch you that's all I care about to take care of the issues but you got to move past obstacles you got to get in the spirit of receiving hello somebody you got to get in the spirit of receiving therefore you got to let distractions and services just fall to the Wayside you got to let critics be critics just let them be who they are they got a fulfilled scripture just like we got a full school for Judas has to be there so don't get involved with getting in a fight with critics they are doing what they're supposed to do get in the spirit to receive something from God well you know I just ain't in the mood well let's change the mood hey man you got to push sometimes it ain't easy every service every service ain't a flowery bed of ease and it's just a uh happy-go-lucky service and boy the blessings are flowing and the things are happening this is popping and that's going on no sometimes you it's a sacrifice you got to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and say I'm I'm going to church some of you fought like oh get out to get here so let's don't get here and lose out on what we came for [Applause] amen we get so tired of the fight sometimes and we get so weird we come here and ah wow now while we're here let's get what we have need of let's get something from him he has some virtue he wants to give out he has some healing he wants to give out he has some Deliverance he wants to give out he has some power breaking chain amen chain breaking power he wants to give out but you got to get in the spirit to receive and then there's some things you got to do you know he talks about the prophet of God he said one time the kings came to him Jehoshaphat had joined himself up with some backslidden people and and then and he he said they couldn't find water and they got enough trouble and they come there to the prophet he said that he said that genuine Prophet wanted to tell him off he wanted to tell him why you come here for won't you go off to your own prophets and see what they can do for you he said he was in a kind of a a rough spot kind of got all stirred up and he said you know kind of got his righteous indignation up to you Holiness people you calvinistic Presbyterian Baptist he just got angry that's all he got angry he got stirred up he said why why don't you go down the old cold former Church get you some of your preachers and down there and you asked them he got his dandruff up see why don't you go down to your mother's prophets and your daddy's prophets see it was uh he was a halfway borderline believer there he said why don't you go down there Elisha with his dandruff up he said I wasn't that I respected the president of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you but he really got out of humor didn't he what and then to get all out of sorts and he was in no condition amen for the spirit to come unto him for him to be able to give anything so he said you know what bring me a Minstrel bring me a Minstrel he said he said to you people that don't believe in playing music in church I don't know what you're going to do with that one he said but bring me a Minstrel get out get going there out there among them soldiers and find somebody that can play a horror for some stringed instruments anything whatever he got play some of that old-time religion for me I've been placed something there maybe started playing on but only believe but somebody said something to that order he said I know those songs wasn't back there but something like that he said and the prophet all of a sudden they'll begin to hum and Pat his foot after a little while what was it doing he was getting in the spirit to receive amen if a prophet has to do that how much more should we have to do that because we come all out of sorts I know how it is amen the devil sometimes will leave you alone you know the world says Monday morning's bad you know the worst mornings for a Believer Sunday morning and a Wednesday evening amen the devil is coming on every side to try to hinder you to try to stop you to try to get that moment blocked to stop the blood flow and when you see that happening that's when you need to push harder that ain't the time to push by pull back that's the time to push forward and say no the enemy's trying to stop something let's settle ourselves for a moment let's grab an instrument amen let's get some people that's anointed to sing the word of God and play the instruments and let's get to singing and clapping our half what is it we are getting in the spirit to receive something from God so that he can be touched see if you want to be touched by him you have to touch him did you hear me if you want to be touched by him you have to touch him amen he's at Sea that's what's the matter with the church that's what's the matter with this meeting if you can't get in the spirit you won't see nothing there were so many others that was there and they went in the spirit to receive what she received and they no doubt had just as much need as she had but how many are Unwritten about think about that here's Jairus and here's this woman how many others were around there that had just as much need but they're not even written about because they wasn't willing to let all that stuff go and touch him amen you have to get in the spirit of it before you can see it he said you people that used to go to dances he said I don't believe you and do it now since you're a Christian but when you used to you used to have all have to play all the music and carry on everything get in the spirit of dancing when you went to ball games somebody had to hit a home run before you throwed the hats in the air and screamed and hollered and it was all right for you then but a fella didn't believe much in ball games he just stood there and couldn't see nothing to it he wasn't in the spirit of it and he said that's the reason you come around an old-fashioned meeting where they got good salvation and they go to holler and amen and praising the Lord and you say that's a bunch of Fanatics he says because you're not in the spirit of it he said if this is the holy spirit then that other thing must be the Unholy spirit this makes you do what holy things that makes you do Unholy things amen a woman said one time well Billy I understand you've got some new kind of religion he said what kind is that he said them kind the people they make some people shout and dance and go on I said well that's a new kind that's the only kind there ever should be that's the oldest religious that religion there ever was he said well I never heard of that before he said well what about when job when he spoke to him and said Joe where was you when I laid the foundation of the world tell me what they're fasting into where was you when the Morning Star saying for joy and the sons of God shouted for Joy a hundred million years before the world was ever formed they had a shouting religion Hallelujah then talk and then talk about something new that's the oldest that there ever was so if your religion is not a shouting religion you got something new amen yeah he said that old-fashioned heartfelt sky blue sin killing religion brother it don't wash your white washer it washes your white From the Inside Out makes you do things you didn't think you'd ever do yeah buddy makes you do things you don't think you wouldn't think you would ever do just got a testimony huh I don't have it here before me but just got a testimony of a young mother who was in some severe depression there in those meetings in Ohio to the point where her thoughts was turning my family don't need me she's having to take medicines and things to try to control things because she was diving so deep into darkness and and and she was just going down a real real real deep dark path suicide on everything and every thought seemed like and just writing even notes she comes to that meeting on a Saturday night and she uh comes up to the prayer line I remember her coming through and she said I just need another real dose of the Holy Ghost I I just need to I need a renewing so we pray for her and God moves on her life and she goes over there and you know what the devil puts in her mind well why ain't you shouting like the rest of them Shout why why ain't that happening for you and she said well you know that had never been on me like that before and she said so I just kind of turned it on him I said well I know God just gave me something regardless if am I shouting or not I'm just going to still going to thank him for it so she Praises him forward and and things and so the next Sunday Sunday morning I actually preached on a let's let's make this a good fight and I dealt and I knew the Lord was moving very directly towards suicide and depression and brother Ray Erickson mentioned it to me afterwards he said I don't know if I've ever seen a sermon so directed towards that Darkness like that and you just kept calling it out and kept hitting at it and kept and kept hitting that direction he said I I I wonder what that was about we just talked about it like that we didn't know we hadn't heard this yet and here this sister sitting back there and we began to sing the song you don't know like I know what he done for me you don't know like I know what he done for me I said I got one you broke depression off my life that's what you've done for me and she said at that moment her hands were up in the air and she began to dance and Shout she said I was one of those wild women like the rest of them so the power of God fell on her and she began to dance and shout and today medicines are being taken off her thoughts have changed the sun is shining the birds are seeing amen what happened God changed it all in the moment she got to Jesus and if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole amen so they got to play in the music and got it to going real good I I like that in fact the day I was listening This Means War and none doesn't nothing does my heart good I actually sent a little clip I said we're just being real tonight I sent a little clip to Joe today I didn't know he wasn't gonna be here tonight I know he's traveling already but I sent the clip to him with that first first part of that service I'd sent that to brother Mike brother Mike had that other song on his heart and so in which God used powerfully stay and he used it in his last meeting as well it's just it's amazing what God has done through that music and that song Amen but he said how am I going to work this into that and and so he had brother Colby started out and brother Colby gets to go and all of a sudden that door opens and how the door Joe comes to dancing out of it I said well I said get it started Joe that's the way we got to do it hey man it came with an attitude to receive amen but it does nothing does me more good in that end of that so as they sing in that song again to see brother Ron Spencer up there shouting and praising God and thanking God for his healing and what God's doing Amen brother Andrew and different ones all over the building amen that's that's what it takes you got to get into the spirit to receive Amen to realize this is war and if it's going to be War let's make it a good War let's make it a good fight amen let's push on into the things of God and this he said he'd gotten the spirit and then he began to see things he began to see more than the faults that were around him he began to see more than the backsliders that were around him and the other sessions with the situation that was around him amen he began to see what God saw that's what faith is is what God sees you say well oh brother Branham way well that's what they did on the day of Pentecost they all stayed there and prayed till they got in the spirit and then they got filled with the Holy Ghost and run out and act like a bunch of drunk people religious people of the world stood and said these men are drunk all of them together even Virgin Mary and all of them was together said they're drunk on new wine he said well what was it they had got in the spirit that's what we need today is an old-fashioned shaking down God said holy ghost Revival then you can have healing Services then you have indecent in order God will bless the altars will be full you don't need some new theology you need the Holy Spirit priest and power through Simplicity it's the greatest drawing card the world has ever had thank you Elisha was getting in the spirit then the Visions begin to come he said thus saith the Lord go out and start digging some ditches get ready for a whole lot of water so depending on how much water you get it's depending on how much ditch you dig how much you're willing to put yourself through in sacrifice amen that's how much blessing you're going to receive it ain't all dependent on God it's dependent on you amen he wants to do more for you even exceedingly abundantly more than you can even think or ask so if you're dead got a feel if your dick gotta feel if your dick gonna feel gonna move through everything he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it he wants to give you more of himself more than you want it get to dig in there well he said listen dig some ditches you're not going to see a cloud you're not going to hear rain you know you don't have to get no degree or go to some Seminary but you're going to get some water you don't have to join some organization you don't have to join some church if you want water start digging I can see them get started digging some fella hit the ground a couple times said wow this is rough I'm just going to sit over here and let somebody else do it you won't get no water amen there's a reason why you got to dig because there's some testimonies to dig out of there amen you go he said if you quit digging you ain't gonna get no water every man had to dig his own spring hello somebody amen every person is responsible for themselves what they get out of a service so you can't get mad at the song leader or at this one or that one it is on you amen it's not because there wasn't a certain song song you didn't get something there wasn't a certain thing preached that you didn't get something he was preaching to jairus's house but she said this is my moment this is my time this is my service this is for me see we bring our shovels for the wrong reason we bring the shovel to take what's said and throw it on somebody else you bring a shovel you need to bring one to church but that's the dig a ditch I'm gonna you're not throwing dirt on nobody else no you're just digging a hole and you're just getting ready to receive as we heard about that woman who went and got many vessels amen according to the vessels that's what she received according to what you dig out and what you say well I want God to feel every fiber then start digging what blocking it out of your life and dig it out sometimes it's a root of bitterness and it goes through all kind of fibers of your life and it takes a long time to root that thing out but it's worth rooting out sometimes it's an unforgiving spirit and you allow it to lay there and you got all against your mother your daddy or this that and the other and you're so unforgiving and you're about you're just a dried up old prune why because you haven't dug it out therefore the water can't get to where it needs to get to he said whether somebody hits a big old tin can so what's this well it says there's no such a thing as Divine Healing kick that thing out make room for water keep on digging somebody hits another Tin Can says we can't you ain't got you shouldn't have altar calls no more kick that thing out don't tell me I've seen God move too much at Alters and besides all that altar ink just for people to come and repent an altar is a place of washing it's a place of worship it's a place of laying yourself down and kneeling at his feet so you can Touch the Hem of His Garment amen it ain't all about well look at that one they're up there at the altar again oh I'm as long as they get what they come for that's all that matters kick it out yeah God don't use prayer lines no more that's a lie what about that girl just testify what if we didn't have that what if we just had an old dried up stump of a service and she sat back there she'd probably be dead by now amen kick that thing out keep on digging don't believe in Divine Healing the power of God get room in there so you can get some more water the deeper you dig the more water you have get all the doubt all the unbelief things away from you and when the showers begin to come down to the valley you'll get a big portion of it you'll get a little well like that that's all you can have I he said I like to go Plum over my head thank you you know what Plum over your head means that means you have lost all control of your you can't you can't hit the ground no more amen you can't you know when you get in waters you can swim in and that's all you can do that's some different kind of waters and Waters right up to here or Waters to your ankles or Waters up to your waist or water's up to your chest when you get to a place that you can't hit bottom that's a whole different kind of water and that's why people don't want to let go they're afraid they won't be able to hit bottom they're afraid that they they won't be able to control what's about to happen they will they're afraid they'll lose all control listen if you're giving it to him who cares he's the one in control amen that's why we sing the song let go and let God have his way amen it ain't let go and we worry about this or that no we're letting ourselves go Amen to what we think and how we think of service ought to go and how we think it ought to be and how how we think it ought to be orchestrated and how we think think think and we're getting beyond what we think where we can't stand on no more what we think we can only we're in waters we can swim in he said I like to get over my head so I can swim in the goodness of God get all the old kettles and all the old rocks and the stumps out of the way well now if I get saved what will I do well you get saved went over and got the Holy Spirit the first thing you know you dug down and said ten percent of the church on my throw it out of the way get room for more water keep digging make a big well where God can really baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fix you right he wants to fix every issue you're not going to see any clouds you won't have to do this you won't have to have a new theology but you're going to get water anyhow where did that water come from it ain't going to rain out of the heavens it ain't going to be artificially made but there's going to be water there through the supernatural this won't be a man-made rain sprinkler and the service depends on that man whether he had a good day or not whether he feels like preaching or not no it ain't dependent on man this is a supernatural reign amen Jesus Christ is moving now through the church he said do you know the children of Israel passed right through that same Wilderness and the rock that was in the wilderness when they passed was still there oh my the one that gave water Jesus Christ was in the church in this church last night he's still the same church tonight in the same church Jesus is the same Christ tonight in the same church just get to dig it get all the doubt out of your way get all the superstitions quit saying that it's so the devil quit talking about this throw it out of the way speak to the Rock and Waters will come forth they woke up the next morning and all those valleys of ditches were full of water and The Invasion came and God used that as ambushments against the enemy amen he used it as traps against the enemy amen see why the devil has been so easily coming into your house because he's been walking across dry land easily accessible and easily able to get to and easily able to defeat and easily able to bring down but if you'll dig enough ditches so the god of Heavens can fill it supernaturally with water next time he comes he won't find it so easy he'll find some entrapments there he'll find the spirit of the Living God the Living Waters of Life are flowing freely again he'll find that he can't walk where he used to walk he can't go where he used to go his this property is not accessible no more hallelujah amen he'll find it's not possible anymore I can't go to where I used to go because there's something there now he said we need to dig it all out of our heart all those old things that take somebody else's word beside God's word when Jesus Christ was then he is now he rose from the dead and he's moving even now he said see what happens you get all those tin cans and things out of the well and get a testimony in your hand you'll stop up some of these old formal whales around here that don't believe in Divine Healing and the power of God amen when you realize God's a supernatural God and now it ain't just somebody else's testimony but now it's your testimony how many whales have been stopped up amen of cancer that said I'll I'll eat you I'll beat you I'll tear you down but all of a sudden God raised up a testimony to put down on The Well of that devil and say no I got the power to heal cancer I got the power to raise the dead I got the power to heal alopecia and brain bleeds and undeveloped hips and bad eyeballs I got the power so therefore God gives you the power to go to where the enemy is and more every place come on somebody he's been writing on your walls defeated he's been writing on your walls that hey he'll never overcome he's been more in your testimony but now that the wall the whales have been dug and the supernatural has filled it then God has given you a testimony you have the right to go to his house and say defeated you don't have no power over me no more I have overcome I will rise above it all I will not be like who my mother was or who my father was that's not who I am foreign amen sister Elena tonight can walk up there with that rocket testimony and right on the Gates of Hell healed of cancer marred hell and showing that there's power over here amen there's five people here today that can walk and say delivered of tobacco delivered of alcohol delivered of all kinds of things delivered of lust and pornography write it down on the walls of hell and say I have been delivered it was the right kind of touch she pulled her Deliverance through that body her faith say notice he didn't turn to her and say my faith saved you my being here saved you no your faith saved you her attitude of approach this woman had a blood issue how many believes that God was in Christ amen a woman with a blood issue walked over and touched His Garment went back and here hit herself and even denied she touched him and Jesus said somebody touched me well he better say that at Services of the evening light somebody touched me virtue has left me Peter said well I mean everybody touched you what do you mean I mean they've been hitting on you and slapping you and bumping up against you he said but virtue is left feel weak he looked around all denied all the strength where it was going went right to that little woman Jesus didn't know who it was he was a man in human flesh he was a man but the woman had touched God through him and you touch him the same way listen to this Jesus's Corporal body is sitting right at the right hand of God in Majesty on high as a sent offer make an intercession then he then his spirit that was in the body has come back into the predestinated for ordained offices in the church that you touch God the same way through those bodies that's what I said wow wow you touched God the same way through those bodies not that they're in their own self but worthy and surely not but they don't stand in their own righteousness no they stand in the robe of the Lord Jesus it's his righteousness to declare his works that he is the same yesterday today and forever this is why he would say they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover why because virtue is moving from one body to another and healing is being transformed for dry amen deliverances is being transferred amen the power to walk out of cells is being transferred we're not standing here as men in their own righteousness it's not about me it's about him but that's why it's important when you come to the house of God to have the right approach it's faith the notes may be going a certain direction but I promise you if faith is let loose it'll move how many times has brother Brandon been at a poor platform and the angel of the Lord he said you know what that is that or you you feel that presence that's the angel of the Lord and he would deal and he says now wait a minute he's left me and he gets to look and he begins to look he said oh there he is I heard him today on the tape he said there can't you just see him standing right over there in that corner right there by that man he who did he touch the same Angels here can he have the same response who touched me somebody touched me somebody on a Wednesday night reached out touch me virtuous left me I feel a pull I feel drawn I feel moved something has taken place and maybe you don't hid yourself over in the corner somewhere but he'll find you out and how do you know you touched you touched him because it's changed when I touched Jesus I touched Jesus and it just continues don't know if you touch him it's going to change and her blood stopped immediately touch him tonight let's bow our hands you touch God the same way through these bodies it's more than just a man just reading today brother I'm talked about the office he said if you don't respect the office God won't even respect you well brother Timothy this one done me wrong and that one yeah that's between that man and God let that go Let It Go and let God have his way in you [Music] and touch him [Music] how many could say tonight Lord I I want to touch you Lord out of faith in order I want to touch you tonight and healing or deliverances whatever can take place you can draw the angel of the Lord right to your pew he's still the same one tonight Hallelujah hallelujah oh touching Jesus is all that really matters within your life will never be the same
