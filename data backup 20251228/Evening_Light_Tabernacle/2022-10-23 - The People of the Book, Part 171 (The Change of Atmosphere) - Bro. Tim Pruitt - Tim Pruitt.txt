Hallelujah let him cut down upon you today offer up a sacrifice of praise and let his power come down upon you and receive that sacrifice today as we worship him today in his presence amen amen we're going to have a little sister Ellie Patton she's going to be baptized today in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we saw the Holy Spirit young work upon our young children there even in the prayer line and and um and different times after the service and the special meetings and this is a result of that amen she's made that decision to follow Jesus aren't you glad for that amen God bless you if you'll be to turn with me in your Bibles be fine in Genesis 18 and verse 1. wanted to tell you brother Timothy and I are leaving for Switzerland we're having meetings from there I wonder how many of you enjoyed Brother David Mayer when he was here did you enjoy that amen well that comes with the price so you know we have to go and pay up so you know um you know we just can't have a mouth has come our way without also going there to and trying to help out and it's been a long time since I've been over there we was there during the Easter Camp um some years ago now four or five years ago I can't remember the date but anyway we're going back again and there's a couple hundred people Gathering there from England and Belgium and Switzerland and France and um and several other places and a lot more tuning in than Serbia Croatia different other places over there so going to be quite a few that will be uh you know joining with us in those meetings if they're not physically there but maybe uh in the broadcast and so you know it's the way that the gospel has a spreading around the world amen and so we just pray that God would bless us in a great day wait today in his presence amen Genesis 18 verse 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him and how Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I'm old waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being older also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall have a church he bear a child which him all is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied Saiyan I laughed not for she was afraid and he said neighbor thou did his life God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak today on the changing the Change of Atmosphere The Winds of Change are blowing across the world as we know it today and we are entered into a very very different season it's a very serious time that we're living and ever everyone no matter who you talk to whether it even be the news you listen to everyone is feeling restless and we know that something bad is foreboding in the world and we have had a pandemics that we have just passed through and still are threatened by and the viruses that have killed Millions shut down world economies brought back brought about global inflation and this is brought about um even with all of this in the midst of all of this it brings about rampant voter fraud and throughout the nation we have elected a Catholic President and a woman vice president Royal Purple and we have a a new woke agenda from our government that has weakened our military and the same agenda is destroying our educational system and and the American families and the spirit of lawlessness has increased across our nation as we hear the cries defund the police and and then riotin in the cities and Rising crime and brother Brandon talked about this he said um uh himself when he when he referred to such times like this he he can compare it to a lamb that was out eating in the field and the little poor the poor little fellow couldn't see nothing but he begins to feel Restless even though he's not seeing anything he's he senses something's wrong that there's something fixing to happen because crouching over in the bushes is a lion coming up and it's just something about it he can't tell it but he knows something is fixing to happen he can he can't see the line but he knows something is wrong and that's the way it is today that there is a setting scene today with all the conglomeration of Blackness and darkness and sin and things that are going on the world they're actually setting the stage for the greatest drama that was ever acted out in all the ages the coming of Jesus Christ now if you actually look back in the days of Sarah and Abraham they were actually actors on the the stage as it was and they were prophesying of end time events and so um again they they were in this situation but Sarah was not quite in the spirit of what was happening you see she was sitting back there um perhaps confused as to what was going on and hearing the Angels reported she just couldn't somehow believe that that was true now but of course you know we can't have the last day until people get in the spirit of the last days we can't have a healing service unless people get in the spirit of of a healing service you you know that the atmosphere has to be right and we we cannot have a feeling of the Holy Ghost unless the atmosphere is right for people to get in that kind of an atmosphere and it's in the right atmosphere that the Holy Ghost comes remember when the day of Pentecost was fully come it was where when the atmosphere became right that's when the Holy Spirit came down and of course um you know the the people was um in the atmosphere back in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah that we are reading about these days that that to bring judgment upon the earth and the Angels were coming down and mixing with human beings and as far as walking among them and they were they were um looking there looking and judging the the the the the fruits of the people upon the Earth and uh and of course they they're in the same atmosphere today and brother Branham told us we are also in another time of investigating Angels where that they are looking for something they're looking they're looking to hear as um as uh God would say to Abraham I've come down to see if the report of these sins is true or not and and if it is I will know and so he sends Angels down there to investigate and and of course he comes to Sarah and he's looking for Faith and this is what God is looking for in this last day God is looking for somebody who will believe him whose Hearts have been turned back to believing again but of course we look at the age that we're living in that's like Sodom and Gomorrah that their their marriage and and giving and marriage and divorce and remarriage and then you know just cohabiting and all kinds a sin of the uh you know of drinking and and um carousing and so on and um the glory of God of course is also being preached and demonstrated in the power of the Holy Ghost and uh it sets forth a example of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and and it shows us that God is going to take a church into glory and I believe even the atmospheres that we can see that are changing Even in our in our church in the church body and the and the ministry that is going for us it's being preached with certain expectation with certain atmospheres producing certain atmosphere because that we know just as certain as I'm standing here Jesus Christ is coming back to the Earth again for a people but at the same time men are ignoring that and paying no attention to it or walking away from it because they are in the spirit of the last days and the atmosphere is coming right for this now for Sarah there had to come A Change of Atmosphere in her life and man in order to receive the promised son I just want to say she's typing the bride and so there has to be a change of atmosphere within the bride of Christ where she comes under the expectancy of seeing the miraculous and recognizing the presence of God Among Us the there had to become a Change of Atmosphere in Sarah's life in order for her to receive the promised son and the same thing it is we we cannot just sit and lay Ode to see in conditions and and um you know locks and um rich and increasing Goods saying we have need of nothing and expect expect the coming of the Lord we've got to get in the spirit of his coming now brother Branham told us I don't look for Revival in this generation he said I look for the coming of the Lord but with the coming of the Lord does come Revival it is a restoration it is Reviving it is a refilling of the Holy Ghost it's an outpouring of his spirit and and so again you see the The Church Must Get in the atmosphere in order to receive the promised son now Sarah was barren she was sitting in her tent in unbelief how much longer can Sarah sit there and I just want to say that about the bride of Christ how much longer can we just sit in the tent and sit there you know wear it like Sarah did Sarah had loud bitterness to rule within her she had come to a point that rather than easily believe in the promise and receiving it she would actually laugh at the promise and so you see she had let bitterness rule in her life you know there's many of people make that mistake and this is what happens to their marriage or in their home or even in their Church it drives them out of the house of God they start letting bitterness rule in their life and and so this was Sarah she had just kind of got bitter at life sitting back in the chin and and I'm not expecting the Fulfillment of the promise of God now I want to tell you you must rule your atmosphere you see you must rule your thoughts you know what you think will Define you what you dwell upon and what you're thinking on will become what you are they become words and words become actions and action becomes in deeds and deeds become uh who you are and you become associated then with those bitterness that bitterness but I I want you to know that if you can ever get your heart turned to Faith that faith will change your vocabulary it'll take it from it'll never happen to me or it's impossible for me or looks like the promises you know are way off from me and my children will never come in well I'll never have that promised child or I I'll never get over this sickness or I can't Rise Above This problem you see you when when Faith Comes interchange your vocabulary it'll take away the I can't and put in I can I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me so with his power I can do this you see Sarah had let her barrenness Define her and I want you to know you cannot allow your baroness to Define you well it's been a long time God doesn't really love me I hadn't felt the spirit of God in years do not let baroness Define you that is not who you are you are a people of promise you are a people of faith you're not a people of defeat I mean you're not to have a victim mentality but an overcoming mentality because he said to the Leo to see an age to him that overcometh so there has to be somebody in this age overcome now so you see we can we cannot let whatever situation we are going through Define us amen we cannot look at our problems and let that Define Who We Are the trouble in our families don't let that Define your family that may be what you went through and what you've been but that's not who you are you are the child of the most high God you are a possessor of Heaven and Earth you are you are the sons and daughters of the king so you don't let anything negative Define you you take the word and let it Define you and so who you are I am a bloodbot blood loss son of daughter daughter of the Living God [Applause] you need to look at your situation and say I'm not going to let it Define me I will not take on the name of this sickness this problem this debt my failures that's not who I am that is not my day what defines me now Sarah had let this Define her until she become bitter oh it'll never happen for me she had given up on the promise I'm going to tell you friend she was right on the right in the the very face right on the cusp of her promise being fulfilled and she was about to miss it but there's something about God when he prophesies when he puts it in his word when he says I'll have a bride without spotted wrinkle or blemish Hallelujah when he puts in his word what you're going to be amen that God's going to bring you the past and he's going to work until he brings it to pass now when you get to where you should be in your faith then you can be like the shunamite woman and say all is well don't give up until you get to where your faith is reaching the level of God's promise now you are you see you are you are not built to remain in the valley you may have had things in your life that has blowed you down and you're sitting down maybe on the lowest of the lowest limbs but I want to remind you you're still an eagle just because storms have blowed you down just because trouble has got you down just because that it doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen for me does it mean that you're not an eagle anymore are you with me amen you were made to fly with the Eagles where all things are possible to them that believe you are to rule the skies in other words you are to rule the atmospheres but right now Sarah is letting her atmosphere rule her and God comes to visit because he has to birth faith in Sarah's heart first you see words have been spoke of her many years before but she just regarded them as for somebody else you know uh her years of baroness had taken this toll and she believed the promise was true for Abraham but not for her you see it wasn't possible for her she she kind of had a victim mentality and God had to change her to a restoration mentality and this is what God wants to do with you he wants to take you from where you've always been the victim to where that you can be the victor word that you've always lived a defeated life and and baroness and I you know you just not ever been on what you're supposed to be and you never quit cloudy attained and you'd never been good enough God wants to change you from an atmosphere of unbelief to a restoration mentality for he said I will restore saith the Lord now you see it's kind of about a mentality I've talked about quite a bit a slave mentality you see Sarah had to get rid of the victim mentality that enslaved her Victory starts in the mind first I want you to get this right I want you to get it this is the womb to the soul the mind is the Gateway and victory starts in the mind first that's why that of the right mental attitude toward the Divine promise will bring it to pass and as long as you've got this poor me it'll never happen for me I I can never do it we can never attain we might as well give up this this is what defines who I am as long as you have that then that raw mental attitude will come out of your mouth and you will be speaking unbelief and fear and doubt rather than faith and only faith can create now so you see Victory starts in the mind first some mental right mental attitude toward the promise of God is what must be I can be I can do all things through Christ's strength everybody who's going to bless me in the field he's going to bless me wherever I go His blessings upon me his love is upon me amen he is he's put his love upon me he's going to bring into my life what what he is to design for me to be you see Sarah had been prophesied over but she began to believe that the promise you know carried so it's not for me it's not for me it couldn't be for me it's got to be for somebody else or else it would have happened and now it's beyond you know even what I could ever believe before I could believe this when I was young I could believe this when I was healthy and a young girl but I can't believe it now it is past but that's when God likes to work when it becomes impossible for man then God steps in and works because he's the one who can do the impossible now Joseph for example Joseph was a slave down in Egypt and you know he that he had had dreams and prophecies over him right and yet so far it didn't ever it wasn't producing nothing but slavery and captivity and abuse and false accusations lies and imprisonments he could have easily looked at the promise and said well you know I missed it it's not for me the prophecy ain't for me it ain't going to happen like it said I mean I had this vision of the 12 stars and the Sun and the Moon balling before me I had this vision of the of the twelve sheaves bound before me I had all of that but it's not for me it's never going to happen it'd be impossible for it to happen in my condition you see after all of these years of trying to believe I'm just still Barren it's never never been fruitful in my life but you see you see Joseph had to see himself differently than his situation he had to see himself as an overcomer as a Victor and so even though he sold into slavery he excels into positions is that right he didn't just sit there in his bitterness and say well I'm so down here you know you got to look at even the wisdom of God how did he orchestrated the whole thing how in the world is he going to ever reach this position of governor of Egypt and he don't even know their language did you ever notice when he spoke in the Egyptian tongues his brother didn't understand him right they spoke a different language he had to be sent and and abased in order to be prepared to sit on the throne I'm telling you everything that you have been going through is only preparing you for your moment of victory the heartaches the stress the Weeping the crying the baroness the hurt everything has only been preparing you for your victory [Applause] he was a slave down in Egypt but in order to get from being a slave to the government Governor he had to see himself as a Victor an overcomer this is why you've got to start seeing yourself your name is not defeat your name is not barren your name is not I can't do it your name is I'm an overcomer I Will Rise Above This you see no matter how many times that Joseph tried to get up he was pushed down you see every time that he almost raised and thought Oh My this is going to be it now and I'm I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna raise it you see my brothers will come and now I'm head of Potiphar's house and uh glory to God he'll see me in an important position with an important man one of the leaders in Egypt and now see they'll see and they'll have to recognize but that wasn't what God's plan was so he almost achieves only to drop down again so then it gets put in jail on a lie trying to do right are you with me you think well if I do everything right it's just going to be a Bed of Roses yeah but they got thorns amen yeah there'll be roses along the way but there's going to be a lot of thorns in that too are you with me I mentioned Joseph again he almost achieves and he's now made you know again he's not just set back in bitterness but he reaches toward the promise even when he's in prison and he becomes the head of the prison if God placed me here I'm going to excel while I'm here that ought to be your attitude Wherever You Are Amen in your walk with God you ought to say wherever I am God's going to excel right here until God moves me higher I'm gonna be faithful now here again you know it looks like it's man it's just going to come to pass you know what my brothers will get down here to Egypt and and I'll tell you what will happen that you know they will they will uh um they will surely see me um because you know my brothers are Scallywags they'll get in prison down here and they'll get thrown in jail and when they do well they'll see me I'll be the head of the prisons but God had more for him more did you hear the song More I want more don't be satisfied Where You Are there's more for you stay in his presence but expect more so Joseph was a slave and and now he comes into prison and no matter but no matter how many times he gets pushed down he had to get up again and again and that's what I'm saying to you if you've been pushed down if you've been disappointed get up one more time [Applause] Sarah is saying I'm in the tent there ain't no need for me to get up but God comes to her and say get up I got more plans for you than that baroness and that bitterness and that unbelief I am going to make you a woman of faith [Applause] listen God wants us to be a people who believe in his promise who believes for ourselves that it's just not oh I believe brother Branham could do that and I believe brother Tim could do that or I believe God wants you to end a place where you believe that your prayers means something to God the children of Israel when they was leaving Egypt I'd like to point out to Exodus 3 and verse 21. and I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when you go you shall not go out empty now listen they are again another type another prophecy of an Endtime people they are in their Exodus which they are typing us and in their Exodus what does he say when you go you're not going out of here empty but every woman shall borrow of her neighboring of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and Rhema and you shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and you shall spoil the Egyptians now think about this here they are leaving going to the promised land and they have been slaves 400 years slaves they're great dad their great granddaddy was a slave their great great granddaddy was a slave that's all they knew listen they were full of uh they were victims they were they were full of of slave mentality we'll know we how could we be the people of God how could we ever do anything how could we ever rise above all of this and God said I tell you what when you're going I don't want you going out here looking like slaves [Applause] I want you to call go out of here with the finest the finest garments I want you to go out of here with gold and Raymond and silver and every kind of wealth I don't want you leaving here like you're a victim I don't want you leaving here like you're a slave because today you're no longer a Slave or if that could get in the heart of the pride we're not going to leave out of here as victims and slaves and with the slave mentality but God has made sure to address you in the Garment of his word with gold with silver with abundance with healing with Miracles with signs with wonders Hallelujah with powers of the Holy Ghost and you're not going to leave out of here looking like a bunch of Rejects but by elect my bride My Chosen and you're not a victim anymore and you're not a slave anymore but you're mine mine you look like the King's Daughter Gold Silver and fine Raymond amen the children of Israel had this trip Egypt of their wealth it's doing so they got payment for the years of captivity forever striped to God for all the beatens that they had for all the times that they were misused and abused God made sure they got paid back before they left and no matter how much Satan has abused you no matter what much evil has befallen you God is going to make sure this bride is not going to leave here in a defeated condition but looking and acting address if the Ravens of the Queen of Heaven pay back Satan it is now payday we're gonna we're gonna get paid back for all the evil that you've done for what you did to our bodies so what you get for our children to what you did in our family to what you did to all of it there is coming a great payday all right guess who is Barren when we leave guess who is stripped when we leave guess who is poor when we lead foreign the devil now so you see God wanted them to realize they were not poor and slaves but rich he wanted them to ditch their their slave mentality for a restoration mentality you see they were not going to the land as slaves and vagabonds God wanted them to see themselves in a new light this is why he comes to Sarah she's got to see herself in a new light because right now she's so full of unbelief that when an angel of God announced when Jehovah God himself is standing in front of her telling her what's going to happen she disbelieves in the face of God as I look at this for a moment I want you to think of this like Israel we're going out of here the Bible said they went out with a high hand and what I want to say this how we're going to leave from here we're going out in New Clothes fully dressed in new bodies changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye everything that the devil stole got back again now the last miracle God would do did for Sarah was to make her young again fixing the original problem and in doing that he bypassed the natural processes and to prove it all and I think it's amazing that in the story of Sarah and Abraham and we'll maybe get to it a little later again but uh there is King abimelech once this 90 year old for a wife she is so restored that he wants her womb for his own seed foreign remember this this is the devil this is what he's out to do he wants to see that the womb of Sarah for his own he did this to Eve come on he he done this now to Sarah he's doing it to the church he wants her womb to reproduce himself in there now but you see King abimelech looked at this 90 year old woman and wanted her for a wife she was so made new and so restored that this old woman well-stricken an age she would actually live 37 more years after the birth of Isaac and and and the and razor son Isaac to manhood think of this I mean she didn't just have strength to give forth she had strength to live another almost 40 years raise her son to manhood and and Abraham after his body was now dead that's what the Bible said was so changed that he lived another 75 years and was so full of Vitality at nearly 140 years old that he be got six more Sons even after Sarah's death now how's that for restoration yeah now the first miracle that Jesus did when he began his Earthly Ministry was at a wedding feast we are now at another wedding feast remember brother Branham even tells us America you have been called to a wedding feast and you refuse to come and and so again they at the wedding Feast that Jesus went to they ran out of wine and and when they did Jesus bypass all of nature I want you to think about this you see to bring water into wine he actually bypassed the seed the leaves the vine the grapes in other words the fruit he didn't he didn't wait for the the cluster of Vine of grape to uh cluster grapes to to grow and for the vine to grow up he bypassed a squeezing of the juice the weeks of preparation are processing the wine you see he took water and he bypassed the entire process and took water which would have been lined by coming up through the grapevine into the fruit and mashed out and then made into wine Jesus bypassed that for his first miracle his last miracle I want you to get this he will do the same thing for his bride people he's going to bypass the natural processes you see you see as I quote from Brother Branham he's God you fail to see who he is he's the unchanging God I'm glad I got my faith in him tonight that someday when my body my life my body with his 16 elements will be back in the dust of the earth he will say William Branham and I'll come forth and uh and he will breathe the breath of life into it and say there you are and you'll bypass the birth of my mother and so forth like Jesus on his first miracle he turned water into wine eventually it would have been wine but he bypassed all that procedure and he said turn water into wine and at the resurrection he will not say Mr Mrs Branham get married again and bring forth William he will speak and I'll come forward that's him that he's God that will come for the time he says again word that will be no more sex but God will call his children from the dust of the earth back like there was in the original not to any woman but to the molding of the clay and the cosmic lights and the petroleum he will create again like he did Adam at the first time the last miracle will be like that he did it took water turned to the wine God will do the same thing he will bypass the natural birth process and give you a brand new body we're right here at the last miracle brother Timothy was preaching Wednesday night about along these same lines I felt like it made a good platform and I want to say thank you brother Timothy brother Timothy was sick and he preached when he wasn't feeling good and I want to thank him for laboring for the Lord but you know and he mentioned there about uh the prophet Elisha how he got all out of sorts seeing the son of ahabit come to him along with Jehoshaphat now Jehoshaphat was of the of the one of the kings of Judah and the son of Ahab he was just a scoundrel like his daddy was he was a descendant of Jezebel and it was uh you know he had lived a a a a a a horrible life and had followed the gods of Baal and other gods and and when he come when he come to their remember um they they went to seek the Lord because they had a formidable host out there and they didn't know what to do and Jehoshaphat said let's consult the prophet now I think that's what real true sincere men and Dog Sons and Daughters of God do they want to consult the word what did the word say about this so he goes to the prophet and of course the prophet looks out and he sees that scallywag that son of Ahab there and it makes him mad because he come to his church service I know Rascal like him coming here you know he served other gods he's went and chased this and all kinds of false doctrines and things and now he's going to show up my meeting when he needs help here he comes and it got the prophet out of sorts you can do that in case you didn't know still happens but anyway you know remember the story and brother Branham tells us so well and making the valley full of ditches this was in Shreveport 1956 I happen to be in this in this series of meetings there's a boy about almost two years old in the fairgrounds in Shreveport my family attended there and brother branham's talking about here of what you have to do to prepare for prepare for the promise to be fulfilled I mean he said and they went and got all the music and they first got to play in the music some real good hymn and the first thing you know when the songs returned to Zion when the music and the children began to sing from the heart something takes place a spirit of the Lord come on the prophet and if a real old-fashioned Godly singing repenting would bring the spirit of God on the prophet Dam it would do the same today and notice he wanted to see the way out and the only way they could do it would be a Revival and he had some repentant Sinners that had come in the music played and the prophet saw Vision now let me let me pause for a minute because he said well that's it brother Tim we we need old-fashioned songs for what you don't realize I you know I am a student I do know what I'm talking about what you don't realize is that most of brother branham's old-fashioned songs were written in his generation they were contemporary for the time they were even sang by like you know worldly men like Roy Acuff and and uh you know Dad well I can I can name a lot of different ones and brother Brandon would use those songs and sing those songs and speak of those songs he would take a high on the chart pop song called on the wings of a dove and write a verse to it by the Holy Spirit so you see this was a solid these were songs that were written in his time this is what he's calling old-fashioned this is what he's called because it is old-fashioned you see the music We Sing is old-fashioned to the world it is it is old-fashioned to the world they you see they don't want that kind of the singing Because it brings the spirit of God down what's the Holy Spirit anoint those songs and anoint the people and see the atmosphere get charged to be able to receive the word now in making the valley full of dishes he's ditches he said the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual Revival where the hallelujahs of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an old-fashioned Holy Ghost said your Revival hits the place and then you begin to see things that God will bring to begin to reveal things and you wonder why these real Christians are hanging on while they're praying for you what a Revival and he got in the spirit and that's the reason that these people have dances they didn't have a dance so they could get in the spirit of dancing you can't have a ball game until you get in the spirit of the ball game you got to get in the spirit of it and never can we have a Revival in Shreveport or anyone else until the church gets in the spirit of Revival and then God can perform come and conform Miracles he can show signs and wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and Afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival so our brother Tim that's a problem we don't believe in Revival yeah you don't but God does because this is an hour of restoration Revival amen this is the time where God is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh you want some spirits he says how they begin to move and it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the peoples and the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time they got Atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's in the spirit of the day the people are are in the spirit of the end time the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit and the world is running out yonder and making fun and scoffing and laughing and they're living like the devil every day it's the spirit of the thing so brother Branham tells us it's the atmosphere has got to get right so no wonder we see Sodom all around us no wonder we see evil in the land no wonder there's all of this trouble that's everywhere is because people are actually getting in the spirit of the end time and if you took a glimpse down and Sodom you would see Satan become incarnate in people you wonder how the Hideous crimes are being done in the world today and the insanity that is on the world today it is because the mind of Satan is pressing down and you are seeing people getting so full of the devil that they will mock righteousness and abuse the angels as I said as I said last Sunday Sodom has increased from less than one percent of my generation identifying as homosexuals to nearly one out of four of those who are of Generation Z 18 to 25 and the rest are okay with it it's your freedom to do so while I'm here let me correct something I said because brother EJ corrected me I said one of our school resources officers and Shreveport identifies as a fox now I got that wrong the fox actually signed up as an auxiliary deputy but nevertheless he's not a human he's a fox they're coming in to enforce the laws of the land to pretend that he's protecting us this is a Sodom world that we're living in insanity and let me just repeat again why it is it is because Satan there's actually right now we are in the process as we Ascend Satan is falling as he falls he's incarnated in people until he will become full King of the earth just wait until the bride leaves and I tell you you don't want to be here to find out what I'm saying is right because the evil that you see today is just the tip of the iceberg as to what's coming but brother Branham told us an anointed once at the end time he said first and he said there's three things that lays before us now and I believe these things are prophetic first the world is in his in the Sodom condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion are women trying to act like men are men trying to act like women sissified rotten filthy low-down devil possessed and don't know it amen and the Bible said it would happen and that's where it's at secondly it's an hour according to scripture that Janice and jamaries appears and that's number two and Jenison Damaris are impersonators of the genuine so therefore even in message ranks we have a whole generation of impersonators who are impersonating the Holy Ghost because it raised their hand in a meeting and said they believe on Christ or accept him as Savior and they're impersonating a real Holy Ghost life thirdly it's the same hour the son of man is to being revealed and I'd like to say where he's being revealed in his bride form now why is Sodom increasing because Satan is incarnating himself and we'll advance from the Antichrist to the full embodiment in the false prophet now in the second seal brother Branham said in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate the red dragon himself oh my can't you see it he is Incarnate in his people then he's got his people Bound by his power the false prophet has prophesied them right into them give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and to be damned by it denying the word with a form of godliness now this of course is why you want to be careful who you're listening to because they can prophesy you right into the Incarnation of the devil amen and Satan has incarnated himself by education systematic instruction until the sea generation the young adults ages 18 to 25 one out of four have now now identify as homosexuals and we're hearing constantly it's become it's become quite regular a drag queen shows in our public schools for little kids and how much more delusional can the world get right here in this in the Commonwealth of Virginia there are State lawmaker is who are wanting to introduce a bill making it a crime for parents not to affirm their LGBT child and this meal will expand the state's definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents and the Guardians who will not affirm their LGBT children so there again they are they are fortunate remember the marking of the Beast will be forced in the end time brother Branham calls these side of the laws amen a school in San Diego is left reading and writing the arithmetic to host what is called a family friendly Halloween drag queen show and the event was sponsored by no less than a local San Francisco gender gender reassignment surgery center in collaboration with popular a popular gay nightclub these people have an agenda our Educational Systems are now filled with groomers and activist pimps Decades of parents of public school education have indoctrinated many of today's parents where they feel like this is okay the offices of the U.S government is filled with homosexuals and transgenders and the nation has ceased from freedom of religion promoting now freedom from religion and with the Incarnation of Satan comes the mind and the thinking of Satan and Satan is pressing down and forcing himself upon the world that we're living in fortunate by Sodom laws amen all in the name of freedom you see Satan has had 6 000 years of a perversion which now has climaxed into a time of Satan's Eden Satan's Eden has been created by bringing all the times of perversion uh the keeping up of all the sins of the past all the days from the days of Noah all the way down um where the man's mind was on evil continually until the days of Sodom were it was the ultimate a perversion localized in a couple of cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and now the now it is now climaxed into a Sodom world it's no longer a local place whether you can just be out in the desert like Abraham was and be far removed from it but it's right there in your neighborhood in your workplace in your schools it's there in the colleges it's everywhere and Satan's got an agenda and that is to take over your thinking and to produce an attitude or an atmosphere of unbelief in your life you see a word that it becomes a conglomerate of sin and evil keeping up all the sins of all generations it's now keeping up every demon power now congregate in itself in this last day as Darkness makes its final stand first Peter 5 and 8 says for us to be sober that means to be serious to be vigilant to be on guard because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion an impersonator he's not a roaring lion the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the lion of the tribe of Judah but he goes as a roaring lion you know very religiously walking about seeking whom he may devour and then he says whom resists steadfast into faith I want you to notice you are to be resistors constantly pushing out the mind and the thinking of Satan and his predominant views that he wants to press upon this world you see listen I've seen it even among our young people I've seen I message youth get up and defend defend the the black matters movement defend which is a homosexual agenda by the way defend a homosexual lifestyle defend abortion on demand young people who's supposed to believe the message raised in the message church but their minds have been taken over and we've got to guard against it and resist it amen now listen where brother Brandon placed the scripture he said he said that here in the beginning ending of the Gentiles dispensation he said the Bible said in the last day that Satan would go about like a roared line he's gathered together all of his enemies all his friends our enemies and congregating them together keeping under one big head the mark of the beast in the ecclesiastical Realms that kind of federates our churches all the year 19 and making themselves a great organization the same as Catholicism and the world Empires are uniting themselves together forming up a big head um there in the political Realms called communism and the life of God is pressing on now I want you to get this because he said they're congregating like a roaring line and people are actually being pushed into this very trap of Satan where that they are receiving the mind and the thinking of the Beast are you with me but the same time the life of God is pressing on so when you're we're preaching here about Sarah and God appearing at the same time Satan is there in a civilization and he's bringing about an agenda there against righteousness against Holiness and again it's not one city it's the whole world now the pressures of the age become so hard against a Believer to keep you from the revealing of the hour brother Branham said himself he said well you know why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's a father trying to reveal this great mystery to you but you keep letting so many other things keep you from it amen and then he goes on and starts naming some of the things that keep people from it but Satan's doing everything he can to keep the bride out of the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen but the life of God is pressing against that because there has to be a people whose hearts are changed whose mind is set on God who believed the word whose seeds at work I know that there's something happening in them it may be invisible yet but it's happening now the pressures of this age presses so hard against the Believers to keep you from the revealing of the hours to drive the spirit of Christ from you and he does it in the Unseen realm and he uses tools of the scene realm to keep you out of the presence of the angel he comes with his evil AIDS but I want you to understand he has no part in US John Chapter 14 verse 30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and he had nothing in me how many could say that today the prince of the world is come he's here we're creating a Sodom with all his evil but he doesn't have a part in my life I'm not a part of that he I ain't giving him my mind I ain't giving him my heart I'm not giving him my faith come on Amen I am standing there on the promise of God he comes with his music but there's nothing in me to feed on that he comes with his money his women his popularity but he have found no place in me I cannot be bought I cannot be compromised amen I cannot be lured away amen but there is nothing in me I'm saying take this whole world but just give me Jesus Hallelujah now Jesus said in Luke chapter 22 verse 53 when I was dated with you in the temple you stretch Fortune no hand against me but this is your hour and the power of Darkness now I want to point out something because this is prophetical because as the bride leaves from here and the crucifixion of the word has taken place it becomes his hour and the hour of the power of Darkness this is our word Darkness Reigns and Jesus said when I was daily with you in your temple you stressing up with no hand against me but now this is your hour and the power of Darkness so there comes again Satan's hour and his power of Darkness as he comes now to Incarnate himself in a people in this end time now we are in a spiritual squeeze a persecution a press upon the mind of man that is designed to keep you from giving preeminence to the word of God this was Sarah she was so pressed upon she was so she was so embittered the days the toil the long the length of time had at War upon her and hear all of the pressures there had come upon her and she was not given preeminence to the word she was not given preeminence to the word to the to God that was right there in the inner midst that was calling her name that was identifying her in a promise and even with the identification she's still unbelieving no I want you to know we are in a spiritual squeeze a persecution a press a press upon the minds of men that is designed to keep you from giving the word of God its proper place in your life now letting off the pressure brother Branham talks about how that this has become a neurotic age and everybody's built up hadn't got any time that builds up a place to or that it breaks up things it causes people to have a hard feelings as they snap off and say things you didn't mean to say he said everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty you're all guilty so the pressures of this age can actually cause us to do things that are wrong that are really the result of the pressure on us rather than the result of God on us this is Sarah now so you see there's an excess pressure he said build up today you're under excess pressure every age has had its burdens every ages had its problems but this is a proud day where all is sinned heats up against this generation you are not just facing a few things you're facing all the tactics of the enemy that he has learned for six thousand years and he's coming directly against you press it on you trying to keep you from believing and brother Brandon said I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing it's the devil and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand the Bible said that the devil go about like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you'll make decisions that you wouldn't do if you'd sit down and thinking over so it's not so much a physical press or squeeze that won't come until Satan becomes full of King of the earth and then there'll become a persecution but right now the great burden of the last age is a pressure of riches self-living nervous tensions in the complex age that we seem unfit to live in so why is this press this is what I want to ask you then why why is all of this Satan coming down into this age why is it all of this heaping up and congealing together and mixing together and coming together why is this press because it is the dawning of a new day come on Sarah when you thought it couldn't get any worse it did when your condition progressed to where it was impossible it did when it got so dark you can't believe anymore it's dead you thought oh you know I I wrestled with this in ages Pastor days past but it gets worse unbelief is coming in harder than ever but why is this press it is because it is the dawning of a new day and light is pressing against the darkness this is why it's congealing and coming together and getting darker and darker and darker because there is light that has come to an end-time people Hallelujah who are not of this present world who are not of this present Darkness but they are light in the Lord somebody help me preach amen they are looking upon the face of the mighty angel with the full countenance of the Sun in whom there is no Darkness or Shadow attorney with every type every Veil being taken away to see him in his fullness and it presses the darkness now in Abraham's day Satan has been pushed and darkness had congealed and pressed in a place called Sodom today it's a Sodom world but I want you to know the light is coming on you can't put it back when the Sun rises and it begins and on the darkness is there you know and it starts coming forward with light and Progressive you can't rewind the clock you can't turn it back into darkness and when this light is coming this day and hour there is no way Satan in all his forces can put light back in a box Hallelujah this light is bringing a new day a dawning of a new day to believe us and Sarah this is not Satan's hour this is your hour this is not just the hour of Darkness but this is the hour of light and light is pressing the darkness brother Branham said and the great darkness is swinging over the earth now is nothing but to declare the light is pressing its way down Hallelujah I don't know about you but there's already been a prophet in this day that ran up to the height of the mountain and saw the rise into the sun amen you you remember the story of the slave son when they were down in the valley and the light wouldn't shine down there but on a certain day at Sunrise they would be free and so but down in the valley it wouldn't come till about 12 or 1 o'clock in the day where the sun got over the mountain so there was some young men that run up to the top of the mountain amen that when the sun came up amen they looked over there and said here it comes it's risen a man that they shouted down to the next one hey the Sun is up he is risen you're free you may not have seen the light yet but you're free anyhow the light is up I tell you there's a prophet came in this day when all the wages are top of the pyramid and he saw the light coming and he declared Salam peace it's the dawning of a new day and there ain't nothing the devil can do to stop it that light will press the doctors back to his place and he got up to the top of the mountain and said it is the rising of the Sun Hallelujah Shalom good morning church it's no longer a night the evening light has come Hallelujah and the evening light it dispelling the darkness this great darkness is swinging of the earth now is nothing but declare the lightest person its way down when death is hanging so close that it could be in an hour one hour from the from now the world could meet its death you know that's true look what Russia is claiming look a lot of how Iran is racing look at all the listen they said we're closer to nuclear destruction than we have been and now now since the other Roman Catholic President was in we're closer now to Doomsday than we've ever been amen and he said death is hanging so close it could be within an hour one hour from now the world could meet its death if death is hanging that close what is it doing it's life life is coming Hallelujah it ain't all bad news the good news is the sun shining good the good news is it is the rising of the sun amen the good news is a man arise in China for thy light has come and this Glory shall be seen upon you Hallelujah little Bride come on Sarah don't you realize his glory the glory of the revealed word is starting on the people in this hour Awakening the bride to the to the realize I'm no longer the victim I'm the victor I'm no longer defeated I am the defeater I am a serpent Bruiser Hallelujah devil defeater amen I am here I've been called in this age to cast Satan down the prince of the world has come he offered me everything but he had no part in me there's a people on Earth today that can say he offered us everything but nothing he offered we walked we want Jesus let him stay let his presence abide let me get more of him [Applause] he said what is this death coming so close the Resurrection the Easter for all of God's children is hanging low and is pressing Hallelujah these are for All God's Children is hanging low and it's pressing the angels are coming down the great holy spirit is moving in darkness has taken its last toll for the light will soon be here Christ will come the joy the hope of the ages a real Resurrection for all believers for we will share with him in his resurrection as we have shared with him and his suffering he that suffers with me shall reign with me we're in the time dimensions are blending Angels coming down into this dimension seven angels in the cloud declaring declaring that the seven thunders of Revelation 10 are now revealed the voice of God speaking out the Seven Seals being made known that's the hour we're in amen we're we're in the we're in the hour where that Angels come without a door open and walk right through the door where the pillar of fire is seen Among Us this is where we are the Holy Spirit moving down Angels coming in and darkness is taking its last toll for the light will soon be here Christ will come to Joy of the hope of the ages oh think of this even dimensions are blending hallelujah it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity the dead in Christ are closer to this Dimension than they ever have been are you with me this is where we are in time where that they can almost be felt Hallelujah and soon they will be seen and when they are seen we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the winds have changed Angels coming down when I think about the Angels holding the whims of war and strife until the Servants of God are sealed in their forehead you realize before he concealed 144 thousand he has to seal the last Gentile into the kingdom did somebody catch that I hope that didn't go over your head let me just say it again you see the angels are holding the Winds of War and strife the Bible said it they hold the Four Winds of the Earth winds represent war and strife and he's holding them back you see it would have destroyed it back when I was a little boy in the mission and the and the Cuban Missile Crisis amen it would have destroyed come on the window destroyed the Earth and when it is flooded all right you know are you with me for a moment what what year was that brother Timothy where brother Doug Baker talks about living in North Carolina and there are a nuclear weapon actually crashed into the ground right near the base and there are would have wiped out the whole East Coast but there were Angels there holding it back why didn't Christ come in 1963 some say he did well he didn't sure he revealed himself in the word but and there was a word coming to Christ but it wasn't his physical return are you with me amen but why did he come then when the book was opened and the Seven Seals revealed because there were more names written on the Lamb's Book of Life that had not been manifested on Earth [Applause] Hallelujah the message had to go out and catch some of you some of you were out in sin and worldliness and everything else wasn't ready for the coming of the Lord but God wasn't going to leave one of his behind so he's been holding back the limbs of strike and laws he's been holding it back until he steals the Servants of God in their forehead that's the Jews and they're all back to Israel now waiting there for their ceiling time but he had to seal the Gentile in first so he held it back not just for Jews but for you Hallelujah amen and when the last one comes in the Angels gonna let some things fly amen now so you said brother Brandon said there's darkness that is pressing in now watch you got to recognize darkness when it's coming in see there seems to be something wrong among men men don't seem to be have that masculine touch that he used to have women don't have that feminist touch she used to have you men today you take men today they don't seem to be Burly like they used to I I happen to see a clip there was a song that come on that I I liked and it came up and I happened to be on Facebook and saw this song come up that I wanted to hear it was a gospel song and I listened to that singing next thing come on and here's this guy and he comes on he looks like about coming 50 45 50. and he's complaining about adult bullying and he said I went into a hardware store and he said I had these shorts on and he points down he's got these little mini shorts on and they're all flowery and you know full of all the multicolors and whatever and so these men come in a truck and they got out and everyone looked like rough men and they had beards and and and whatever looked like you know Hillbillies and whatever and they began to Snicker at me you know and then he goes on this whole race you see like a woman would on Facebook about this bullying that's gone on in in America today you know when I can't even wear my shorts into without somebody making a crude remark you know you because you see they don't have men don't have that masculine touch anymore the first thing you know that God this little bracelet on and you know got a little necklace on and you know an ear ring or two or you know some some kind of effeminate ways Amen brother Brandon said men don't seem to be Burly like they used to and I want to just say something to you women you know I know you think it's cute for your little boy to be set up in his little in his little shorts and you know dressed up in his little ways and and and a little cute and you you did them that way when they were young but I'm telling you you need to treat your teacher young man how to be men not a feminate and I've seen mothers that actually pushed out on their kids and of course when they grow up the next day you know they're still wanting to wear those cute little shorts you see they want brother Bradley said they don't need they don't seem to be Burly like they used to be they want to wear suede shoes with purple they want to act like women and it seems more like a perversion a woman wants to cut off her hair act like a man man wants to act like a woman and yet you talk to them they're nice people to talk to nice people friendly sociable people what's caused this it is gross Darkness upon the people it is something that pressed them into it but I want you to know friends that ain't us your light has come and it's come from the Eternal Realms and Eternity is now shining into this Dimension the glory of the revealed word has risen and the pillar of fire has returned and is working Among Us healing Our Sick casting out Devils filling Sons and Daughters of God with the spirit light and darkness is here all at the same time light pressing the darkness forcing or gathered together the fortune of religion and politics until they will actually Crown Satan as king now brother Branham says the difference is just like it was at the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the Earth and the spirit of God moved upon the waters said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness and I believe we're now living in that hour again where God is separating light from Darkness right there amen he'll come right down even even in the church and he'll separate light from Darkness make sure you don't join with Darkness and that's the reason why he said and God is pressing it to the other side of the world the light might be manifest then the then the church the reason I say shalom to them is because it's God's peace that's what I want to bring to you this morning for the new year not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there's something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy we've looked forward to depressing coming of the great light and now we see it breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from an Earthbound sickness and a troubled world to bright and sunny day of an immortal life an immortal body and a mortal Earth that can never pass away it's shalom to the church now it's light time coming from the believer but across Darkness upon the people so even as we see Satan incarnating himself even so God is now incarnating himself in a people moving from justification to sanctification unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost until the Incarnation of God into his people when God incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in that person think of that Satan taking on flesh and at the same time God is taking on flesh I don't know about you but I don't want my flesh yielded to the devil I've seen the wreckage that brings I've seen the herd and the harms and the confusion and the trouble that brings I want to yield myself to God say Lord come and incarnate yourself in me come step down inside of me come live and dwell in me come move in my life come change me from bitterness to believing again from Faith from doubt unto faith you know God pouring out a spirit upon All Flesh now not in one flesh this is where the problem is men are now looking up for another one to rise you know they want to Crown the he'll be the Messiah he's going to be the one that leads the bride in and people won't accept him oh so he becomes in the rejected Christ that's nonsense you see again it's not it's not that anymore all one-man scriptures has been fulfilled it's a body Ministry it's a body move amen where God is coming in flesh in bright form God walking and talking and dwelling among his people this is what God's doing now and because of him the atmosphere is changing now what happens what are we trying to do what are we want in an evening like Tabernacle you see we've got to be a people of the right atmosphere because in the atmosphere Sarah was in she would never bring forth that promised son she was in the wrong atmosphere so in order for us to bring Jesus back to Earth the last one's got to come in so we got to have the right atmosphere in the church where that God can come and fill newborn babes in Christ with the holy spirit amen an atmosphere where there can be healing because if there is no Divine Healing there's no change in the body amen we've got to have every promise manifested in our lives not just part of them so you see we've got to create an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can move we're newborns can be birthed into the kingdom where we can bring Isaacs the church has got to bring it forth now so you see it doesn't matter if it's a word written in the scripture and I'm closing on this words written in the scripture it's got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit no matter how much you read it even the message no matter how much and even even a vision no matter how much a vision has spoke the word it's got to be received in the atmosphere for that to take to cause a faith to come in you you can't just get the visions of well I believe well God's Gonna God's gonna do this for me you've got to do more than that you've got to open your heart to it you've got to come to the point that you no more scorning at the promise so well if you don't come in a certain time I don't even want it anymore no I want it it doesn't matter when it comes if God you gave a promise I want it if God said I can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want it if God said I can have Divine Healing I want it if God said the church can be on fire for God I want it I want the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost the atmosphere we're the word of God can be manifested God bless you will you stand together with you can have genuine seed you can even be genuine seed seed Gene of God wheat all the way I can hold in my hand grains of wheat and it's got life in it but you'll never know it until he gets in the right atmosphere you can have really seed of God oh yes names on The Book of Life for the Lambs from the foundation world but if there's no atmosphere for it thank you that see will lay dormant you can have scripture theology truth message and without the spirit on it it'll never make manifest you see Sarah knew all these things intellectually but our atmosphere had to be changed I'm saying to you today look at your atmosphere of your life your creator yourself you can create an atmosphere let the Holy Spirit do it work in you and produce a creation of attitude of receiving from God so there's a change in your life to your new creature in Christ that it changes your vocabulary this takes out that I can't to I can that Lord I don't care when it comes I just want it I'm not going to make any kind of deals I I ain't gonna make some requirements well if you don't come when I want it Lord it's coming prepare my heart oh God do something like you did for Sarah come down and call my name speak to me it means something when your name gets called sometimes the other day on Saturday I'll just tell you this I was suffering so bad with my feet they were burning so bad I was in tears I was back in the back rubbing them I couldn't come out in time because I couldn't stand I couldn't stand it even I had my shoes on I had my socks off brother Ron was back there with me he was going to preach I put my shoes and socks back on and came back out here and sat down and at the end of the service I said Lord about my way it would just means something to me you just called my name you speak to me Lord It's a spark of faith in my life and no more and I got that prayer out he began to pray for me and my feet it didn't all go away for one moment but every day it got a little less until in two weeks I haven't had that burning anymore I want you to start expecting your American I want you to start expecting healing for your family I want you to start expecting the prodigals to come home I want you to start expecting God to move I want you to expect him to call your name and say it's for use I'm coming by your way I'm calling you out I'm calling your name now believe sister Eliana Mr Ellie that's good mom and dad come down with her that's wonderful see these children worshiping God I've got videos of some of them some of the winners grandchildren brother Tim's little grandkids he sent them to me like a proud Pop-Pop [Music] showing his little daughter's worshiping God loving him that's what we want we want an atmosphere where it can birth sons and daughters and God can prepare people for his coming little sister Ellie she wants the Lord to come in her life she's invited him now she wants to take on his name you know you may not realize it but you heard your name called the other day God become personal to you that's what it is is when God becomes personal to you when he speaks to you for your need Amen brother Aaron come pray with me of the Timothy lead in the song let's just Worship the Lord together will you change my

don't turn it back it's the Lord this is wonderful to see one of our young people there surrendering their heart to the Lord and so I'd say young age brother Tim well when I first gave my heart to the Lord I was five so I guess God can do that don't you I believe the Lord can save our young people and before they go out and live an awful life of sin you know there's always all kinds of testimonies there's many testimonies I was a sinner I was in drugs and alcohol prostitution all that all the things that we don't want our children to have to go through you know and that can be a testimony in a great testimony but I think as great a testimony as the Lord kept me Raise Me Up in a Christian family and taught me the right way and when I was a young age I gave my heart to the Lord and I think that can be your testimony too I think that's just powerful a testimony as those that says well I was the Hell's Angels or I was drunkard I was dope or I was you know this horrible sin and but yet God Saves us no matter who we are and all of us needed a savior because we were born wrong to begin with that's why we have to be born again so God did that for for us to provide a second birth because our first birth was wrong and we were birthed into sin so Jesus taught us you must be born again so we bring Ellie here to the Lord today and you know if you slide this way just a little bit sweetheart and Ellie has gave her heart to the Lord and you know in the meetings he was so blessed and God just did a miraculous work in her life and I believe that he'll continue that because I believe that he that begun the good work in you will perform it to the day of Christ so you know whatever steps you make with the Lord God will take you even further you may have made certain steps with the Lord and but you know I believe he'll finish it and if he hadn't finished it in you I believe he will and so just keep pressing toward him with all your heart now Sister Ellie the Lord Jesus sent another Tim to the world called him at a young age and you know when I was about your age I already knew I was called to preach already making plans to minister the gospel of Christ at 11 years old you're about 11 aren't you at your age I asked my mother and dad for a Bible with my name on it and the new suit at 11 years old for my 11th birthday because I believe that God was calling me to the ministry I wouldn't preach till I was 15. but yet even then I knew the Lord had put something on my heart and God can deal with you and work with you as a young person and he has and it's for this reason you're in the water today so he sent me here in this end time to preach the gospel and he commanded me in his word that those who believed and followed him that I was to baptize them that believed in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost so in obedience to that Divine command that God made and gave me in the Bible I baptized you my beloved sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord praise the Lord Amen in God good for us and that's why we praise him that's why we sing that's why we [Music] Bow Down and Worship this king or he gave his everything yes he gave is it everything he came to live live a perfect life he came to be the Living Word I like he came to die so we'd be reckons he came to rise to show his power [Music] everything yes he gave everything he came to live live again to be our concret King and friend he came to him and so the loss was his love he came to go prepare a place for us [Music] everything that's why we bow down worship this King foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
