humbly in your presence knowing Lord that you know all things you're the great creator of heavens and earth desired that you could have fellowship with man and you set aside your Priestly garments and your kingly robes came down into Mankind and bridged a gap and made a way that we could have fellowship with you Lord there's nothing that we can bring of ourselves but just yield to you Lord say Have Thine Own Way Lord Have Thine Own Way Thou Art the Potter and we are but the clay mold us and make us Lord into your image into your likeness Lord tonight we've come and to the house of God where you would come and speak words of life and your word would come forth and those that are bound could be delivered and those that have come bearing burdens Lord those burdens could be cast down at your feet and they could walk out without the Yoke of bondage Lord but taking your yoke Lord that is easy for your burden is light Lord you've made a way where there is no way and we thank you for that this evening Lord those that have come back from the camp meetings in Ohio and Lord may be a little bit weary in body but so rejoicing in the spirit of God that is just so uncommon made yourself real

down a stake setting another anchor Lord where you have met them the promise of God in their lives Lord we come this evening asking that you take the man of God our brother Aaron Oglesby Lord we know him as a man and we love him as a man but there's the god behind the man that we so desire to hear from this evening take the words that you've inspired to his heart and may it be bred to us Lord may

one Lord those that are sick and have a need of you this evening may they Reach Out And Touch the Hem of your garment we pray in faith believing that you are a God who has promised that you would not

wonderful you know if we can come making him our everything making him our Focus laying aside everything and we spoke last time on the power of one mind and getting in one mind and one Accord and we'll kind of continue that a little bit you know I was thinking about it even at the at the meetings this weekend there in Ohio how you get that many people together and they come with one purpose and with one mind and it's about it's about God and it's about getting closer and it's about getting more and you see what takes place when people get in that Unity of mind and when they come thinking God you're my everything God you're my savior God You're My Healer God I just need more of you and in those moments and in those times there's a breakthrough and what we have to recognize within each and every one of us even as individuals is that we have a lot to do with whether or not there's a breakthrough in a service you have a lot to do with what happens to other people in a service so we can't come to a church service and be selfish I don't feel good I'm not in a good mood I'm working through something I'm upset I don't care people around you need you to enter in people around you need you to create an atmosphere there's people whose souls are hanging in the balance and you're creating an ice cube right there on your Pew and not allowing the spirit to break out in that spot and I hate to say it but there will be accountability for it because there's so only so many opportunities we get let's give him our everything tonight let's give him our all tonight let's just push through any feeling of tiredness any weariness let's remember why we're here hey before we go to the word I would just like to just briefly just say how proud that that I was of our young people this weekend and and even in in the travel the way they act and conduct themselves on the bus the way they conduct themselves in truck stops and restaurants along the way the way they conduct themselves at camp that they do evening light Tabernacle very very proud and I think we should give them a hand this evening they are an awesome group they are an awesome group but that don't happen by accident awesome parents an awesome church family that they're part of we thank each and every one of you and it was a wonderful Camp I'd also like to tell you I mean all the ministry was great but just to to brag on our own brother Timothy was just absolutely over the top this weekend above and beyond the Lord just came down and blessed and he did us proud it was just an awesome thing to be a part of and a little bit weary but we're glad to be back we're excited to be here so with that being said let's let's pray before we go to the word Heavenly Father Lord with all our hearts we just want to say thank you Lord thank you for this opportunity thank you for this church Lord thank you for each Soul gathered here Lord Jesus Lord thank you for what you did this weekend at the Youth Camp Lord the the lives that were touched the lives that were changed forever Lord even getting texts today Lord from Brother Tom there in Ohio talking about his ten-year-old granddaughter getting the Holy Ghost and Lord my own daughter receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the different ones Lord that traveled up and that God did things Lord tremendous things and Lord we will forever be grateful but tonight we say Lord we know you're an I am God and we need you to speak to us tonight Lord May the things that started this weekend made those fires Lord just be built up and get stronger Lord and fed Lord till they're just roaring and blazing in the lives of of the young people Lord but Lord that don't excuse us may the fires and the lives of us Lord each and every adult the old the younger life may they be roaring Lord with the Holy Spirit on the inside of us father giving you our everything and every opportunity Lord come and speak now Lord take control of this service I pray Lord that all things will be said and done for your glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen we want to look into the book of Psalms Psalms 133 and 1. Psalms 133-1 we're going to continue a little bit on the kind of along the same lines that we spoke on last time we were speaking on the power of one mind and we were talking about one mind and one Accord tonight I want to speak on fighting for Unity fighting for Unity and it may be a little bit of a Sunday school lesson type tonight I had other things that I thought I was going to study out and Minister but you know the Lord's just really been specifically dealing with our church in a certain way these last few services and and the one that brother Joe preached right before we left was just incredible on forgiveness and that was an amazing service and we spoke about one mind and one Accord and now fighting for Unity the Lord just wanted me to go down this this line tonight so we're going to obey him it says behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the Dew of Herman and as the Dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore amen you may have your seats we just pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the reading of the word like we said last time we were we were preaching on on on on the power of one mind and as and as we focus then on one mind and one Accord and and we're going to continue like I said today and and look at at fighting for Unity fighting for Unity we all know that that Unity is not something that has ever really come easy for man ever since the fall it's not easy to be in perfect Unity even with those that you love the dearest and love the most and people that you would give your life for sometimes you can't hardly dwell in unity because we all have different Natures we all have different things that make us tick different things that get on our nerves different things that make us happy and we're all different people different individuals and so Unity isn't really something that comes easy it is something that we have to fight for um and our history of humanity has been constant division constant fighting constant quarreling and that's why I down through history when you see times of unity it tends to be something that catches your eye when you study history it tends to be moments in history that People Unite for a common cause those moments really tend to stand out and it's usually in these times in history where great things are accomplished when people come together in unity that's during the time that you'll see great Innovation or you'll see great advancements or or times of unity bring Liberation or even the births of Nations because people were able to lay aside their differences long enough to unite together and fight for a common goal all right but it only takes a very short time it seems after that goal is reached and suddenly that commonality begins to wear off and suddenly the strength that came from that begins to deteriorate and once again people are right back to bickering and fighting and their disagreements and things of that nature you know just to give you a couple examples of this I was looking through at different Empires and different things and and I got to looking at Rome and how they United the world under one great Empire and at that time probably the greatest Empire that had ever been and it was because they all had the attitude that this is for the glory of Rome there was no one in it for the glory of themselves there was no one in it to build their own Empire everything they did was for the glory of Rome and because of this suddenly education spread to the world there were architectural and Engineering Marvels Road systems were built that were so intricate they're better than the roads that are currently in Shreveport still to this day and I don't okay that really wasn't a compliment was it but they built Road systems so intricate that even today it's a well-known saying that all roads lead to Rome it's something people said there were codes of law that served as the foundation for modern law literature literature spread like wildfire the very calendar we use and things like that were developed during this time medicine and and medical advancements developed in this time but over time it became less and less about Rome and more and more about individuals more and more about power about who would be in charge and who would get the credit for this Victory and and which politician was a was going to be the most powerful and which general was going to be the greatest and who would carry the most influence and even though Rome was eventually invaded by Germanic tribes the most historians will agree that the fall of Rome was due to division amongst themselves the division that crept in and became about individuals instead of about the greater good of the Empire we can look at our own Nation a nation of colonists a nation of farmers poor people without much weapons just little malicious but United against the greatest nation in the world they birthed the new nation they they got United at this idea of Liberty and this idea of freedom and they stood together and they laid aside their differences and they fought in unity and they won one of the most astounding victories in history but you only have to go a couple Generations later and there's a civil war ripping the very Nation apart that they fought in unity to buy but suddenly just a couple Generations later there's a civil war in the Nations being torn apart yeah there's been other times down through history just in my life that I can remember where Unity has brought what we would call maybe bounces in patriotism I remember being 10 or 11 years old 1991 when Desert Storm took place and and all of a sudden everybody was proud to be an American again and and they were United against the common enemy you know everybody had signs in the yard God bless our troops you know and things like that and then that Fades away and then 9 11 happens and there for a short period of time we had a common enemy again and suddenly everybody was proud to be American again and yet then that Fades away and there was a time where a message came and struck this Earth and we were all just proud to be called out proud to be in the message proud to know that God sent a prophet proud to know that we were called proud to know that we were chosen but over time what has happened some of that has all slipped away and it's about when my church says this and my church says that and I don't see it like this and I don't see it like that listen I think Unity is something worth fighting for I think we should still be proud we should still put our arms around one another we should still love our brother and sister thank God you've heard the call thank God you've been called out thank God there's a Rapture for you thank God there's a Rapture for me and let our Unity Never Fade like like those natural things do amen United for a time period we were United in our commonality and not divided by our differences I'll think about this right here United in our commonality and not divided by our differences even like Tabernacle that's what I long to see and I believe that that's exactly what God longs to see it's where we're United by what we have in common and not torn apart by our differences United against a common enemy let me remind you you are not my enemy I am not yours your wife is not yours your kids nobody else is your enemy your enemy is the devil my enemy is the devil and if we will unite in the commonality of that and focus our our our our Warfare against him and quit fighting one against the other we will be an invincible Army if we'll focus that when we become United against one enemy United under the blood United under this message an invincible Army marching to Onward Christian Soldier if Nations and people can do Mighty powerful things in the natural when they become United what about the Bride of Jesus Christ in the spiritual when we become United I tell you we would do more than build roads and Science and education but the kingdoms of hell would be torn down prison bars would come open there would be healings and deliverances there would be refillings of the Holy Ghost if we would just unite one against the other I'm telling you the Rapture would get here a lot quicker sometimes we think we're waiting on God we're waiting on God and he's waiting on us to get into place because the scripture says that the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride hath made herself ready we gotta quit fighting against each other and shooting against each other and realize we're in this together I need you you need me and let's love one another through our differences and go to war with the Devil amen what might we do my belief we would see the sick healed every service because there's power in unity there's strength in unity there's victory in unity when we all get in one Accord when we all get United for the same goal and against the same entity enemy I believe that heaven's open and Hell shakes hey man I believe that with all my heart God comes down and chains begin to fall off lives are changed and great advancements happen great advancements happen when the church comes in unity in one mind and one Accord not just things of temporary not just natural but Eternal advancements in the lives of men and women and in the lives of our children so as we say all this and we recognize the power of unity guess what the devil hates Unity he hates Unity and he's always coming to try to break apart our Unity with jealousy With Envy with Strife listen sometimes it ain't none of that sometimes it's just with with personality differences listen we've covered this before we're going to cover it again it's okay if you don't like people it's not okay if you allow that to hinder spiritual things we're not all going to hang out I don't know why we're here again but we're going to talk about it this is just annoying me I'm gonna go ahead and move it I just noticed it we're not all going to be best buddies we're not all going to think every single person in here is the awesomest person because that wouldn't work mathematically that's not possible but we can lay aside our differences that's what I get out of the book of Acts when you see there are some buses and you see some quarrels and you see some disagreements that's not what I focus on I say isn't it awesome that they were so different had such different ideas and yet for the for the gospel's sake for the cause of Christ for the cause of the Holy Ghost breaking out in people's lives for the cause of Salvation they were willing to lay those things aside and be mature enough to walk on and March on and fight together in unity against the enemy and not make one another their enemies he tries to tear up Unity with backbiting with the tongue we're not going to have time to get into it today but man as I said I studied a lot of James 3 this week and it's all about the tongue and it says some pretty harsh things about the tongue and how evil it is and how no man can tame it and how it's held fire and all kind of things listen we got to be careful what we say if there's that much power in the tongue which the word says they're in why not what says there is why not use it for good why not use it to speak life and speak Victory and speak healing and speak Deliverance listen instead of speaking well that person this and that person that and that person is how about we speak Lord bless them Lord pour it out in their lives Lord help me Lord to love them the way you love them help me to look at that brother the way you look at that brother Lord I speak life in this situation Satan hates Unity think about the beauty and the unity of Heaven and all of its perfection Perfect Harmony it was absolutely perfect and in that setting in that Harmony and in that perfect Unity Satan starts a campaign think about it it couldn't have got any better [Music] it's not like God could have made it better and made Satan happy some folks just ain't gonna be happy no matter what that's why that's why I tell my wife sometimes when when we're looking at reviews like about certain hotels and it's negative negative and I'm like look listen you got to understand certain people are review people and they're generally not happy people now if I go there and it's a terrible hotel that's on me I should have listened to the negative people I should listen but I'm not typically a review guy and I said because some people you just can't make happy but Satan starts a campaign and he starts setting up sides he starts setting up see Satan loves for there to be sides because when there's sides there cannot be Unity when their sides there when there's Unity there isn't sides it's Unity so Satan loves for there to be sides he loves for this one to be against that one he loves for there to be bitterness and he loves for there to be hatred if you don't think that's the case look at the world we live in look around at the world we live in you know he took Jesus up on the mountain he offered him the kingdoms of the world and the reason he could do this he couldn't offer them to me unless they belonged to him they were his so look at the nature of the Kingdom that he rules constant fighting constant choosing sides this cause against that cause this shits you against that issue constant threats constant bickering you know if Jesus ruled over the kingdoms of this Earth we could stack all the weapons right now and never have to worry about it ever again you never have to lock your door you'd never have anxiety you'd never have fear because he's the Prince of Peace and there would be peace upon the Earth you would never have a worry but Satan rules right now in the world we live in is his Eden and it's obvious that it's his because he is the author he's the author of death he is the author of division sides how did he manage to make sides in heaven think about it you think he can't find fault in this church you think he can't find fault in the life of your brother and then put those thoughts in your head you think he can't find fault with the leadership he found enough fault in God that he turned one-third of the Angels against him no notice it was an actual fault because he's blameless but it was in the way that it was presented to the angels that's why we have to guard our ears that's why we have to guard our hearts we have to guard our tongues we have to guard our attitudes and we must have Grace for our brothers and sisters because what he's going to do is he's going to come in and he's going to magnify their faults in your eyes he's going to magnify my faults in your eyes and if I already if you already got a funny feeling towards me then that fault all of a sudden is going to be some huge thing that others may never notice but he's going to make sure you notice he's going to make sure it gets on your nerves he's going to make sure it bothers you he's gonna magnify that person's flaws he's going to twist their words in your mind and if we allow ourselves to dwell there it's where all we see is their fault and we don't have Grace and we don't have mercy and we don't see him the way Jesus sees them and we allow ourselves to dwell there and we dwell on it then what happens it begins to eat at us it begins to eat at us and it begins to canker and then we lend our mind to it and eventually we lend our tongue to the accuser of the brethren and we begin to speak the words that he would speak if he was standing here in a body think about it who am I to speak words of condemnation over one purchase by the blood of Christ grace and mercy for our brothers and sisters and we start using that tongue to tear down and we start using that tone to create sides do we realize look at look trust me then once again I'm in the same boat I was in last time to where I'm preaching to myself because as I was going through this and looking at these things I thought Lord I've been guilty I've been guilty there's a difference in having a conversation about someone listen if you if you know try to go a whole day without somebody's name coming out of your mouth and that and saying things in a negative slant in a negative tone and saying things in a way that people see your side do we realize how childish it is did you hear it's like it's like you're back on the Elementary playground by the monkey bars did you hear well no no no that's not what happened see I heard it straight from them and what really happened was well what they said well whose side are you on who sorry listen I'm going to tell you right now whose side I'm on I'm taking sides with the word I'm taking sides with Jesus where you don't understand who got offended who got upset you know listen I'll tell you what Jesus will fix it well you don't understand how mad he is about this and how Matt listened Jesus will fix it listen we're trying to over complicate things when I'm telling you is just start putting things in the hand of Jesus quit trying to fix everybody's problems quit getting caught up in everybody's issues and just put it in the hands of Jesus and say Jesus you fix me you fix me I know you can fix them and maybe I need a little bit more fixing myself I'm just gonna put it right here in your hands we don't have to get it all figured out we don't have to come to an agreement on the situation we don't have to come to we don't have to we don't have to get to a point where like okay well I see it your way okay we don't ever got to get to that what we got to do is let it go put it in the hands of Jesus and put our arms around one another and love one another and have Unity regardless of where we stand we have to let it go and focus that's the promise we get focused on individuality instead of focus on our common goal and our and becoming United in our purpose listen Unity isn't about all of us being the same that's not Unity Unity is having the same goals the same purpose under the same headship of the same word it's about laying aside the bickering and the rumors and that he said and the she said it's about forgiveness and letting go and focusing on our common purpose what is our common purpose our common purpose is we're gonna win we're gonna Rapture we're gonna make it out of here despite this little thing that you're going through this week I promise you on Rapture day it will matter nothing it will matter none you won't care who said what to who and who thought this and who thought that you're going to say I made it I would this was my goal this was my purpose this is what it was all about [Applause] all right our goal is to have a body change brother Branham says so why just let them go ahead and let's love one another don't fight one another he says as long as the devil's got you fighting one another he don't have to fight at all he will sit back and has a picnic watching you fight one another and laugh at you professing to have the Holy Ghost and fighting one another now I don't want to read too much into it I'm going to let brother Brown say what brother Brown said but he makes it sound like that you're not going to have the Holy Ghost and be fighting one another laughing at you professing to have the Holy Ghost and fighting one another Paul looks at this very thing going on and he says you're all a bunch of children we'll put it in our terms he says you're all a bunch of children I'll read it the way he said it First Corinthians 3 1 and I Brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual but as under carnal even as unto babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able in other words you hadn't got any better this ain't past tense you were a baby and you're still a baby for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying in strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men he says I can't even speak to you like spiritual people but carnal people who worry too much after fleshly things too worried about who is right and who did what to who he says I have to speak to you like babies I can't even give you meat because you can't handle it well bless God I'm a mature Christian I've been serving God 25 years time ain't got nothing to do with it it's like I've heard boys say I can't wait till I turn 18 I'll be a man I'll be man I know a lot of 30 something year old folks that ain't men it ain't got nothing to do with time or how long well I'm mature well that means you have progressed that means you have grown that means you have grown up in the faith and you're not acting like a little child anymore have you grown up are you able to dwell in unity are you able to dwell in unity or does every little thing that pops up somehow stumble you and trip you up think about it here I'm just being real with this do you get caught up in every debate and every argument somehow you know there's some people that they just absolutely love drama and my favorite thing that they say is drama just seems to find me drama ain't never found nobody you're a magnet for it because your spirit feeds on it and you like it because there's some people and you can name them they can go their whole life and never even know drama is going on because they choose not to be in it you are in drama because you love it sorry that's just the truth whether you like it or not drama just finds me no you got a flashlight and you're hunting it them's just look I was too many years in a public school to know is always the same people it didn't matter whose problem it was somehow you end up in it and it ain't cause you're a good listener it just ain't notice Paul calls them babies and then he says why they're spiritual babies because among you there is envying and strife and divisions there is a direct correlation between unity and maturity in Christ you will never find a church torn apart by strife and Indians and jealousies all the time listen let's not act like things don't come I don't care what church I don't care who you are things come okay but if it's a constant thing then that's not a mature church if you're constantly living in drama constantly and backbiting constantly you're not a mature person you're just not there isn't a maturity there but unity and maturity go hand in hand listen it's important that we get to a place that we recognize that maturity is important he's not coming back for a little childlike bride he's not coming back for a bride that's fussing and fighting and arguing and bickering and caught up and all this he's coming back for a mature elect lady he's coming back for one who has made herself ready who has stepped away from all the immaturity and all the baby stuff and all the backbiting and all the Strife who has stepped away from that and said I no longer want a part of that I want to dwell in unity with my brothers I want to dwell in unity with my sisters and I'm going to mature into the place that I'm ready to be in that bride he doesn't want a little girl to marry there's a unity in this bride that can't be found in the world because she's not of this world she's of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace and I'm gonna tell you right now listen to me Unity is worth fighting for Unity is worth fighting for listen we have something special here I know there's a lot of wonderful churches there's a lot of wonderful people but this is where I'm at so this is who I'm talking to we have something very special here lovely people beautiful people who love the Lord and who love one another and like I said I've traveled all over been in a lot of great congregations with great people and yet I've still never found one in my opinion that is as closely knit together as this congregation I love the way we support one another I love the way we support each other in sickness and in Trials I love the way we come together for for young people and for their their graduations and for for their weddings and for that we support our young people I love that I love the way you Fellowship I love the way you worship I love the way you laugh together I love the way you cry together there is a special Unity here but don't think for a minute that the devil is going to allow it to go unchecked without coming and bringing an attack against it and trying to tear it down and tear you apart and I say when you see it come in be willing to stand up and fight against it and say we're going to have Unity we're going to have maturity we're going to stand together we're going to pray for each other we're going to fight for each other We're not gonna fall into those spiritual baby conditions where there's envying and strife and Division Unity is something worth fighting for because Unity brings victory Unity brings the Holy Spirit we dealt with that last time in one mind and one Accord that's what caused him to come down it's worth holding on to because it pleases God listen again to the word of God as he describes the importance of unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head he really cares this much about us getting along and caring and loving and fighting for one another that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the Dew of Herman and as the Dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore now listen to where brother Branham takes and does with this he says and to think that you can come apart and gather like this whereas the psalmist says behold how sweet and pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the anointing goal that was on Aaron's beard that ran to the hymns of His Garment which that anointing oil which you know what the anointing oil done it preserved him to go into the presence of God Unity allows us to go into the presence of God see he had to be Anointed with that old before he went into the presence of God and when Brethren can dwell together in unity it is likened unto that oil when we enter into the presence of the Lord with that anointing of Brethren together in unity oil represents the Holy Spirit he goes on to say no I believe it was said once in the Bible it's another quote how sweet that Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard that run to the hands of his skirt I think there is nothing any more precious than to see a unified people in the spirit of the Lord to be unity all agreeing you know I think the 10 days that they were waiting for the original first outpouring of the Holy Spirit how that must have been a unifying time of the people all in one heart and one according every time now here we go why is it worth fighting for every time that man gets together like that since then the holy spirit always meets with them don't let the enemy get us separated because it's very important that the Holy Spirit meet with us our very lives depend on it we must have the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we must have them in our services we must have him in our home how we can apply what we're talking about to the home there needs to be unity in the home you want the Holy Spirit to meet it needs to be in proper order laid out the way the scripture lays a home out to be but we must have the Holy Spirit meeting with us don't let the devil tear us apart don't let him make us focus on our differences don't let Division and strife begin to come amongst us because instead of that coming amongst us I want the Holy Spirit to come amongst us that is the desire of my heart like I said our lives depend on it our homes depend on it listen who gets hurt the most when there's Division and strife in backbiting in a church listen the old heads ain't going nowhere sorry I hold heads okay I'll join in with you I'll be an old head it hurts the youth it hurts the young people the very lives of our young people depend upon the unity of the church that would allow the Holy Spirit to come in and change their lives and filled them with the baptism of the Holy Spirit the lives of your children are depending on it are you saying that there's not going to be any anything come up in any disagreements come up in the church you know better than that they'll probably be one by the time we all leave this parking lot tonight Humanity what I'm saying is let's lay those things aside and move in the unity of the spirit lay that thing aside and move in the unity of purpose you lay that thing aside and move in the unity of the faith and allow that Unity to completely dictate it dictate how we act how we talk how we think of one another and then when we get to that place where we're laying things aside and we're moving and operating in unity then we will have outpourings in these services that we can't hardly contain then you will have lives changed then you will have healings then you'll have people set free then you have people so full of the Holy Ghost that they get to the place like brother Branham said that the devil don't even know what to do with them Lord let that be me let me get so full of the spirit so full of an outpouring of the Holy Ghost that he don't know what to do with me and not just on Church days but on Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday let me dwell in unity with my brothers and sisters that I might be filled to overflowing huh you know I coached football for 15 years and each team usually had 40 or 50 players on it all those kids from different races different homes different ideas different socioeconomic backgrounds some people on the team were friends some didn't like each other some didn't have many friends some were super popular sounds like any crowd of people you get together but none of that ever mattered when we stepped on the field because we were a team because at that point we had one goal we didn't care where you were from what street you lived on how much money you made we cared about you doing your part to bring victory because we had a goal we had worked too hard to lose we had cooked too many days in 100 degree weather in the blistering Sun preparing for this moment to worry about any of the things that made us different think about it for a minute and my big thing was I really love the way games I love games that were at the other team's field because I would always tell my players in the Huddle I said there is absolutely nothing better then coming on their field and taking it from them there's nothing I like better than to come to the place that they call home that they're comfortable in and absolutely ripping Victory from them right there and I'll tell you later see you don't worry me none listen I ain't worried about it no because it may be his eating it may be his home field it may be where he's comfortable but I'm telling you we're gonna win we may be the away team this ain't our home field but we're coming to win we're coming to be victorious we're going to take our children and go we're going to take our healing and go we're going to take our body change and go we're going to take our Rapture and go I don't care where we fight we'll fight them on land we'll fight him on see we'll fight him in the air we'll fight him and layer to see ya but we're gonna get a victory and we're gonna go and we're gonna do it together we're gonna come together and I'm gonna fight for you and you're going to fight for me and we're going to lay aside the things that divide us and we're gonna win hallelujah we're gonna win that's what it's all about we're going to win foreign we're going to go to the enemy's camp his home field we're going to take back our joy we're going to take back our peace we're going to take back our worship we're going to take our rapture and there ain't nothing he can do about it we're going to take it all and we're going to go because I say we've come way too far to turn back we've been working and practicing in the fires of the Holy Ghost oh yeah we're gold that's been tried in the fire and we ain't worried about the heat of laodicea We Were Made for This we were predestined for this this is the moment we've been living for this is the moment we've been working for this is what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world this is what it's all about and somebody's going to rise to the occasion I ain't scared of the moment the moment ain't too big for me this is what this my was made for is this moment predestined not to fall that's who you are hope we could ever get that in our head hey look as a coach one of the biggest things I had to do was make them believe they were going to win make them believe they were the better team because when you believe you're the better team You'll Play like the better team and when you realize you're the one going to win you're the one going to Rapture you'll live like somebody that's gonna Rapture you'll live like an overcomer you'll live with the devil under your feet you'll live with a worship coming out of your life you will live like one who knows I'm gonna win and there's nothing he can do to stop me what's there to be depressed about what's there to be down about today the prison doors are open you're the winner walk out claim it take it and walk and live and talk in unity in Victory with the purpose laid before you that we've come too far to let pettiness and strife derail us moving on to Ephesians 4 1. it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation we're with you are called with all loneliness and meekness and long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body in one Spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all he identifies this Unity here as the unity of the spirit and he tells us that we're going to have to Endeavor to keep it Endeavor here means to be diligent to exert oneself to do your utmost which tells me it's going to be attacked there's going to be someone trying to take that Unity away from us he's going to come against it there's going to be occasion now here's the kind of fighting we got to do because think about it there's going to be occasion where you get done wrong and you want to lash out I'm sorry but that is not endeavoring to keep the unity that's the moment where you have to Endeavor but they did me wrong I know now you have to Endeavor keep the unity there's moments where you're going to want your side of the story told but you've got to Endeavor to keep the you the minute you start telling your side their sides Endeavor to keep the unity because somebody's going to do you wrong I promise people are going to do you wrong and he says here to Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace notice what Unity does it creates a bond of peace and a bond here talks about something that's not easily broken something that can't just be swept away or torn away or ripped apart not easily destroyed it's bonded together working together as a unit the root your word of unity one Lord One Faith one baptism if you go further down in the chapter it says then he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers that alone will preach but that's not where we're at tonight for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith now notice this back in Corinthians what did he do he tied Unity with maturity follow along in this and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children right back to that toss to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive a couple things here once again we already saw already pointed out there about the maturity and when we come to Unity it says then we henceforth be no more children in other words what's happened is we have matured enough that we can lay down what we think is best you're no longer a child it's about Unity but a child likes to fuss if he don't get his toy a child likes to kick and scream if he get a child don't like what you cook for supper they throw a little fit that's the actions of a child because they're worried about what they want but what he's saying here is you've matured to a point of unity to where you lay down your thinking you've matured enough to let go of your ideas and the way that you think it should be and our Focus isn't selfish anymore but now our focus is the faith the cause the reason the goal notice just like when in the book of Jude when he's telling you to contend here he he referenced it as the faith it's the unity of the faith so it's very specific what I'm preaching you tonight this isn't some economical message about hippie love and how we gotta you know be in unity with everybody and and be in unity with everybody and everything this is a very specific Unity it's a Unity among brethren in the faith Unity amongst those fighting the same fight and standing for the same faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen this isn't about agreeing with everyone it's about not fighting against those who are on your side there's plenty others and we shouldn't be fighting with anybody I'm just saying though there's plenty of people to disagree with and strive with and what why do it with the ones that's fighting with you why do it against the ones that's on your side and that's the unity we're talking about here we're not to be in unity with everyone and everything brother Brown tells us he says it's the same thing today separating separated found them they were not in unity they couldn't have no Unity cannot have Unity with day can a Believer have Unity within with an Infidel can a man who believes in all the word of God pay attention to this have Unity with them who just believes part of the word of God wants separators so when we're talking about Unity it's not Unity with everyone and everything it's Unity with the Brethren and the sisters of the faith those who are striving and fighting for the same thing we're not to sacrifice truth and standards for the sake of unity let that sink in we're not sacrificing truth we're not sacrificing standards for the sake of getting along that is an EC communical spirit brother Branham says and that's exactly the way old mother Jezebel has done the Protestant church has cropped in and now they're compromising on a few little doctrines they said they have so they can have Unity over the world and the first place the church got her locks bobbed off was at nicaea and she's going to Bob them again since she's been here that's her Secret is the word notice brother branham's talking about the word is our secret when he's doing he's tying this back into Samson and he's talking about how he was willing to give up his secret but in so doing his power was stripped away from him so tying this back in with the church and with Samson listen we're not giving up our secret this ain't about giving up on the word the the Lord went to great and Extreme Measures in this day to bring about the promise of restoration to make sure the word was completely restored and how dare us back off even a little for the sake of Fellowship I believe in fellowship and I believe in fellowship and even with those who don't see it exactly the way you do but that don't mean you back off your standards and back off the revealed word of the hour in order to do so we're not giving up our secret we're not giving up the word we're not backing off What the Lord Has Done in this day this isn't about that this is about letting go of personal opinions letting go of those little odd feelings that we have towards certain people putting our arms around our brother and repenting because of the hurt that we caused it's not easy and then giving forgiveness to those who have hurt us it's about being able to Fellowship even if we don't see eye to eye moving beyond wounds of the past staying the course why for the sake of the Gospel staying in unity for the sake of the moving of the spirit staying in unity so that God can have his way in our services listen we may be different we may have different ideas we may all come from different backgrounds but if we're holding the standard of the Gospel and if you're holding the standard of the new birth and we're both standing there fighting and striving for the Rapture then let's lay aside our differences and work together in unity for the common good for the common cause that God can move an evening light Tabernacle the way that he wants to move to where the breaks are off to where there's no spiritual fire extinguishers there's no little funny feeling come from a certain section going to another section listen you don't think it matters I was listening to brother Brown today and he says there's one person I don't know how big the crowd was he said but there's one person in here unbelieving he said I've discerned it and it's making it so very hard one person and it's making it so very he said brother won't you just help us he said you'd be better to support and quit hindering Unity matters Unity matters he says the Holy Ghost will follow God's word to the letter and a preacher behind the pulpit that ain't got Grace enough to preach it I doubt he's got it it's another one for another day he said that's just exactly well that's what the Holy Ghost is for is to give option to the preacher is to give Holiness to the group is to set the church in order is to bring a Unity of spirit is to unite us together with power is to unite us together with love brotherly love now I want to try to move quickly here as we're running out of time because what we know is brother Branham deals with this extensively and I'm going to skip some of the quotes but that the early church was United in spirit it was United in power and it was United in brotherly love and then what happened and we know this if you've read the church age book and the scriptures that the Palm or worm and then the locus and the canker worm and the caterpillar it began to destroy that early church and it began to Rob and steal from him the victory that the early church had and one of the things that they lost was Unity brother Branham says now the next great thing that come up was the Locust and he was the one who was to destroy the unity of the Believers in the Bible there were in Pentecost there was a unity and these people were with one heart and with one Accord and Paul said I believe in Romans the seventh chapter there was nothing could separate us from of the love of God that's in Christ Jesus there was nothing he said we've let the whole Palmer word come along with his stinger and break down Brotherhood break down Unity amongst us Paul said in the Bible that he wanted us to all speak the same thing he wanted us to be in unity that early church fought together they stood together they died together and because they had that Unity the power of God moved amongst them you see Time After Time God pouring his spirits out the gifts operating they was in a Brotherhood nothing he says nothing could separate them but then that Locus came and it began to take away the unity and then what happened was is a system of man with a forced Unity was put in its place and it wasn't a Unity of the spirit but it was a Unity led by man it was a man-made Unity you have to join this church or else you have to be baptized this way or else and what it did was it broke up the Brotherhood into different organizations and it broke up the unity and it was a spirit of denomination which separates and brother Branham says watch when it comes to The Showdown at the end time look at the weakness of it now 900 and something different organizations one pulling away and one the other there is no Unity among them and they're trying to bring Unity but here's the key not backed by the word of God God's original plan they are taking it in by politics and by organization and the devil brings a reason and he's like well surely if we're all you don't God want Unity don't God want us all together and surely if we're all together then then God's in it so maybe we should back off preaching some of those things so harshly maybe we should back off preaching some of those things that offend a little bit and maybe we should do it and just say it in a nicer way you know for the sake of unity and for the sake of Brotherhood that's true God does want Unity but he wants Unity under his word he wants Unity under the headship of his holy spirit he don't want worship to some denominational church he wants worship unto himself and we are united through the word and we are united by the word and you're United with everyone that stands for the fullness of that word that is where our Unity lies we are united today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we are united today that he still heals we are united today that he still fills with the Holy Ghost we are united today that this message is the truth there is unity in that unite underneath this glorious message if you have nothing else in common but this message it ought to be enough for us to unite under and fellowship under and live in unity under if that's all we have in common all right and that's what we've got to get our Focus back on tonight because the word was restored in this day to prepare a bride to take a rapture and the word called my name and the word called your name and because of that we should have unity in the faith listen we will never achieve Unity of opinion we will never achieve Unity of the thermostat in the sanctuary what happened we'll never achieve Unity of how it should sound we'll never achieve Unity of of who I think should be in charge and who should be running this and who should be running that and guess what that's okay we don't have to be in unity in that as long as we don't allow those things to become our focus and begin to worm its way in and tear us apart over things that do not matter what we have to be in unity is is our common goal we're going to win we're going to Rapture I'm going to be there in my Offspring with me I'm not leaving a hoof behind I'm not leaving a promise unclaimed I'm walking underneath this message and it's going to take me all the way and that's what we have to be United underneath it stay United in the faith stay United in the spirit that was part of the restoration of the broad tree that was part of it because that was part that had been stole and when he sends Malachi 4 brother Brandon actually says it here I believe I have the quote he makes this statement I won't read the whole thing he says if you believe that I've told you the truth and the truth is in the Bible that Jesus is the son of God and he sent me just his servant to help bring the Church of the Living God together in unity he sent Malachi 4 to bring a Unity to the church I wonder if he looked at the church right now if he would say oh I was successful in that I hope but are we letting too many things hinder to me things that don't matter too many things come in that would Rob away our unity and steal away listen I say let's fight for it I say let's contend for it make it a matter of importance that that devil is not going to come in and Rob this church of its Unity the first church had unity and the results speak for themselves I want First Church Unity with First Church results I want First Church Unity with licks of Fire coming down on each and every one of us I want First Church Unity with me being able to tell people Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have I give you in the name of Jesus rise up and walk I want First Church Unity where we can lay our hands on someone as they receive the Holy Ghost and the place will be shaken and the walls will be shaken I want that kind of unity and then that Unity comes power in the unity and what about the unity of expectations what about that what about the unity of expectation and we are closing but do you think that those amazing meetings that we just had this weekend just happened by accident do you think there's a re what is the reason that they're different from any other night by the way you've been a lovely audience so I'm not hitting you over the head with this you've been awesome I'm just talking what's different between that and a Wednesday night the unity of expectation because I would bet there's a I don't bet sorry um I would venture to say per Adventure I would venture to say that not many of you gave too much thought to today's service until today I don't know I'm not trying to pick on you I'm being I've been there how many of you prayed for Wednesday night service on Monday but guess what happens at meetings like this went on and even the meetings we'll have in October we'll start thinking about about three weeks ahead of time we'll take vacation time for it we'll set time aside we'll think about the Ministries and we'll pray for the ministry we'll pray for the services we'll have a special need on our heart and we'll think this is going I need this gun I'm coming expecting this and you want brother Brown even says there's a reason that the last night of the meeting has greater results is because people have greater expectation because they're in Greater desperation because they know it's their last chance [Applause] what if we came on on Wednesday night going this could be my last chance this could be my last opportunity this is where I gotta get it what if we came with that expectation how do I believe hell would Shake tonight I believe the heavens would open tonight I believe he would pour it out tonight just like you did all weekend because the people came expecting there was a Unity of expectation do we think it's just an accident that preachers come out during a meeting and preach the best Services ever no it's the unity of expectation pouring it out of them and it pulls them to that level and it goes to another place it's the round that we can walk in every service oh somebody didn't think so I say why not why not what hinders it's a day on a calendar Unity of expectation brings results they went about in the book of Acts expecting for miracles to happen expecting for God to show up expecting for the Holy Ghost to fall and they go to places like Ohio and Dry Creek and here in October expecting that let's start expecting it on Wednesday and on Sunday and come and go on God I'm here United my expectations are right I need you tonight I need you to touch my life I need a healing you heal on Wednesdays I need a Deliverance you deliver on Wednesdays I need you to pour it out in my family tonight and you pour it out on Wednesdays let the unity of expectations rise to the level that it pulls him out of the heavens right down into the midst of the congregation let it raise up in a Unity you can stay standing musicians you can come I'm a finish while you're standing it makes you feel better Satan knows the power of unity and he knows what hindering one person can do that's why he fights so hard in your life leading up to meetings fights you hard on Wednesdays Wednesdays be your worst work day ever some days why is it why I'm gonna talk to him why am I so tired on Sunday mornings Church down to 11. I'll be like is the Sun up well it's like it's 8 30. some days I'm tighter than any other day why because you're lazy no no I caught that thought enough because he's fighting because he's fighting brother Branham says I'm gonna skip ahead and let you read this here it is I didn't have to skip ahead there it was do you know where there's disunity the spirit of God is not welcome Lord have I been guilty of creating disunity Lord I don't want to hinder Lord I want to be in unity he says this and I'll let this be the last one there's more but I'm gonna let this be the last one let it settle in he says but however they must be in a spiritual attitude for God worships where there is unity and spirit God will come to us this morning and he'll spare the life of this little darling girl and the many of you here who are perhaps dying with cancer with other diseases if we can only get in spiritual Unity with his word and with him God will reveal himself he always does think about the weight of that God will heal this person heal all these people if wow we can get into a spiritual Unity with his word he will come and reveal himself he always does prophet of God said that we're to be the final voice to the final age which means it's not going to be the final voices there's going to be a Unity it's going to be one voice what is your voice crying out I say let's lend our voices to the resurrection let's lend our voice that he's a living God listen to our voice that he's the same yesterday today and forever let's lend our voice that he's the Lord God that heals all our diseases let's lend our voice that we're two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there let's lend our voice to Unity let's lend our voice to Harmony and not lend our voice to the accuser of the brethren because I believe that through the word we've seen that in unity there's power in unity God moves so whatever I have Lord me whatever I have that would hinder Unity whatever feelings I have Lord I want to lay those aside I don't want to have a personal agenda listen we're not in unity if even in like Tabernacle is spreading our own agenda we're not in unity with the rest of the broad body what is our agenda to lift up the name of Jesus to lift up that there has been a message in this last day and that message broke through the darkness and tore through the darkness and it found Seeds of Life and now we have a purpose we can unite under Lord let that light keep shining Lord let that light go out and find more seeds let that light go out and get my children let that light go out and get my family let that light go out and dermatize more and germatize more and germatize more and let me be in unity until that light strikes the last seed and then that morning in unity we'll take a body change and unity will be gathered together in unity will praise the King of Kings and the Lord of lords through all eternity I say let's be in unity now so that we can be United then father we love you with all of our hearts Lord we thank you for the word that's so plain and so clear Lord we ask that you'll take anything out of our life that would hinder the Lord your move that would hinder you dealing with lives dealing with hearts Healing The Sick Lord anything in our life that would Hinder Lord let our life speak of unity let our lives speak of brother to Brotherly Love let our life speak of mercy and Grace for all those around us let us lay aside our personal feelings and Lord let us be United with you Lord in a perfect harmony and perfect Unity Lord I Thank you for this wonderful church this wonderful congregation and the unity that you've allowed us to have here but Lord may we be guarded Lord may we Endeavor to keep that unity in the hearts and lives lord of the
